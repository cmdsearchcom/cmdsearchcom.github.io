<p>GFORTRAN(1) GNU GFORTRAN(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gfortran - GNU Fortran compiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gfortran [-c|-S|-E] <br>
[-g] [-pg] [-Olevel] <br>
[-Wwarn...] [-pedantic] <br>
[-Idir...] [-Ldir...] <br>
[-Dmacro[=defn]...] [-Umacro] <br>
[-foption...] <br>
[-mmachine-option...] <br>
[-o outfile] infile...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the most useful options are
listed here; see below for the remainder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The gfortran command supports all the options supported by
the gcc command. Only options specific to GNU Fortran are
documented here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All GCC and GNU Fortran options
are accepted both by gfortran and by gcc (as well as any
other drivers built at the same time, such as g++), since
adding GNU Fortran to the GCC <br>
distribution enables acceptance of GNU Fortran options by
all of the relevant drivers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some cases, options have
positive and negative forms; the negative form of -ffoo
would be -fno-foo. This manual documents only one of these
two forms, whichever one is not <br>
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Here is a summary of all the options specific to GNU
Fortran, grouped by type. Explanations are in the following

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options controlling Fortran
dialect <br>
The following options control the details of the Fortran
dialect accepted by the compiler:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffree-form <br>
-ffixed-form <br>
Specify the layout used by the source file. The free form
layout was introduced in Fortran 90. Fixed form was
traditionally used in older Fortran programs. When neither
<br>
option is specified, the source form is determined by the
file extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fall-intrinsics <br>
This option causes all intrinsic procedures (including the
GNU-specific extensions) to be accepted. This can be useful
with -std=f95 to force standard-compliance but get <br>
access to the full range of intrinsics available with
gfortran. As a consequence, -Wintrinsics-std will be ignored
and no user-defined procedure with the same name as any <br>
intrinsic will be called except when it is explicitly
declared &quot;EXTERNAL&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fd-lines-as-code <br>
-fd-lines-as-comments <br>
Enable special treatment for lines beginning with
&quot;d&quot; or &quot;D&quot; in fixed form sources. If the
-fd-lines-as-code option is given they are treated as if the
first column <br>
contained a blank. If the -fd-lines-as-comments option is
given, they are treated as comment lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdefault-double-8 <br>
Set the &quot;DOUBLE PRECISION&quot; type to an 8 byte wide
type. If -fdefault-real-8 is given, &quot;DOUBLE
PRECISION&quot; would instead be promoted to 16 bytes if
possible, and <br>
-fdefault-double-8 can be used to prevent this. The kind of
real constants like &quot;1.d0&quot; will not be changed by
-fdefault-real-8 though, so also -fdefault-double-8 does not
<br>
affect it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdefault-integer-8 <br>
Set the default integer and logical types to an 8 byte wide
type. Do nothing if this is already the default. This option
also affects the kind of integer constants like 42.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdefault-real-8 <br>
Set the default real type to an 8 byte wide type. Do nothing
if this is already the default. This option also affects the
kind of non-double real constants like 1.0, and <br>
does promote the default width of &quot;DOUBLE
PRECISION&quot; to 16 bytes if possible, unless
&quot;-fdefault-double-8&quot; is given, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdollar-ok <br>
Allow $ as a valid character in a symbol name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fbackslash <br>
Change the interpretation of backslashes in string literals
from a single backslash character to &quot;C-style&quot;
escape characters. The following combinations are expanded
&quot;&quot;,&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot; &quot;\&quot;, and
&quot; &quot; to the ASCII characters <br>
&quot;,, &quot;0, &quot; alert, backspace, form feed,
newline, carriage return, horizontal tab, vertical tab,
backslash, and <br>
NUL, respectively. Additionally, &quot;n, &quot;&quot;nnnn
and &quot;U&quot;nnnnnnnn (where each n is a hexadecimal
digit) are translated into the Unicode characters
corresponding to the <br>
specified code points. All other combinations of a character
preceded by &nbsp;are unexpanded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmodule-private <br>
Set the default accessibility of module entities to
&quot;PRIVATE&quot;. Use-associated entities will not be
accessible unless they are explicitly declared as
&quot;PUBLIC&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffixed-line-length-n <br>
Set column after which characters are ignored in typical
fixed-form lines in the source file, and through which
spaces are assumed (as if padded to that length) after the
<br>
ends of short fixed-form lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Popular values for n include 72
(the standard and the default), 80 (card image), and 132
(corresponding to &quot;extended-source&quot; options in
some popular compilers). n may also <br>
be none, meaning that the entire line is meaningful and that
continued character constants never have implicit spaces
appended to them to fill out the line. <br>
-ffixed-line-length-0 means the same thing as
-ffixed-line-length-none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffree-line-length-n <br>
Set column after which characters are ignored in typical
free-form lines in the source file. The default value is
132. n may be none, meaning that the entire line is <br>
meaningful. -ffree-line-length-0 means the same thing as
-ffree-line-length-none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmax-identifier-length=n <br>
Specify the maximum allowed identifier length. Typical
values are 31 (Fortran 95) and 63 (Fortran 2003 and Fortran
2008).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fimplicit-none <br>
Specify that no implicit typing is allowed, unless
overridden by explicit &quot;IMPLICIT&quot; statements. This
is the equivalent of adding &quot;implicit none&quot; to the
start of every <br>
procedure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcray-pointer <br>
Enable the Cray pointer extension, which provides C-like
pointer functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fopenmp <br>
Enable the OpenMP extensions. This includes OpenMP
&quot;!$omp&quot; directives in free form and
&quot;c$omp&quot;, *$omp and &quot;!$omp&quot; directives in
fixed form, &quot;!$&quot; conditional compilation <br>
sentinels in free form and &quot;c$&quot;, &quot;*$&quot;
and &quot;!$&quot; sentinels in fixed form, and when linking
arranges for the OpenMP runtime library to be linked in. The
option -fopenmp implies <br>
-frecursive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-range-check <br>
Disable range checking on results of simplification of
constant expressions during compilation. For example, GNU
Fortran will give an error at compile time when simplifying
<br>
&quot;a = 1. / 0&quot;. With this option, no error will be
given and &quot;a&quot; will be assigned the value
&quot;+Infinity&quot;. If an expression evaluates to a value
outside of the relevant range <br>
of [&quot;-HUGE()&quot;:&quot;HUGE()&quot;], then the
expression will be replaced by &quot;-Inf&quot; or
&quot;+Inf&quot; as appropriate. Similarly, &quot;DATA
i/Z&rsquo;FFFFFFFF&rsquo;/&quot; will result in an integer
overflow on most <br>
systems, but with -fno-range-check the value will &quot;wrap
around&quot; and &quot;i&quot; will be initialized to -1
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-std=std <br>
Specify the standard to which the program is expected to
conform, which may be one of f95, f2003, f2008, gnu, or
legacy. The default value for std is gnu, which specifies a
<br>
superset of the Fortran 95 standard that includes all of the
extensions supported by GNU Fortran, although warnings will
be given for obsolete extensions not recommended for <br>
use in new code. The legacy value is equivalent but without
the warnings for obsolete extensions, and may be useful for
old non-standard programs. The f95, f2003 and f2008 <br>
values specify strict conformance to the Fortran 95, Fortran
2003 and Fortran 2008 standards, respectively; errors are
given for all extensions beyond the relevant language <br>
standard, and warnings are given for the Fortran 77 features
that are permitted but obsolescent in later standards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enable and customize
preprocessing <br>
Preprocessor related options. See section Preprocessing and
conditional compilation for more detailed information on
preprocessing in gfortran.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cpp <br>
-nocpp <br>
Enable preprocessing. The preprocessor is automatically
invoked if the file extension is .fpp, .FPP, .F, .FOR, .FTN,
.F90, .F95, .F03 or .F08. Use this option to manually <br>
enable preprocessing of any kind of Fortran file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To disable preprocessing of
files with any of the above listed extensions, use the
negative form: -nocpp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The preprocessor is run in
traditional mode, be aware that any restrictions of the
file-format, e.g. fixed-form line width, apply for
preprocessed output as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dM Instead of the normal
output, generate a list of &rsquo;#define&rsquo; directives
for all the macros defined during the execution of the
preprocessor, including predefined macros. This <br>
gives you a way of finding out what is predefined in your
version of the preprocessor. Assuming you have no file
foo.f90, the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">touch foo.f90; gfortran -cpp -dM
foo.f90</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will show all the predefined
macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dD Like -dM except in two
respects: it does not include the predefined macros, and it
outputs both the &quot;#define&quot; directives and the
result of preprocessing. Both kinds of output <br>
go to the standard output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dN Like -dD, but emit only the
macro names, not their expansions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dU Like dD except that only
macros that are expanded, or whose definedness is tested in
preprocessor directives, are output; the output is delayed
until the use or test of the <br>
macro; and &rsquo;#undef&rsquo; directives are also output
for macros tested but undefined at the time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dI Output
&rsquo;#include&rsquo; directives in addition to the result
of preprocessing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fworking-directory <br>
Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output
that will let the compiler know the current working
directory at the time of preprocessing. When this option is
<br>
enabled, the preprocessor will emit, after the initial
linemarker, a second linemarker with the current working
directory followed by two slashes. GCC will use this <br>
directory, when it&rsquo;s present in the preprocessed
input, as the directory emitted as the current working
directory in some debugging information formats. This option
is <br>
implicitly enabled if debugging information is enabled, but
this can be inhibited with the negated form
-fno-working-directory. If the -P flag is present in the
command line, <br>
this option has no effect, since no &quot;#line&quot;
directives are emitted whatsoever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-idirafter dir <br>
Search dir for include files, but do it after all
directories specified with -I and the standard system
directories have been exhausted. dir is treated as a system
include <br>
directory. If dir begins with &quot;=&quot;, then the
&quot;=&quot; will be replaced by the sysroot prefix; see
--sysroot and -isysroot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-imultilib dir <br>
Use dir as a subdirectory of the directory containing
target-specific C++ headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iprefix prefix <br>
Specify prefix as the prefix for subsequent -iwithprefix
options. If the prefix represents a directory, you should
include the final &rsquo;/&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-isysroot dir <br>
This option is like the --sysroot option, but applies only
to header files. See the --sysroot option for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iquote dir <br>
Search dir only for header files requested with
&quot;#include &quot;file&quot;&quot;; they are not searched
for &quot;#include &lt;file&gt;&quot;, before all
directories specified by -I and before the standard <br>
system directories. If dir begins with &quot;=&quot;, then
the &quot;=&quot; will be replaced by the sysroot prefix;
see --sysroot and -isysroot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-isystem dir <br>
Search dir for header files, after all directories specified
by -I but before the standard system directories. Mark it as
a system directory, so that it gets the same special <br>
treatment as is applied to the standard system directories.
If dir begins with &quot;=&quot;, then the &quot;=&quot;
will be replaced by the sysroot prefix; see --sysroot and
-isysroot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nostdinc <br>
Do not search the standard system directories for header
files. Only the directories you have specified with -I
options (and the directory of the current file, if <br>
appropriate) are searched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-undef <br>
Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.
The standard predefined macros remain defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Apredicate=answer <br>
Make an assertion with the predicate predicate and answer
answer. This form is preferred to the older form -A
predicate(answer), which is still supported, because it does
<br>
not use shell special characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A-predicate=answer <br>
Cancel an assertion with the predicate predicate and answer
answer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Do not discard comments. All
comments are passed through to the output file, except for
comments in processed directives, which are deleted along
with the directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should be prepared for side
effects when using -C; it causes the preprocessor to treat
comments as tokens in their own right. For example, comments
appearing at the start <br>
of what would be a directive line have the effect of turning
that line into an ordinary source line, since the first
token on the line is no longer a &rsquo;#&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: this currently handles
C-Style comments only. The preprocessor does not yet
recognize Fortran-style comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-CC Do not discard comments,
including during macro expansion. This is like -C, except
that comments contained within macros are also passed
through to the output file where the <br>
macro is expanded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the side-effects
of the -C option, the -CC option causes all C++-style
comments inside a macro to be converted to C-style comments.
This is to prevent later <br>
use of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the
remainder of the source line. The -CC option is generally
used to support lint comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: this currently handles
C- and C++-Style comments only. The preprocessor does not
yet recognize Fortran-style comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dname <br>
Predefine name as a macro, with definition 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dname=definition <br>
The contents of definition are tokenized and processed as if
they appeared during translation phase three in a
&rsquo;#define&rsquo; directive. In particular, the
definition will be <br>
truncated by embedded newline characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are invoking the
preprocessor from a shell or shell-like program you may need
to use the shell&rsquo;s quoting syntax to protect
characters such as spaces that have a <br>
meaning in the shell syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish to define a
function-like macro on the command line, write its argument
list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign (if
any). Parentheses are <br>
meaningful to most shells, so you will need to quote the
option. With sh and csh,
&quot;-D&rsquo;name(args...)=definition&rsquo;&quot;
works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D and -U options are processed
in the order they are given on the command line. All
-imacros file and -include file options are processed after
all -D and -U options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Print the name of each header
file used, in addition to other normal activities. Each name
is indented to show how deep in the &rsquo;#include&rsquo;
stack it is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Inhibit generation of
linemarkers in the output from the preprocessor. This might
be useful when running the preprocessor on something that is
not C code, and will be sent <br>
to a program which might be confused by the linemarkers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Uname <br>
Cancel any previous definition of name, either built in or
provided with a -D option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options to request or suppress
errors and warnings <br>
Errors are diagnostic messages that report that the GNU
Fortran compiler cannot compile the relevant piece of source
code. The compiler will continue to process the program in
<br>
an attempt to report further errors to aid in debugging, but
will not produce any compiled output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warnings are diagnostic messages
that report constructions which are not inherently erroneous
but which are risky or suggest there is likely to be a bug
in the program. Unless <br>
-Werror is specified, they do not prevent compilation of the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can request many specific
warnings with options beginning -W, for example -Wimplicit
to request warnings on implicit declarations. Each of these
specific warning options <br>
also has a negative form beginning -Wno- to turn off
warnings; for example, -Wno-implicit. This manual lists only
one of the two forms, whichever is not the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options control the amount
and kinds of errors and warnings produced by GNU
Fortran:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmax-errors=n <br>
Limits the maximum number of error messages to n, at which
point GNU Fortran bails out rather than attempting to
continue processing the source code. If n is 0, there is no
<br>
limit on the number of error messages produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsyntax-only <br>
Check the code for syntax errors, but don&rsquo;t actually
compile it. This will generate module files for each module
present in the code, but no other output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pedantic <br>
Issue warnings for uses of extensions to Fortran 95.
-pedantic also applies to C-language constructs where they
occur in GNU Fortran source files, such as use of \ in a
<br>
character constant within a directive like
&quot;#include&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Valid Fortran 95 programs should
compile properly with or without this option. However,
without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional
Fortran features are <br>
supported as well. With this option, many of them are
rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some users try to use -pedantic
to check programs for conformance. They soon find that it
does not do quite what they want---it finds some nonstandard
practices, but not <br>
all. However, improvements to GNU Fortran in this area are
welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This should be used in
conjunction with -std=f95, -std=f2003 or -std=f2008.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pedantic-errors <br>
Like -pedantic, except that errors are produced rather than
warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wall <br>
Enables commonly used warning options pertaining to usage
that we recommend avoiding and that we believe are easy to
avoid. This currently includes -Waliasing, -Wampersand, <br>
-Wsurprising, -Wintrinsics-std, -Wno-tabs,
-Wintrinsic-shadow and -Wline-truncation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Waliasing <br>
Warn about possible aliasing of dummy arguments.
Specifically, it warns if the same actual argument is
associated with a dummy argument with &quot;INTENT(IN)&quot;
and a dummy argument <br>
with &quot;INTENT(OUT)&quot; in a call with an explicit
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example will
trigger the warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interface <br>
subroutine bar(a,b) <br>
integer, intent(in) :: a <br>
integer, intent(out) :: b <br>
end subroutine <br>
end interface <br>
integer :: a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">call bar(a,a)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wampersand <br>
Warn about missing ampersand in continued character
constants. The warning is given with -Wampersand, -pedantic,
-std=f95, -std=f2003 and -std=f2008. Note: With no ampersand
<br>
given in a continued character constant, GNU Fortran assumes
continuation at the first non-comment, non-whitespace
character after the ampersand that initiated the <br>
continuation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Warray-temporaries <br>
Warn about array temporaries generated by the compiler. The
information generated by this warning is sometimes useful in
optimization, in order to avoid such temporaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wcharacter-truncation <br>
Warn when a character assignment will truncate the assigned
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wline-truncation <br>
Warn when a source code line will be truncated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wconversion <br>
Warn about implicit conversions between different types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wimplicit-interface <br>
Warn if a procedure is called without an explicit interface.
Note this only checks that an explicit interface is present.
It does not check that the declared interfaces are <br>
consistent across program units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wintrinsics-std <br>
Warn if gfortran finds a procedure named like an intrinsic
not available in the currently selected standard (with -std)
and treats it as &quot;EXTERNAL&quot; procedure because of
this. <br>
-fall-intrinsics can be used to never trigger this behaviour
and always link to the intrinsic regardless of the selected
standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsurprising <br>
Produce a warning when &quot;suspicious&quot; code
constructs are encountered. While technically legal these
usually indicate that an error has been made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This currently produces a
warning under the following circumstances:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; An INTEGER
SELECT construct has a CASE that can never be matched as its
lower value is greater than its upper value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A LOGICAL SELECT
construct has three CASE statements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A TRANSFER
specifies a source that is shorter than the destination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The type of a
function result is declared more than once with the same
type. If -pedantic or standard-conforming mode is enabled,
this is an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wtabs <br>
By default, tabs are accepted as whitespace, but tabs are
not members of the Fortran Character Set. For continuation
lines, a tab followed by a digit between 1 and 9 is <br>
supported. -Wno-tabs will cause a warning to be issued if a
tab is encountered. Note, -Wno-tabs is active for -pedantic,
-std=f95, -std=f2003, -std=f2008 and -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunderflow <br>
Produce a warning when numerical constant expressions are
encountered, which yield an UNDERFLOW during
compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wintrinsic-shadow <br>
Warn if a user-defined procedure or module procedure has the
same name as an intrinsic; in this case, an explicit
interface or &quot;EXTERNAL&quot; or &quot;INTRINSIC&quot;
declaration might be <br>
needed to get calls later resolved to the desired
intrinsic/procedure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused-parameter <br>
Contrary to gcc&rsquo;s meaning of -Wunused-parameter,
gfortran&rsquo;s implementation of this option does not warn
about unused dummy arguments, but about unused
&quot;PARAMETER&quot; values. <br>
-Wunused-parameter is not included in -Wall but is implied
by -Wall -Wextra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Walign-commons <br>
By default, gfortran warns about any occasion of variables
being padded for proper alignment inside a COMMON block.
This warning can be turned off via -Wno-align-commons. See
<br>
also -falign-commons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Werror <br>
Turns all warnings into errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of these have no effect
when compiling programs written in Fortran.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for debugging your
program or GNU Fortran <br>
GNU Fortran has various special options that are used for
debugging either your program or the GNU Fortran
compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdump-parse-tree <br>
Output the internal parse tree before starting code
generation. Only really useful for debugging the GNU Fortran
compiler itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffpe-trap=list <br>
Specify a list of IEEE exceptions when a Floating Point
Exception (FPE) should be raised. On most systems, this will
result in a SIGFPE signal being sent and the program <br>
being interrupted, producing a core file useful for
debugging. list is a (possibly empty) comma-separated list
of the following IEEE exceptions: invalid (invalid floating
<br>
point operation, such as &quot;SQRT(-1.0)&quot;), zero
(division by zero), overflow (overflow in a floating point
operation), underflow (underflow in a floating point
operation), <br>
precision (loss of precision during operation) and denormal
(operation produced a denormal value).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of the routines in the
Fortran runtime library, like CPU_TIME, are likely to
trigger floating point exceptions when
&quot;ffpe-trap=precision&quot; is used. For this reason,
the <br>
use of &quot;ffpe-trap=precision&quot; is not
recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fbacktrace <br>
Specify that, when a runtime error is encountered or a
deadly signal is emitted (segmentation fault, illegal
instruction, bus error or floating-point exception), the
Fortran <br>
runtime library should output a backtrace of the error. This
option only has influence for compilation of the Fortran
main program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdump-core <br>
Request that a core-dump file is written to disk when a
runtime error is encountered on systems that support core
dumps. This option is only effective for the compilation of
<br>
the Fortran main program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for directory search
<br>
These options affect how GNU Fortran searches for files
specified by the &quot;INCLUDE&quot; directive and where it
searches for previously compiled modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It also affects the search paths
used by cpp when used to preprocess Fortran source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Idir <br>
These affect interpretation of the &quot;INCLUDE&quot;
directive (as well as of the &quot;#include&quot; directive
of the cpp preprocessor).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also note that the general
behavior of -I and &quot;INCLUDE&quot; is pretty much the
same as of -I with &quot;#include&quot; in the cpp
preprocessor, with regard to looking for header.gcc files
<br>
and other such things.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This path is also used to search
for .mod files when previously compiled modules are required
by a &quot;USE&quot; statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Jdir <br>
This option specifies where to put .mod files for compiled
modules. It is also added to the list of directories to
searched by an &quot;USE&quot; statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is the current
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fintrinsic-modules-path dir
<br>
This option specifies the location of pre-compiled intrinsic
modules, if they are not in the default location expected by
the compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Influencing the linking step
<br>
These options come into play when the compiler links object
files into an executable output file. They are meaningless
if the compiler is not doing a link step.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-static-libgfortran <br>
On systems that provide libgfortran as a shared and a static
library, this option forces the use of the static version.
If no shared version of libgfortran was built when the <br>
compiler was configured, this option has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Influencing runtime behavior
<br>
These options affect the runtime behavior of programs
compiled with GNU Fortran.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fconvert=conversion <br>
Specify the representation of data for unformatted files.
Valid values for conversion are: native, the default; swap,
swap between big- and little-endian; big-endian, use <br>
big-endian representation for unformatted files;
little-endian, use little-endian representation for
unformatted files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option has an effect only
when used in the main program. The &quot;CONVERT&quot;
specifier and the GFORTRAN_CONVERT_UNIT environment variable
override the default specified by <br>
-fconvert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-range-check <br>
Disable range checking of input values during integer
&quot;READ&quot; operations. For example, GNU Fortran will
give an error if an input value is outside of the relevant
range of <br>
[&quot;-HUGE()&quot;:&quot;HUGE()&quot;]. In other words,
with &quot;INTEGER (kind=4) :: i&quot; , attempting to read
-2147483648 will give an error unless -fno-range-check is
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-frecord-marker=length <br>
Specify the length of record markers for unformatted files.
Valid values for length are 4 and 8. Default is 4. This is
different from previous versions of gfortran, which <br>
specified a default record marker length of 8 on most
systems. If you want to read or write files compatible with
earlier versions of gfortran, use -frecord-marker=8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmax-subrecord-length=length
<br>
Specify the maximum length for a subrecord. The maximum
permitted value for length is 2147483639, which is also the
default. Only really useful for use by the gfortran <br>
testsuite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsign-zero <br>
When writing zero values, show the negative sign if the sign
bit is set. &quot;fno-sign-zero&quot; does not print the
negative sign of zero values for compatibility with F77.
Default <br>
behavior is to show the negative sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for code generation
conventions <br>
These machine-independent options control the interface
conventions used in code generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of them have both positive
and negative forms; the negative form of -ffoo would be
-fno-foo. In the table below, only one of the forms is
listed---the one which is not the <br>
default. You can figure out the other form by either
removing no- or adding it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-automatic <br>
Treat each program unit (except those marked as RECURSIVE)
as if the &quot;SAVE&quot; statement were specified for
every local variable and array referenced in it. Does not
affect <br>
common blocks. (Some Fortran compilers provide this option
under the name -static or -save.) The default, which is
-fautomatic, uses the stack for local variables smaller <br>
than the value given by -fmax-stack-var-size. Use the option
-frecursive to use no static memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ff2c <br>
Generate code designed to be compatible with code generated
by g77 and f2c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The calling conventions used by
g77 (originally implemented in f2c) require functions that
return type default &quot;REAL&quot; to actually return the
C type &quot;double&quot;, and functions <br>
that return type &quot;COMPLEX&quot; to return the values
via an extra argument in the calling sequence that points to
where to store the return value. Under the default GNU
calling <br>
conventions, such functions simply return their results as
they would in GNU C---default &quot;REAL&quot; functions
return the C type &quot;float&quot;, and &quot;COMPLEX&quot;
functions return the GNU C <br>
type &quot;complex&quot;. Additionally, this option implies
the -fsecond-underscore option, unless
-fno-second-underscore is explicitly requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This does not affect the
generation of code that interfaces with the libgfortran
library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution: It is not a good idea
to mix Fortran code compiled with -ff2c with code compiled
with the default -fno-f2c calling conventions as, calling
&quot;COMPLEX&quot; or default <br>
&quot;REAL&quot; functions between program parts which were
compiled with different calling conventions will break at
execution time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution: This will break code
which passes intrinsic functions of type default
&quot;REAL&quot; or &quot;COMPLEX&quot; as actual arguments,
as the library implementations use the -fno-f2c <br>
calling conventions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-underscoring <br>
Do not transform names of entities specified in the Fortran
source file by appending underscores to them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -funderscoring in effect,
GNU Fortran appends one underscore to external names with no
underscores. This is done to ensure compatibility with code
produced by many UNIX <br>
Fortran compilers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution: The default behavior of
GNU Fortran is incompatible with f2c and g77, please use the
-ff2c option if you want object files compiled with GNU
Fortran to be compatible <br>
with object code created with these tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of -fno-underscoring is not
recommended unless you are experimenting with issues such as
integration of GNU Fortran into existing system environments
(vis-@&lsquo;{a}-vis <br>
existing libraries, tools, and so on).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, with
-funderscoring, and assuming other defaults like
-fcase-lower and that &quot;j()&quot; and
&quot;max_count()&quot; are external functions while
&quot;my_var&quot; and &quot;lvar&quot; are local <br>
variables, a statement like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I = J() + MAX_COUNT (MY_VAR,
LVAR)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is implemented as something akin
to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i = j_() +
max_count__(&amp;my_var__, &amp;lvar);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -fno-underscoring, the same
statement is implemented as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i = j() + max_count(&amp;my_var,
&amp;lvar);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of -fno-underscoring allows
direct specification of user-defined names while debugging
and when interfacing GNU Fortran code with other
languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that just because the names
match does not mean that the interface implemented by GNU
Fortran for an external name matches the interface
implemented by some other <br>
language for that same name. That is, getting code produced
by GNU Fortran to link to code produced by some other
compiler using this or any other method can be only a small
<br>
part of the overall solution---getting the code generated by
both compilers to agree on issues other than naming can
require significant effort, and, unlike naming <br>
disagreements, linkers normally cannot detect disagreements
in these other areas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, note that with
-fno-underscoring, the lack of appended underscores
introduces the very real possibility that a user-defined
external name will conflict with a name in a <br>
system library, which could make finding
unresolved-reference bugs quite difficult in some
cases---they might occur at program run time, and show up
only as buggy behavior at <br>
run time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In future versions of GNU
Fortran we hope to improve naming and linking issues so that
debugging always involves using the names as they appear in
the source, even if the <br>
names as seen by the linker are mangled to prevent
accidental linking between procedures with incompatible
interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsecond-underscore <br>
By default, GNU Fortran appends an underscore to external
names. If this option is used GNU Fortran appends two
underscores to names with underscores and one underscore to
<br>
external names with no underscores. GNU Fortran also appends
two underscores to internal names with underscores to avoid
naming collisions with external names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option has no effect if
-fno-underscoring is in effect. It is implied by the -ff2c
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, with this option, an
external name such as &quot;MAX_COUNT&quot; is implemented
as a reference to the link-time external symbol
&quot;max_count__&quot;, instead of &quot;max_count_&quot;.
This <br>
is required for compatibility with g77 and f2c, and is
implied by use of the -ff2c option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fbounds-check <br>
Enable generation of run-time checks for array subscripts
and against the declared minimum and maximum values. It also
checks array indices for assumed and deferred shape <br>
arrays against the actual allocated bounds and ensures that
all string lengths are equal for character array
constructors without an explicit typespec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some checks require that
-fbounds-check is set for the compilation of the main
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: In the future this may
also include other forms of checking, e.g., checking
substring references.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fcheck-array-temporaries <br>
Warns at run time when for passing an actual argument a
temporary array had to be generated. The information
generated by this warning is sometimes useful in
optimization, in <br>
order to avoid such temporaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The warning is only
printed once per location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmax-array-constructor=n <br>
This option can be used to increase the upper limit
permitted in array constructors. The code below requires
this option to expand the array at compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C&lt;program test&gt; <br>
C&lt;implicit none&gt; <br>
C&lt;integer j&gt; <br>
C&lt;integer, parameter :: n = 100000&gt; <br>
C&lt;integer, parameter :: i(n) = (/ (2*j, j = 1, n) /)&gt;
<br>
C&lt;print &rsquo;(10(I0,1X))&rsquo;, i&gt; <br>
C&lt;end program test&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution: This option can lead to
long compile times and excessively large object files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value for n is
65535.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmax-stack-var-size=n <br>
This option specifies the size in bytes of the largest array
that will be put on the stack; if the size is exceeded
static memory is used (except in procedures marked as <br>
RECURSIVE). Use the option -frecursive to allow for
recursive procedures which do not have a RECURSIVE attribute
or for parallel programs. Use -fno-automatic to never use
the <br>
stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option currently only
affects local arrays declared with constant bounds, and may
not apply to all character variables. Future versions of GNU
Fortran may improve this <br>
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value for n is
32768.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpack-derived <br>
This option tells GNU Fortran to pack derived type members
as closely as possible. Code compiled with this option is
likely to be incompatible with code compiled without <br>
this option, and may execute slower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-frepack-arrays <br>
In some circumstances GNU Fortran may pass assumed shape
array sections via a descriptor describing a noncontiguous
area of memory. This option adds code to the function <br>
prologue to repack the data into a contiguous block at
runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This should result in faster
accesses to the array. However it can introduce significant
overhead to the function call, especially when the passed
data is noncontiguous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fshort-enums <br>
This option is provided for interoperability with C code
that was compiled with the -fshort-enums option. It will
make GNU Fortran choose the smallest &quot;INTEGER&quot;
kind a given <br>
enumerator set will fit in, and give all its enumerators
this kind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fexternal-blas <br>
This option will make gfortran generate calls to BLAS
functions for some matrix operations like
&quot;MATMUL&quot;, instead of using our own algorithms, if
the size of the matrices <br>
involved is larger than a given limit (see
-fblas-matmul-limit). This may be profitable if an optimized
vendor BLAS library is available. The BLAS library will have
to be <br>
specified at link time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fblas-matmul-limit=n <br>
Only significant when -fexternal-blas is in effect. Matrix
multiplication of matrices with size larger than (or equal
to) n will be performed by calls to BLAS functions, <br>
while others will be handled by gfortran internal
algorithms. If the matrices involved are not square, the
size comparison is performed using the geometric mean of the
<br>
dimensions of the argument and result matrices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value for n is
30.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-frecursive <br>
Allow indirect recursion by forcing all local arrays to be
allocated on the stack. This flag cannot be used together
with -fmax-stack-var-size= or -fno-automatic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-finit-local-zero <br>
-finit-integer=n <br>
-finit-real=&lt;zero|inf|-inf|nan&gt; <br>
-finit-logical=&lt;true|false&gt; <br>
-finit-character=n <br>
The -finit-local-zero option instructs the compiler to
initialize local &quot;INTEGER&quot;, &quot;REAL&quot;, and
&quot;COMPLEX&quot; variables to zero, &quot;LOGICAL&quot;
variables to false, and &quot;CHARACTER&quot; <br>
variables to a string of null bytes. Finer-grained
initialization options are provided by the -finit-integer=n,
-finit-real=&lt;zero|inf|-inf|nan&gt; (which also
initializes the <br>
real and imaginary parts of local &quot;COMPLEX&quot;
variables), -finit-logical=&lt;true|false&gt;, and
-finit-character=n (where n is an ASCII character value)
options. These options do <br>
not initialize components of derived type variables, nor do
they initialize variables that appear in an
&quot;EQUIVALENCE&quot; statement. (This limitation may be
removed in future <br>
releases).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the -finit-real=nan
option initializes &quot;REAL&quot; and &quot;COMPLEX&quot;
variables with a quiet NaN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-falign-commons <br>
By default, gfortran enforces proper alignment of all
variables in a COMMON block by padding them as needed. On
certain platforms this is mandatory, on others it increases
<br>
performance. If a COMMON block is not declared with
consistent data types everywhere, this padding can cause
trouble, and -fno-align-commons can be used to disable
automatic <br>
alignment. The same form of this option should be used for
all files that share a COMMON block. To avoid potential
alignment issues in COMMON blocks, it is recommended to <br>
order objects from largests to smallest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The gfortran compiler currently does not make use of any
environment variables to control its operation above and
beyond those that affect the operation of gcc.</p>
