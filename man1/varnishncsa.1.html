<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
varnishncsa - Display Varnish logs in Apache / NCSA combined
log format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
varnishncsa [-a] [-b] [-c] [-C] [-d] [-D] [-F
&lt;format&gt;] [-f &lt;formatfile&gt;] [-g
&lt;request|vxid&gt;] [-h] [-L &lt;limit&gt;] [-n
&lt;dir&gt;] [-N &lt;filename&gt;] [-P &lt;file&gt;] [-q
&lt;query&gt;] [-r &lt;file&acirc; <br>
name&gt;] [-t &lt;seconds|off&gt;] [-V] [-w
&lt;filename&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The varnishncsa utility reads varnishd(1) shared memory logs
and presents them in the Apache / NCSA &quot;combined&quot;
log format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each log line produced is based
on a single Request type transaction gathered from the
shared memory log. The Request transaction is then scanned
for the relevant parts in order <br>
to output one log line. To filter the log lines produced,
use the query language to select the applicable
transactions. Non-request transactions are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a When writing output to a
file, append to it rather than overwrite it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Log backend requests. If -c
is not specified, then only backend requests will trigger
log lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Log client requests. This is
the default. If -b is specified, then -c is needed to also
log client requests</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Do all regular expression and
string matching caseless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Process log records at the
head of the log and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Daemonize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F &lt;format&gt; <br>
Set the output log format string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f &lt;formatfile&gt; <br>
Read output format from a file. Will read a single line from
the specified file, and use that line as the format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g &lt;request|vxid&gt; <br>
The grouping of the log records. The default is to group by
vxid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print program usage and
exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L &lt;limit&gt; <br>
Sets the upper limit of incomplete transactions kept before
the oldest transaction is force completed. A warning record
is synthesized when this happens. This setting <br>
keeps an upper bound on the memory usage of running queries.
Defaults to 1000 transactions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n &lt;dir&gt; <br>
Specify the varnishd working directory (also known as
instance name) to get logs from. If -n is not specified, the
host name is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N &lt;filename&gt; <br>
Specify the filename of a stale VSM instance. When using
this option the abandonment checking is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P &lt;file&gt; <br>
Write the process&rsquo; PID to the specified file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q &lt;query&gt; <br>
Specifies the VSL query to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r &lt;filename&gt; <br>
Read log in binary file format from this file. The file can
be created with varnishlog -w filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t &lt;seconds|off&gt; <br>
Timeout before returning error on initial VSM connection. If
set the VSM connection is retried every 0.5 seconds for this
many seconds. If zero the connection is attempted <br>
only once and will fail immediately if unsuccessful. If set
to &quot;off&quot;, the connection will not fail, allowing
the utility to start and wait indefinetely for the Varnish
<br>
instance to appear. Defaults to 5 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print version information and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w &lt;filename&gt; <br>
Redirect output to file. The file will be overwritten unless
the -a option was specified. If the application receives a
SIGHUP in daemon mode the file will be reopened <br>
allowing the old one to be rotated away. This option is
required when running in daemon mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODES <br>
The default mode of varnishncsa is &quot;client mode&quot;.
In this mode, the log will be similar to what a web server
would produce in the absence of varnish. Client mode can be
explic&acirc; <br>
itly selected by using -c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -b switch is specified,
varnishncsa will operate in &quot;backend mode&quot;. In
this mode, requests generated by varnish to the backends
will be logged. Unless -c is also speci&acirc; <br>
fied, client requests received by varnish will be
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running varnishncsa in both
backend and client mode, it is strongly advised to include
the format specifier %{Varnish:side}x to distinguish between
backend and client <br>
requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Client requests that results in
a pipe (ie. return(pipe) in vcl), will not generate logging
in backend mode. This is because varnish is not generating
requests, but blindly <br>
passes on bytes in both directions. However, a varnishncsa
instance running in normal mode can see this case by using
the formatter %{Varnish:handling}x, which will be
&rsquo;pipe&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In backend mode, some of the
fields in the format string get different meanings. Most
notably, the byte counting formatters (%b, %I, %O) considers
varnish to be the client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to keep two
varnishncsa instances running, one in backend mode, and one
in client mode, logging to different files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FORMAT <br>
Specify the log format to use. If no format is specified the
default log format is used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%h %l %u %t &quot;%r&quot; %s %b
&quot;%{Referer}i&quot; &quot;%{User-agent}i&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Escape sequences and are
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported formatters are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%b In client mode, size of
response in bytes, excluding HTTP headers. In backend mode,
the number of bytes received from the backend, excluding
HTTP headers. In CLF format, <br>
i.e. a &rsquo;-&rsquo; rather than a 0 when no bytes are
sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%D In client mode, time taken to
serve the request, in microseconds. In backend mode, time
from the request was sent to the entire body had been
received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%H The request protocol.
Defaults to HTTP/1.0 if not known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%h Remote host. Defaults to
&rsquo;-&rsquo; if not known. In backend mode this is the IP
of the backend server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%I In client mode, total bytes
received from client. In backend mode, total bytes sent to
the backend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%{X}i The contents of request
header X. If the header appears multiple times in a single
transaction, the last occurrence is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%l Remote logname. Always
&rsquo;-&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%m Request method. Defaults to
&rsquo;-&rsquo; if not known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%{X}o The contents of response
header X. If the header appears multiple times in a single
transaction, the last occurrence is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%O In client mode, total bytes
sent to client. In backend mode, total bytes received from
the backend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%q The query string. Defaults to
an empty string if not present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%r The first line of the
request. Synthesized from other fields, so it may not be the
request verbatim. See the NOTES section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s Status sent to the client. In
backend mode, status received from the backend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%t In client mode, time when the
request was received, in HTTP date/time format. In backend
mode, time when the request was sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%{X}t In client mode, time when
the request was received, in the format specified by X. In
backend mode, time when the request was sent. The time
specification format is the <br>
same as for strftime(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%T In client mode, time taken to
serve the request, in seconds. In backend mode, time from
the request was sent to the entire body had been
received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%U The request URL without the
query string. Defaults to &rsquo;-&rsquo; if not known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%u Remote user from auth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%{X}x Extended variables.
Supported variables are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Varnish:time_firstbyte <br>
Time from when the request processing starts until the first
byte is sent to the client. For backend mode: Time from the
request was sent to the backend to the <br>
entire header had been received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Varnish:hitmiss <br>
One of the &rsquo;hit&rsquo; or &rsquo;miss&rsquo; strings,
depending on whether the request was a cache hit or miss.
Pipe, pass and synth are considered misses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Varnish:handling <br>
One of the &rsquo;hit&rsquo;, &rsquo;miss&rsquo;,
&rsquo;pass&rsquo;, &rsquo;pipe&rsquo; or
&rsquo;synth&rsquo; strings indicating how the request was
handled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Varnish:side <br>
Backend or client side. One of two values, &rsquo;b&rsquo;
or &rsquo;c&rsquo;, depending on where the request was made.
In pure backend or client mode, this field will be
constant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Varnish:vxid <br>
The VXID of the varnish transaction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VCL_Log:key <br>
The value set by std.log(&quot;key:value&quot;) in VCL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VSL:tag[field] <br>
The value of the VSL entry for the given tag. The field
will, if present, treat the log record as a white space
separated list of fields, and only the nth part of <br>
the record will be matched against. Fields start counting at
1. Defaults to &rsquo;-&rsquo; when the tag is not seen, or
when the field is out of bounds. If a tag appears mul&acirc;
<br>
tiple times in a single transaction, the first occurrence is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
SIGHUP Rotate the log file (see -w option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 <br>
Flush any outstanding transactions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The %r formatter is equivalent to &quot;%m
http://%{Host}i%U%q %H&quot;. This differs from
apache&rsquo;s %r behavior, equivalent to &quot;%m %U%q
%H&quot;. Furthermore, when using the %r formatter, if <br>
the Host header appears multiple times in a single
transaction, the first occurrence is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Log the second field of the Begin tag, corresponding to the
VXID of the parent transaction:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">varnishncsa -F
&quot;%{VSL:Begin[2]}x&quot;</p>
