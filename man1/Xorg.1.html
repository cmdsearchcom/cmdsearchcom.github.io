<p>Xorg(1) General Commands Manual Xorg(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Xorg - X11R7 X server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Xorg [:display] [option ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Xorg is a full featured X server that was originally
designed for UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems running on
Intel x86 hardware. It now runs on a wider range of hardware
<br>
and OS platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This work was derived by the
X.Org Foundation from the XFree86 Project&rsquo;s XFree86
4.4rc2 release. The XFree86 release was originally derived
from X386 1.2 by Thomas Roell which <br>
was contributed to X11R5 by Snitily Graphics Consulting
Service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLATFORMS <br>
Xorg operates under a wide range of operating systems and
hardware platforms. The Intel x86 (IA32) architecture is the
most widely supported hardware platform. Other hardware <br>
platforms include Compaq Alpha, Intel IA64, AMD64, SPARC and
PowerPC. The most widely supported operating systems are the
free/OpenSource UNIX-like systems such as Linux, Free&acirc;
<br>
BSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Solaris. Commercial UNIX operating
systems such as UnixWare are also supported. Other supported
operating systems include GNU Hurd. Mac OS X is sup&acirc;
<br>
ported with the Xquartz(1) X server. Win32/Cygwin is
supported with the XWin(1) X server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NETWORK CONNECTIONS <br>
Xorg supports connections made using the following reliable
byte-streams:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Local <br>
On most platforms, the &quot;Local&quot; connection type is
a UNIX-domain socket. On some System V platforms, the
&quot;local&quot; connection types also include STREAMS
pipes, named pipes, and <br>
some other mechanisms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCPIP <br>
Xorg listens on port 6000+n, where n is the display number.
This connection type can be disabled with the -nolisten
option (see the Xserver(1) man page for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
For operating systems that support local connections other
than Unix Domain sockets (SVR3 and SVR4), there is a
compiled-in list specifying the order in which local
connections <br>
should be attempted. This list can be overridden by the
XLOCAL environment variable described below. If the display
name indicates a best-choice connection should be made (e.g.
<br>
:0.0), each connection mechanism is tried until a connection
succeeds or no more mechanisms are available. Note: for
these OSs, the Unix Domain socket connection is treated
dif&acirc; <br>
ferently from the other local connection types. To use it
the connection must be made to unix:0.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The XLOCAL environment variable
should contain a list of one more more of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAMED <br>
PTS <br>
SCO <br>
ISC</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which represent SVR4 Named
Streams pipe, Old-style USL Streams pipe, SCO XSight Streams
pipe, and ISC Streams pipe, respectively. You can select a
single mechanism (e.g. XLO&acirc; <br>
CAL=NAMED), or an ordered list (e.g.
XLOCAL=&quot;NAMED:PTS:SCO&quot;). his variable overrides
the compiled-in defaults. For SVR4 it is recommended that
NAMED be the first preference <br>
connection. The default setting is PTS:NAMED:ISC:SCO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To globally override the
compiled-in defaults, you should define (and export if using
sh or ksh) XLOCAL globally. If you use startx(1) or
xinit(1), the definition should be at <br>
the top of your .xinitrc file. If you use xdm(1), the
definitions should be early on in the
/usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Xorg supports several mechanisms for supplying/obtaining
configuration and run-time parameters: command line options,
environment variables, the xorg.conf(5) configuration files,
<br>
auto-detection, and fallback defaults. When the same
information is supplied in more than one way, the highest
precedence mechanism is used. The list of mechanisms is
ordered <br>
from highest precedence to lowest. Note that not all
parameters can be supplied via all methods. The available
command line options and environment variables (and some
<br>
defaults) are described here and in the Xserver(1) manual
page. Most configuration file parameters, with their
defaults, are described in the xorg.conf(5) manual page.
Driver <br>
and module specific configuration parameters are described
in the relevant driver or module manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the normal server
options described in the Xserver(1) manual page, Xorg
accepts the following command line switches:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vtXX XX specifies the Virtual
Terminal device number which Xorg will use. Without this
option, Xorg will pick the first available Virtual Terminal
that it can locate. This <br>
option applies only to platforms that have virtual terminal
support, such as Linux, BSD, OpenSolaris, SVR3, and
SVR4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-allowMouseOpenFail <br>
Allow the server to start up even if the mouse device
can&rsquo;t be opened or initialised. This is equivalent to
the AllowMouseOpenFail xorg.conf(5) file option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-allowNonLocalXvidtune <br>
Make the VidMode extension available to remote clients. This
allows the xvidtune client to connect from another host.
This is equivalent to the AllowNonLocalXvidtune <br>
xorg.conf(5) file option. By default non-local connections
are not allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bgamma value <br>
Set the blue gamma correction. value must be between 0.1 and
10. The default is 1.0. Not all drivers support this. See
also the -gamma, -rgamma, and -ggamma options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bpp n No longer supported. Use
-depth to set the color depth, and use -fbbpp if you really
need to force a non-default framebuffer (hardware) pixel
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-config file <br>
Read the server configuration from file. This option will
work for any file when the server is run as root (i.e, with
real-uid 0), or for files relative to a directory <br>
in the config search path for all other users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-configdir directory <br>
Read the server configuration files from directory. This
option will work for any directory when the server is run as
root (i.e, with real-uid 0), or for directories <br>
relative to a directory in the config directory search path
for all other users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-configure <br>
When this option is specified, the Xorg server loads all
video driver modules, probes for available hardware, and
writes out an initial xorg.conf(5) file based on what <br>
was detected. This option currently has some problems on
some platforms, but in most cases it is a good way to
bootstrap the configuration process. This option is only
<br>
available when the server is run as root (i.e, with real-uid
0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-crt /dev/ttyXX <br>
SCO only. This is the same as the vt option, and is provided
for compatibility with the native SCO X server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-depth n <br>
Sets the default color depth. Legal values are 1, 4, 8, 15,
16, and 24. Not all drivers support all values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-disableVidMode <br>
Disable the parts of the VidMode extension (used by the
xvidtune client) that can be used to change the video modes.
This is equivalent to the DisableVidModeExtension <br>
xorg.conf(5) file option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fbbpp n <br>
Sets the number of framebuffer bits per pixel. You should
only set this if you&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s necessary;
normally the server can deduce the correct value from -depth
<br>
above. Useful if you want to run a depth 24 configuration
with a 24 bpp framebuffer rather than the (possibly default)
32 bpp framebuffer (or vice versa). Legal values <br>
are 1, 8, 16, 24, 32. Not all drivers support all
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flipPixels <br>
Swap the default values for the black and white pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gamma value <br>
Set the gamma correction. value must be between 0.1 and 10.
The default is 1.0. This value is applied equally to the R,
G and B values. Those values can be set inde&acirc; <br>
pendently with the -rgamma, -bgamma, and -ggamma options.
Not all drivers support this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ggamma value <br>
Set the green gamma correction. value must be between 0.1
and 10. The default is 1.0. Not all drivers support this.
See also the -gamma, -rgamma, and -bgamma options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ignoreABI <br>
The Xorg server checks the ABI revision levels of each
module that it loads. It will normally refuse to load
modules with ABI revisions that are newer than the
server&rsquo;s. <br>
This is because such modules might use interfaces that the
server does not have. When this option is specified,
mismatches like this are downgraded from fatal errors to
<br>
warnings. This option should be used with care.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-isolateDevice bus-id <br>
Restrict device resets to the device at bus-id. The bus-id
string has the form bustype:bus:device:function (e.g.,
&acirc;PCI:1:0:0&acirc;). At present, only isolation of PCI
<br>
devices is supported; i.e., this option is ignored if
bustype is anything other than &acirc;PCI&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keeptty <br>
Prevent the server from detaching its initial controlling
terminal. This option is only useful when debugging the
server. Not all platforms support (or can use) this <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keyboard keyboard-name <br>
Use the xorg.conf(5) file InputDevice section called
keyboard-name as the core keyboard. This option is ignored
when the Layout section specifies a core keyboard. In <br>
the absence of both a Layout section and this option, the
first relevant InputDevice section is used for the core
keyboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-layout layout-name <br>
Use the xorg.conf(5) file Layout section called layout-name.
By default the first Layout section is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-logfile filename <br>
Use the file called filename as the Xorg server log file.
The default log file when running as root is
/var/log/Xorg.n.log and for non root it is <br>
$XDG_DATA_HOME/xorg/Xorg.n.log where n is the display number
of the Xorg server. The default may be in a different
directory on some platforms. This option is only <br>
available when the server is run as root (i.e, with real-uid
0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-logverbose [n] <br>
Sets the verbosity level for information printed to the Xorg
server log file. If the n value isn&rsquo;t supplied, each
occurrence of this option increments the log file ver&acirc;
<br>
bosity level. When the n value is supplied, the log file
verbosity level is set to that value. The default log file
verbosity level is 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-modulepath searchpath <br>
Set the module search path to searchpath. searchpath is a
comma separated list of directories to search for Xorg
server modules. This option is only available when the <br>
server is run as root (i.e, with real-uid 0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nosilk Disable Silken Mouse
support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-novtswitch <br>
Disable the automatic switching on X server reset and
shutdown to the VT that was active when the server started,
if supported by the OS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pixmap24 <br>
Set the internal pixmap format for depth 24 pixmaps to 24
bits per pixel. The default is usually 32 bits per pixel.
There is normally little reason to use this option. <br>
Some client applications don&rsquo;t like this pixmap
format, even though it is a perfectly legal format. This is
equivalent to the Pixmap xorg.conf(5) file option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pixmap32 <br>
Set the internal pixmap format for depth 24 pixmaps to 32
bits per pixel. This is usually the default. This is
equivalent to the Pixmap xorg.conf(5) file option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pointer pointer-name <br>
Use the xorg.conf(5) file InputDevice section called
pointer-name as the core pointer. This option is ignored
when the Layout section specifies a core pointer. In the
<br>
absence of both a Layout section and this option, the first
relevant InputDevice section is used for the core
pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quiet Suppress most
informational messages at startup. The verbosity level is
set to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rgamma value <br>
Set the red gamma correction. value must be between 0.1 and
10. The default is 1.0. Not all drivers support this. See
also the -gamma, -bgamma, and -ggamma options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sharevts <br>
Share virtual terminals with another X server, if supported
by the OS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-screen screen-name <br>
Use the xorg.conf(5) file Screen section called screen-name.
By default the screens referenced by the default Layout
section are used, or the first Screen section when <br>
there are no Layout sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-showconfig <br>
This is the same as the -version option, and is included for
compatibility reasons. It may be removed in a future
release, so the -version option should be used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-showDefaultModulePath <br>
Print out the default module path the server was compiled
with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-showDefaultLibPath <br>
Print out the path libraries should be installed to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-showopts <br>
For each driver module installed, print out the list of
options and their argument types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-weight nnn <br>
Set RGB weighting at 16 bpp. The default is 565. This
applies only to those drivers which support 16 bpp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose [n] <br>
Sets the verbosity level for information printed on stderr.
If the n value isn&rsquo;t supplied, each occurrence of this
option increments the verbosity level. When the n <br>
value is supplied, the verbosity level is set to that value.
The default verbosity level is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Print out the server version, patchlevel, release date, the
operating system/platform it was built on, and whether it
includes module loader support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEYBOARD <br>
The Xorg server is normally configured to recognize various
special combinations of key presses that instruct the server
to perform some action, rather than just sending the key
<br>
press event to a client application. These actions depend on
the XKB keymap loaded by a particular keyboard device and
may or may not be available on a given configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following key combinations
are commonly part of the default XKEYBOARD keymap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl+Alt+Backspace <br>
Immediately kills the server -- no questions asked. It can
be disabled by setting the DontZap xorg.conf(5) file option
to a TRUE value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It should be noted that zapping
is triggered by the Terminate_Server action in the keyboard
map. This action is not part of the default keymaps but can
be enabled with <br>
the XKB option &quot;terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Plus <br>
Change video mode to next one specified in the configuration
file. This can be disabled with the DontZoom xorg.conf(5)
file option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Minus <br>
Change video mode to previous one specified in the
configuration file. This can be disabled with the DontZoom
xorg.conf(5) file option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl+Alt+F1...F12 <br>
For systems with virtual terminal support, these keystroke
combinations are used to switch to virtual terminals 1
through 12, respectively. This can be disabled with the <br>
DontVTSwitch xorg.conf(5) file option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
Xorg typically uses a configuration file called xorg.conf
and configuration files with the suffix .conf in a directory
called xorg.conf.d for its initial setup. Refer to the <br>
xorg.conf(5) manual page for information about the format of
this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xorg has a mechanism for
automatically generating a built-in configuration at
run-time when no xorg.conf file or xorg.conf.d files are
present. The current version of this auto&acirc; <br>
matic configuration mechanism works in two ways.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first is via enhancements
that have made many components of the xorg.conf file
optional. This means that information that can be probed or
reasonably deduced doesn&rsquo;t need to <br>
be specified explicitly, greatly reducing the amount of
built-in configuration information that needs to be
generated at run-time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second is to have
&quot;safe&quot; fallbacks for most configuration
information. This maximises the likelihood that the Xorg
server will start up in some usable configuration even <br>
when information about the specific hardware is not
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The automatic configuration
support for Xorg is work in progress. It is currently aimed
at the most popular hardware and software platforms
supported by Xorg. Enhancements are <br>
planned for future releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
The Xorg server config files can be found in a range of
locations. These are documented fully in the xorg.conf(5)
manual page. The most commonly used locations are shown
here.</p>
