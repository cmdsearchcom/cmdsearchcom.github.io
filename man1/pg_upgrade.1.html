<p>PG_UPGRADE(1) PostgreSQL 9.2.18 Documentation
PG_UPGRADE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pg_upgrade - upgrade a PostgreSQL server instance</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pg_upgrade -b oldbindir -B newbindir -d olddatadir -D
newdatadir [option...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pg_upgrade (formerly called pg_migrator) allows data stored
in PostgreSQL data files to be upgraded to a later
PostgreSQL major version without the data dump/reload
typically <br>
required for major version upgrades, e.g. from 8.4.7 to the
current major release of PostgreSQL. It is not required for
minor version upgrades, e.g. from 9.0.1 to 9.0.4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Major PostgreSQL releases
regularly add new features that often change the layout of
the system tables, but the internal data storage format
rarely changes. pg_upgrade uses this <br>
fact to perform rapid upgrades by creating new system tables
and simply reusing the old user data files. If a future
major release ever changes the data storage format in a way
<br>
that makes the old data format unreadable, pg_upgrade will
not be usable for such upgrades. (The community will attempt
to avoid such situations.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pg_upgrade does its best to make
sure the old and new clusters are binary-compatible, e.g. by
checking for compatible compile-time settings, including
32/64-bit binaries. It is <br>
important that any external modules are also binary
compatible, though this cannot be checked by pg_upgrade.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pg_upgrade supports upgrades
from 8.3.X and later to the current major release of
PostgreSQL, including snapshot and alpha releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
These are the steps to perform an upgrade with
pg_upgrade:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Optionally move the old
cluster: If you are using a version-specific installation
directory, e.g. /opt/PostgreSQL/9.1, you do not need to move
the old cluster. The graphical <br>
installers all use version-specific installation
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your installation directory
is not version-specific, e.g. /usr/local/pgsql, it is
necessary to move the current PostgreSQL install directory
so it does not interfere with <br>
the new PostgreSQL installation. Once the current PostgreSQL
server is shut down, it is safe to rename the PostgreSQL
installation directory; assuming the old directory is <br>
/usr/local/pgsql, you can do:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mv /usr/local/pgsql
/usr/local/pgsql.old</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to rename the directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. For source installs, build
the new version: Build the new PostgreSQL source with
configure flags that are compatible with the old cluster.
pg_upgrade will check <br>
pg_controldata to make sure all settings are compatible
before starting the upgrade.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Install the new PostgreSQL
binaries: Install the new server&rsquo;s binaries and
support files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For source installs, if you wish
to install the new server in a custom location, use the
prefix variable:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmake
prefix=/usr/local/pgsql.new install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Install pg_upgrade and
pg_upgrade_support: Install the pg_upgrade binary and
pg_upgrade_support library in the new PostgreSQL
cluster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Initialize the new PostgreSQL
cluster: Initialize the new cluster using initdb. Again, use
compatible initdb flags that match the old cluster. Many
prebuilt installers do <br>
this step automatically. There is no need to start the new
cluster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Install custom shared object
files: Install any custom shared object files (or DLLs) used
by the old cluster into the new cluster, e.g. pgcrypto.so,
whether they are from <br>
contrib or some other source. Do not install the schema
definitions, e.g. pgcrypto.sql, because these will be
upgraded from the old cluster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. Adjust authentication:
pg_upgrade will connect to the old and new servers several
times, so you might want to set authentication to peer in
pg_hba.conf or use a ~/.pgpass <br>
file (see Section 31.15, &acirc;The Password File&acirc;, in
the documentation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. Stop both servers: Make sure
both database servers are stopped using, on Unix, e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pg_ctl -D /opt/PostgreSQL/8.4
stop <br>
pg_ctl -D /opt/PostgreSQL/9.0 stop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or on Windows, using the proper
service names:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NET STOP postgresql-8.4 <br>
NET STOP postgresql-9.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NET STOP pgsql-8.3 (PostgreSQL
8.3 and older used a different service name)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9. Run pg_upgrade: Always run
the pg_upgrade binary of the new server, not the old one.
pg_upgrade requires the specification of the old and new
cluster&rsquo;s data and executable <br>
(bin) directories. You can also specify user and port
values, and whether you want the data linked instead of
copied (the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use link mode, the
upgrade will be much faster (no file copying), but you will
not be able to access your old cluster once you start the
new cluster after the upgrade. <br>
Link mode also requires that the old and new cluster data
directories be in the same file system. See pg_upgrade
--help for a full list of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For Windows users, you must be
logged into an administrative account, and then start a
shell as the postgres user and set the proper path:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNAS /USER:postgres
&quot;CMD.EXE&quot; n <br>
SET PATH=%PATH%;C:Program FilesPostgreSQL9.0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and then run pg_upgrade with
quoted directories, e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pg_upgrade.exe <br>
--old-datadir &quot;C:/Program
Files/PostgreSQL/8.4/data&quot; <br>
--new-datadir &quot;C:/Program
Files/PostgreSQL/9.0/data&quot; <br>
--old-bindir &quot;C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/8.4/bin&quot;
<br>
--new-bindir &quot;C:/Program
Files/PostgreSQL/9.0/bin&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once started, pg_upgrade will
verify the two clusters are compatible and then do the
upgrade. You can use pg_upgrade --check to perform only the
checks, even if the old <br>
server is still running. pg_upgrade --check will also
outline any manual adjustments you will need to make after
the upgrade. If you are going to be using link mode, you
<br>
should use the --link option with --check to enable
link-mode-specific checks. pg_upgrade requires write
permission in the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Obviously, no one should be
accessing the clusters during the upgrade. pg_upgrade
defaults to running servers on port 50432 to avoid
unintended client connections. You can <br>
use the same port number for both clusters when doing an
upgrade because the old and new clusters will not be running
at the same time. However, when checking an old running <br>
server, the old and new port numbers must be different.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an error occurs while
restoring the database schema, pg_upgrade will exit and you
will have to revert to the old cluster as outlined in Step
14 below. To try pg_upgrade <br>
again, you will need to modify the old cluster so the
pg_upgrade schema restore succeeds. If the problem is a
contrib module, you might need to uninstall the contrib
module <br>
from the old cluster and install it in the new cluster after
the upgrade, assuming the module is not being used to store
user data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10. Restore pg_hba.conf: If you
modified pg_hba.conf, restore its original settings. It
might also be necessary to adjust other configuration files
in the new cluster to match <br>
the old cluster, e.g. postgresql.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">11. Post-Upgrade processing: If
any post-upgrade processing is required, pg_upgrade will
issue warnings as it completes. It will also generate script
files that must be run by <br>
the administrator. The script files will connect to each
database that needs post-upgrade processing. Each script
should be run using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">psql --username postgres --file
script.sql postgres</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The scripts can be run in any
order and can be deleted once they have been run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution <br>
In general it is unsafe to access tables referenced in
rebuild scripts until the rebuild scripts have run to
completion; doing so could yield incorrect results or poor
<br>
performance. Tables not referenced in rebuild scripts can be
accessed immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">12. Statistics: Because
optimizer statistics are not transferred by pg_upgrade, you
will be instructed to run a command to regenerate that
information at the end of the upgrade.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">13. Delete old cluster: Once you
are satisfied with the upgrade, you can delete the old
cluster&rsquo;s data directories by running the script
mentioned when pg_upgrade completes. You <br>
can also delete the old installation directories (e.g. bin,
share).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">14. Reverting to old cluster:
If, after running pg_upgrade, you wish to revert to the old
cluster, there are several options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you ran
pg_upgrade with --check, no modifications were made to the
old cluster and you can re-use it anytime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you ran
pg_upgrade with --link, the data files are shared between
the old and new cluster. If you started the new cluster, the
new server has written to those shared <br>
files and it is unsafe to use the old cluster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you ran
pg_upgradewithout--link or did not start the new server, the
old cluster was not modified except that, if linking
started, a .old suffix was appended to <br>
$PGDATA/global/pg_control. To reuse the old cluster,
possibly remove the .old suffix from
$PGDATA/global/pg_control; you can then restart the old
cluster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
pg_upgrade does not support upgrading of databases
containing these reg* OID-referencing system data types:
regproc, regprocedure, regoper, regoperator, regconfig, and
<br>
regdictionary. (regtype can be upgraded.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All failure, rebuild, and
reindex cases will be reported by pg_upgrade if they affect
your installation; post-upgrade scripts to rebuild tables
and indexes will be generated <br>
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For deployment testing, create a
schema-only copy of the old cluster, insert dummy data, and
upgrade that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading a
pre-PostgreSQL 9.2 cluster that uses a
configuration-file-only directory, you must pass the real
data directory location to pg_upgrade, and pass the <br>
configuration directory location to the server, e.g. -d
/real-data-directory -o &rsquo;-D
/configuration-directory&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If using a pre-9.1 old server
that is using a non-default Unix-domain socket directory or
a default that differs from the default of the new cluster,
set PGHOST to point to the <br>
old server&rsquo;s socket location. (This is not relevant on
Windows.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Log-Shipping Standby Server
(Section 25.2, &acirc;Log-Shipping Standby Servers&acirc;,
in the documentation) cannot be upgraded because the server
must allow writes. The simplest way is to <br>
upgrade the primary and use rsync to rebuild the standbys.
You can run rsync while the primary is down, or as part of a
base backup (Section 24.3.2, &acirc;Making a Base
Backup&acirc;, in <br>
the documentation) which overwrites the old standby
cluster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to use link mode and
you do not want your old cluster to be modified when the new
cluster is started, make a copy of the old cluster and
upgrade that in link mode. To <br>
make a valid copy of the old cluster, use rsync to create a
dirty copy of the old cluster while the server is running,
then shut down the old server and run rsync again to update
<br>
the copy with any changes to make it consistent. You might
want to exclude some files, e.g. postmaster.pid, as
documented in Section 24.3.3, &acirc;Making a Base Backup
Using the Low <br>
Level API&acirc;, in the documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Limitations in Upgrading from
PostgreSQL 8.3 <br>
Upgrading from PostgreSQL 8.3 has additional restrictions
not present when upgrading from later PostgreSQL releases.
For example, pg_upgrade will not work for upgrading from 8.3
<br>
if a user column is defined as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a tsquery data
type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; data type name
and is not the first column</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You must drop any such columns
and upgrade them manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pg_upgrade will not work if the
ltree contrib module is installed in a database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pg_upgrade will require a table
rebuild if:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a user column is
of data type tsvector</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pg_upgrade will require a
reindex if:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; an index is of
type hash or GIN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; an index uses
bpchar_pattern_ops</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, the default datetime
storage format changed to integer after PostgreSQL 8.3.
pg_upgrade will check that the datetime storage format used
by the old and new clusters match. <br>
Make sure your new cluster is built with the configure flag
--disable-integer-datetimes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For Windows users, note that due
to different integer datetimes settings used by the
graphical installer and the MSI installer, it is only
possible to upgrade from version 8.3 of <br>
the installer distribution to version 8.4 or later of the
installer distribution. It is not possible to upgrade from
the MSI installer to the new graphical installer.</p>
