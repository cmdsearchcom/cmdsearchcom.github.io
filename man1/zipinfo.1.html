<p>ZIPINFO(1L) ZIPINFO(1L)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
zipinfo - list detailed information about a ZIP archive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
zipinfo [-12CsmlvhMtTz] file[.zip] [file(s) ...] [-x
xfile(s) ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unzip -Z [-12CsmlvhMtTz]
file[.zip] [file(s) ...] [-x xfile(s) ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
zipinfo lists technical information about files in a ZIP
archive, most commonly found on MS-DOS systems. Such
information includes file access permissions, encryption
status, <br>
type of compression, version and operating system or file
system of compressing program, and the like. The default
behavior (with no options) is to list single-line entries
for <br>
each file in the archive, with header and trailer lines
providing summary information for the entire archive. The
format is a cross between Unix &lsquo;&lsquo;ls
-l&rsquo;&rsquo; and &lsquo;&lsquo;unzip -v&rsquo;&rsquo;
out&acirc; <br>
put. See DETAILED DESCRIPTION below. Note that zipinfo is
the same program as unzip (under Unix, a link to it); on
some systems, however, zipinfo support may have been omitted
<br>
when unzip was compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
file[.zip] <br>
Path of the ZIP archive(s). If the file specification is a
wildcard, each matching file is processed in an order
determined by the operating system (or file system). <br>
Only the filename can be a wildcard; the path itself cannot.
Wildcard expressions are similar to Unix egrep(1) (regular)
expressions and may contain:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* matches a sequence of 0 or
more characters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? matches exactly 1
character</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[...] matches any single
character found inside the brackets; ranges are specified by
a beginning character, a hyphen, and an ending character. If
an exclamation point <br>
or a caret (&lsquo;!&rsquo; or &lsquo;^&rsquo;) follows the
left bracket, then the range of characters within the
brackets is complemented (that is, anything except the
characters inside <br>
the brackets is considered a match). To specify a verbatim
left bracket, the three-character sequence
&lsquo;&lsquo;[[]&rsquo;&rsquo; has to be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Be sure to quote any character
that might otherwise be interpreted or modified by the
operating system, particularly under Unix and VMS.) If no
matches are found, the <br>
specification is assumed to be a literal filename; and if
that also fails, the suffix .zip is appended. Note that
self-extracting ZIP files are supported, as with any <br>
other ZIP archive; just specify the .exe suffix (if any)
explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[file(s)] <br>
An optional list of archive members to be processed,
separated by spaces. (VMS versions compiled with VMSCLI
defined must delimit files with commas instead.) Regular
<br>
expressions (wildcards) may be used to match multiple
members; see above. Again, be sure to quote expressions that
would otherwise be expanded or modified by the operat&acirc;
<br>
ing system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-x xfile(s)] <br>
An optional list of archive members to be excluded from
processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-1 list filenames only, one per line. This option excludes
all others; headers, trailers and zipfile comments are never
printed. It is intended for use in Unix shell <br>
scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2 list filenames only, one per
line, but allow headers (-h), trailers (-t) and zipfile
comments (-z), as well. This option may be useful in cases
where the stored filenames <br>
are particularly long.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C use case-insensitive matching
for the selection of archive entries from the command-line
list of extract selection patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s list zipfile info in short
Unix &lsquo;&lsquo;ls -l&rsquo;&rsquo; format. This is the
default behavior; see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m list zipfile info in medium
Unix &lsquo;&lsquo;ls -l&rsquo;&rsquo; format. Identical to
the -s output, except that the compression factor, expressed
as a percentage, is also listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l list zipfile info in long
Unix &lsquo;&lsquo;ls -l&rsquo;&rsquo; format. As with -m
except that the compressed size (in bytes) is printed
instead of the compression ratio.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v list zipfile information in
verbose, multi-page format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h list header line. The archive
name, actual size (in bytes) and total number of files is
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M pipe all output through an
internal pager similar to the Unix more(1) command. At the
end of a screenful of output, zipinfo pauses with a
&lsquo;&lsquo;--More--&rsquo;&rsquo; prompt; the next <br>
screenful may be viewed by pressing the Enter (Return) key
or the space bar. zipinfo can be terminated by pressing the
&lsquo;&lsquo;q&rsquo;&rsquo; key and, on some systems, the
Enter/Return <br>
key. Unlike Unix more(1), there is no forward-searching or
editing capability. Also, zipinfo doesn&rsquo;t notice if
long lines wrap at the edge of the screen, effectively <br>
resulting in the printing of two or more lines and the
likelihood that some text will scroll off the top of the
screen before being viewed. On some systems the number of
<br>
available lines on the screen is not detected, in which case
zipinfo assumes the height is 24 lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t list totals for files listed
or for all files. The number of files listed, their
uncompressed and compressed total sizes , and their overall
compression factor is <br>
printed; or, if only the totals line is being printed, the
values for the entire archive are given. The compressed
total size does not include the 12 additional header <br>
bytes of each encrypted entry. Note that the total
compressed (data) size will never match the actual zipfile
size, since the latter includes all of the internal zipfile
<br>
headers in addition to the compressed data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T print the file dates and
times in a sortable decimal format (yymmdd.hhmmss). The
default date format is a more standard, human-readable
version with abbreviated month <br>
names (see examples below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U [UNICODE_SUPPORT only] modify
or disable UTF-8 handling. When UNICODE_SUPPORT is
available, the option -U forces unzip to escape all
non-ASCII characters from UTF-8 coded <br>
filenames as &lsquo;&lsquo;#Uxxxx&rsquo;&rsquo;. This option
is mainly provided for debugging purpose when the fairly new
UTF-8 support is suspected to mangle up extracted
filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -UU allows to
entirely disable the recognition of UTF-8 encoded filenames.
The handling of filename codings within unzip falls back to
the behaviour of previ&acirc; <br>
ous versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z include the archive comment
(if any) in the listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DETAILED DESCRIPTION <br>
zipinfo has a number of modes, and its behavior can be
rather difficult to fathom if one isn&rsquo;t familiar with
Unix ls(1) (or even if one is). The default behavior is to
list <br>
files in the following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rw-rws--- 1.9 unx 2802 t- defX
11-Aug-91 13:48 perms.2660</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last three fields are the
modification date and time of the file, and its name. The
case of the filename is respected; thus files that come from
MS-DOS PKZIP are always cap&acirc; <br>
italized. If the file was zipped with a stored directory
name, that is also displayed as part of the filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second and third fields
indicate that the file was zipped under Unix with version
1.9 of zip. Since it comes from Unix, the file permissions
at the beginning of the line are <br>
printed in Unix format. The uncompressed file-size (2802 in
this example) is the fourth field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fifth field consists of two
characters, either of which may take on several values. The
first character may be either &lsquo;t&rsquo; or
&lsquo;b&rsquo;, indicating that zip believes the file to be
<br>
text or binary, respectively; but if the file is encrypted,
zipinfo notes this fact by capitalizing the character
(&lsquo;T&rsquo; or &lsquo;B&rsquo;). The second character
may also take on four val&acirc; <br>
ues, depending on whether there is an extended local header
and/or an &lsquo;&lsquo;extra field&rsquo;&rsquo; associated
with the file (fully explained in PKWare&rsquo;s
APPNOTE.TXT, but basically analogous <br>
to pragmas in ANSI C--i.e., they provide a standard way to
include non-standard information in the archive). If neither
exists, the character will be a hyphen (&lsquo;-&rsquo;); if
there is <br>
an extended local header but no extra field,
&lsquo;l&rsquo;; if the reverse, &lsquo;x&rsquo;; and if
both exist, &lsquo;X&rsquo;. Thus the file in this example
is (probably) a text file, is not encrypted, and has <br>
neither an extra field nor an extended local header
associated with it. The example below, on the other hand, is
an encrypted binary file with an extra field:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RWD,R,R 0.9 vms 168 Bx shrk
9-Aug-91 19:15 perms.0644</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extra fields are used for
various purposes (see discussion of the -v option below)
including the storage of VMS file attributes, which is
presumably the case here. Note that the <br>
file attributes are listed in VMS format. Some other
possibilities for the host operating system (which is
actually a misnomer--host file system is more correct)
include OS/2 or <br>
NT with High Performance File System (HPFS), MS-DOS, OS/2 or
NT with File Allocation Table (FAT) file system, and
Macintosh. These are denoted as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rw-a-- 1.0 hpf 5358 Tl i4:3
4-Dec-91 11:33 longfilename.hpfs <br>
-r--ahs 1.1 fat 4096 b- i4:2 14-Jul-91 12:58 EA DATA. SF
<br>
--w------- 1.0 mac 17357 bx i8:2 4-May-92 04:02
unzip.macr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File attributes in the first two
cases are indicated in a Unix-like format, where the seven
subfields indicate whether the file: (1) is a directory, (2)
is readable (always <br>
true), (3) is writable, (4) is executable (guessed on the
basis of the extension--.exe, .com, .bat, .cmd and .btm
files are assumed to be so), (5) has its archive bit set,
(6) is <br>
hidden, and (7) is a system file. Interpretation of
Macintosh file attributes is unreliable because some
Macintosh archivers don&rsquo;t store any attributes in the
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, the sixth field
indicates the compression method and possible sub-method
used. There are six methods known at present: storing (no
compression), reducing, shrinking, <br>
imploding, tokenizing (never publicly released), and
deflating. In addition, there are four levels of reducing (1
through 4); four types of imploding (4K or 8K sliding
dictio&acirc; <br>
nary, and 2 or 3 Shannon-Fano trees); and four levels of
deflating (superfast, fast, normal, maximum compression).
zipinfo represents these methods and their sub-methods as
fol&acirc; <br>
lows: stor; re:1, re:2, etc.; shrk; i4:2, i8:3, etc.; tokn;
and defS, defF, defN, and defX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The medium and long listings are
almost identical to the short format except that they add
information on the file&rsquo;s compression. The medium
format lists the file&rsquo;s compression <br>
factor as a percentage indicating the amount of space that
has been &lsquo;&lsquo;removed&rsquo;&rsquo;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rw-rws--- 1.5 unx 2802 t- 81%
defX 11-Aug-91 13:48 perms.2660</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, the file has
been compressed by more than a factor of five; the
compressed data are only 19% of the original size. The long
format gives the compressed file&rsquo;s <br>
size in bytes, instead:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rw-rws--- 1.5 unx 2802 t- 538
defX 11-Aug-91 13:48 perms.2660</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In contrast to the unzip
listings, the compressed size figures in this listing format
denote the complete size of compressed data, including the
12 extra header bytes in case of <br>
encrypted entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adding the -T option changes the
file date and time to decimal format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rw-rws--- 1.5 unx 2802 t- 538
defX 910811.134804 perms.2660</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that because of limitations
in the MS-DOS format used to store file times, the seconds
field is always rounded to the nearest even second. For Unix
files this is expected <br>
to change in the next major releases of zip(1L) and
unzip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to individual file
information, a default zipfile listing also includes header
and trailer lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Archive: OS2.zip 5453 bytes 5
files <br>
,,rw, 1.0 hpf 730 b- i4:3 26-Jun-92 23:40 Contents <br>
,,rw, 1.0 hpf 3710 b- i4:3 26-Jun-92 23:33 makefile.os2 <br>
,,rw, 1.0 hpf 8753 b- i8:3 26-Jun-92 15:29 os2unzip.c <br>
,,rw, 1.0 hpf 98 b- stor 21-Aug-91 15:34 unzip.def <br>
,,rw, 1.0 hpf 95 b- stor 21-Aug-91 17:51 zipinfo.def <br>
5 files, 13386 bytes uncompressed, 4951 bytes compressed:
63.0%</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The header line gives the name
of the archive, its total size, and the total number of
files; the trailer gives the number of files listed, their
total uncompressed size, and <br>
their total compressed size (not including any of
zip&rsquo;s internal overhead). If, however, one or more
file(s) are provided, the header and trailer lines are not
listed. This <br>
behavior is also similar to that of Unix&rsquo;s
&lsquo;&lsquo;ls -l&rsquo;&rsquo;; it may be overridden by
specifying the -h and -t options explicitly. In such a case
the listing format must also be speci&acirc; <br>
fied explicitly, since -h or -t (or both) in the absence of
other options implies that ONLY the header or trailer line
(or both) is listed. See the EXAMPLES section below for a
<br>
semi-intelligible translation of this nonsense.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The verbose listing is mostly
self-explanatory. It also lists file comments and the
zipfile comment, if any, and the type and number of bytes in
any stored extra fields. Cur&acirc; <br>
rently known types of extra fields include PKWARE&rsquo;s
authentication (&lsquo;&lsquo;AV&rsquo;&rsquo;) info; OS/2
extended attributes; VMS filesystem info, both PKWARE and
Info-ZIP versions; Macintosh <br>
resource forks; Acorn/Archimedes SparkFS info; and so on.
(Note that in the case of OS/2 extended attributes--perhaps
the most common use of zipfile extra fields--the size of
<br>
the stored EAs as reported by zipinfo may not match the
number given by OS/2&rsquo;s dir command: OS/2 always
reports the number of bytes required in 16-bit format,
whereas zipinfo <br>
always reports the 32-bit storage.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Again, the compressed size
figures of the individual entries include the 12 extra
header bytes for encrypted entries. In contrast, the archive
total compressed size and the <br>
average compression ratio shown in the summary bottom line
are calculated without the extra 12 header bytes of
encrypted entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS <br>
Modifying zipinfo&rsquo;s default behavior via options
placed in an environment variable can be a bit complicated
to explain, due to zipinfo&rsquo;s attempts to handle
various defaults in an <br>
intuitive, yet Unix-like, manner. (Try not to laugh.)
Nevertheless, there is some underlying logic. In brief,
there are three &lsquo;&lsquo;priority levels&rsquo;&rsquo;
of options: the default <br>
options; environment options, which can override or add to
the defaults; and explicit options given by the user, which
can override or add to either of the above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default listing format, as
noted above, corresponds roughly to the &quot;zipinfo
-hst&quot; command (except when individual zipfile members
are specified). A user who prefers the <br>
long-listing format (-l) can make use of the zipinfo&rsquo;s
environment variable to change this default:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unix Bourne shell: <br>
ZIPINFO=-l; export ZIPINFO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unix C shell: <br>
setenv ZIPINFO -l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OS/2 or MS-DOS: <br>
set ZIPINFO=-l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VMS (quotes for lowercase): <br>
define ZIPINFO_OPTS &quot;-l&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If, in addition, the user
dislikes the trailer line, zipinfo&rsquo;s concept of
&lsquo;&lsquo;negative options&rsquo;&rsquo; may be used to
override the default inclusion of the line. This is
accomplished by <br>
preceding the undesired option with one or more minuses:
e.g., &lsquo;&lsquo;-l-t&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;--tl&rsquo;&rsquo;, in this example. The first
hyphen is the regular switch character, but the one before
the <br>
&lsquo;t&rsquo; is a minus sign. The dual use of hyphens may
seem a little awkward, but it&rsquo;s reasonably intuitive
nonetheless: simply ignore the first hyphen and go from
there. It is also <br>
consistent with the behavior of the Unix command
nice(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As suggested above, the default
variable names are ZIPINFO_OPTS for VMS (where the symbol
used to install zipinfo as a foreign command would otherwise
be confused with the envi&acirc; <br>
ronment variable), and ZIPINFO for all other operating
systems. For compatibility with zip(1L), ZIPINFOOPT is also
accepted (don&rsquo;t ask). If both ZIPINFO and ZIPINFOOPT
are <br>
defined, however, ZIPINFO takes precedence. unzip&rsquo;s
diagnostic option (-v with no zipfile name) can be used to
check the values of all four possible unzip and zipinfo
environ&acirc; <br>
ment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To get a basic, short-format listing of the complete
contents of a ZIP archive storage.zip, with both header and
totals lines, use only the archive name as an argument to
zip&acirc; <br>
info:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zipinfo storage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To produce a basic, long-format
listing (not verbose), including header and totals lines,
use -l:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zipinfo -l storage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To list the complete contents of
the archive without header and totals lines, either negate
the -h and -t options or else specify the contents
explicitly:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zipinfo --h-t storage <br>
zipinfo storage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(where the backslash is required
only if the shell would otherwise expand the &lsquo;*&rsquo;
wildcard, as in Unix when globbing is turned on--double
quotes around the asterisk would have <br>
worked as well). To turn off the totals line by default, use
the environment variable (C shell is assumed here):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setenv ZIPINFO --t <br>
zipinfo storage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To get the full, short-format
listing of the first example again, given that the
environment variable is set as in the previous example, it
is necessary to specify the -s option <br>
explicitly, since the -t option by itself implies that ONLY
the footer line is to be printed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setenv ZIPINFO --t <br>
zipinfo -t storage [only totals line] <br>
zipinfo -st storage [full listing]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -s option, like -m and -l,
includes headers and footers by default, unless otherwise
specified. Since the environment variable specified no
footers and that has a higher <br>
precedence than the default behavior of -s, an explicit -t
option was necessary to produce the full listing. Nothing
was indicated about the header, however, so the -s option
<br>
was sufficient. Note that both the -h and -t options, when
used by themselves or with each other, override any default
listing of member files; only the header and/or footer are
<br>
printed. This behavior is useful when zipinfo is used with a
wildcard zipfile specification; the contents of all zipfiles
are then summarized with a single command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To list information on a single
file within the archive, in medium format, specify the
filename explicitly:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zipinfo -m storage
unshrink.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specification of any member
file, as in this example, will override the default header
and totals lines; only the single line of information about
the requested file will be <br>
printed. This is intuitively what one would expect when
requesting information about a single file. For multiple
files, it is often useful to know the total compressed and
<br>
uncompressed size; in such cases -t may be specified
explicitly:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zipinfo -mt storage
&quot;*.[ch]&quot; Mak</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To get maximal information about
the ZIP archive, use the verbose option. It is usually wise
to pipe the output into a filter such as Unix more(1) if the
operating system allows <br>
it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zipinfo -v storage | more</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, to see the most
recently modified files in the archive, use the -T option in
conjunction with an external sorting utility such as Unix
sort(1) (and sed(1) as well, in <br>
this example):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zipinfo -T storage | sort -nr -k
7 | sed 15q</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -nr option to sort(1) tells
it to sort numerically in reverse order rather than in
textual order, and the -k 7 option tells it to sort on the
seventh field. This assumes the <br>
default short-listing format; if -m or -l is used, the
proper sort(1) option would be -k 8. Older versions of
sort(1) do not support the -k option, but you can use the
tradi&acirc; <br>
tional + option instead, e.g., +6 instead of -k 7. The
sed(1) command filters out all but the first 15 lines of the
listing. Future releases of zipinfo may incorporate <br>
date/time and filename sorting as built-in options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIPS <br>
The author finds it convenient to define an alias ii for
zipinfo on systems that allow aliases (or, on other systems,
copy/rename the executable, create a link or create a
com&acirc; <br>
mand file with the name ii). The ii usage parallels the
common ll alias for long listings in Unix, and the
similarity between the outputs of the two commands was
intentional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
As with unzip, zipinfo&rsquo;s -M
(&lsquo;&lsquo;more&rsquo;&rsquo;) option is overly
simplistic in its handling of screen output; as noted above,
it fails to detect the wrapping of long lines and may
thereby <br>
cause lines at the top of the screen to be scrolled off
before being read. zipinfo should detect and treat each
occurrence of line-wrap as one additional line printed. This
<br>
requires knowledge of the screen&rsquo;s width as well as
its height. In addition, zipinfo should detect the true
screen geometry on all systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zipinfo&rsquo;s listing-format
behavior is unnecessarily complex and should be simplified.
(This is not to say that it will be.)</p>
