<p>RAWSHARK(1) The Wireshark Network Analyzer
RAWSHARK(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rawshark - Dump and analyze raw pcap data</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rawshark [ -d &lt;encap:dlt&gt;|&lt;proto:protoname&gt; ] [
-F &lt;field to display&gt; ] [ -h ] [ -l ] [ -n ] [ -N
&lt;name resolving flags&gt; ] [ -o &lt;preference
setting&gt; ] ... [ -p ] [ -r &lt;pipe&gt;|- ] <br>
[ -R &lt;read (display) filter&gt; ] [ -s ] [ -S &lt;field
format&gt; ] [ -t ad|a|r|d|e ] [ -v ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Rawshark reads a stream of packets from a file or pipe, and
prints a line describing its output, followed by a set of
matching fields for each packet on stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT <br>
Unlike TShark, Rawshark makes no assumptions about
encapsulation or input. The -d and -r flags must be
specified in order for it to run. One or more -F flags
should be specified <br>
in order for the output to be useful. The other flags listed
above follow the same conventions as Wireshark and
TShark.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rawshark expects input records
with the following format by default. This matches the
format of the packet header and packet data in a
pcap-formatted file on disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct rawshark_rec_s { <br>
uint32_t ts_sec; /* Time stamp (seconds) */ <br>
uint32_t ts_usec; /* Time stamp (microseconds) */ <br>
uint32_t caplen; /* Length of the packet buffer */ <br>
uint32_t len; /* &quot;On the wire&quot; length of the
packet */ <br>
uint8_t data[caplen]; /* Packet data */ <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -p is supplied rawshark
expects the following format. This matches the struct
pcap_pkthdr structure and packet data used in
libpcap/WinPcap. This structure&rsquo;s format is <br>
platform-dependent; the size of the tv_sec field in the
struct timeval structure could be 32 bits or 64 bits. For
rawshark to work, the layout of the structure in the input
must <br>
match the layout of the structure in rawshark. Note that
this format will probably be the same as the previous format
if rawshark is a 32-bit program, but will not necessarily
<br>
be the same if rawshark is a 64-bit program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct rawshark_rec_s { <br>
struct timeval ts; /* Time stamp */ <br>
uint32_t caplen; /* Length of the packet buffer */ <br>
uint32_t len; /* &quot;On the wire&quot; length of the
packet */ <br>
uint8_t data[caplen]; /* Packet data */ <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In either case, the endianness
(byte ordering) of each integer must match the system on
which rawshark is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT <br>
If one or more fields are specified via the -F flag,
Rawshark prints the number, field type, and display format
for each field on the first line as &quot;packet
number&quot; 0. For each <br>
record, the packet number, matching fields, and a
&quot;1&quot; or &quot;0&quot; are printed to indicate if
the field matched any supplied display filter. A
&quot;-&quot; is used to signal the end of a field <br>
description and at the end of each packet line. For example,
the flags -F ip.src -F dns.qry.type might generate the
following output:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 FT_IPv4 BASE_NONE - 1
FT_UINT16 BASE_HEX - <br>
1 1=&quot;1&quot; 0=&quot;192.168.77.10&quot; 1 - <br>
2 1=&quot;1&quot; 0=&quot;192.168.77.250&quot; 1 - <br>
3 0=&quot;192.168.77.10&quot; 1 - <br>
4 0=&quot;74.125.19.104&quot; 1 -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that packets 1 and 2 are
DNS queries, and 3 and 4 are not. Adding -R &quot;not
dns&quot; still prints each line, but there&rsquo;s an
indication that packets 1 and 2 didn&rsquo;t pass the
filter:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 FT_IPv4 BASE_NONE - 1
FT_UINT16 BASE_HEX - <br>
1 1=&quot;1&quot; 0=&quot;192.168.77.10&quot; 0 - <br>
2 1=&quot;1&quot; 0=&quot;192.168.77.250&quot; 0 - <br>
3 0=&quot;192.168.77.10&quot; 1 - <br>
4 0=&quot;74.125.19.104&quot; 1 -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also note that the output may be
in any order, and that multiple matching fields might be
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d &lt;encapsulation&gt; <br>
Specify how the packet data should be dissected. The
encapsulation is of the form type:value, where type is one
of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">encap:name Packet data should be
dissected using the libpcap/WinPcap data link type (DLT)
name, e.g. encap:EN10MB for Ethernet. Names are converted
using <br>
pcap_datalink_name_to_val(). A complete list of DLTs can be
found at &lt;http://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">encap:number Packet data should
be dissected using the libpcap/WinPcap DLT number, e.g.
encap:105 for raw IEEE 802.11.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">proto:protocol Packet data
should be passed to the specified Wireshark protocol
dissector, e.g. proto:http for HTTP data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F &lt;field to display&gt; <br>
Add the matching field to the output. Fields are any valid
display filter field. More than one -F flag may be
specified, and each field can match multiple times in a
given <br>
packet. A single field may be specified per -F flag. If you
want to apply a display filter, use the -R flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print the version and options
and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Flush the standard output
after the information for each packet is printed. (This is
not, strictly speaking, line-buffered if -V was specified;
however, it is the same as <br>
line-buffered if -V wasn&rsquo;t specified, as only one line
is printed for each packet, and, as -l is normally used when
piping a live capture to a program or script, so that <br>
output for a packet shows up as soon as the packet is seen
and dissected, it should work just as well as true
line-buffering. We do this as a workaround for a deficiency
in <br>
the Microsoft Visual C++ C library.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This may be useful when piping
the output of TShark to another program, as it means that
the program to which the output is piped will see the
dissected data for a packet as <br>
soon as TShark sees the packet and generates that output,
rather than seeing it only when the standard output buffer
containing that data fills up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Disable network object name
resolution (such as hostname, TCP and UDP port names), the
-N flag might override this one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N &lt;name resolving flags&gt;
<br>
Turn on name resolving only for particular types of
addresses and port numbers, with name resolving for other
types of addresses and port numbers turned off. This flag
<br>
overrides -n if both -N and -n are present. If both -N and
-n flags are not present, all name resolutions are turned
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument is a string that
may contain the letters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m to enable MAC address
resolution</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n to enable network address
resolution</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N to enable using external
resolvers (e.g., DNS) for network address resolution</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t to enable transport-layer port
number resolution</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C to enable concurrent
(asynchronous) DNS lookups</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o
&lt;preference&gt;:&lt;value&gt; <br>
Set a preference value, overriding the default value and any
value read from a preference file. The argument to the
option is a string of the form prefname:value, where <br>
prefname is the name of the preference (which is the same
name that would appear in the preference file), and value is
the value to which it should be set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Assume that packet data is
preceded by a pcap_pkthdr struct as defined in pcap.h. On
some systems the size of the timestamp data will be
different from the data written to <br>
disk. On other systems they are identical and this flag has
no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r &lt;pipe&gt;|- <br>
Read packet data from input source. It can be either the
name of a FIFO (named pipe) or &lsquo;&lsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo;
to read data from the standard input, and must have the
record format specified <br>
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R &lt;read (display) filter&gt;
<br>
Cause the specified filter (which uses the syntax of
read/display filters, rather than that of capture filters)
to be applied before printing the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Allows standard pcap files to
be used as input, by skipping over the 24 byte pcap file
header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Use the specified format
string to print each field. The following formats are
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%D Field name or description,
e.g. &quot;Type&quot; for dns.qry.type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%N Base 10 numeric value of the
field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%S String value of the
field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For something similar to
Wireshark&rsquo;s standard display (&quot;Type: A (1)&quot;)
you could use %D: %S (%N).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t ad|a|r|d|e <br>
Set the format of the packet timestamp printed in summary
lines, the default is relative. The format can be one
of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ad absolute with date: The
absolute date and time is the actual time and date the
packet was captured</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a absolute: The absolute time is
the actual time the packet was captured, with no date
displayed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r relative: The relative time is
the time elapsed between the first packet and the current
packet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d delta: The delta time is the
time since the previous packet was captured</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e epoch: The time in seconds
since epoch (Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print the version and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">READ FILTER SYNTAX <br>
For a complete table of protocol and protocol fields that
are filterable in TShark see the wireshark-filter(4) manual
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
These files contains various Wireshark configuration
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Preferences <br>
The preferences files contain global (system-wide) and
personal preference settings. If the system-wide preference
file exists, it is read first, overriding the default <br>
settings. If the personal preferences file exists, it is
read next, overriding any previous values. Note: If the
command line option -o is used (possibly more than once), it
<br>
will in turn override values from the preferences files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The preferences settings are in
the form prefname:value, one per line, where prefname is the
name of the preference and value is the value to which it
should be set; white <br>
space is allowed between : and value. A preference setting
can be continued on subsequent lines by indenting the
continuation lines with white space. A # character starts a
<br>
comment that runs to the end of the line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Capture in promiscuous mode?
<br>
# TRUE or FALSE (case-insensitive). <br>
capture.prom_mode: TRUE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The global preferences file is
looked for in the wireshark directory under the share
subdirectory of the main installation directory (for
example, <br>
/usr/local/share/wireshark/preferences) on UNIX-compatible
systems, and in the main installation directory (for
example, C:Program FilesWiresharkreferences) on Windows <br>
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The personal preferences file is
looked for in $HOME/.wireshark/preferences on
UNIX-compatible systems and %APPDATA%Wiresharkreferences
(or, if %APPDATA% isn&rsquo;t defined, <br>
%USERPROFILE%0lication DataWiresharkreferences) on Windows
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disabled (Enabled) Protocols
<br>
The disabled_protos files contain system-wide and personal
lists of protocols that have been disabled, so that their
dissectors are never called. The files contain protocol <br>
names, one per line, where the protocol name is the same
name that would be used in a display filter for the
protocol:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http <br>
tcp # a comment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The global disabled_protos file
uses the same directory as the global preferences file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The personal disabled_protos
file uses the same directory as the personal preferences
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name Resolution (hosts) <br>
If the personal hosts file exists, it is used to resolve
IPv4 and IPv6 addresses before any other attempts are made
to resolve them. The file has the standard hosts file <br>
syntax; each line contains one IP address and name,
separated by whitespace. The same directory as for the
personal preferences file is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Capture filter name resolution
is handled by libpcap on UNIX-compatible systems and WinPcap
on Windows. As such the Wireshark personal hosts file will
not be consulted for <br>
capture filter name resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name Resolution (ethers) <br>
The ethers files are consulted to correlate 6-byte hardware
addresses to names. First the personal ethers file is tried
and if an address is not found there the global ethers <br>
file is tried next.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each line contains one hardware
address and name, separated by whitespace. The digits of the
hardware address are separated by colons (:), dashes (-) or
periods (.). The <br>
same separator character must be used consistently in an
address. The following three lines are valid lines of an
ethers file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff Broadcast <br>
c0-00-ff-ff-ff-ff TR_broadcast <br>
00.00.00.00.00.00 Zero_broadcast</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The global ethers file is looked
for in the /etc directory on UNIX-compatible systems, and in
the main installation directory (for example, C:Program
FilesWireshark) on <br>
Windows systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The personal ethers file is
looked for in the same directory as the personal preferences
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Capture filter name resolution
is handled by libpcap on UNIX-compatible systems and WinPcap
on Windows. As such the Wireshark personal ethers file will
not be consulted for <br>
capture filter name resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name Resolution (manuf) <br>
The manuf file is used to match the 3-byte vendor portion of
a 6-byte hardware address with the manufacturer&rsquo;s
name; it can also contain well-known MAC addresses and
address <br>
ranges specified with a netmask. The format of the file is
the same as the ethers files, except that entries of the
form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">00:00:0C Cisco</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">can be provided, with the 3-byte
OUI and the name for a vendor, and entries such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">00-00-0C-07-AC/40
All-HSRP-routers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">can be specified, with a MAC
address and a mask indicating how many bits of the address
must match. The above entry, for example, has 40 significant
bits, or 5 bytes, and <br>
would match addresses from 00-00-0C-07-AC-00 through
00-00-0C-07-AC-FF. The mask need not be a multiple of 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The manuf file is looked for in
the same directory as the global preferences file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name Resolution (ipxnets) <br>
The ipxnets files are used to correlate 4-byte IPX network
numbers to names. First the global ipxnets file is tried and
if that address is not found there the personal one is <br>
tried next.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format is the same as the
ethers file, except that each address is four bytes instead
of six. Additionally, the address can be represented as a
single hexadecimal <br>
number, as is more common in the IPX world, rather than four
hex octets. For example, these four lines are valid lines of
an ipxnets file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C0.A8.2C.00 HR <br>
c0-a8-1c-00 CEO <br>
00:00:BE:EF IT_Server1 <br>
110f FileServer3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The global ipxnets file is
looked for in the /etc directory on UNIX-compatible systems,
and in the main installation directory (for example,
C:Program FilesWireshark) on <br>
Windows systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The personal ipxnets file is
looked for in the same directory as the personal preferences
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
WIRESHARK_DEBUG_EP_NO_CHUNKS <br>
Normally per-packet memory is allocated in large
&quot;chunks.&quot; This behavior doesn&rsquo;t work well
with debugging tools such as Valgrind or ElectricFence.
Export this environment <br>
variable to force individual allocations. Note: disabling
chunks also disables canaries (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WIRESHARK_DEBUG_SE_NO_CHUNKS
<br>
Normally per-file memory is allocated in large
&quot;chunks.&quot; This behavior doesn&rsquo;t work well
with debugging tools such as Valgrind or ElectricFence.
Export this environment <br>
variable to force individual allocations. Note: disabling
chunks also disables canaries (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WIRESHARK_DEBUG_EP_NO_CANARY
<br>
Normally per-packet memory allocations are separated by
&quot;canaries&quot; which allow detection of memory
overruns. This comes at the expense of some extra memory
usage. Exporting <br>
this environment variable disables these canaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WIRESHARK_DEBUG_SE_USE_CANARY
<br>
Exporting this environment variable causes per-file memory
allocations to be protected with &quot;canaries&quot; which
allow for detection of memory overruns. This comes at the
<br>
expense of significant extra memory usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WIRESHARK_DEBUG_SCRUB_MEMORY
<br>
If this environment variable is set, the contents of
per-packet and per-file memory is initialized to 0xBADDCAFE
when the memory is allocated and is reset to 0xDEADBEEF when
<br>
the memory is freed. This functionality is useful mainly to
developers looking for bugs in the way memory is
handled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WIRESHARK_DEBUG_WMEM_OVERRIDE
<br>
Setting this environment variable forces the wmem framework
to use the specified allocator backend for *all*
allocations, regardless of which backend is normally
specified by <br>
the code. This is mainly useful to developers when testing
or debugging. See README.wmem in the source distribution for
details.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY
<br>
This environment variable causes the plugins and other data
files to be loaded from the build directory (where the
program was compiled) rather than from the standard <br>
locations. It has no effect when the program in question is
running with root (or setuid) permissions on *NIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WIRESHARK_DATA_DIR <br>
This environment variable causes the various data files to
be loaded from a directory other than the standard
locations. It has no effect when the program in question is
<br>
running with root (or setuid) permissions on *NIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WIRESHARK_PYTHON_DIR <br>
This environment variable points to an alternate location
for Python. It has no effect when the program in question is
running with root (or setuid) permissions on *NIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERF_RECORDS_TO_CHECK <br>
This environment variable controls the number of ERF records
checked when deciding if a file really is in the ERF format.
Setting this environment variable a number higher <br>
than the default (20) would make false positives less
likely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPFIX_RECORDS_TO_CHECK <br>
This environment variable controls the number of IPFIX
records checked when deciding if a file really is in the
IPFIX format. Setting this environment variable a number
<br>
higher than the default (20) would make false positives less
likely.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_DISSECTOR_BUG
<br>
If this environment variable is set, Rawshark will call
abort(3) when a dissector bug is encountered. abort(3) will
cause the program to exit abnormally; if you are running
<br>
Rawshark in a debugger, it should halt in the debugger and
allow inspection of the process, and, if you are not running
it in a debugger, it will, on some OSes, assuming your <br>
environment is configured correctly, generate a core dump
file. This can be useful to developers attempting to
troubleshoot a problem with a protocol dissector.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WIRESHARK_EP_VERIFY_POINTERS
<br>
This environment variable, if set, causes certain uses of
pointers to be audited to ensure they do not point to memory
that is deallocated after each packet has been fully <br>
dissected. This can be useful to developers writing or
auditing code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WIRESHARK_SE_VERIFY_POINTERS
<br>
This environment variable, if set, causes certain uses of
pointers to be audited to ensure they do not point to memory
that is deallocated after when a capture file is <br>
closed. This can be useful to developers writing or auditing
code.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_OUT_OF_MEMORY
<br>
This environment variable, if present, causes abort(3) to be
called if certain out-of-memory conditions (which normally
result in an exception and an explanatory error <br>
message) are experienced. This can be useful to developers
debugging out-of-memory conditions.</p>
