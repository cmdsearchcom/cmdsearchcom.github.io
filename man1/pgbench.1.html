<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pgbench - run a benchmark test on PostgreSQL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pgbench -i [option...] [dbname]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pgbench [option...] [dbname]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pgbench is a simple program for running benchmark tests on
PostgreSQL. It runs the same sequence of SQL commands over
and over, possibly in multiple concurrent database sessions,
<br>
and then calculates the average transaction rate
(transactions per second). By default, pgbench tests a
scenario that is loosely based on TPC-B, involving five
SELECT, UPDATE, <br>
and INSERT commands per transaction. However, it is easy to
test other cases by writing your own transaction script
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typical output from pgbench
looks like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">transaction type: TPC-B (sort
of) <br>
scaling factor: 10 <br>
query mode: simple <br>
number of clients: 10 <br>
number of threads: 1 <br>
number of transactions per client: 1000 <br>
number of transactions actually processed: 10000/10000 <br>
tps = 85.184871 (including connections establishing) <br>
tps = 85.296346 (excluding connections establishing)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first six lines report some
of the most important parameter settings. The next line
reports the number of transactions completed and intended
(the latter being just the <br>
product of number of clients and number of transactions per
client); these will be equal unless the run failed before
completion. (In -T mode, only the actual number of <br>
transactions is printed.) The last two lines report the
number of transactions per second, figured with and without
counting the time to start database sessions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default TPC-B-like
transaction test requires specific tables to be set up
beforehand. pgbench should be invoked with the -i
(initialize) option to create and populate these <br>
tables. (When you are testing a custom script, you
don&rsquo;t need this step, but will instead need to do
whatever setup your test needs.) Initialization looks
like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pgbench -i [ other-options ]
dbname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where dbname is the name of the
already-created database to test in. (You may also need -h,
-p, and/or -U options to specify how to connect to the
database server.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution <br>
pgbench -i creates four tables pgbench_accounts,
pgbench_branches, pgbench_history, and pgbench_tellers,
destroying any existing tables of these names. Be very
careful to use <br>
another database if you have tables having these names!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the default &acirc;scale
factor&acirc; of 1, the tables initially contain this many
rows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">table # of rows <br>
--------------------------------- <br>
pgbench_branches 1 <br>
pgbench_tellers 10 <br>
pgbench_accounts 100000 <br>
pgbench_history 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can (and, for most purposes,
probably should) increase the number of rows by using the -s
(scale factor) option. The -F (fillfactor) option might also
be used at this point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you have done the necessary
setup, you can run your benchmark with a command that
doesn&rsquo;t include -i, that is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pgbench [ options ] dbname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In nearly all cases,
you&rsquo;ll need some options to make a useful test. The
most important options are -c (number of clients), -t
(number of transactions), -T (time limit), and -f <br>
(specify a custom script file). See below for a full
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following is divided into three subsections: Different
options are used during database initialization and while
running benchmarks, some options are useful in both
cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Initialization Options <br>
pgbench accepts the following command-line initialization
arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i <br>
Required to invoke initialization mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F fillfactor <br>
Create the pgbench_accounts, pgbench_tellers and
pgbench_branches tables with the given fillfactor. Default
is 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s scale_factor <br>
Multiply the number of rows generated by the scale factor.
For example, -s 100 will create 10,000,000 rows in the
pgbench_accounts table. Default is 1.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--index-tablespace=index_tablespace
<br>
Create indexes in the specified tablespace, rather than the
default tablespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tablespace=tablespace <br>
Create tables in the specified tablespace, rather than the
default tablespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unlogged-tables <br>
Create all tables as unlogged tables, rather than permanent
tables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Benchmarking Options <br>
pgbench accepts the following command-line benchmarking
arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c clients <br>
Number of clients simulated, that is, number of concurrent
database sessions. Default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C <br>
Establish a new connection for each transaction, rather than
doing it just once per client session. This is useful to
measure the connection overhead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d <br>
Print debugging output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D varname=value <br>
Define a variable for use by a custom script (see below).
Multiple -D options are allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filename <br>
Read transaction script from filename. See below for
details. -N, -S, and -f are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j threads <br>
Number of worker threads within pgbench. Using more than one
thread can be helpful on multi-CPU machines. The number of
clients must be a multiple of the number of threads, <br>
since each thread is given the same number of client
sessions to manage. Default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l <br>
Write the time taken by each transaction to a log file. See
below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M querymode <br>
Protocol to use for submitting queries to the server:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; simple: use
simple query protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; extended: use
extended query protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; prepared: use
extended query protocol with prepared statements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is simple query
protocol. (See Chapter 46, Frontend/Backend Protocol, in the
documentation for more information.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n <br>
Perform no vacuuming before running the test. This option is
necessary if you are running a custom test scenario that
does not include the standard tables pgbench_accounts, <br>
pgbench_branches, pgbench_history, and pgbench_tellers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N <br>
Do not update pgbench_tellers and pgbench_branches. This
will avoid update contention on these tables, but it makes
the test case even less like TPC-B.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r <br>
Report the average per-statement latency (execution time
from the perspective of the client) of each command after
the benchmark finishes. See below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s scale_factor <br>
Report the specified scale factor in pgbench&rsquo;s output.
With the built-in tests, this is not necessary; the correct
scale factor will be detected by counting the number of <br>
rows in the pgbench_branches table. However, when testing
custom benchmarks (-f option), the scale factor will be
reported as 1 unless this option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S <br>
Perform select-only transactions instead of TPC-B-like
test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t transactions <br>
Number of transactions each client runs. Default is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T seconds <br>
Run the test for this many seconds, rather than a fixed
number of transactions per client. -t and -T are mutually
exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
Vacuum all four standard tables before running the test.
With neither -n nor -v, pgbench will vacuum the
pgbench_tellers and pgbench_branches tables, and will
truncate <br>
pgbench_history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Common Options <br>
pgbench accepts the following command-line common
arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h hostname <br>
The database server&rsquo;s host name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
The database server&rsquo;s port number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U login <br>
The user name to connect as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print the pgbench version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Show help about pgbench command line arguments, and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
What is the &acirc;Transaction&acirc; Actually Performed in
pgbench? <br>
The default transaction script issues seven commands per
transaction:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. BEGIN;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. UPDATE pgbench_accounts SET
abalance = abalance + :delta WHERE aid = :aid;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. SELECT abalance FROM
pgbench_accounts WHERE aid = :aid;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. UPDATE pgbench_tellers SET
tbalance = tbalance + :delta WHERE tid = :tid;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. UPDATE pgbench_branches SET
bbalance = bbalance + :delta WHERE bid = :bid;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. INSERT INTO pgbench_history
(tid, bid, aid, delta, mtime) VALUES (:tid, :bid, :aid,
:delta, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. END;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify -N, steps 4 and 5
aren&rsquo;t included in the transaction. If you specify -S,
only the SELECT is issued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Custom Scripts <br>
pgbench has support for running custom benchmark scenarios
by replacing the default transaction script (described
above) with a transaction script read from a file (-f
option). <br>
In this case a &acirc;transaction&acirc; counts as one
execution of a script file. You can even specify multiple
scripts (multiple -f options), in which case a random one of
the scripts is <br>
chosen each time a client session starts a new
transaction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of a script file is
one SQL command per line; multiline SQL commands are not
supported. Empty lines and lines beginning with -- are
ignored. Script file lines can also <br>
be &acirc;meta commands&acirc;, which are interpreted by
pgbench itself, as described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a simple
variable-substitution facility for script files. Variables
can be set by the command-line -D option, explained above,
or by the meta commands explained below. <br>
In addition to any variables preset by -D command-line
options, the variable scale is preset to the current scale
factor. Once set, a variable&rsquo;s value can be inserted
into a SQL <br>
command by writing :variablename. When running more than one
client session, each session has its own set of
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Script file meta commands begin
with a backslash (. Arguments to a meta command are
separated by white space. These meta commands are
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">varname operand1 [ operator
operand2 ] <br>
Sets variable varname to a calculated integer value. Each
operand is either an integer constant or a :variablename
reference to a variable having an integer value. The <br>
operator can be +, -, *, or /.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntellers 10 * :scale</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">random varname min max <br>
Sets variable varname to a random integer value between the
limits min and max inclusive. Each limit can be either an
integer constant or a :variablename reference to a <br>
variable having an integer value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">random aid 1 :naccounts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ep number [ us | ms | s ] <br>
Causes script execution to sleep for the specified duration
in microseconds (us), milliseconds (ms) or seconds (s). If
the unit is omitted then seconds are the default. <br>
number can be either an integer constant or a :variablename
reference to a variable having an integer value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ep 10 ms</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell varname command [ argument
... ] <br>
Sets variable varname to the result of the shell command
command. The command must return an integer value through
its standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">argument can be either a text
constant or a :variablename reference to a variable of any
types. If you want to use argument starting with colons, you
need to add an <br>
additional colon at the beginning of argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell variable_to_be_assigned
command literal_argument :variable
::literal_starting_with_colon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ll command [ argument ... ] <br>
Same as shell, but the result is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ll command literal_argument
:variable ::literal_starting_with_colon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example, the full
definition of the built-in TPC-B-like transaction is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nbranches :scale <br>
ntellers 10 * :scale <br>
naccounts 100000 * :scale <br>
random aid 1 :naccounts <br>
random bid 1 :nbranches <br>
random tid 1 :ntellers <br>
random delta -5000 5000 <br>
BEGIN; <br>
UPDATE pgbench_accounts SET abalance = abalance + :delta
WHERE aid = :aid; <br>
SELECT abalance FROM pgbench_accounts WHERE aid = :aid; <br>
UPDATE pgbench_tellers SET tbalance = tbalance + :delta
WHERE tid = :tid; <br>
UPDATE pgbench_branches SET bbalance = bbalance + :delta
WHERE bid = :bid; <br>
INSERT INTO pgbench_history (tid, bid, aid, delta, mtime)
VALUES (:tid, :bid, :aid, :delta, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP); <br>
END;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This script allows each
iteration of the transaction to reference different,
randomly-chosen rows. (This example also shows why
it&rsquo;s important for each client session to have its
<br>
own variables &acirc; otherwise they&rsquo;d not be
independently touching different rows.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Per-Transaction Logging <br>
With the -l option, pgbench writes the time taken by each
transaction to a log file. The log file will be named
pgbench_log.nnn, where nnn is the PID of the pgbench
process. If <br>
the -j option is 2 or higher, creating multiple worker
threads, each will have its own log file. The first worker
will use the same name for its log file as in the standard
<br>
single worker case. The additional log files for the other
workers will be named pgbench_log.nnn.mmm, where mmm is a
sequential number for each worker starting with 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the log is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">client_id transaction_no time
file_no time_epoch time_us</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where time is the total elapsed
transaction time in microseconds, file_no identifies which
script file was used (useful when multiple scripts were
specified with -f), and <br>
time_epoch/time_us are a UNIX epoch format timestamp and an
offset in microseconds (suitable for creating an ISO 8601
timestamp with fractional seconds) showing when the <br>
transaction completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are example outputs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 199 2241 0 1175850568 995598
<br>
0 200 2465 0 1175850568 998079 <br>
0 201 2513 0 1175850569 608 <br>
0 202 2038 0 1175850569 2663</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Per-Statement Latencies <br>
With the -r option, pgbench collects the elapsed transaction
time of each statement executed by every client. It then
reports an average of those values, referred to as the <br>
latency for each statement, after the benchmark has
finished.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the default script, the
output will look similar to this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">starting vacuum...end. <br>
transaction type: TPC-B (sort of) <br>
scaling factor: 1 <br>
query mode: simple <br>
number of clients: 10 <br>
number of threads: 1 <br>
number of transactions per client: 1000 <br>
number of transactions actually processed: 10000/10000 <br>
tps = 618.764555 (including connections establishing) <br>
tps = 622.977698 (excluding connections establishing) <br>

0.001310 random aid 1 :naccounts <br>
0.001073 random bid 1 :nbranches <br>
0.001005 random tid 1 :ntellers <br>
0.001078 random delta -5000 5000 <br>
0.326152 BEGIN; <br>
0.603376 UPDATE pgbench_accounts SET abalance = abalance +
:delta WHERE aid = :aid; <br>
0.454643 SELECT abalance FROM pgbench_accounts WHERE aid =
:aid; <br>
5.528491 UPDATE pgbench_tellers SET tbalance = tbalance +
:delta WHERE tid = :tid; <br>
7.335435 UPDATE pgbench_branches SET bbalance = bbalance +
:delta WHERE bid = :bid; <br>
0.371851 INSERT INTO pgbench_history (tid, bid, aid, delta,
mtime) VALUES (:tid, :bid, :aid, :delta, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
<br>
1.212976 END;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multiple script files are
specified, the averages are reported separately for each
script file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that collecting the
additional timing information needed for per-statement
latency computation adds some overhead. This will slow
average execution speed and lower the <br>
computed TPS. The amount of slowdown varies significantly
depending on platform and hardware. Comparing average TPS
values with and without latency reporting enabled is a good
<br>
way to measure if the timing overhead is significant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Good Practices <br>
It is very easy to use pgbench to produce completely
meaningless numbers. Here are some guidelines to help you
get useful results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the first place, never
believe any test that runs for only a few seconds. Use the
-t or -T option to make the run last at least a few minutes,
so as to average out noise. In <br>
some cases you could need hours to get numbers that are
reproducible. It&rsquo;s a good idea to try the test run a
few times, to find out if your numbers are reproducible or
not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the default TPC-B-like test
scenario, the initialization scale factor (-s) should be at
least as large as the largest number of clients you intend
to test (-c); else you&rsquo;ll <br>
mostly be measuring update contention. There are only -s
rows in the pgbench_branches table, and every transaction
wants to update one of them, so -c values in excess of -s
will <br>
undoubtedly result in lots of transactions blocked waiting
for other transactions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default test scenario is
also quite sensitive to how long it&rsquo;s been since the
tables were initialized: accumulation of dead rows and dead
space in the tables changes the <br>
results. To understand the results you must keep track of
the total number of updates and when vacuuming happens. If
autovacuum is enabled it can result in unpredictable changes
<br>
in measured performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A limitation of pgbench is that
it can itself become the bottleneck when trying to test a
large number of client sessions. This can be alleviated by
running pgbench on a <br>
different machine from the database server, although low
network latency will be essential. It might even be useful
to run several pgbench instances concurrently, on several
<br>
client machines, against the same database server.</p>
