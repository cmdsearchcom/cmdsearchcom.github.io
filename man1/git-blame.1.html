<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-blame - Show what revision and author last modified each
line of a file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git blame [-c] [-b] [-l] [--root] [-t] [-f] [-n] [-s] [-e]
[-p] [-w] [--incremental] [-L n,m] <br>
[-S &lt;revs-file&gt;] [-M] [-C] [-C] [-C]
[--since=&lt;date&gt;] [--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;] <br>
[&lt;rev&gt; | --contents &lt;file&gt; | --reverse
&lt;rev&gt;] [--] &lt;file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Annotates each line in the given file with information from
the revision which last modified the line. Optionally, start
annotating from the given revision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command can also limit the
range of lines annotated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The origin of lines is
automatically followed across whole-file renames (currently
there is no option to turn the rename-following off). To
follow lines moved from one file to <br>
another, or to follow lines that were copied and pasted from
another file, etc., see the -C and -M options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The report does not tell you
anything about lines which have been deleted or replaced;
you need to use a tool such as git diff or the
&quot;pickaxe&quot; interface briefly mentioned in the <br>
following paragraph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Apart from supporting file
annotation, Git also supports searching the development
history for when a code snippet occurred in a change. This
makes it possible to track when a <br>
code snippet was added to a file, moved or copied between
files, and eventually deleted or replaced. It works by
searching for a text string in the diff. A small
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git log --pretty=oneline
-S&rsquo;blame_usage&rsquo; <br>
5040f17eba15504bad66b14a645bddd9b015ebb7 blame -S
&lt;ancestry-file&gt; <br>
ea4c7f9bf69e781dd0cd88d2bccb2bf5cc15c9a7 git-blame: Make the
output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b <br>
Show blank SHA-1 for boundary commits. This can also be
controlled via the blame.blankboundary config option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--root <br>
Do not treat root commits as boundaries. This can also be
controlled via the blame.showroot config option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-stats <br>
Include additional statistics at the end of blame
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L &lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt;
<br>
Annotate only the given line range. &lt;start&gt; and
&lt;end&gt; can take one of these forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &lt;start&gt; or &lt;end&gt;
is a number, it specifies an absolute line number (lines
count from 1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; /regex/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This form will use the first
line matching the given POSIX regex. If &lt;end&gt; is a
regex, it will search starting at the line given by
&lt;start&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; +offset or
-offset</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is only valid for
&lt;end&gt; and will specify a number of lines before or
after the line given by &lt;start&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l <br>
Show long rev (Default: off).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t <br>
Show raw timestamp (Default: off).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S &lt;revs-file&gt; <br>
Use revisions from revs-file instead of calling
git-rev-list(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reverse <br>
Walk history forward instead of backward. Instead of showing
the revision in which a line appeared, this shows the last
revision in which a line has existed. This requires a <br>
range of revision like START..END where the path to blame
exists in START.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --porcelain <br>
Show in a format designed for machine consumption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--line-porcelain <br>
Show the porcelain format, but output commit information for
each line, not just the first time a commit is referenced.
Implies --porcelain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--incremental <br>
Show the result incrementally in a format designed for
machine consumption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--encoding=&lt;encoding&gt; <br>
Specifies the encoding used to output author names and
commit summaries. Setting it to none makes blame output
unconverted data. For more information see the discussion
about <br>
encoding in the git-log(1) manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--contents &lt;file&gt; <br>
When &lt;rev&gt; is not specified, the command annotates the
changes starting backwards from the working tree copy. This
flag makes the command pretend as if the working tree copy
<br>
has the contents of the named file (specify - to make the
command read from the standard input).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--date &lt;format&gt; <br>
The value is one of the following alternatives:
{relative,local,default,iso,rfc,short}. If --date is not
provided, the value of the blame.date config variable is
used. If the <br>
blame.date config variable is also not set, the iso format
is used. For more information, See the discussion of the
--date option at git-log(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M|&lt;num&gt;| <br>
Detect moved or copied lines within a file. When a commit
moves or copies a block of lines (e.g. the original file has
A and then B, and the commit changes it to B and then <br>
A), the traditional blame algorithm notices only half of the
movement and typically blames the lines that were moved up
(i.e. B) to the parent and assigns blame to the lines <br>
that were moved down (i.e. A) to the child commit. With this
option, both groups of lines are blamed on the parent by
running extra passes of inspection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;num&gt; is optional but it
is the lower bound on the number of alphanumeric characters
that Git must detect as moving/copying within a file for it
to associate those lines with <br>
the parent commit. The default value is 20.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C|&lt;num&gt;| <br>
In addition to -M, detect lines moved or copied from other
files that were modified in the same commit. This is useful
when you reorganize your program and move code around <br>
across files. When this option is given twice, the command
additionally looks for copies from other files in the commit
that creates the file. When this option is given three <br>
times, the command additionally looks for copies from other
files in any commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;num&gt; is optional but it
is the lower bound on the number of alphanumeric characters
that Git must detect as moving/copying between files for it
to associate those lines with <br>
the parent commit. And the default value is 40. If there are
more than one -C options given, the &lt;num&gt; argument of
the last -C will take effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
Show help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c <br>
Use the same output mode as git-annotate(1) (Default:
off).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--score-debug <br>
Include debugging information related to the movement of
lines between files (see -C) and lines moved within a file
(see -M). The first number listed is the score. This is <br>
the number of alphanumeric characters detected as having
been moved between or within files. This must be above a
certain threshold for git blame to consider those lines of
<br>
code to have been moved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --show-name <br>
Show the filename in the original commit. By default the
filename is shown if there is any line that came from a file
with a different name, due to rename detection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --show-number <br>
Show the line number in the original commit (Default:
off).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s <br>
Suppress the author name and timestamp from the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --show-email <br>
Show the author email instead of author name (Default:
off).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w <br>
Ignore whitespace when comparing the parent&acirc;s version
and the child&acirc;s to find where the lines came from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--abbrev=&lt;n&gt; <br>
Instead of using the default 7+1 hexadecimal digits as the
abbreviated object name, use &lt;n&gt;+1 digits. Note that 1
column is used for a caret to mark the boundary commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE PORCELAIN FORMAT <br>
In this format, each line is output after a header; the
header at the minimum has the first line which has:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 40-byte SHA-1 of
the commit the line is attributed to;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the line number
of the line in the original file;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the line number
of the line in the final file;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; on a line that
starts a group of lines from a different commit than the
previous one, the number of lines in this group. On
subsequent lines this field is absent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This header line is followed by
the following information at least once for each commit:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the author name
(&quot;author&quot;), email (&quot;author-mail&quot;), time
(&quot;author-time&quot;), and timezone
(&quot;author-tz&quot;); similarly for committer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the filename in
the commit that the line is attributed to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the first line
of the commit log message (&quot;summary&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The contents of the actual line
is output after the above header, prefixed by a TAB. This is
to allow adding more header elements later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The porcelain format generally
suppresses commit information that has already been seen.
For example, two lines that are blamed to the same commit
will both be shown, but the <br>
details for that commit will be shown only once. This is
more efficient, but may require more state be kept by the
reader. The --line-porcelain option can be used to output
full <br>
commit information for each line, allowing simpler (but less
efficient) usage like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># count the number of lines
attributed to each author <br>
git blame --line-porcelain file | <br>
sed -n &rsquo;s/^author //p&rsquo; | <br>
sort | uniq -c | sort -rn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPECIFYING RANGES <br>
Unlike git blame and git annotate in older versions of git,
the extent of the annotation can be limited to both line
ranges and revision ranges. When you are interested in <br>
finding the origin for lines 40-60 for file foo, you can use
the -L option like so (they mean the same thing &acirc; both
ask for 21 lines starting at line 40):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git blame -L 40,60 foo <br>
git blame -L 40,+21 foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also you can use a regular
expression to specify the line range:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git blame -L &rsquo;/^sub hello
{/,/^}$/&rsquo; foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which limits the annotation to
the body of the hello subroutine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you are not interested in
changes older than version v2.6.18, or changes older than 3
weeks, you can use revision range specifiers similar to git
rev-list:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git blame v2.6.18.. -- foo <br>
git blame --since=3.weeks -- foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When revision range specifiers
are used to limit the annotation, lines that have not
changed since the range boundary (either the commit v2.6.18
or the most recent commit that is <br>
more than 3 weeks old in the above example) are blamed for
that range boundary commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A particularly useful way is to
see if an added file has lines created by copy-and-paste
from existing files. Sometimes this indicates that the
developer was being sloppy and did <br>
not refactor the code properly. You can first find the
commit that introduced the file with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git log --diff-filter=A
--pretty=short -- foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and then annotate the change
between the commit and its parents, using commit^!
notation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git blame -C -C -f $commit^! --
foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INCREMENTAL OUTPUT <br>
When called with --incremental option, the command outputs
the result as it is built. The output generally will talk
about lines touched by more recent commits first (i.e. the
<br>
lines will be annotated out of order) and is meant to be
used by interactive viewers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output format is similar to
the Porcelain format, but it does not contain the actual
lines from the file that is being annotated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Each blame entry always
starts with a line of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;40-byte hex sha1&gt;
&lt;sourceline&gt; &lt;resultline&gt; &lt;num_lines&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Line numbers count from 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The first time that a commit
shows up in the stream, it has various other information
about it printed out with a one-word tag at the beginning of
each line describing the <br>
extra commit information (author, email, committer, dates,
summary, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Unlike the Porcelain format,
the filename information is always given and terminates the
entry:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;filename&quot;
&lt;whitespace-quoted-filename-goes-here&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and thus it is really quite easy
to parse for some line- and word-oriented parser (which
should be quite natural for most scripting languages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
For people who do parsing: to make it more robust, just
ignore any lines between the first and last one
(&quot;&lt;sha1&gt;&quot; and &quot;filename&quot; lines)
where you do not recognize the tag <br>
words (or care about that particular one) at the beginning
of the &quot;extended information&quot; lines. That way, if
there is ever added information (like the commit encoding or
<br>
extended commit commentary), a blame viewer will not
care.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAPPING AUTHORS <br>
If the file .mailmap exists at the toplevel of the
repository, or at the location pointed to by the
mailmap.file or mailmap.blob configuration options, it is
used to map author <br>
and committer names and email addresses to canonical real
names and email addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the simple form, each line in
the file consists of the canonical real name of an author,
whitespace, and an email address used in the commit
(enclosed by &lt; and &gt;) to map to <br>
the name. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Proper Name
&lt;commit@email.xx&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The more complex forms are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;proper@email.xx&gt;
&lt;commit@email.xx&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which allows mailmap to replace
only the email part of a commit, and:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Proper Name
&lt;proper@email.xx&gt; &lt;commit@email.xx&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which allows mailmap to replace
both the name and the email of a commit matching the
specified commit email address, and:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Proper Name
&lt;proper@email.xx&gt; Commit Name
&lt;commit@email.xx&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which allows mailmap to replace
both the name and the email of a commit matching both the
specified commit name and email address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 1: Your history contains
commits by two authors, Jane and Joe, whose names appear in
the repository under several forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Joe Developer
&lt;joe@example.com&gt; <br>
Joe R. Developer &lt;joe@example.com&gt; <br>
Jane Doe &lt;jane@example.com&gt; <br>
Jane Doe &lt;jane@laptop.(none)&gt; <br>
Jane D. &lt;jane@desktop.(none)&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now suppose that Joe wants his
middle name initial used, and Jane prefers her family name
fully spelled out. A proper .mailmap file would look
like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Jane Doe
&lt;jane@desktop.(none)&gt; <br>
Joe R. Developer &lt;joe@example.com&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note how there is no need for an
entry for &lt;jane@laptop.(none)&gt;, because the real name
of that author is already correct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 2: Your repository
contains commits from the following authors:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nick1 &lt;bugs@company.xx&gt;
<br>
nick2 &lt;bugs@company.xx&gt; <br>
nick2 &lt;nick2@company.xx&gt; <br>
santa &lt;me@company.xx&gt; <br>
claus &lt;me@company.xx&gt; <br>
CTO &lt;cto@coompany.xx&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then you might want a .mailmap
file that looks like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;cto@company.xx&gt;
&lt;cto@coompany.xx&gt; <br>
Some Dude &lt;some@dude.xx&gt; nick1 &lt;bugs@company.xx&gt;
<br>
Other Author &lt;other@author.xx&gt; nick2
&lt;bugs@company.xx&gt; <br>
Other Author &lt;other@author.xx&gt;
&lt;nick2@company.xx&gt; <br>
Santa Claus &lt;santa.claus@northpole.xx&gt;
&lt;me@company.xx&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use hash # for comments that are
either on their own line, or after the email address.</p>
