<p>SceneViewer(1) General Commands Manual
SceneViewer(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
SceneViewer - 3d editor and viewer for Inventor scenes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
SceneViewer [-e env_file] [file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
SceneViewer is a program for viewing and interacting with
Inventor scene graph files (the SGI 3D file format
standard). SceneViewer was written to demonstrate Inventor
features, <br>
and serves as the basis for the IRIS Explorer Render
Module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When SceneViewer is run, a
window appears containing the Inventor examiner viewer and a
menu bar. The viewer allows the user to interactively change
the view of the scene through <br>
direct manipulation, or indirect slider and push button
controls. The menu bar contains the following menus:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File <br>
This menu supports file reading and writing, and launches a
dialog for printing to a printer or to PostScript file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Edit <br>
This menu enables copy and paste of 3D data, selecting all
objects, and deleting the currently selected objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Viewing <br>
This menu controls viewing options. It allows different
viewing paradigms to be employed: the examiner viewer which
provides a virtual trackball interface, the fly- <br>
through viewer for traveling through expansive data sets,
the walk viewer for architectural walk-throughs, and the
plane viewer for orthographic projections. The menu <br>
also enables different types of transparency, fog effects,
antialiasing, and background color controls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selection <br>
This menu allows the different selection policies to be
demonstrated. A selection policy determines how objects get
added and removed from the collection of selected <br>
objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Editors <br>
This menu launches the material editor and transform
sliders. An object must be selected for the menu to be
active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Manips <br>
This menu allows different manipulators to act on the
current selection, including the trackball, handle box,
jack, center ball, and transform box. Manipulators can also
<br>
be turned off, in which case selected objects are surrounded
with a red wireframe box highlight.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lights <br>
This menu allows directional, point, and spot lights to be
created and edited. It also allows lights to be turned on
and off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information on how to
use the viewers and editors employed by the scene viewer,
please see SceneViewer&rsquo;s runtime help cards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOURCE CODE <br>
Note that the source code to SceneViewer comes with the Open
Inventor 3d Toolkit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following command line options are allowed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e env_file <br>
Read the passed environment file, and use the lights,
camera, and environment settings found there.</p>
