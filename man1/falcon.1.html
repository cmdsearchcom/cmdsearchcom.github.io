<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
falcon - The Falcon Programming Language command line
interpreter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
falcon [options] [main_script] [script_options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The falcon command line interpreter is used to launch,
compile, assemble or debug scripts written in the Falcon
Programming Language. The command line interpreter pushes
the core <br>
module and the rtl module in the script load table, so they
are available by default to all the scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default operation is that of
launching the given script, or read it from the standard
input if the script name is not given. By default, falcon
saves also the compiled module <br>
of the script in the same directory where it is found,
changing the extension to &quot;.fam&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main_script can be a
&quot;logical&quot; module name, a relative path or an
absolute path. In case it&rsquo;s a logical module name,
that is, a script name without extension nor leading <br>
path, it is searched through the load path. The default load
path is determined by the compilation options of the
interpreter, and usually it includes the current directory.
The <br>
environment variable FALCON_LOAD_PATH and the command line
option -L can change the default module search path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the main module is found,
its path is added to the module search path; in other words,
there isn&rsquo;t any need to specify the path containing
the main module to have other mod&acirc; <br>
ules in its same directory to get loaded. The main module
and other source Falcon module it loads can be stored in a
directory that is not listed in the module search path;
indi&acirc; <br>
cating an absolute or relative path as the main_script
parameter will add that path on top of the active search
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If not differently specified,
falcon will search for .fam modules newer than the relative
.fal source scripts and will load those ones instead of
compiling the sources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options past the script name
will be directly passed in the args[] global variable of the
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interpreter is compatible
with the UNIX script execution directive &quot;#!&quot;. A
main script can have on the very first line of the code the
directive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/path/to/falcon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to declare to the shell that the
falcon command line is to be loaded. If falcon command line
interpreter is also in the system PATH environment variable,
which is usually the <br>
case of a normal installation, then the interpreter
directive may also be simply</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/env falcon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is then simply necessary to
make the main script executable with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chmod 744 script_name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to be able to call the script
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scripts executed in this way
will add their path to the falcon module load path as soon
as they are loade, so other modules referenced by them will
be searched in the directory <br>
where they resides before being searched elsewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options to the falcon compiler
may be passed normally by writing them after the execution
directive in the main script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since version 0.8.12, the falcon
command line interpreter has also an interactive mode which
accepts statements and provide results as the expressions
are evaluated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c Compile but do not execute. This makes falcon to compile
the given module into a .fam file and then terminate. By
default, the .fam file is written to a file with the <br>
same name as the input one, with the .fam extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Check for memory leaks in VM
execution. Like the -M option of faltest, this function sets
the falcon engine memory allocators to slower functions that
checks for memory to <br>
be allocated and deallocated correctly during the execution
of a module. If the script is executed, before Falcon exits
it writes a small report to the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d
&lt;directive&gt;=&lt;value&gt; <br>
Sets the given directive to the desired value. Compilation
directives and their values are the ones that scripts can
set through the directive statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D
&lt;constant&gt;=&lt;value&gt; <br>
Sets the given constant to the desired value. Constants are
made available at compile time, and can be employed in macro
and meta compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e &lt;enc&gt; <br>
Set given encoding as default for VM I/O. Unless the scripts
select a different I/O encoding, the streams that are
provided to the falcon VM (like the output stream for <br>
printf) are encoded using the given ISO encoding. This
overrides the default encoding that is detected by reading
the environment settings. In example, if your system uses
<br>
iso-8859-1 encoding by default, but you want your script to
read and write utf-8 files, use the option -e utf-8</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -e option also determines
the default encoding of the source files. To override this,
use -E</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E &lt;enc&gt; <br>
Set source script encoding. As -e , but this determines only
the encoding used by falcon when loading the source scripts.
This options overrides -e values, so it can be <br>
used to set the script encoding when they have to read and
write from different encodings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Force recompilation of
modules even when .fam are found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h or -? <br>
Prints a brief help on stdout and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h or -? <br>
Interactive mode. Falcon interpreter reads language
statements from a prompt and present evaluation results to
the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l &lt;lang_code&gt; <br>
Select a different language code for internationalized
programs. This option loads an alternate string table for
all the modules loaded. If the table doesn&rsquo;t exist or
if <br>
the modules doesn&rsquo;t have a .ftr file containing the
translation, the operation silently files and the original
strings are used instead. Language codes should be in the
<br>
international ISO format of five characters with a language
name, an underscore and the regional code, like in en_US</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L &lt;path&gt; <br>
Changes the default load path. This overrides both the
internal built in settings and the contents of environment
variable FALCON_LOAD_PATH. Each directory in the path <br>
should be separated by &quot;;&quot; and use forward
slashes, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">falcon -L</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Use temporary files for
intermediate steps. By default compilation is completely
performed in memory; this option makes falcon to use
temporary files instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Do NOT save the compiled
modules in &rsquo;.fam&rsquo; files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o &lt;fn&gt; <br>
Redirects output to &lt;fn&gt;. This is useful to control
the output of falcon when using options as -c, -a, -S etc.
If &lt;fn&gt; is a dash (-) the output is sent to
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p &lt;module&gt; <br>
Preloads the given module as if it were loaded by the main
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Ignore default load paths and
uses only the paths set via the -L switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Ignore source files and only
use available .fam. This does not affects the main script;
use the -x option if also the main script is a pre-compiled
.fam module and source <br>
script must be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Produce an assembly output.
Writes an assembly representation of the given script to the
standard output aznd the exit. Use -o to change file
destination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Generates a syntactic tree of
the source and writes it to the standard output, then exits.
The syntactic tree is a representation of the script that is
known by the com&acirc; <br>
piler and used by the generators to create the final code.
This option is useful when debugging the compiler and to
test for the correct working of optimization algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Force input parsing as .ftd
(Falcon Template Document). Normally, only files ending with
&quot;.ftd&quot; (case sensitive) are parsed as template
document; when this switch is <br>
selected, the input is treated as a template document
regardless of its name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Prints copyright notice and
version and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w After execution, requires the
user to confirm program termination by pressing
&lt;enter&gt;. This helps in point &amp; click environments,
where Falcon window is closed as soon as <br>
the program terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Executes a pre-compiled .fam
module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Creates a template file for
internationalization. This option creates a single .ftt file
from a single source, .fam module or binary module. By
default, the name of the <br>
template is the same as the module plus
&quot;.temp.ftt&quot; added at the end; it is possible to
change the destination template file using the -o
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/lib/libfalcon_engine.so <br>
Default location of the Falcon Engine loadable module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/lib/falcon <br>
Default directory containing Falcon binary modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
FALCON_LOAD_PATH <br>
Default search path for modules loaded by the scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FALCON_SRC_ENCODING <br>
Default encoding for the source scripts loaded by falcon
(when different from the system default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FALCON_VM_ENCODING <br>
Default encoding for the VM I/O streams (when different from
system default).</p>
