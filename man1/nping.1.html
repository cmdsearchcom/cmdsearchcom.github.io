<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
nping - Network packet generation tool / ping utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
nping [Options] {targets}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Nping is an open-source tool for network packet generation,
response analysis and response time measurement. Nping
allows users to generate network packets of a wide range of
<br>
protocols, letting them tune virtually any field of the
protocol headers. While Nping can be used as a simple ping
utility to detect active hosts, it can also be used as a raw
<br>
packet generator for network stack stress tests, ARP
poisoning, Denial of Service attacks, route tracing, and
other purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, Nping offers a
special mode of operation called the &quot;Echo Mode&quot;,
that lets users see how the generated probes change in
transit, revealing the differences between <br>
the transmitted packets and the packets received at the
other end. See section &quot;Echo Mode&quot; for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output from Nping is a list
of the packets that are being sent and received. The level
of detail depends on the options used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A typical Nping execution is
shown in Example 1. The only Nping arguments used in this
example are -c, to specify the number of times to target
each host, --tcp to specify TCP <br>
Probe Mode, -p 80,433 to specify the target ports; and then
the two target hostnames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE THE MAN PAGE FOR MANY MORE
OPTIONS, DESCRIPTIONS, AND EXAMPLES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TARGET SPECIFICATION <br>
Everything on the Nping command line that isn&rsquo;t an
option or an option argument is treated as a target host
specification. Nping uses the same syntax for target
specifications <br>
that Nmap does. The simplest case is a single target given
by IP address or hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nping supports CIDR-style.
addressing. You can append /numbits to an IPv4 address or
hostname and Nping will send probes to every IP address for
which the first numbits are the <br>
same as for the reference IP or hostname given. For example,
192.168.10.0/24 would send probes to the 256 hosts between
192.168.10.0 (binary: 11000000 10101000 00001010 00000000)
<br>
and 192.168.10.255 (binary: 11000000 10101000 00001010
11111111), inclusive. 192.168.10.40/24 would ping exactly
the same targets. Given that the host scanme.nmap.org. is at
<br>
the IP address 64.13.134.52, the specification
scanme.nmap.org/16 would send probes to the 65,536 IP
addresses between 64.13.0.0 and 64.13.255.255. The smallest
allowed value is <br>
/0, which targets the whole Internet. The largest value is
/32, which targets just the named host or IP address because
all address bits are fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CIDR notation is short but not
always flexible enough. For example, you might want to send
probes to 192.168.0.0/16 but skip any IPs ending with .0 or
.255 because they may be <br>
used as subnet network and broadcast addresses. Nping
supports this through octet range addressing. Rather than
specify a normal IP address, you can specify a
comma-separated <br>
list of numbers or ranges for each octet. For example,
192.168.0-255.1-254 will skip all addresses in the range
that end in .0 or .255, and 192.168.3-5,7.1 will target the
four <br>
addresses 192.168.3.1, 192.168.4.1, 192.168.5.1, and
192.168.7.1. Either side of a range may be omitted; the
default values are 0 on the left and 255 on the right. Using
- by <br>
itself is the same as 0-255, but remember to use 0- in the
first octet so the target specification doesn&rsquo;t look
like a command-line option. Ranges need not be limited to
the <br>
final octets: the specifier 0-.-.13.37 will send probes to
all IP addresses on the Internet ending in .13.37. This sort
of broad sampling can be useful for Internet surveys and
<br>
research.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPv6 addresses can only be
specified by their fully qualified IPv6 address or hostname.
CIDR and octet ranges aren&rsquo;t supported for IPv6
because they are rarely useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nping accepts multiple host
specifications on the command line, and they don&rsquo;t
need to be the same type. The command nping scanme.nmap.org
192.168.0.0/8 10.0.0,1,3-7.- does what <br>
you would expect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTION SPECIFICATION <br>
Nping is designed to be very flexible and fit a wide variety
of needs. As with most command-line tools, its behavior can
be adjusted using command-line options. These general <br>
principles apply to option arguments, unless stated
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options that take integer
numbers can accept values specified in decimal, octal or
hexadecimal base. When a number starts with 0x, it will be
treated as hexadecimal; when it <br>
simply starts with 0, it will be treated as octal.
Otherwise, Nping will assume the number has been specified
in base 10. Virtually all numbers that can be supplied from
the <br>
command line are unsigned so, as a general rule, the minimum
value is zero. Users may also specify the word random or
rand to make Nping generate a random value within the <br>
expected range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IP addresses may be given as
IPv4 addresses (e.g. 192.168.1.1), IPv6 addresses (e.g.
2001:db8:85a3::8e4c:760:7146), or hostnames, which will be
resolved using the default DNS <br>
server configured in the host system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options that take MAC addresses
accept the usual colon-separated 6 hex byte format (e.g.
00:50:56:d4:01:98). Hyphens may also be used instead of
colons (e.g. <br>
00-50-56-c0-00-08). The special word random or rand sets a
random address and the word broadcast or bcast sets
ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL OPERATION <br>
Unlike other ping and packet generation tools, Nping
supports multiple target host and port specifications. While
this provides great flexibility, it is not obvious how Nping
<br>
handles situations where there is more than one host and/or
more than one port to send probes to. This section explains
how Nping behaves in these cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When multiple target hosts are
specified, Nping rotates among them in round-robin fashion.
This gives slow hosts more time to send their responses
before another probe is sent to <br>
them. Ports are also scheduled using round robin. So, unless
only one port is specified, Nping never sends two probes to
the same target host and port consecutively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The loop around targets is the
&acirc;inner loop&acirc; and the loop around ports is the
&acirc;outer loop&acirc;. All targets will be sent a probe
for a given port before moving on to the next port. <br>
Between probes, Nping waits a configurable amount of time
called the &acirc;inter-probe delay&acirc;, which is
controlled by the --delay option. These examples show how it
works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROBE MODES <br>
Nping supports a wide variety of protocols. Although in some
cases Nping can automatically determine the mode from the
options used, it is generally a good idea to specify it <br>
explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tcp-connect (TCP Connect mode)
. <br>
TCP connect mode is the default mode when a user does not
have raw packet privileges. Instead of writing raw packets
as most other modes do, Nping asks the underlying <br>
operating system to establish a connection with the target
machine and port by issuing the connect system call. This is
the same high-level system call that web browsers, P2P <br>
clients, and most other network-enabled applications use to
establish a connection. It is part of a programming
interface known as the Berkeley Sockets API. Rather than
read <br>
raw packet responses off the wire, Nping uses this API to
obtain status information on each connection attempt. For
this reason, you will not be able to see the contents of
<br>
the packets that are sent or received but only status
information about the TCP connection establishment taking
place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tcp (TCP mode) . <br>
TCP is the mode that lets users create and send any kind of
TCP packet. TCP packets are sent embedded in IP packets that
can also be tuned. This mode can be used for many <br>
different purposes. For example you could try to discover
open ports by sending TCP SYN messages without completing
the three-way handshake. This technique is often referred
<br>
to as half-open scanning, because you don&rsquo;t open a
full TCP connection. You send a SYN packet, as if you are
going to open a real connection and then wait for a
response. A <br>
SYN/ACK indicates the port is open, while a RST indicates
it&rsquo;s closed. If no response is received one could
assume that some intermediate network device is filtering
the <br>
responses. Another use could be to see how a remote TCP/IP
stack behaves when it receives a non-RFC-compliant packet,
like one with both SYN and RST flags set. One could also
<br>
do some evil by creating custom RST packets using an spoofed
IP address with the intent of closing an active TCP
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--udp (UDP mode) . <br>
UDP mode can have two different behaviours. Under normal
circumstances, it lets users create custom IP/UDP packets.
However, if Nping is run by a user without raw packet <br>
privileges and no changes to the default protocol headers
are requested, then Nping enters the unprivileged UDP mode
which basically sends UDP packets to the specified target
<br>
hosts and ports using the sendto system call. Note that in
this unprivileged mode it is not possible to see low-level
header information of the packets on the wire but only <br>
status information about the amount of bytes that are being
transmitted and received. UDP mode can be used to interact
with any UDP-based server. Examples are DNS servers, <br>
streaming servers, online gaming servers, and port
knocking/single-packet. authorization daemons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--icmp (ICMP mode) . <br>
ICMP mode is the default mode when the user runs Nping with
raw packet privileges. Any kind of ICMP message can be
created. The default ICMP type is Echo, i.e., ping. ICMP
<br>
mode can be used for many different purposes, from a simple
request for a timestamp or a netmask to the transmission of
fake destination unreachable messages, custom <br>
redirects, and router advertisements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--arp (ARP/RARP mode) . <br>
ARP lets you create and send a few different ARP-related
packets. These include ARP, RARP, DRARP, and InARP requests
and replies. This mode can ban be used to perform <br>
low-level host discovery, and conduct ARP-cache poisoning
attacks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--traceroute (Traceroute mode) .
<br>
Traceroute is not a mode by itself but a complement to TCP,
UDP, and ICMP modes. When this option is specified Nping
will set the IP TTL value of the first probe to 1. When <br>
the next router receives the packet it will drop it due to
the expiration of the TTL and it will generate an ICMP
destination unreachable message. The next probe will have a
<br>
TTL of 2 so now the first router will forward the packet
while the second router will be the one that drops the
packet and generates the ICMP message. The third probe will
<br>
have a TTL value of 3 and so on. By examining the source
addresses of all those ICMP Destination Unreachable messages
it is possible to determine the path that the probes <br>
take until they reach their final destination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP CONNECT MODE <br>
-p port_spec, --dest-port port_spec (Target ports) . <br>
This option specifies which ports you want to try to connect
to. It can be a single port, a comma-separated list of ports
(e.g. 80,443,8080), a range (e.g. 1-1023), and any <br>
combination of those (e.g. 21-25,80,443,1024-2048). The
beginning and/or end values of a range may be omitted,
causing Nping to use 1 and 65535, respectively. So you can
<br>
specify -p- to target ports from 1 through 65535. Using port
zero is allowed if you specify it explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g portnumber, --source-port
portnumber (Spoof source port) . <br>
This option asks Nping to use the specified port as source
port for the TCP connections. Note that this might not work
on all systems or may require root privileges. <br>
Specified value must be an integer in the range
[0&acirc;65535].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP MODE <br>
-p port_spec, --dest-port port_spec (Target ports) <br>
This option specifies which destination ports you want to
send probes to. It can be a single port, a comma-separated
list of ports (e.g. 80,443,8080), a range (e.g. <br>
1-1023), and any combination of those (e.g.
21-25,80,443,1024-2048). The beginning and/or end values of
a range may be omitted, causing Nping to use 1 and 65535,
<br>
respectively. So you can specify -p- to target ports from 1
through 65535. Using port zero is allowed if you specify it
explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g portnumber, --source-port
portnumber (Spoof source port) <br>
This option asks Nping to use the specified port as source
port for the TCP connections. Note that this might not work
on all systems or may require root privileges. <br>
Specified value must be an integer in the range
[0&acirc;65535].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--seq seqnumber (Sequence
Number) . <br>
Specifies the TCP sequence number. In SYN packets this is
the initial sequence number (ISN). In a normal transmission
this corresponds to the sequence number of the first <br>
byte of data in the segment. seqnumber must be a number in
the range [0&acirc;4294967295].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--flags flags (TCP Flags) . <br>
This option specifies which flags should be set in the TCP
packet. flags may be specified in three different ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. As a comma-separated list of
flags, e.g. --flags syn,ack,rst</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. As a list of one-character
flag initials, e.g. --flags SAR tells Nping to set flags
SYN, ACK, and RST.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. As an 8-bit hexadecimal
number, where the supplied number is the exact value that
will be placed in the flags field of the TCP header. The
number should start with the <br>
prefix 0x and should be in the range [0x00&acirc;0xFF], e.g.
--flags 0x20 sets the URG flag as 0x20 corresponds to binary
00100000 and the URG flag is represented by the third <br>
bit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are 8 possible flags to
set: CWR, ECN, URG, ACK, PSH, RST, SYN, and FIN. The special
value ALL means to set all flags. NONE means to set no
flags. It is important that <br>
if you don&rsquo;t want any flag to be set, you request it
explicitly because in some cases the SYN flag may be set by
default. Here is a brief description of the meaning of each
<br>
flag:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CWR (Congestion Window Reduced)
. <br>
Set by an ECN-Capable sender when it reduces its congestion
window (due to a retransmit timeout, a fast retransmit or in
response to an ECN notification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ECN (Explicit Congestion
Notification) . <br>
During the three-way handshake it indicates that sender is
capable of performing explicit congestion notification.
Normally it means that a packet with the IP Congestion <br>
Experienced flag set was received during normal
transmission. See RFC 3168. for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">URG (Urgent) . <br>
Segment is urgent and the urgent pointer field carries valid
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACK (Acknowledgement) . <br>
The segment carries an acknowledgement and the value of the
acknowledgement number field is valid and contains the next
sequence number that is expected from the <br>
receiver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PSH (Push) . <br>
The data in this segment should be immediately pushed to the
application layer on arrival.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RST (Reset) . <br>
There was some problem and the sender wants to abort the
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYN (Synchronize) . <br>
The segment is a request to synchronize sequence numbers and
establish a connection. The sequence number field contains
the sender&rsquo;s initial sequence number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FIN (Finish) . <br>
The sender wants to close the connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--win size (Window Size) . <br>
Specifies the TCP window size, this is, the number of octets
the sender of the segment is willing to accept from the
receiver at one time. This is usually the size of the <br>
reception buffer that the OS allocates for a given
connection. size must be a number in the range
[0&acirc;65535].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--badsum (Invalid Checksum) .
<br>
Asks Nping to use an invalid TCP checksum for the packets
sent to target hosts. Since virtually all host IP stacks
properly drop these packets, any responses received are <br>
likely coming from a firewall or an IDS that didn&rsquo;t
bother to verify the checksum. For more details on this
technique, see http://nmap.org/p60-12.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UDP MODE <br>
-p port_spec, --dest-port port_spec (Target ports) . <br>
This option specifies which ports you want UDP datagrams to
be sent to. It can be a single port, a comma-separated list
of ports (e.g. 80,443,8080), a range (e.g. 1-1023), <br>
and any combination of those (e.g. 21-25,80,443,1024-2048).
The beginning and/or end values of a range may be omitted,
causing Nping to use 1 and 65535, respectively. So you <br>
can specify -p- to target ports from 1 through 65535. Using
port zero is allowed if you specify it explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g portnumber, --source-port
portnumber (Spoof source port) . <br>
This option asks Nping to use the specified port as source
port for the transmitted datagrams. Note that this might not
work on all systems or may require root privileges. <br>

from a fixed link layer address. DRARP was used mainly in
<br>
Sun Microsystems platforms in the late 90&rsquo;s but now
it&rsquo;s no longer used. See RFC 1931. for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">drarp-reply, drarp-rep, dr <br>
Dynamic RARP Reply (type 6). A DRARP reply is a message sent
in response to a RARP request to provide network layer
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">drarp-error, drarp-err, de <br>
DRARP Error (type 7). DRARP Error messages are usually sent
in response to DRARP requests to inform of some error. In
DRARP Error messages, the Target Protocol Address field <br>
is used to carry an error code (usually in the first byte).
The error code is intended to tell why no target protocol
address is being returned. For more information see RFC <br>
1931.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inarp-request, inarp, i <br>
Inverse ARP Request (type 8). InARP requests are used to
translate a link layer address to a network layer address.
It is similar to RARP request but in this case, the sender
<br>
of the InARP request wants to know the network layer address
of another node, not its own address. InARP is mainly used
in Frame Relay and ATM networks. For more information <br>
see RFC 2390..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inarp-reply, inarp-rep, ir <br>
Inverse ARP Reply (type 9). InARP reply messages are sent in
response to InARP requests to provide the network layer
address associated with the host that has a given link <br>
layer address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arp-nak, an <br>
ARP NAK (type 10). ARP NAK messages are an extension to the
ATMARP protocol and they are used to improve the robustness
of the ATMARP server mechanism. With ARP NAK, a client <br>
can determine the difference between a catastrophic server
failure and an ATMARP table lookup failure. See RFC 1577.
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPV4 OPTIONS <br>
-S addr, --source-ip addr (Source IP Address) . <br>
Sets the source IP address. This option lets you specify a
custom IP address to be used as source IP address in sent
packets. This allows spoofing the sender of the packets.
<br>
addr can be an IPv4 address or a hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dest-ip addr (Destination IP
Address) . <br>
Adds a target to Nping&rsquo;s target list. This option is
provided for consistency but its use is deprecated in favor
of plain target specifications. See the section called <br>
&acirc;TARGET SPECIFICATION&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tos tos (Type of Service) .
<br>
Sets the IP TOS field. The TOS field is used to carry
information to provide quality of service features. It is
normally used to support a technique called Differentiated
<br>
Services. See RFC 2474. for more information. tos must be a
number in the range [0&acirc;255].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--id id (Identification) . <br>
Sets the IPv4 Identification field. The Identification field
is a 16-bit value that is common to all fragments belonging
to a particular message. The value is used by the <br>
receiver to reassemble the original message from the
fragments received. id must be a number in the range
[0&acirc;65535].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--df (Don&rsquo;t Fragment) .
<br>
Sets the Don&rsquo;t Fragment bit in sent packets. When an
IP datagram has its DF flag set, intermediate devices are
not allowed to fragment it so if it needs to travel across a
<br>
network with a MTU smaller that datagram length the datagram
will have to be dropped. Normally an ICMP Destination
Unreachable message is generated and sent back to the <br>
sender.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mf (More Fragments) . <br>
Sets the More Fragments bit in sent packets. The MF flag is
set to indicate the receiver that the current datagram is a
fragment of some larger datagram. When set to zero it <br>
indicates that the current datagram is either the last
fragment in the set or that it is the only fragment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ttl hops (Time To Live) . <br>
Sets the IPv4 Time-To-Live (TTL) field in sent packets to
the given value. The TTL field specifies how long the
datagram is allowed to exist on the network. It was
originally <br>
intended to represent a number of seconds but it actually
represents the number of hops a packet can traverse before
being dropped. The TTL tries to avoid a situation in <br>
which undeliverable datagrams keep being forwarded from one
router to another endlessly. hops must be a number in the
range [0&acirc;255].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--badsum-ip (Invalid IP
checksum) . <br>
Asks Nping to use an invalid IP checksum for packets sent to
target hosts. Note that some systems (like most Linux
kernels), may fix the checksum before placing the packet on
<br>
the wire, so even if Nping shows the incorrect checksum in
its output, the packets may be transparently corrected by
the kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ip-options S|R [route]|L
[route]|T|U ..., --ip-options hex string (IP Options) . <br>
The IP protocol offers several options which may be placed
in packet headers. Unlike the ubiquitous TCP options, IP
options are rarely seen due to practicality and security
<br>
concerns. In fact, many Internet routers block the most
dangerous options such as source routing. Yet options can
still be useful in some cases for determining and <br>
manipulating the network route to target machines. For
example, you may be able to use the record route option to
determine a path to a target even when more traditional <br>
traceroute-style approaches fail. Or if your packets are
being dropped by a certain firewall, you may be able to
specify a different route with the strict or loose source
<br>
routing options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The most powerful way to specify
IP options is to simply pass in hexadecimal data as the
argument to --ip-options. Precede each hex byte value with
You may repeat certain <br>
characters by following them with an asterisk and then the
number of times you wish them to repeat. For example, 1740*4
is the same as <br>
1740000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if you specify a
number of bytes that is not a multiple of four, an incorrect
IP header length will be set in the IP packet. The reason
for this is that the IP <br>
header length field can only express multiples of four. In
those cases, the length is computed by dividing the header
length by 4 and rounding down. This will affect the way <br>
the header that follows the IP header is interpreted,
showing bogus information in Nping or in the output of any
sniffer. Although this kind of situation might be useful for
<br>
some stack stress tests, users would normally want to
specify explicit padding, so the correct header length is
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nping also offers a shortcut
mechanism for specifying options. Simply pass the letter R,
T, or U to request record-route, record-timestamp, or both
options together, <br>
respectively. Loose or strict source routing may be
specified with an L or S followed by a space and then a
space-separated list of IP addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information and
examples of using IP options with Nping, see the mailing
list post at
http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2006/q3/0052.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mtu size (Maximum Transmission
Unit) . <br>
This option sets a fictional MTU in Nping so IP datagrams
larger than size are fragmented before transmission. size
must be specified in bytes and corresponds to the number
<br>
of octets that can be carried on a single link-layer
frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPV6 OPTIONS <br>
-6, --ipv6 (Use IPv6) . <br>
Tells Nping to use IP version 6 instead of the default IPv4.
It is generally a good idea to specify this option as early
as possible in the command line so Nping can parse it <br>
soon and know in advance that the rest of the parameters
refer to IPv6. The command syntax is the same as usual
except that you also add the -6 option. Of course, you must
<br>
use IPv6 syntax if you specify an address rather than a
hostname. An address might look like
3ffe:7501:4819:2000:210:f3ff:fe03:14d0, so hostnames are
recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While IPv6 hasn&rsquo;t exactly
taken the world by storm, it gets significant use in some
(usually Asian) countries and most modern operating systems
support it. To use Nping with <br>
IPv6, both the source and target of your packets must be
configured for IPv6. If your ISP (like most of them) does
not allocate IPv6 addresses to you, free tunnel brokers are
<br>
widely available and work fine with Nping. You can use the
free IPv6 tunnel broker service at
http://www.tunnelbroker.net.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that IPv6 support is
still highly experimental and many modes and options may not
work with it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S addr, --source-ip addr
(Source IP Address) . <br>
Sets the source IP address. This option lets you specify a
custom IP address to be used as source IP address in sent
packets. This allows spoofing the sender of the packets.
<br>
addr can be an IPv6 address or a hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dest-ip addr (Destination IP
Address) . <br>
Adds a target to Nping&rsquo;s target list. This option is
provided for consistency but its use is deprecated in favor
of plain target specifications. See the section called <br>
&acirc;TARGET SPECIFICATION&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--flow label (Flow Label) . <br>
Sets the IPv6 Flow Label. The Flow Label field is 20 bits
long and is intended to provide certain quality-of-service
properties for real-time datagram delivery. However, it <br>
has not been widely adopted, and not all routers or
endpoints support it. Check RFC 2460. for more information.
label must be an integer in the range [0&acirc;1048575].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--traffic-class class (Traffic
Class) . <br>
Sets the IPv6 Traffic Class. This field is similar to the
TOS field in IPv4, and is intended to provide the
Differentiated Services method, enabling scalable service
<br>
discrimination in the Internet without the need for per-flow
state and signaling at every hop. Check RFC 2474. for more
information. class must be an integer in the range <br>
[0&acirc;255].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hop-limit hops (Hop Limit) .
<br>
Sets the IPv6 Hop Limit field in sent packets to the given
value. The Hop Limit field specifies how long the datagram
is allowed to exist on the network. It represents the <br>
number of hops a packet can traverse before being dropped.
As with the TTL in IPv4, IPv6 Hop Limit tries to avoid a
situation in which undeliverable datagrams keep being <br>
forwarded from one router to another endlessly. hops must be
a number in the range [0&acirc;255].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ETHERNET OPTIONS <br>
In most cases Nping sends packets at the raw IP level. This
means that Nping creates its own IP packets and transmits
them through a raw socket. However, in some cases it may be
<br>
necessary to send packets at the raw Ethernet level. This
happens, for example, when Nping is run under Windows (as
Microsoft has disabled raw socket support since Windows XP
<br>
SP2), or when Nping is asked to send ARP packets. Since in
some cases it is necessary to construct ethernet frames,
Nping offers some options to manipulate the different
fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dest-mac mac (Ethernet
Destination MAC Address) . <br>
This option sets the destination MAC address that should be
set in outgoing Ethernet frames. This is useful in case
Nping can&rsquo;t determine the next hop&rsquo;s MAC address
or when <br>
you want to route probes through a router other than the
configured default gateway. The MAC address should have the
usual format of six colon-separated bytes, e.g. <br>
00:50:56:d4:01:98. Alternatively, hyphens may be used
instead of colons. Use the word random or rand to generate a
random address, and broadcast or bcast to use <br>
ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff. If you set up a bogus destination MAC
address your probes may not reach the intended targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--source-mac mac (Ethernet
Source MAC Address) . <br>
This option sets the source MAC address that should be set
in outgoing Ethernet frames. This is useful in case Nping
can&rsquo;t determine your network interface MAC address or
<br>
when you want to inject traffic into the network while
hiding your network card&rsquo;s real address. The syntax is
the same as for --dest-mac. If you set up a bogus source MAC
<br>
address you may not receive probe replies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ether-type type (Ethertype) .
<br>
This option sets the Ethertype field of the ethernet frame.
The Ethertype is used to indicate which protocol is
encapsulated in the payload. type can be supplied in two
<br>
different ways. You can use the official numbers listed by
the IEEE[3] (e.g. --ether-type 0x0800 for IP version 4), or
one of the mnemonics from the section called &acirc;Ethernet

Types&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAYLOAD OPTIONS <br>
--data hex string (Append custom binary data to sent
packets) . <br>
This option lets you include binary data as payload in sent
packets. hex string may be specified in any of the following
formats: 0xAABBCCDDEEFF..., AABBCCDDEEFF... or <br>
.... Examples of use are --data 0xdeadbeef and --data 9.
Note that if you specify a number like 0x00ff no byte-order
conversion is <br>
performed. Make sure you specify the information in the byte
order expected by the receiver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--data-string string (Append
custom string to sent packets) . <br>
This option lets you include a regular string as payload in
sent packets. string can contain any string. However, note
that some characters may depend on your system&rsquo;s <br>
locale and the receiver may not see the same information.
Also, make sure you enclose the string in double quotes and
escape any special characters from the shell. Example: <br>
--data-string &quot;Jimmy Jazz...&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--data-length len (Append random
data to sent packets) . <br>
This option lets you include len random bytes of data as
payload in sent packets. len must be an integer in the range
[0&acirc;65400]. However, values higher than 1400 are not
<br>
recommended because it may not be possible to transmit
packets due to network MTU limitations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ECHO MODE <br>
The &quot;Echo Mode&quot; is a novel technique implemented
by Nping which lets users see how network packets change in
transit, from the host where they originated to the target
machine. <br>
Basically, the Echo mode turns Nping into two different
pieces: the Echo server and the Echo client. The Echo server
is a network service that has the ability to capture packets
<br>
from the network and send a copy (&quot;echo them&quot;) to
the originating client through a side TCP channel. The Echo
client is the part that generates such network packets,
transmits <br>
them to the server, and receives their echoed version
through a side TCP channel that it has previously
established with the Echo server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This scheme lets the client see
the differences between the packets that it sends and what
is actually received by the server. By having the server
send back copies of the <br>
received packets through the side channel, things like NAT
devices become immediately apparent to the client because it
notices the changes in the source IP address (and maybe <br>
even source port). Other devices like those that perform
traffic shaping, changing TCP window sizes or adding TCP
options transparently between hosts, turn up too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Echo mode is also useful for
troubleshooting routing and firewall issues. Among other
things, it can be used to determine if the traffic generated
by the Nping client is <br>
being dropped in transit and never gets to its destination
or if the responses are the ones that don&rsquo;t get back
to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internally, client and server
communicate over an encrypted and authenticated channel,
using the Nping Echo Protocol (NEP), whose technical
specification can be found in <br>
http://nmap.org/svn/nping/docs/EchoProtoRFC.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following paragraphs
describe the different options available in Nping&rsquo;s
Echo mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ec passphrase, --echo-client
passphrase (Run Echo client) . <br>
This option tells Nping to run as an Echo client. passphrase
is a sequence of ASCII characters that is used to generate
the cryptographic keys needed for encryption and <br>
authentication in a given session. The passphrase should be
a secret that is also known by the server, and it may
contain any number of printable ASCII characters. <br>
Passphrases that contain whitespace or special characters
must be enclosed in double quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running Nping as an Echo
client, most options from the regular raw probe modes apply.
The client may be configured to send specific probes using
flags like --tcp, --icmp <br>
or --udp. Protocol header fields may be manipulated normally
using the appropriate options (e.g. --ttl, --seq,
--icmp-type, etc.). The only exceptions are ARP-related
flags, <br>
which are not supported in Echo mode, as protocols like ARP
are closely related to the data link layer and its probes
can&rsquo;t pass through different network segments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--es passphrase, --echo-server
passphrase (Run Echo server) . <br>
This option tells Nping to run as an Echo server. passphrase
is a sequence of ASCII characters that is used to generate
the cryptographic keys needed for encryption and <br>
authentication in a given session. The passphrase should be
a secret that is also known by the clients, and it may
contain any number of printable ASCII characters. <br>
Passphrases that contain whitespace or special characters
must be enclosed in double quotes. Note that although it is
not recommended, it is possible to use empty <br>
passphrases, supplying --echo-server &quot;&quot;. However,
if what you want is to set up an open Echo server, it is
better to use option --no-crypto. See below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ep port, --echo-port port (Set
Echo TCP port number) . <br>
This option asks Nping to use the specified TCP port number
for the Echo side channel connection. If this option is used
with --echo-server, it specifies the port on which <br>
the server listens for connections. If it is used with
--echo-client, it specifies the port to connect to on the
remote host. By default, port number 9929 is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nc, --no-crypto (Disable
encryption and authentication) . <br>
This option asks Nping not to use any cryptographic
operations during an Echo session. In practical terms, this
means that the Echo side channel session data will be <br>
transmitted in the clear, and no authentication will be
performed by the server or client during the session
establishment phase. When --no-crypto is used, the
passphrase <br>
supplied with --echo-server or --echo-client is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option must be specified if
Nping was compiled without openSSL support. Note that, for
technical reasons, a passphrase still needs to be supplied
after the --echo-client <br>
or --echo-server flags, even though it will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --no-crypto flag might be
useful when setting up a public Echo server, because it
allows users to connect to the Echo server without the need
for any passphrase or shared <br>
secret. However, it is strongly recommended to not use
--no-crypto unless absolutely necessary. Public Echo servers
should be configured to use the passphrase
&quot;public&quot; or the <br>
empty passphrase (--echo-server &quot;&quot;) as the use of
cryptography does not only provide confidentiality and
authentication but also message integrity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--once (Serve one client and
quit) . <br>
This option asks the Echo server to quit after serving one
client. This is useful when only a single Echo session wants
to be established as it eliminates the need to access <br>
the remote host to shutdown the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--safe-payloads (Zero
application data before echoing a packet) . <br>
This option asks the Echo server to erase any application
layer data found in client packets before echoing them. When
the option is enabled, the Echo server parses the <br>
packets received from Echo clients and tries to determine if
they contain data beyond the transport layer. If such data
is found, it is overwritten with zeroes before <br>
transmitting the packets to the appropriate Echo client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Echo servers can handle multiple
simultaneous clients running multiple echo sessions in
parallel. In order to determine which packet needs to be
echoed to which client and <br>
through which session, the Echo server uses an heuristic
algorithm. Although we have taken every security measure
that we could think of to prevent that a client receives an
<br>
echoed packet that it did not generate, there is always a
risk that our algorithm makes a mistake and delivers a
packet to the wrong client. The --safe-payloads option is
<br>
useful for public echo servers or critical deployments where
that kind of mistake cannot be afforded.</p>

illustrate how Nping&rsquo;s Echo mode can be used to
discover intermediate devices.</p>

the address seen by the server is 80.38.10.21, the Internet
side address of the NAT device. The source port was also
<br>
modified by the device. The line starting with RCVD
corresponds to the responses generated by the TCP/IP stack
of the machine where the Echo server is run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, the output is a
bit more tricky. The absence of error messages shows that
the Echo client has successfully established an Echo session
with the server. However, <br>
no CAPT packets can be seen in the output. This means that
none of the transmitted packets reached the server.
Interestingly, a TCP SYN-ACK packet was received in response
to the <br>
first TCP-SYN packet (and also, it is known that the target
host does not have port 80 open). This behavior reveals the
presence of a transparent web proxy cache server (which in
<br>
this case is an old MS ISA server).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OPTIONS
<br>
--delay time (Delay between probes) . <br>
This option lets you control for how long will Nping wait
before sending the next probe. Like in many other ping
tools, the default delay is one second. time must be a <br>
positive integer or floating point number. By default it is
specified in seconds, however you can give an explicit unit
by appending ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for <br>
minutes, or h for hours (e.g. 2.5s, 45m, 2h).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rate rate (Send probes at a
given rate) . <br>
This option specifies the number of probes that Nping should
send per second. This option and --delay are inverses;
--rate 20 is the same as --delay 0.05. If both options are
<br>
used, only the last one in the parameter list counts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS <br>
-h, --help (Display help) . <br>
Displays help information and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version (Display version)
. <br>
Displays the program&rsquo;s version number and quits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c rounds, --count rounds (Stop
after a given number of rounds) . <br>
This option lets you specify the number of times that Nping
should loop over target hosts (and in some cases target
ports). Nping calls these &acirc;rounds&acirc;. In a basic
execution <br>
with only one target (and only one target port in TCP/UDP
modes), the number of rounds matches the number of probes
sent to the target host. However, in more complex <br>
executions where Nping is run against multiple targets and
multiple ports, the number of rounds is the number of times
that Nping sends a complete set of probes that covers <br>
all target IPs and all target ports. For example, if Nping
is asked to send TCP SYN packets to hosts 192.168.1.0-255
and ports 80 and 433, then 256 &Atilde; 2 = 512 packets are
sent <br>
in one round. So if you specify -c 100, Nping will loop over
the different target hosts and ports 100 times, sending a
total of 256 &Atilde; 2 &Atilde; 100 = 51200 packets. By
default <br>
Nping runs for 5 rounds. If a value of 0 is specified, Nping
will run continuously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e name, --interface name (Set
the network interface to be used) . <br>
This option tells Nping what interface should be used to
send and receive packets. Nping should be able to detect
this automatically, but it will tell you if it cannot. name
<br>
must be the name of an existing network interface with an
assigned IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--privileged (Assume that the
user is fully privileged) . <br>
Tells Nping to simply assume that it is privileged enough to
perform raw socket sends, packet sniffing, and similar
operations that usually require special privileges. By <br>
default Nping quits if such operations are requested by a
user that has no root or administrator privileges. This
option may be useful on Linux, BSD or similar systems that
<br>
can be configured to allow unprivileged users to perform
raw-packet transmissions. The NPING_PRIVILEGED. environment
variable may be set as an alternative to using <br>
--privileged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unprivileged (Assume that the
user lacks raw socket privileges) . <br>
This option is the opposite of --privileged. It tells Nping
to treat the user as lacking network raw socket and sniffing
privileges. This is useful for testing, debugging, or <br>
when the raw network functionality of your operating system
is somehow broken. The NPING_UNPRIVILEGED. environment
variable may be set as an alternative to using <br>
--unprivileged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--send-eth (Use raw ethernet
sending) . <br>
Asks Nping to send packets at the raw ethernet (data link)
layer rather than the higher IP (network) layer. By default,
Nping chooses the one which is generally best for the <br>
platform it is running on. Raw sockets (IP layer) are
generally most efficient for Unix machines, while ethernet
frames are required for Windows operation since Microsoft
<br>
disabled raw socket support. Nping still uses raw IP packets
despite this option when there is no other choice (such as
non-ethernet connections).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--send-ip (Send at raw IP level)
. <br>
Asks Nping to send packets via raw IP sockets rather than
sending lower level ethernet frames. It is the complement to
the --send-eth option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bpf-filter filter spec
--filter filter spec (Set custom BPF filter) . <br>
This option lets you use a custom BPF filter. By default
Nping chooses a filter that is intended to capture most
common responses to the particular probes that are sent. For
<br>
example, when sending TCP packets, the filter is set to
capture packets whose destination port matches the
probe&rsquo;s source port or ICMP error messages that may be
generated by <br>
the target or any intermediate device as a result of the
probe. If for some reason you expect strange packets in
response to sent probes or you just want to sniff a <br>
particular kind of traffic, you can specify a custom filter
using the BPF syntax used by tools like tcpdump.. See the
documentation at http://www.tcpdump.org/ for more <br>
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --hide-sent (Do not display
sent packets) . <br>
This option tells Nping not to print information about sent
packets. This can be useful when using very short
inter-probe delays (i.e., when flooding), because printing
<br>
information to the standard output has a computational cost
and disabling it can probably speed things up a bit. Also,
it may be useful when using Nping to detect active <br>
hosts or open ports (e.g. sending probes to all TCP ports in
a /24 subnet). In that case, users may not want to see
thousands of sent probes but just the replies generated by
<br>
active hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --no-capture (Do not attempt
to capture replies) . <br>
This option tells Nping to skip packet capture. This means
that packets in response to sent probes will not be
processed or displayed. This can be useful when doing
flooding <br>
and network stack stress tests. Note that when this option
is specified, most of the statistics shown at the end of the
execution will be useless. This option does not work <br>
with TCP Connect mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT OPTIONS <br>
-v[level], --verbose [level] (Increase or set verbosity
level) . <br>
Increases the verbosity level, causing Nping to print more
information during its execution. There are 9 levels of
verbosity (-4 to 4). Every instance of -v increments the
<br>
verbosity level by one (from its default value, level 0).
Every instance of option -q decrements the verbosity level
by one. Alternatively you can specify the level directly,
<br>
as in -v3 or -v-1. These are the available levels:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level &acirc;4 <br>
No output at all. In some circumstances you may not want
Nping to produce any output (like when one of your work
mates is watching over your shoulder). In that case level
<br>
&acirc;4 can be useful because although you won&rsquo;t see
any response packets, probes will still be sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level &acirc;3 <br>
Like level &acirc;4 but displays fatal error messages so you
can actually see if Nping is running or it failed due to
some error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level &acirc;2 <br>
Like level &acirc;3 but also displays warnings and
recoverable errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level &acirc;1 <br>
Displays traditional run-time information (version, start
time, statistics, etc.) but does not display sent or
received packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 0 <br>
This is the default verbosity level. It behaves like level
&acirc;1 but also displays sent and received packets and
some other important information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 1 <br>
Like level 0 but it displays detailed information about
timing, flags, protocol details, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 2 <br>
Like level 1 but displays very detailed information about
sent and received packets and other interesting
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 3 <br>
Like level 2 but also displays the raw hexadecimal dump of
sent and received packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 4 and higher <br>
Same as level 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q[level], --reduce-verbosity
[level] (Decrease verbosity level) . <br>
Decreases the verbosity level, causing Nping to print less
information during its execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d[level] (Increase or set
debugging level) . <br>
When even verbose mode doesn&rsquo;t provide sufficient data
for you, debugging is available to flood you with much more!
As with the -v, debugging is enabled with a command-line
<br>
flag -d and the debug level can be increased by specifying
it multiple times. There are 7 debugging levels (0 to 6).
Every instance of -d increments debugging level by one. <br>
Provide an argument to -d to set the level directly; for
example -d4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debugging output is useful when
you suspect a bug in Nping, or if you are simply confused as
to what Nping is doing and why. As this feature is mostly
intended for <br>
developers, debug lines aren&rsquo;t always
self-explanatory. You may get something like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NSOCK (1.0000s) Callback: TIMER
SUCCESS for EID 12; tcpconnect_event_handler(): Received
callback of type TIMER with status SUCCESS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t understand a
line, your only recourses are to ignore it, look it up in
the source code, or request help from the development list
(nmap-dev). Some lines are <br>
self-explanatory, but the messages become more obscure as
the debug level is increased. These are the available
levels:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 0 <br>
Level 0. No debug information at all. This is the default
level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 1 <br>
In this level, only very important or high-level debug
information will be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 2 <br>
Like level 1 but also displays important or medium-level
debug information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 3 <br>
Like level 2 but also displays regular and low-level debug
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 4 <br>
Like level 3 but also displays messages only a real Nping
freak would want to see.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 5 <br>
Like level 4 but it enables basic debug information related
to external libraries like Nsock..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 6 <br>
Like level 5 but it enables full, very detailed, debug
information related to external libraries like Nsock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Like its author, Nping isn&rsquo;t perfect. But you can help
make it better by sending bug reports or even writing
patches. If Nping doesn&rsquo;t behave the way you expect,
first upgrade to <br>
the latest Nmap version available from
http://nmap.org/download.html. If the problem persists, do
some research to determine whether it has already been
discovered and addressed. <br>
Try searching for the error message on our search page at
http://insecure.org/search.html or at Google. Also try
browsing the nmap-dev archives at http://seclists.org/. Read
<br>
this full manual page as well. If nothing comes out of this,
mail a bug report to &lt;dev@nmap.org&gt;. Please include
everything you have learned about the problem, as well as
what <br>
version of Nping you are running and what operating system
version it is running on. Problem reports and Nping usage
questions sent to &lt;dev@nmap.org&gt; are far more likely
to be <br>
answered than those sent to Fyodor directly. If you
subscribe to the nmap-dev list before posting, your message
will bypass moderation and get through more quickly.
Subscribe at <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Code patches to fix bugs are
even better than bug reports. Basic instructions for
creating patch files with your changes are available at
https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/HACKING. <br>
Patches may be sent to nmap-dev (recommended) or to any of
the authors listed in the next section directly.</p>
