<i>esniper</i> is a lightweight ebay sniping tool. It doesn't have a lot of
  features, and that is by design.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Auctions are specified on the command line, using the auction number and your
  bid price. Multiple auctions can be bid on by specifying more auctions and bid
  prices. esniper stops when the desired quantity has been won (default is 1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can use an auction file instead of specifying auctions on the command line.
  See the <b>AUCTION FILE</b> section below for more details.

      fail.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies a configuration file to read. All options can be

<dl class="Bl-tag">

      esniper.&lt;auction_num&gt;.log and esniper.log, and are written to the
      current working directory. If the -l option or logdir configuration option
      is used, log files are written to the specified directory.</dd>

      auction file. The directory must exist and be writeable. Log files are
      written when the -d option is used.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">Do not bid. The corresponding configuration option is bid,

  <dd class="It-tag">Set the bidding time, specified as now, or seconds before
      the end of an auction. If now is used, bids will be placed immediately.
      The corresponding configuration option is seconds, default value is 10
      seconds. You should snipe late enough in an auction to prevent a manual
      bidder to update their bid, but before other snipes. In case two bids are
      within one bid increment of each other, the first bid placed wins.</dd>

  FILE</a></h1>
Most command-line options can also be set in a configuration file. The advantage
  of using a configuration file is that you can set all of you options once and
  not have to enter them on the command line every time you run esniper.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A configuration file consists of option lines, in the format
  &quot;option=value&quot;, blank lines, and comments. Option names are listed
  above with their corresponding command-line flags. Comments begin with #.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One configuration file option that doesn't have a corresponding command-line
  flag is password. The password option allows you to set your eBay password. If
  you store your eBay password in a configuration file, you should ensure that
  the configuration file can be read only by you.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default configuration file is $HOME/.esniper (or $USERPROFILE/My
  Documents/.esniper in Windows). If an auction file is used, esniper will also
  attempt to read .esniper from the directory that contains the auction file;
  options set in this configuration file will override options set in the user's
  default configuration file. However, if the -c command line option is used,
  then only the configuration file specified by the -c command line option is
  read.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Options specified on the command line override corresponding options set in an
  auction file, and options set in an auction file override options set in any
  configuration file.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="AUCTION_FILE"><a class="selflink" href="#AUCTION_FILE">AUCTION
  FILE</a></h1>
An auction file is similar to a configuration file, but it also has one or more
  auction lines. An auction line contains an auction number, optionally followed
  by a bid price. If no bid price is given, the auction number uses the bid
  price of the first prior auction line that contains a bid price.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If an auction file is specified and the -c option isn't used, esniper attempts
  to read .esniper from the directory where the auction file is located. See the
  <b>CONFIGURATION FILE</b> section for more details.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
An example of a configuration file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
# A configuration file contains option settings,
# blank lines, and comments (begin with #).  The
# default configuration file is $HOME/.esniper, and
# if you specify an auction file, .esniper in the
# auction file's directory as well.  If you specify a
# configuration file using the -c command-line option,
# then that configuration file will be the only one
# read.
#
# If you set your password in a configuration file
# and you are on a unix system, you should be the
# owner of the file, and you should set the
# permissions so that it is readable only by the
# owner.
#
# Here are all the options.  Note that if the
# default (as defined in esniper -H) is fine, you
# don't need to specify it in a configuration file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
# boolean parameters can be set to:
#	true, y, yes, on, 1, enabled
#	false, n, no, off, 0, disabled
batch = false
bid = yes
debug = enabled
reduce = y
<div class="Pp"></div>
# Note: it would be nice if logdir could use ~myuser,
# or $HOME.  Perhaps in a future version.
logdir = /export/home/myuser/esniperlogs
password = myebaypassword
# Note: proxy authentication not yet supported
proxy = http://192.168.1.1:8080/
username = myebayusername
<div class="Pp"></div>
# Note: quantity is usually set in an auction file
quantity = 1
# Note: seconds can also be &quot;now&quot;, if you want to
# bid immediately
seconds = 10
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
An example of an auction file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
# An auction file may contain any line that is valid
# in a configuration file (see sample_config.txt for
# details), plus it may also have auction lines.
#
# An auction line contains an auction number, optionally
# followed by a price.  If a price isn't specified, the
# price used is the same as the previous auction line.
#
# You should have one auction file for each type of item
# you are bidding on, so that you can change the quantity,
# username, or other options to suit the item you are
# bidding on.  For instance, you may want to buy up to 10
# laser print cartridges, but only one digital camera.
<div class="Pp"></div>
# Sample auction file for laser printer cartridges
<div class="Pp"></div>
# I'd like 10 of them, and my target price is $50
