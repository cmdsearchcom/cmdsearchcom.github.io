<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
esniper - a lightweight ebay sniping tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
esniper [-bdhHimnPrUv] [-c conf_file] [-l logdir] [-p proxy]
[-q quantity] [-s secs|now] [-u user] (auction_file | [
auction price ... ])</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
esniper is a lightweight ebay sniping tool. It doesn&rsquo;t
have a lot of features, and that is by design.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Auctions are specified on the
command line, using the auction number and your bid price.
Multiple auctions can be bid on by specifying more auctions
and bid prices. esniper <br>
stops when the desired quantity has been won (default is
1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use an auction file
instead of specifying auctions on the command line. See the
AUCTION FILE section below for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b Enable batch mode. The corresponding configuration option
is batch, default value is false. In batch mode, esniper
never prompts for password and/or username. If the <br>
password or username cannot be determined from options or
read from configuration or auction files, esniper will
fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Specifies a configuration
file to read. All options can be set either by command-line
flags or in the configuration file. See the CONFIGURATION
FILE section for details. <br>
The default configuration file is $HOME/.esniper (or
$USERPROFILE/My Documents/.esniper in Windows).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Enable debug mode. The
corresponding configuration option is debug, default value
is false. Log files are named
esniper.&lt;auction_num&gt;.log and esniper.log, and are
writ&acirc; <br>
ten to the current working directory. If the -l option or
logdir configuration option is used, log files are written
to the specified directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Show command line option
help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Show configuration and
auction file help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Print information on given
auctions and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Set the directory where log
files will be written. The corresponding configuration
option is logdir, default value is the current working
directory, or if an auction file <br>
is specified the directory of the auction file. The
directory must exist and be writeable. Log files are written
when the -d option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Print user&rsquo;s my eBay
watched items list and exit. The user&rsquo;s myEbay watched
items list must use the default column ordering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Do not bid. The corresponding
configuration option is bid, default value is true. Useful
for debugging, it exercises most of esniper except actually
placing bids. It is <br>
also be useful for checking the status of an auction,
without accidentally placing a bid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Specify an http proxy to use.
The corresponding configuration option is proxy, default
value is the value of the http_proxy environment variable.
The proxy should be of <br>
the form http://host:port/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Prompt the user for their
ebay password. This overrides the password set in any
configuration or auction file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Set the quantity. The
corresponding configuration option is quantity, default
value is 1. esniper will quit when it has won enough
items.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Do not reduce quantity on
startup for items you have already won. The corresponding
configuration option is reduce, default value is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Set the bidding time,
specified as now, or seconds before the end of an auction.
If now is used, bids will be placed immediately. The
corresponding configuration option <br>
is seconds, default value is 10 seconds. You should snipe
late enough in an auction to prevent a manual bidder to
update their bid, but before other snipes. In case two <br>
bids are within one bid increment of each other, the first
bid placed wins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Set the ebay username. The
corresponding configuration option is username, there is no
default value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Prompt the user for their
ebay username.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
Most command-line options can also be set in a configuration
file. The advantage of using a configuration file is that
you can set all of you options once and not have to enter
<br>
them on the command line every time you run esniper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A configuration file consists of
option lines, in the format &quot;option=value&quot;, blank
lines, and comments. Option names are listed above with
their corresponding command-line <br>
flags. Comments begin with #.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One configuration file option
that doesn&rsquo;t have a corresponding command-line flag is
password. The password option allows you to set your eBay
password. If you store your eBay <br>
password in a configuration file, you should ensure that the
configuration file can be read only by you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default configuration file
is $HOME/.esniper (or $USERPROFILE/My Documents/.esniper in
Windows). If an auction file is used, esniper will also
attempt to read .esniper from <br>
the directory that contains the auction file; options set in
this configuration file will override options set in the
user&rsquo;s default configuration file. However, if the -c
com&acirc; <br>
mand line option is used, then only the configuration file
specified by the -c command line option is read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options specified on the command
line override corresponding options set in an auction file,
and options set in an auction file override options set in
any configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUCTION FILE <br>
An auction file is similar to a configuration file, but it
also has one or more auction lines. An auction line contains
an auction number, optionally followed by a bid price. <br>
If no bid price is given, the auction number uses the bid
price of the first prior auction line that contains a bid
price.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an auction file is specified
and the -c option isn&rsquo;t used, esniper attempts to read
.esniper from the directory where the auction file is
located. See the CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
section for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
An example of a configuration file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># A configuration file contains
option settings, <br>
# blank lines, and comments (begin with #). The <br>
# default configuration file is $HOME/.esniper, and <br>
# if you specify an auction file, .esniper in the <br>
# auction file&rsquo;s directory as well. If you specify a
<br>
# configuration file using the -c command-line option, <br>
# then that configuration file will be the only one <br>
# read. <br>
# <br>
# If you set your password in a configuration file <br>
# and you are on a unix system, you should be the <br>
# owner of the file, and you should set the <br>
# permissions so that it is readable only by the <br>
# owner. <br>
# <br>
# Here are all the options. Note that if the <br>
# default (as defined in esniper -H) is fine, you <br>
# don&rsquo;t need to specify it in a configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># boolean parameters can be set
to: <br>
# true, y, yes, on, 1, enabled <br>
# false, n, no, off, 0, disabled <br>
batch = false <br>
bid = yes <br>
debug = enabled <br>
reduce = y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Note: it would be nice if
logdir could use ~myuser, <br>
# or $HOME. Perhaps in a future version. <br>
logdir = /export/home/myuser/esniperlogs <br>
password = myebaypassword <br>
# Note: proxy authentication not yet supported <br>
proxy = http://192.168.1.1:8080/ <br>
username = myebayusername</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Note: quantity is usually set
in an auction file <br>
quantity = 1 <br>
# Note: seconds can also be &quot;now&quot;, if you want to
<br>
# bid immediately <br>
seconds = 10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example of an auction
file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># An auction file may contain
any line that is valid <br>
# in a configuration file (see sample_config.txt for <br>
# details), plus it may also have auction lines. <br>
# <br>
# An auction line contains an auction number, optionally
<br>
# followed by a price. If a price isn&rsquo;t specified, the
<br>
# price used is the same as the previous auction line. <br>
# <br>
# You should have one auction file for each type of item
<br>
# you are bidding on, so that you can change the quantity,
<br>
# username, or other options to suit the item you are <br>
# bidding on. For instance, you may want to buy up to 10
<br>
# laser print cartridges, but only one digital camera.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Sample auction file for laser
printer cartridges</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># I&rsquo;d like 10 of them, and
my target price is $50 <br>
quantity = 10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># seller surpluslaserjunk,
shipping $15, <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># seller lasersuppliesforcheap,
lousy reputation, <br>
# don&rsquo;t buy!!! <br>
#9239889372 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
http_proxy The default http proxy. The -p command-line
option and proxy configuration option override this
setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USERPROFILE Windows user&rsquo;s
home directory. If no configuration file is specified,
esniper tries to read the file My Documents/.esniper under
the USERPROFILE directory. Note: <br>
esniper for Windows 95, 98 and Me is compiled under cygwin,
a unix-like environment for Windows. This version of esniper
uses the HOME environment variable, as <br>
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME Unix user&rsquo;s home
directory. If no configuration file is specified, esniper
tries to read the file .esniper in this directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
eBay likes to change their website often. Some of these
changes will break esniper. If esniper doesn&rsquo;t work
for you, please make sure you have the most recent version.
You can <br>
check the version of esniper you are using by running
esniper with the -v option. Updates to esniper are available
at http://esniper.sf.net/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are running the most
current version and you are still encountering a bug, please
