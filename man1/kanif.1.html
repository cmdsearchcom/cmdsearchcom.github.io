<p>KANIF(1) kanif TakTuk Wrapper KANIF(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
kanif - a TakTuk wrapper for cluster management</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
kash|kaget|kaput [-aFHhimqsV] [-f conf-file] [-l login] [-M
machines-list] [-n|-w nodes] [-o options] [-p level] [-r
command] [-T options] [-t timeout] [-u timeout] [-x nodes]
<br>
[machines specifications] [command body]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
kanif is a tool for cluster management and administration.
It combines main features of well known cluster management
tools such as c3, pdsh and dsh and mimics their syntax. For
<br>
the effective cluster management it relies on TakTuk, a tool
for large scale remote execution deployment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For simple parallel tasks that
have to be executed on regular machines such as clusters,
TakTuk syntax is too complicated. The goal of kanif is to
provide an easier and familiar <br>
syntax to cluster administrators while still taking
advantage of TakTuk characteristics and features
(adaptivity, scalability, portability, autopropagation and
information <br>
redirection).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To work, kanif needs to find the
&quot;taktuk&quot; command (version 3.3 and above) in the
user path. The other requirements are the same as TakTuk: it
requires, on all the nodes of the <br>
cluster, a working Perl interpreter (version 5.8 and above)
and a command to log without password (such as
&quot;ssh&quot; with proper rsa keys installed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kanif provides three simple
commands for clusters administration and management:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kash: runs the same command on
multiple nodes <br>
kaput: broadcasts the copy of files or directories to
several nodes <br>
kaget: gathers several remote files or directories</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kanif combines the advantages of
several cluster management tools. Its main features can be
summarized as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; C3-style
configuration file for static clusters setups</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; pdsh-like
options such as nodes ranges and timeouts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; dshbak-like
gathering, sorting and merging of output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As with &quot;pdsh&quot;, kanif
deployment can be monitored and controlled by signals. When
kanif receives a SIGINT (usually sent by typing Ctrl-C), it
displays a brief summary of its <br>
deployment state and commands execution progress. After this
first SIGINT, if kanif receives a second signal within one
second:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; it terminates
its execution (cancelling any ongoing task) if this is a
SIGINT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; it cancels any
ongoing connections and start executions on the already
deployed nodes if this is a SIGTSTP (usually sent by typing
Ctrl-Z)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the end of executions, kanif
also reports a quick summary of failures: connections and
commands execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
To help administrators in their task, kanif options syntax
is as close as possible to C3/pdsh/dsh well known tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a <br>
--all <br>
Deploys on all nodes of all configured clusters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f conf-file <br>
--file conf-file <br>
Uses &quot;conf-file&quot; as configuration file instead of
default. Several possibilities are examined for default
configuration file, in order: &quot;$HOME/.kanif.conf&quot;,
<br>
&quot;/etc/kanif.conf&quot;, &quot;/etc/c3.conf&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F <br>
--flat-deployment <br>
Deploys all remote execution from the root node (which
executes kanif). Useful when remote nodes cannot log on each
other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H <br>
--head <br>
Deploys only on clusters &quot;head&quot; node (using local
interface) for all specified clusters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
--help <br>
Prints a short help text and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i <br>
--interactive <br>
Asks confirmation before any action. An action is either the
execution of one command on all the hosts (default) or the
execution of one command on one host (sequential mode, <br>
see -s switch).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l login <br>
--login login <br>
Uses the given &quot;login&quot; to connect to remote
hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M machines-list <br>
--list machines-list <br>
Adds to the remote hosts the names contained in the file
named &quot;machines-list&quot;. kanif accepts as many -M
options as you wish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m <br>
--monitoring <br>
Makes kanif more verbose about whats happening during
deployment commands execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n nodes <br>
--nodes nodes <br>
Adds the given &quot;nodes&quot; to the deployment. See
section &quot;HOSTNAMES SPECIFICATION&quot; for more
information about &quot;nodes&quot; syntax. kanif accepts as
many -n options as you wish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o options <br>
--remote-opts options <br>
Sets additional options to be passed to the remote shell
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p level <br>
--postprocess level <br>
Sets the level of output formating made in kanif. The
general idea is: the higher the level, the more sorted,
merged and human readable the output. Default is 4,
differents <br>
levels are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 No processing at all: raw
commands output is printed to stdout and raw commands error
is printed to stderr. Connections and executions errors are
not reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Same as 0 except that the name
of the host which produced the output is prepended before
each line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Same as 1 except that the
output is sorted by command (one complete command execution
is outputed entirely before another one). Connections and
executions errors are <br>
summarized at the end to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Same as 2 except that the
hostname is printed once, formatted as a title, before its
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 Same as 3 except that
identical output produced by multiple nodes is printed once
with all the hosts summarized in the title.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q <br>
--dry-run <br>
When this option is given, kanif does nothing and prints its
configuration, the remote nodes it would have tried to
contact and the TakTuk command that would have been <br>
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r command <br>
--remote-cmd command <br>
Sets the name of the &quot;command&quot; used to contact
remote hosts (default is &quot;ssh -o
StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o BatchMode=yes&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s <br>
--sequential <br>
Each command is executed sequentially on remote hosts (using
the order given on the command line as hosts order).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T options <br>
--taktuk-options options <br>
Allows power users to pass some options to the TakTuk
command executed (caution: always include -s which is the
default unless you really know what you are doing).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t timeout <br>
--timeout timeout <br>
Gives a timeout value for connection attempts. At
expiration, connection is canceled and deployment on the
remote host is aborted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u timeout <br>
--upper-limit timeout <br>
Gives a timeout value for commands execution. At expiration
the command is killed with a TERM signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
--version <br>
Prints kanif version and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w <br>
-wcoll <br>
Synonym to -n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x nodes <br>
--exclude nodes <br>
Excludes some nodes from the ones given using -n or -w.
Applies to all hosts sets that do not already contain an
exclusion part. Does not apply to host given with -M
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Usually all kanif options can be set by environment
variables. The rationale is that boolean options have 0/1
value and environment settings are overridden by command
line <br>
switches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of an environment
variable used by kanif is made of the long option name
capitalized with dashes replaced by underscores and
&quot;KANIF_&quot; prepended (for instance <br>
&quot;KANIF_ALL&quot;, &quot;KANIF_HEAD&quot;, and so on).
This rule admits the following exceptions (that have been
chosen to mimic C3/dsh behavior):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KANIF_CONF <br>
Instead of KANIF_FILE for configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KANIF_USER <br>
Instead of KANIF_LOGIN for login name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice also that the variable
KANIF_WCOLL has no meaning to kanif.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTNAMES SPECIFICATION <br>
Hostnames given to kanif might be simple machine name or
complex hosts lists specifications. In its general form, an
hostname is made of an host set and an optional exclusion
set <br>
separated by a slash. Each of those sets is a comma
separated list of host templates. Each of these templates is
made of constant parts (characters outside brackets) and
<br>
optional range parts (characters inside brackets). Each
range part is a comma separated list of intervals or single
values. Each interval is made of two single values separated
<br>
by a dash. This is true for all hostnames given to kanif
(both with -M or -n/-w options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In other words, the following
expressions are valid host specifications: <br>
node1 <br>
node[19] <br>
node[1-3] <br>
node[1-3],otherhost/node2 <br>
node[1-3,5]part[a-b]/node[3-5]parta,node1partb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">they respectively expand to:
<br>
node1 <br>
node19 <br>
node1 node2 node3 <br>
node1 node3 otherhost <br>
node1parta node2parta node2partb node3partb node5partb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice that these list of values
are not regular expressions (&quot;node[19]&quot; is
&quot;node19&quot; and not &quot;node1, node2, ....,
node9&quot;). Intervals are implemented using the perl
magical auto <br>
increment feature, thus you can use alphanumeric values as
interval bounds (see perl documentation, operator ++ for
limitations of this auto increment).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MACHINES SPECIFICATIONS <br>
With kanif, you can specify the remote nodes on which you
want to do some stuff using the command line switches (-n
and -x, pdsh/dsh style), using machines specifications (C3
<br>
style) or both. Thus, this part of the documentation might
be ignored if you do not want to use C3 style nodes
management.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use machines specification
you must describe your cluster in a configuration file (see
-f option and kanif.conf(5)). Machines specifications are
nodes intervals taken from <br>
clusters defined in this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A machine specification is an
optional cluster name followed by a colon and an optional
range. The default cluster is taken if no cluster name is
given. All the nodes of the <br>
cluster are taken if no range is given. Notice that if none
of -n/-w, -M or machine specification is given on the
command line, the remote hosts are assumed to be all the
nodes <br>
of the default cluster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND BODY <br>
Depending on the name used to invoke it (kash, kaput or
kaget), kanif does not perform the same task. Here are its
various behavior:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kash [options] [command line]
<br>
Executes the last part of the command line on all the remote
hosts. If this last part is empty, enters interactive mode
in which kanif waits for command (one per line) on <br>
stdin. In interactive mode, just send an EOF character
(Ctrl-D) to exit kash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kaput [options] src1 [src2 ...]
dest <br>
Copies one ore more files or directories to all the remote
hosts. The last argument is the path to the destination file
or directory on the remote machine. The other <br>
arguments are local files or directories to copy. Behavior
and limitations are similar to the command cp(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kaget [options] src1 [src2 ...]
dest <br>
Download one ore more files or directories from all the
remote hosts. The last argument is the path to the
destination directory on the local machine. The other
arguments are <br>
path to files or directories on remote hosts. Each source
must be present on all the remote hosts. Sources are copied
to the destination directory having the originating host
<br>
appended to their name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice that when using kaget or
kaput each file or directory is completely copied before
proceeding to the next one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
When a configuration file exists on the system or is given
on the command line (see option -f), remote machines can be
specified via clusters names. For instance, the simple <br>
execution of the command &quot;ls -l&quot; on all the nodes
of the cluster named &quot;megacluster&quot; can be
written:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kash megacluster: ls -l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Intervals can also be given. The
following command copies the local .cshrc file to the login
directory of a subset of the default cluster and another
subset of the &quot;megacluster&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kaput :3-6 megacluster:2-5
$HOME/.cshrc .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, one can take advantage
of the default behavior to gather a file named
&quot;results.txt&quot; placed in the &quot;/tmp&quot;
directory on all the nodes of the default cluster to the
local <br>
directory &quot;results&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kaget /tmp/results.txt
results</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a user does not want to
write a configuration file or just wants to deploy on some
other nodes, it is possible to give remote hosts on the
command line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kash -n localhost,supernode
uptime</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This last command will just
execute &quot;uptime&quot; on &quot;localhost&quot; and
&quot;supernode&quot;. Giving intervals and exclusion lists
is also possible on the command line. The following command
<br>
copie the file &quot;/tmp/temporary.txt&quot; to the remote
&quot;/tmp&quot; directories of node1 and node5:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kaput -n node[1-6] -x
node[2-4],node6 /tmp/temporary.txt /tmp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, without entering into
the details of each option, the final command illustrates
the -u option. It executes during 5 seconds a
&quot;ping&quot; to &quot;gateway&quot; from 5 nodes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kash -n node[1-2],node[4-6] -u 5
ping gateway</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Missing features:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; indirect
clusters not supported (see C3 documentation about such
clusters)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; when there are
no machine to deploy and kanif runs in interactive mode,
kanif still waits for a command (or eof) before exiting</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Performance issues:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the algorithm
used by kaput is not very efficient for transferring large
files. Although the precise limit depends on the machine, it
should not scale well above a few <br>
hundreds of megabytes.</p>
