<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
r3.mapcalc performs arithmetic on raster map layers. New
raster map layers can be created which are arithmetic
expressions involving existing raster map layers, integer or
<br>
floating point constants, and functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Program use <br>
r3.mapcalc expression have the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">result = expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where result is the name of a
raster map layer to contain the result of the calculation
and expression is any legal arithmetic expression involving
existing raster map layers <br>
(except result itself), integer or floating point constants,
and functions known to the calculator. Parentheses are
allowed in the expression and may be nested to any depth.
<br>
result will be created in the user&acirc;s current
mapset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As expression= is the first
option, it is the default. This means that passing an
expression on the command line is possible as long as the
expression is quoted and a space is <br>
included before the first = sign. Example (&acirc;foo&acirc;
is the resulting map): <br>
r3.mapcalc &quot;foo = 1&quot; <br>
or: <br>
r3.mapcalc &acirc;foo = 1&acirc; <br>
An unquoted expression (i.e. split over multiple arguments)
won&acirc;t work, nor will omitting the space before the =
sign: <br>
r3.mapcalc &acirc;foo=1&acirc; <br>
Sorry, &lt;foo&gt; is not a valid parameter <br>
If no options are given, it manufactures &quot;file=-&quot;
(which reads from stdin), so you can continue to use e.g.:
<br>
r3.mapcalc &lt; file <br>
or: <br>
r3.mapcalc &lt;&lt;EOF <br>
foo = 1 <br>
EOF <br>
But unless you need compatibility with previous versions,
use file= explicitly, e.g.: <br>
r3.mapcalc file=file <br>
or: <br>
r3.mapcalc file=- &lt;&lt;EOF <br>
foo = 1 <br>
EOF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The formula entered to
r3.mapcalc by the user is recorded both in the result map
title (which appears in the category file for result) and in
the history file for result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some characters have special
meaning to the command shell. If the user is entering input
to r3.mapcalc on the command line, expressions should be
enclosed within single quotes. <br>
See NOTES, below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operators and order of
precedence <br>
The following operators are supported: <br>
Operator Meaning Type Precedence <br>

--------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
- negation Arithmetic 12 <br>
~ one&acirc;s complement Bitwise 12 <br>
! not Logical 12 <br>
^ exponentiation Arithmetic 11 <br>
% modulus Arithmetic 10 <br>

&amp;&amp; logical and Logical 3 <br>
&amp;&amp;&amp; logical and[1] Logical 3 <br>
|| logical or Logical 2 <br>
||| logical or[1] Logical 2 <br>
?: conditional Logical 1 <br>
(modulus is the remainder upon division)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[1] The &amp;&amp;&amp; and |||
operators handle null values differently to other operators.
See the section entitled NULL support below for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The operators are applied from
left to right, with those of higher precedence applied
before those with lower precedence. Division by 0 and
modulus by 0 are acceptable and give <br>
a NULL result. The logical operators give a 1 result if the
comparison is true, 0 otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3D Grid names <br>
Anything in the expression which is not a number, operator,
or function name is taken to be a 3D grid name.
Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">volume <br>
x3 <br>
3d.his</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most GRASS raster map layers and
3D grids meet this naming convention. However, if a 3D grid
has a name which conflicts with the above rule, it should be
quoted. For example, <br>
the expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x = a-b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would be interpreted as: x
equals a minus b, whereas</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x = &quot;a-b&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would be interpreted as: x
equals the 3D grid named a-b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x = 3107</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would create x filled with the
number 3107, while</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x = &quot;3107&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would copy the 3D grid 3107 to
the 3D grid x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quotes are not required unless
the 3D grid names look like numbers or contain operators, OR
unless the program is run non-interactively. Examples given
here assume the program is <br>
run interactively. See NOTES, below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r3.mapcalc will look for the 3D
grids according to the user&acirc;s current mapset search
path. It is possible to override the search path and specify
the mapset from which to select <br>
the 3D grid. This is done by specifying the 3D grid name in
the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name@mapset</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the following is a
legal expression:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">result = x@PERMANENT /
y@SOILS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mapset specified does not
have to be in the mapset search path. (This method of
overriding the mapset search path is common to all GRASS
commands, not just r3.mapcalc.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The neighborhood modifier <br>
3D grids are data base files stored in voxel format, i.e.,
three-dimensional matrices of float/double values. In
r3.mapcalc, 3D grids may be followed by a neighborhood
modifier <br>
that specifies a relative offset from the current cell being
evaluated. The format is map[r,c,d], where r is the row
offset, c is the column offset and d is the depth offset.
For <br>
example, map[1,2,3] refers to the cell one row below, two
columns to the right and 3 levels below of the current cell,
map[-3,-2,-1] refers to the cell three rows above, two
col&acirc; <br>
umns to the left and one level below of the current cell,
and map[0,1,0] refers to the cell one column to the right of
the current cell. This syntax permits the development of
<br>
neighborhood-type filters within a single 3D grid or across
multiple 3D grids.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Functions <br>
The functions currently supported are listed in the table
below. The type of the result is indicated in the last
column. F means that the functions always results in a
floating <br>
point value, I means that the function gives an integer
result, and * indicates that the result is float if any of
the arguments to the function are floating point values and
<br>
integer if all arguments are integer.</p>

Note, that the row(), col() and depth() indexing starts with

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Floating point values in the
expression <br>
Floating point numbers are allowed in the expression. A
floating point number is a number which contains a decimal
point: <br>
2.3 12.0 12. .81 <br>
Floating point values in the expression are handled in a
special way. With arithmetic and logical operators, if
either operand is float, the other is converted to float and
the <br>
result of the operation is float. This means, in particular
that division of integers results in a (truncated) integer,
while division of floats results in an accurate floating
<br>
point value. With functions of type * (see table above), the
result is float if any argument is float, integer
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: If you calculate with
integer numbers, the resulting map will be integer. If you
want to get a float result, add the decimal point to integer
number(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want floating point
division, at least one of the arguments has to be a floating
point value. Multiplying one of them by 1.0 will produce a
floating-point result, as will <br>
using float(): <br>
r3.mapcalc &quot;ratio = float(soil.4 - soil.3) /
soil.3)&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NULL support <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Division by zero should result in NULL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Modulus by zero
should result in NULL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; NULL-values in
any arithmetic or logical operation should result in NULL.
(however, &amp;&amp;&amp; and ||| are treated specially, as
described below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&amp;&amp;&amp; and ||| operators observe the following
axioms even when x is NULL: <br>
x &amp;&amp;&amp; false == false <br>
false &amp;&amp;&amp; x == false <br>
x ||| true == true <br>
true ||| x == true</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; NULL-values in
function arguments should result in NULL (however, if(),
eval() and isnull() are treated specially, as described
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The eval()
function always returns its last argument</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The situation
for if() is: <br>
if(x) <br>
NULL if x is NULL; 0 if x is zero; 1 otherwise <br>
if(x,a) <br>
NULL if x is NULL; a if x is non-zero; 0 otherwise <br>
if(x,a,b) <br>
NULL if x is NULL; a if x is non-zero; b otherwise <br>
if(x,n,z,p) <br>
NULL if x is NULL; n if x is negative; <br>
z if x is zero; p if x is positive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The (new)
function isnull(x) returns: 1 if x is NULL; 0 otherwise. The
(new) function null() (which has no arguments) returns an
integer NULL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Non-NULL, but
invalid, arguments to functions should result in NULL. <br>
Examples: <br>
log(-2) <br>
sqrt(-2) <br>
pow(a,b) where a is negative and b is not an integer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NULL support: Please note that
any math performed with NULL cells always results in a NULL
value for these cells. If you want to replace a NULL cell
on-the-fly, use the isnull() <br>
test function in a if-statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: The users wants the
NULL-valued cells to be treated like zeros. To add maps A
and B (where B contains NULLs) to get a map C the user can
use a construction like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C = A + if(isnull(B),0,B)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NULL and conditions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the one argument form: <br>
if(x) = NULL if x is NULL <br>
if(x) = 0 if x = 0 <br>
if(x) = 1 otherwise (i.e. x is neither NULL nor 0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the two argument form: <br>
if(x,a) = NULL if x is NULL <br>
if(x,a) = 0 if x = 0 <br>
if(x,a) = a otherwise (i.e. x is neither NULL nor 0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the three argument form:
<br>
if(x,a,b) = NULL if x is NULL <br>
if(x,a,b) = b if x = 0 <br>
if(x,a,b) = a otherwise (i.e. x is neither NULL nor 0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the four argument form: <br>
if(x,a,b,c) = NULL if x is NULL <br>
if(x,a,b,c) = a if x &gt; 0 <br>
if(x,a,b,c) = b if x = 0 <br>
if(x,a,b,c) = c if x &lt; 0 <br>
More generally, all operators and most functions return NULL
if *any* of their arguments are NULL. <br>
The functions if(), isnull() and eval() are exceptions. <br>
The function isnull() returns 1 if its argument is NULL and
0 otherwise. If the user wants the opposite, the ! operator,
e.g. &quot;!isnull(x)&quot; must be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All forms of if() return NULL if
the first argument is NULL. The 2, 3 and 4 argument forms of
if() return NULL if the &quot;selected&quot; argument is
NULL, e.g.: <br>
if(0,a,b) = b regardless of whether a is NULL <br>
if(1,a,b) = a regardless of whether b is NULL <br>
eval() always returns its last argument, so it only returns
NULL if the last argument is NULL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The user cannot test for
NULL using the == operator, as that returns NULL if either
or both arguments are NULL, i.e. if x and y are both NULL,
then &quot;x == y&quot; and &quot;x != y&quot; <br>
are both NULL rather than 1 and 0 respectively. <br>
The behaviour makes sense if the user considers NULL as
representing an unknown quantity. E.g. if x and y are both
unknown, then the values of &quot;x == y&quot; and &quot;x
!= y&quot; are also <br>
unknown; if they both have unknown values, the user
doesn&acirc;t know whether or not they both have the same
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Usage from command line <br>
Extra care must be taken if the expression is given on the
command line. Some characters have special meaning to the
UNIX shell. These include, among others: <br>
* ( ) &gt; &amp; |</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is advisable to put single
quotes around the expression; e.g.: <br>
&acirc;result = volume * 2&acirc; <br>
Without the quotes, the *, which has special meaning to the
UNIX shell, would be altered and r3.mapcalc would see
something other than the *.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple computations <br>
In general, it&acirc;s preferable to do as much as possible
in each r3.mapcalc command using multi-line input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backwards compatibility <br>
For the backwards compatibility with GRASS 6, if no options
are given, it manufactures file=- (which reads from stdin),
so you can continue to use e.g.: <br>
r3.mapcalc &lt; file <br>
or: <br>
r3.mapcalc &lt;&lt;EOF <br>
foo = 1 <br>
EOF <br>
But unless you need compatibility with previous GRASS GIS
versions, use file= explicitly, as stated above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the map name contains
uppercase letter(s) or a dot which are not allowed to be in
module option names, the r3.mapcalc command will be valid
also without quotes: <br>
r3.mapcalc volume_A=1 <br>
r3.mapcalc volume.1=1 <br>
However, this syntax is not recommended as quotes as stated
above more safe. Using quotes is both backwards compatible
and valid in future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interactive input in command
line <br>
For formulas that the user enters from standard input
(rather than from the command line), a line continuation
feature now exists. If the user adds a backslash to the end
of an <br>
input line, r3.mapcalc assumes that the formula being
entered by the user continues on to the next input line.
There is no limit to the possible number of input lines or
to the <br>
length of a formula.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the r3.mapcalc formula
entered by the user is very long, the map title will contain
only some of it, but most (if not all) of the formula will
be placed into the history file <br>
for the result map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the user enters input to
r3.mapcalc non-interactively on the command line, the
program will not warn the user not to overwrite existing map
layers. Users should therefore <br>
take care to assign program outputs raster map names that do
not yet exist in their current mapsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3D GRID MASK handling <br>
r3.mapcalc follows the common GRASS behavior of raster MASK
handling, so the MASK is only applied when reading an
existing GRASS raster map. This implies that, for example,
the <br>
command: <br>
r3.mapcalc &quot;volume_amplified = volume * 3&quot; <br>
create a map respecting the masked pixels if MASK is
active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, when creating a map
which is not based on any map, e.g. a map from a constant:
<br>
r3.mapcalc &quot;volume_const = 200.0&quot; <br>
the created raster map is limited only by a computation
region but it is not affected by an active MASK. This is
expected because, as mentioned above, MASK is only applied
when <br>
reading, not when writing a raster map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If also in this case the MASK
should be applied, an if() statement including the MASK
should be used, e.g.: <br>
r3.mapcalc &quot;volume_const = if(MASK, 200.0,
null())&quot; <br>
When testing MASK related expressions keep in mind that when
MASK is active you don&acirc;t see data in masked areas even
if they are not NULL. See r.mask for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Random number generator
initialization <br>
The pseudo-random number generator used by the rand()
function can be initialised to a specific value using the
seed option. This can be used to replicate a previous
calcula&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, it can be
initialised from the system time and the PID using the -r
flag. This should result in a different seed being used each
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In either case, the seed will be
written to the map&acirc;s history, and can be seen using
r.info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want other people to be
able to verify your results, it&acirc;s preferable to use
the seed option to supply a seed which is either specified
in the script or generated from a <br>
determenistic process such as a pseudo-random number
generator given an explicit seed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the rand() function
will generate a fatal error if neither the seed option nor
the -s flag are given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To compute the average of two 3D grids a and b: <br>
ave = (a + b)/2 <br>
To form a weighted average: <br>
ave = (5*a + 3*b)/8.0 <br>
To produce a binary representation of 3D grid a so that
category 0 remains 0 and all other categories become 1: <br>
mask = a != 0 <br>
This could also be accomplished by: <br>
mask = if(a) <br>
To mask 3D grid b by 3D grid a: <br>
result = if(a,b) <br>
To change all values below 5 to NULL, keep otherwise: <br>
newmap = if(map &lt; 5, null(), map) <br>
The graph() function allows users to specify a x-y
conversion using pairs of x,y coordinates. In some
situations a transformation from one value to another is not
easily estab&acirc; <br>
lished mathematically, but can be represented by a 2-D graph
and then linearly interpolated. The graph() function
provides the opportunity to accomplish this. An x-axis value
is <br>
provided to the graph function along with the associated
graph represented by a series of x,y pairs. The x values
must be monotonically increasing (each larger than or equal
to <br>
the previous). The graph function linearly interpolates
between pairs. Any x value lower the lowest x value (i.e.
first) will have the associated y value returned. Any x
value <br>
higher than the last will similarly have the associated y
value returned. Consider the request: <br>
newmap = graph(map, 1,10, 2,25, 3,50) <br>
X (map) values supplied and y (newmap) values returned: <br>
0, 10 <br>
1, 10 <br>
1.5, 17.5 <br>
2.9, 47.5 <br>
4, 50 <br>
100, 50</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN ISSUES <br>
The result variable on the left hand side of the equation
should not appear in the expression on the right hand side.
<br>
mymap = if( mymap &gt; 0, mymap, 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any maps generated by a
r3.mapcalc command only exist after the entire command has
completed. All maps are generated concurrently, row-by-row
(i.e. there is an implicit &quot;for row <br>
in rows {...}&quot; around the entire expression). Thus the
#, @, and [ ] operators cannot be used on a map generated
within same r3.mapcalc command run. <br>
newmap = oldmap * 3.14 <br>
othermap = newmap[-1, 0] / newmap[1, 0]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Continuation lines must end with
a &nbsp;and have no trailing white space (blanks or tabs).
If the user does leave white space at the end of
continuation lines, the error messages <br>
produced by r3.mapcalc will be meaningless and the equation
will not work as the user intended. This is particularly
important for the eval() function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, there is no comment
mechanism in r3.mapcalc. Perhaps adding a capability that
would cause the entire line to be ignored when the user
inserted a # at the start of a <br>
line as if it were not present, would do the trick.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The function should require the
user to type &quot;end&quot; or &quot;exit&quot; instead of
simply a blank line. This would make separation of multiple
scripts separable by white space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r3.mapcalc does not print a
warning in case of operations on NULL cells. It is left to
the user to utilize the isnull() function.</p>
