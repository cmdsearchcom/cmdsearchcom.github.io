<p style="margin-top: 1em">wxGUI Interactive Scatter Plot
Tool DESCRIPTION <br>
Interactive Scatter Plot Tool allows analyzing group of
raster maps. The tool is integrated into Supervised
Classification Tool (see the screen shot below). Also it is
possible <br>
to launch it from Map Display Window (Analyze map
&amp;#8594; Interactive Scatter Plot Tool). The main idea of
the tool is that everything is linked together (scatter
plots together <br>
and mapwindow with the scatter plots). The main feature of
the tool is the interactivity, which allows user to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; work with
multiple plots, which represents multiple raster bands
combinations,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; highlight
plotted points in open scatter plots according to currently
chosen pixels for classes by it&acirc;s training areas
(supported only in Supervised Classification Tool),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; be able to
define areas in plots and the tool will highlight pixels in
map display window and corresponding points in other
plots,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; plot of
confidence ellipses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TOOL CONTROLS LAYOUT <br>
If editing mode is activated (the green polygon tool in
toolbar), the areas which were selected in the scatter plots
are highlighted. In the image you can see this area for
scat&acirc; <br>
ter plot of bands B_6, B_7 inside the ellipse. Opacity and
color of the selected area can be set in settings. The area
corresponds to the active class (in this case clouds). <br>
Selected areas are subset of areas, which belongs to the
category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the editing mode it is
possible to select certain area by the polygon, which can be
created and edited by tools in editing toolbar. After the
area is selected, we can include <br>
or exclude it into active category by clicking on the first
(plus) respectively second (minus) tool in the editing
toolbar. In mapwindow corresponding pixels are shown by the
<br>
class raster representing selected areas in scatter plots.
In this case we can see clouds class raster (blue), forest
class raster (green) and water class raster (red).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The tool can analyze only integer (CELL) rasters. It works
with 8 bit range smoothly. The tool is capable of processing
data up to 12 bit range, however it is not recommended <br>
open many scatter plots in 12/11 bit mode. It could require
significant amount of memory and plot rendering time can be
longer. Analyzing of raster data with higher range is <br>
not recommended. The raster range can be lowered using
r.rescale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN ISSUES <br>
Selection of areas in mapwindow is currently supported only
if the tool was launched from Supervised Classification
Tool.</p>
