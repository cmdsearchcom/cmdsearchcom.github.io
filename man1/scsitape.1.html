scsitape - control SCSI tape devices

scsitape [-f &lt;scsi-generic-device&gt;] commands
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <b>scsitape</b> command controls SCSI tape drives in a platform-independent
  manner. As long as 'mtx' works on the platform, so does 'scsitape'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that 'scsitape' and your OS's native tape driver may stomp on each other.
  In particular, if you use 'setblk' and your OS's native tape driver has a
  different notion of the block size, you may get evil results. It is
  recommended to use 'scsitape' only for software where you've written your own
  low-level READ and WRITE routines that use the SCSI command set to directly
  talk to tape drives (i.e., you do not use the OS's native tape driver at all).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The first argument, given following <b>-f</b> , is the SCSI generic device
  corresponding to your tape drive. Consult your operating system's
  documentation for more information (for example, under Linux these are
  generally /dev/sg0 through /dev/sg15, under FreeBSD these are /dev/pass0
  through /dev/passX. Under Solaris this is usually the same as your tape drive
  (Solaris has a SCSI passthrough ioctl). You can set the STAPE or TAPE
  environment variable rather than use -f.

      MAX_READ_SIZE will need to be turned into a settable variable to allow
      bigger reads). If &lt;blocksize&gt; is ommitted, we assume that we're in
      variable block mode, and that we are going to read from tape until we hit
      a tapemark or end of partition or end of tape.

This program was written by Eric Lee Green &lt;eric@badtux.org&gt;. Major
  portions of the 'mtxl.c' library used herein were written by Leonard Zubkoff.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The SCSI read and write routines are based upon those that Richard Fish wrote
  for Enhanced Software Technology's BRU 16.1 product, substantially modified to
  work in our particular environment (in particular, all the variable block
  stuff is new since BRU only does fixed block reads and writes, and the BRU
  code uses bitmasks rather than bitfields for the various flags and such in
  return values, as well as the BRU code having a different SCSI API and having
  variable names considerably shorter than the rather sesquipedalian 'mtx'
  identifiers). As required by 'mtxl.c', these routines are licensed under the
  GNU General Public License.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="HINTS"><a class="selflink" href="#HINTS">HINTS</a></h1>
Under Linux, <b>cat /proc/scsi/scsi</b> will tell you what SCSI devices you
  have. You can then refer to them as <b>/dev/sga,</b> <b>/dev/sgb,</b> etc. by
  the order they are reported.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Under FreeBSD, <b>camcontrol devlist</b> will tell you what SCSI devices you
  have, along with which <b>pass</b> device controls them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Under Solaris 7 and 8, <b>/usr/sbin/devfsadm -C</b> will clean up your /devices
  directory. Then <b>find /devices -name 'st@*' -print</b> will return a list of
  all tape drives. /dev on Solaris is apparently only of historical interest.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS_AND_LIMITATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS_AND_LIMITATIONS">BUGS
  AND LIMITATIONS</a></h1>
for <b>scsitape read 0 &lt;n&gt;</b> where you are doing variable-block-size
  reads and wish for &lt;n&gt; bytes, it instead reads one and exactly one block
  from tape and prints that (no matter what its size). Use 'dd' on the output of
  scsitape if you want finer control.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>scsitape read 0</b> attempts reads of MAX_READ_SIZE, which is currently 128K.
  If blocks on tape are larger than 128K, only the first 128K will be read --
  the remainder will be silently dumped in the toilet.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This program does not interact well (or at all :-) with your OS's native tape
  driver. You will likely see weird things happen if you attempt to intermingle
  scsitape commands with native tape driver operations. Note that BRU 16.1 for
  Solaris (and possibly others, but Solaris I know about) will have a 'scsi'
  keyword to bypass the native tape driver and write via direct uscsi commands,
  so if you use &#x00B4;scsitape&#x00B4; to bypass the flaws of the native
  Solaris driver, you can use BRU 16.1 to write your actual tape archives.
  (Assuming that BRU 16.1 has been released at the time that you read this).

This version of <b>scsitape</b> is currently being maintained by Robert Nelson
  &lt;robertnelson@users.sourceforge.net&gt; as part of the 'mtx' suite of
  programs. The 'mtx' home page is http://mtx.sourceforge.net and the actual
  code is currently available there and via SVN from
