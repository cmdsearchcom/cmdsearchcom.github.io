<p>SCSITAPE(1) General Commands Manual SCSITAPE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
scsitape - control SCSI tape devices</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
scsitape [-f &lt;scsi-generic-device&gt;] commands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The scsitape command controls SCSI tape drives in a
platform-independent manner. As long as &rsquo;mtx&rsquo;
works on the platform, so does &rsquo;scsitape&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that &rsquo;scsitape&rsquo;
and your OS&rsquo;s native tape driver may stomp on each
other. In particular, if you use &rsquo;setblk&rsquo; and
your OS&rsquo;s native tape driver has a different notion of
the <br>
block size, you may get evil results. It is recommended to
use &rsquo;scsitape&rsquo; only for software where
you&rsquo;ve written your own low-level READ and WRITE
routines that use the SCSI <br>
command set to directly talk to tape drives (i.e., you do
not use the OS&rsquo;s native tape driver at all).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The first argument, given following -f , is the SCSI generic
device corresponding to your tape drive. Consult your
operating system&rsquo;s documentation for more information
(for <br>
example, under Linux these are generally /dev/sg0 through
/dev/sg15, under FreeBSD these are /dev/pass0 through
/dev/passX. Under Solaris this is usually the same as your
tape <br>
drive (Solaris has a SCSI passthrough ioctl). You can set
the STAPE or TAPE environment variable rather than use
-f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
setblk &lt;n&gt; <br>
Set the tape drive&rsquo;s SCSI block size to &lt;n&gt;
bytes. (NOTE: if you are using your OS&rsquo;s native tape
driver, THIS IS EVIL!).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fsf &lt;n&gt; Go forward by
&lt;n&gt; tapemarks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bsf &lt;n&gt; Go to immediately
previous the &lt;n&gt;th previous tapemark. (WARNING: This
probably doesn&rsquo;t do what you expect -- e.g. if you are
immediately after a tapemark and type &rsquo;bfs <br>
1&rsquo;, it moves to immediately *before* that tape mark,
for a sum total of zero effective movement!).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eod Go to end of data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rewind Rewind the tape
drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eject Eject the tape currently
in the drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">erase Does a *short* erase
(warning: does NOT work on all drives!).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mark &lt;n&gt; <br>
write &lt;n&gt; filemarks ( &rsquo;mark 0&rsquo; flushes the
drive&rsquo;s buffers ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">seek &lt;n&gt; Seek to a logical
position &lt;n&gt; that was reported by a previous
&rsquo;tapeinfo&rsquo; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">write &lt;blocksize&gt; <br>
write blocks from stdin to the tape. Chunk the data into
&lt;blocksize&gt;-sized chunks. *DOES NOT WRITE OUT A
TAPEMARK!* (you will need to use a subsequent mark 1 command
to <br>
write out a tape mark).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">read [&lt;blocksize&gt;] [
&lt;#blocks/#bytes&gt; ] <br>
read blocks from the tape, write them to stdout. If we are
in variable block mode, &lt;blocksize&gt; should be zero
(note: The maximum block size we currently support in <br>
variable block mode is 128K, MAX_READ_SIZE will need to be
turned into a settable variable to allow bigger reads). If
&lt;blocksize&gt; is ommitted, we assume that we&rsquo;re in
<br>
variable block mode, and that we are going to read from tape
until we hit a tapemark or end of partition or end of
tape.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
This program was written by Eric Lee Green
&lt;eric@badtux.org&gt;. Major portions of the
&rsquo;mtxl.c&rsquo; library used herein were written by
Leonard Zubkoff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SCSI read and write routines
are based upon those that Richard Fish wrote for Enhanced
Software Technology&rsquo;s BRU 16.1 product, substantially
modified to work in our particu&acirc; <br>
lar environment (in particular, all the variable block stuff
is new since BRU only does fixed block reads and writes, and
the BRU code uses bitmasks rather than bitfields for the
<br>
various flags and such in return values, as well as the BRU
code having a different SCSI API and having variable names
considerably shorter than the rather sesquipedalian
&rsquo;mtx&rsquo; <br>
identifiers). As required by &rsquo;mtxl.c&rsquo;, these
routines are licensed under the GNU General Public
License.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HINTS <br>
Under Linux, cat /proc/scsi/scsi will tell you what SCSI
devices you have. You can then refer to them as /dev/sga,
/dev/sgb, etc. by the order they are reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under FreeBSD, camcontrol
devlist will tell you what SCSI devices you have, along with
which pass device controls them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under Solaris 7 and 8,
/usr/sbin/devfsadm -C will clean up your /devices directory.
Then find /devices -name &rsquo;st@*&rsquo; -print will
return a list of all tape drives. /dev on Solaris <br>
is apparently only of historical interest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS AND LIMITATIONS <br>
for scsitape read 0 &lt;n&gt; where you are doing
variable-block-size reads and wish for &lt;n&gt; bytes, it
instead reads one and exactly one block from tape and prints
that (no matter <br>
what its size). Use &rsquo;dd&rsquo; on the output of
scsitape if you want finer control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scsitape read 0 attempts reads
of MAX_READ_SIZE, which is currently 128K. If blocks on tape
are larger than 128K, only the first 128K will be read --
the remainder will be <br>
silently dumped in the toilet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program does not interact
well (or at all :-) with your OS&rsquo;s native tape driver.
You will likely see weird things happen if you attempt to
intermingle scsitape commands <br>
with native tape driver operations. Note that BRU 16.1 for
Solaris (and possibly others, but Solaris I know about) will
have a &rsquo;scsi&rsquo; keyword to bypass the native tape
driver and <br>
write via direct uscsi commands, so if you use
&Acirc;&acute;scsitape&Acirc;&acute; to bypass the flaws of
the native Solaris driver, you can use BRU 16.1 to write
your actual tape archives. (Assuming <br>
that BRU 16.1 has been released at the time that you read
this).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVAILABILITY <br>
This version of scsitape is currently being maintained by
Robert Nelson &lt;robertnelson@users.sourceforge.net&gt; as
part of the &rsquo;mtx&rsquo; suite of programs. The
&rsquo;mtx&rsquo; home page is <br>
http://mtx.sourceforge.net and the actual code is currently
available there and via SVN from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mtx.</p>
