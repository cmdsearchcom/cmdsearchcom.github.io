<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
modes_gui: - Gnuradio Mode-S/ADS-B receiver</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
A Qt Graphical User Interface to display positions and
status messages of aircraft as reported on 1090 MHz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gr-air-modes implements a
software-defined radio receiver for Mode S transponder
signals, including ADS-B reports from equipped aircraft.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mode S is the transponder
protocol used in modern commercial aircraft. A Mode
S-equipped aircraft replies to radar interrogation by either
ground radar (secondary surveillance) <br>
or other aircraft (&quot;Traffic Collision Avoidance
System&quot;, or TCAS). The protocol is an extended version
of the Mode A/C protocol used in transponders since the
1940s. Mode S <br>
reports include a unique airframe identifier (referred to as
the &quot;ICAO number&quot;) and altitude (to facilitate
separation control). This receiver listens to the 1090MHz
downlink <br>
channel; interrogation requests at 1030MHz are not received
or decoded by this program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is a communication protocol
using the Extended Squitter capability of the Mode S
transport layer. There are other implementa&acirc; <br>
tions (VDL Mode 2 and UAT, for instance) but Mode S remains
the primary ADS-B transport for commercial use. The protocol
is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Automatic: it requires no
pilot input</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Dependent: it is dependent on
altimeter, GPS, and other aircraft <br>
instrumentation for information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Surveillance: it provides
current information about the transmitting <br>
aircraft</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Broadcast: it is one-way,
broadcast to all receivers within range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADS-B-equipped aircraft
broadcast (&quot;squitter&quot;) their position, velocity,
flight number, and other interesting information to any
receiver within range of the aircraft. Position <br>
reports are typically generated once per second and flight
indentification every five seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implementation of ADS-B is
mandatory in European airspace as well as in Australia.
North American implementation is still voluntary, with a
mandate arriving in 2020 via the FAA&rsquo;s <br>
&quot;NextGen&quot; program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIRES <br>
An X display, as all user settings as well as displayed data
are handled within the GUI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A GNU Radio supported receiver
for RF capable of 2 Mbits/second sample rate and tuning to
1090 MHz. (Or captured data file or network connection to a
data source.)</p>
