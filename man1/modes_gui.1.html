modes_gui: - Gnuradio Mode-S/ADS-B receiver
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
A Qt Graphical User Interface to display positions and status messages of
  aircraft as reported on 1090 MHz.
<div class="Pp"></div>
gr-air-modes implements a software-defined radio receiver for Mode S transponder
  signals, including ADS-B reports from equipped aircraft.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mode S is the transponder protocol used in modern commercial aircraft. A Mode
  S-equipped aircraft replies to radar interrogation by either ground radar
  (secondary surveillance) or other aircraft (&quot;Traffic Collision Avoidance
  System&quot;, or TCAS). The protocol is an extended version of the Mode A/C
  protocol used in transponders since the 1940s. Mode S reports include a unique
  airframe identifier (referred to as the &quot;ICAO number&quot;) and altitude
  (to facilitate separation control). This receiver listens to the 1090MHz
  downlink channel; interrogation requests at 1030MHz are not received or
  decoded by this program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is a communication protocol
  using the Extended Squitter capability of the Mode S transport layer. There
  are other implementations (VDL Mode 2 and UAT, for instance) but Mode S
  remains the primary ADS-B transport for commercial use. The protocol is:
<div class="Pp"></div>
* Automatic: it requires no pilot input
<div class="Pp"></div>
* Dependent: it is dependent on altimeter, GPS, and other aircraft
<br/>
 instrumentation for information
<div class="Pp"></div>
* Surveillance: it provides current information about the transmitting
<br/>
 aircraft
<div class="Pp"></div>
* Broadcast: it is one-way, broadcast to all receivers within range.
<div class="Pp"></div>
ADS-B-equipped aircraft broadcast (&quot;squitter&quot;) their position,
  velocity, flight number, and other interesting information to any receiver
  within range of the aircraft. Position reports are typically generated once
  per second and flight indentification every five seconds.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Implementation of ADS-B is mandatory in European airspace as well as in
  Australia. North American implementation is still voluntary, with a mandate
  arriving in 2020 via the FAA's &quot;NextGen&quot; program.
