<p>LUNAR(1) General Commands Manual LUNAR(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lunar - a calendar conversion utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lunar [-usthg5b] <br>
lunar [-usthg5b] year month day [hour] <br>
lunar [-usthg5b] -i [-l] year month day [hour] <br>
lunar --help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The lunar program performs date conversion between the
Gregorian Solar Calendar (SC) and the Chinese Lunar Calendar
(LC). Given a date in either calendar, the program also
out&acirc; <br>
puts the corresponding &quot;shengxiao&quot; (animal of the
year) and &quot;ganzhi&quot; characters. The date range
currently covered is from about 1900 A.D. to 2049 A.D.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the sake of convenience, we
choose the convention such that the solar and lunar year
numbers of the first day of a lunar year are the same. For
example, SC 1991.2.15 is LC <br>
1991.1.1, while SC 1991.2.14 is LC 1990.12.30. Moreover, we
choose the convention such that the solar and lunar hour
numbers (in 24-hour clock) of a date are the same, although
<br>
a lunar day starts at 23:00 of a solar day. This means that
SC 1991.2.15.23 is LC 1991.1.2.23, while SC 1991.2.16.0 is
LC 1991.1.2.0, and SC 1991.2.16.1 is LC 1991.1.2.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standard time of the Lunar
Calendar is Beijing (Hong Kong) Standard Time, not GMT. Be
sure to adjust appropriately for other time zones and
&quot;Daylight Saving Time&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the Lunar Calendar, a normal
year has 12 months, and a leap year (run-nian) has 13
months, where the extra month is called a &quot;leap
month&quot; (run-yue). For example, the leap <br>
month that follows immediately the 6-th lunar month is
called the 6-th leap month. A (leap) month is either a short
or long one, which has 29 or 30 days respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are 10 gan&rsquo;s and 12
zhi&rsquo;s. The ganzhi labeling of the year, month, day and
hour of a date is a member of the Cartesian product GxGxGxG,
where G = {1,2,...,60}. For exam&acirc; <br>
ple, &quot;jia-zi&quot; is 1, &quot;yi-chou&quot; is 2, and
so on. The ganzhi of the j-th leap month is the same as that
of the j-th month.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Since lunar was first packaged for Debian in 2002, the
Debian package maintainer has made minor additions such as
Big5 and UTF-8 support. More recently, lunar gained the
ability <br>
to detect system locale and choose the correct character
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lunar now also detects and
displays the current China Standard Time by default, so that
the year month day [hour] parameters are now optional for
solar-to-lunar calendar conver&acirc; <br>
sion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The possible options are</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b output ganzhi in special
&quot;bitmap&quot; characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --utf8 <br>
output hanzi or Chinese characters encoded in UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s output simplified Chinese
(for UTF-8 only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t output traditional Chinese
(for UTF-8 only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, -h, --gb <br>
output hanzi or Chinese characters encoded in
(highest-bit-set) GB code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-5, --big5 <br>
output hanzi or Chinese characters encoded in Big5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i convert a lunar date to solar
date. The default is to convert a solar date to a lunar
date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l indicate the month is a lunar
leap month. This option is meaningful only when the
&quot;-i&quot; option is used.</p>
