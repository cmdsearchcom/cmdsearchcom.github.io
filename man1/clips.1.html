<p>CLIPS(1) C Language Integrated Production System
CLIPS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
clips - an expert system programming language</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
clips [ file.clp ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
CLIPS is a productive development and delivery expert system
tool which provides a complete environment for the
construction of rule and/or object based expert systems.
CLIPS is <br>
being used by numerous users throughout the public and
private community including: all NASA sites and branches of
the military, numerous federal bureaus, government
contractors, <br>
universities, and many companies. The key features of CLIPS
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Knowledge Representation <br>
CLIPS provides a cohesive tool for handling a wide variety
of knowledge with support for three different programming
paradigms: rule-based, object-oriented and procedural. <br>
Rule-based programming allows knowledge to be represented as
heuristics, or &quot;rules of thumb,&quot; which specify a
set of actions to be performed for a given situation.
Object- <br>
oriented programming allows complex systems to be modeled as
modular components (which can be easily reused to model
other systems or to create new components). The proce&acirc;
<br>
dural programming capabilities provided by CLIPS are similar
to capabilities found in languages such as C, Pascal, Ada,
and LISP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portability <br>
CLIPS is written in C for portability and speed and has been
installed on many different computers without code changes.
Computers on which CLIPS has been tested include <br>
an IBM PC running DOS and Windows 95 and a Macintosh running
MacOS and Mach. CLIPS can be ported to any system which has
an ANSI compliant C compiler. CLIPS comes with <br>
all source code which can be modified or tailored to meet a
user&rsquo;s specific needs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Integration/Extensibility <br>
CLIPS can be embedded within procedural code, called as a
subroutine, and integrated with languages such as C, FORTRAN
and ADA. CLIPS can be easily extended by a user <br>
through the use of several well-defined protocols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interactive Development <br>
The standard version of CLIPS provides an interactive, text
oriented development environment, including debugging aids,
on-line help, and an integrated editor. Interfaces <br>
providing features such as pulldown menus, integrated
editors, and multiple windows have been developed for the
Macintosh, Windows 95, and X Window environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verification/Validation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLIPS includes a number of
features to support the verification and validation of
expert systems including support for modular design and
partitioning of a knowledge base, <br>
static and dynamic constraint checking of slot values and
function arguments, and semantic analysis of rule patterns
to determine if inconsistencies could prevent a rule <br>
from firing or generate an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fully Documented <br>
CLIPS comes with extensive documentation including a
Reference Manual and a User&rsquo;s Guide. (provided in the
Debian clips-doc package)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
CLIPS is old software so bugs are not unheard of.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The origins of the C Language Integrated Production System
(CLIPS) date back to 1984 at NASA&rsquo;s Johnson Space
Center. At this time, the Artificial Intelligence Section
(later the <br>
Software Technology Branch, Client/Server Systems Branch,
and now the Information Technology Office) had developed
over a dozen prototype expert systems applications using
state- <br>
of-the-art hardware and software. However, despite extensive
demonstrations of the potential of expert systems, few of
these applications were put into regular use. This failure
<br>
to provide expert systems technology within NASA&rsquo;s
operational computing constraints could largely be traced to
the use of LISP as the base language for nearly all expert
system <br>
software tools at that time. In particular, three problems
hindered the use of LISP based expert system tools within
NASA: the low availability of LISP on a wide variety of
con&acirc; <br>
ventional computers, the high cost of state-of-the-art LISP
tools and hardware, and the poor integration of LISP with
other languages (making embedded applications
difficult).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Artificial Intelligence
Section felt that the use of a conventional language, such
as C, would eliminate most of these problems, and initially
looked to the expert system <br>
tool vendors to provide an expert system tool written using
a conventional language. Although a number of tool vendors
started converting their tools to run in C, the cost of <br>
each tool was still very high, most were restricted to a
small variety of computers, and the projected availability
times were discouraging. To meet all of its needs in a
timely <br>
and cost effective manner, it became evident that the
Artificial Intelligence Section would have to develop its
own C based expert system tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The prototype version of CLIPS
was developed in the spring of 1985 in a little over two
months. Particular attention was given to making the tool
compatible with expert systems <br>
under development at that time by the Artificial
Intelligence Section. Thus, the syntax of CLIPS was made to
very closely resemble the syntax of a subset of the ART
expert system <br>
tool developed by Inference Corporation. Although originally
modelled from ART, CLIPS was developed entirely without
assistance from Inference or access to the ART source
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The original intent for CLIPS
was to gain useful insight and knowledge about the
construction of expert system tools and to lay the
groundwork for the construction of a replace&acirc; <br>
ment tool for the commercial tools currently being used.
Version 1.0 demonstrated the feasibility of the project
concept. After additional development, it became apparent
that <br>
CLIPS would be a low cost expert system tool ideal for the
purposes of training. Another year of development and
internal use went into CLIPS improving its portability,
perfor&acirc; <br>
mance, functionality, and supporting documentation. Version
3.0 of CLIPS was made available to groups outside of NASA in
the summer of 1986.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Further enhancements transformed
CLIPS from a training tool into a tool useful for the
development and delivery of expert systems as well. Versions
4.0 and 4.1 of CLIPS, released <br>
respectively in the summer and fall of 1987, featured
greatly improved performance, external language integration,
and delivery capabilities. Version 4.2 of CLIPS, released in
<br>
the summer of 1988, was a complete rewrite of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLIPS for code modularity. Also
included with this release were an architecture manual
providing a detailed description of the CLIPS software
architecture and a utility program <br>
for aiding in the verification and validation of rule-based
programs. Version 4.3 of CLIPS, released in the summer of
1989, added still more functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Originally, the primary
representation methodology in CLIPS was a forward chaining
rule language based on the Rete algorithm (hence the
Production System part of the CLIPS acro&acirc; <br>
nym). Version 5.0 of CLIPS, released in the spring of 1991,
introduced two new programming paradigms: procedural
programming (as found in languages such as C and Ada;) and
<br>
object-oriented programming (as found in languages such as
the Common Lisp Object System and Smalltalk). The
object-oriented programming language provided within CLIPS
is called <br>
the CLIPS Object-Oriented Language (COOL). Version 5.1 of
CLIPS, released in the fall of 1991, was primarily a
software maintenance upgrade required to support the newly
devel&acirc; <br>
oped and/or enhanced X Window, MS-DOS, and Macintosh
interfaces. Version 6.0, released in the Spring of 1993,
added fully integrated object/rule pattern matching and
support fea&acirc; <br>
tures for rule-based software engineering. Version 6.1,
released in the Summer of 1998, added C++ compatibility and
functions for profiling performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because of its portability,
extensibility, capabilities, and low-cost, CLIPS has
received widespread acceptance throughout the government,
industry, and academia. The development <br>
of CLIPS has helped to improve the ability to deliver expert
system technology throughout the public and private sectors
for a wide range of applications and diverse computing <br>
environments. CLIPS is being used by over 5,000 users
throughout the public and private community including: all
NASA sites and branches of the military, numerous federal
<br>
bureaus, government contractors, universities, and many
private companies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLIPS is now maintained as
public domain software by the main program authors who no
longer work for NASA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There have appeared also
derivative works from CLIPS like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JESS The Java Expert System
Shell, which provides a CLIPS interpreter for the Java
programming language.</p>
