<b>CLIPS</b> is a productive development and delivery expert system tool which
  provides a complete environment for the construction of rule and/or object
  based expert systems. CLIPS is being used by numerous users throughout the
  public and private community including: all NASA sites and branches of the
  military, numerous federal bureaus, government contractors, universities, and
  many companies. The key features of CLIPS are:

  <dd class="It-tag"><b>CLIPS</b> provides a cohesive tool for handling a wide
      variety of knowledge with support for three different programming
      paradigms: rule-based, object-oriented and procedural. Rule-based
      programming allows knowledge to be represented as heuristics, or
      &quot;rules of thumb,&quot; which specify a set of actions to be performed
      for a given situation. Object-oriented programming allows complex systems
      to be modeled as modular components (which can be easily reused to model
      other systems or to create new components). The procedural programming
      capabilities provided by <b>CLIPS</b> are similar to capabilities found in
      languages such as C, Pascal, Ada, and LISP.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="HISTORY"><a class="selflink" href="#HISTORY">HISTORY</a></h1>
The origins of the C Language Integrated Production System (CLIPS) date back to
  1984 at NASA's Johnson Space Center. At this time, the Artificial Intelligence
  Section (later the Software Technology Branch, Client/Server Systems Branch,
  and now the Information Technology Office) had developed over a dozen
  prototype expert systems applications using state-of-the-art hardware and
  software. However, despite extensive demonstrations of the potential of expert
  systems, few of these applications were put into regular use. This failure to
  provide expert systems technology within NASA's operational computing
  constraints could largely be traced to the use of LISP as the base language
  for nearly all expert system software tools at that time. In particular, three
  problems hindered the use of LISP based expert system tools within NASA: the
  low availability of LISP on a wide variety of conventional computers, the high
  cost of state-of-the-art LISP tools and hardware, and the poor integration of
  LISP with other languages (making embedded applications difficult).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The Artificial Intelligence Section felt that the use of a conventional
  language, such as C, would eliminate most of these problems, and initially
  looked to the expert system tool vendors to provide an expert system tool
  written using a conventional language. Although a number of tool vendors
  started converting their tools to run in C, the cost of each tool was still
  very high, most were restricted to a small variety of computers, and the
  projected availability times were discouraging. To meet all of its needs in a
  timely and cost effective manner, it became evident that the Artificial
  Intelligence Section would have to develop its own C based expert system tool.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The prototype version of <b>CLIPS</b> was developed in the spring of 1985 in a
  little over two months. Particular attention was given to making the tool
  compatible with expert systems under development at that time by the
  Artificial Intelligence Section. Thus, the syntax of <b>CLIPS</b> was made to
  very closely resemble the syntax of a subset of the ART expert system tool
  developed by Inference Corporation. Although originally modelled from ART,
  <b>CLIPS</b> was developed entirely without assistance from Inference or
  access to the ART source code.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The original intent for <b>CLIPS</b> was to gain useful insight and knowledge
  about the construction of expert system tools and to lay the groundwork for
  the construction of a replacement tool for the commercial tools currently
  being used. Version 1.0 demonstrated the feasibility of the project concept.
  After additional development, it became apparent that <b>CLIPS</b> would be a
  low cost expert system tool ideal for the purposes of training. Another year
  of development and internal use went into <b>CLIPS</b> improving its
  portability, performance, functionality, and supporting documentation. Version
  3.0 of <b>CLIPS</b> was made available to groups outside of NASA in the summer
  of 1986.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Further enhancements transformed <b>CLIPS</b> from a training tool into a tool
  useful for the development and delivery of expert systems as well. Versions
  4.0 and 4.1 of <b>CLIPS</b>, released respectively in the summer and fall of
  1987, featured greatly improved performance, external language integration,
  and delivery capabilities. Version 4.2 of <b>CLIPS</b>, released in the summer
  of 1988, was a complete rewrite of
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>CLIPS</b> for code modularity. Also included with this release were an
  architecture manual providing a detailed description of the <b>CLIPS</b>
  software architecture and a utility program for aiding in the verification and
  validation of rule-based programs. Version 4.3 of <b>CLIPS</b>, released in
  the summer of 1989, added still more functionality.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Originally, the primary representation methodology in <b>CLIPS</b> was a forward
  chaining rule language based on the Rete algorithm (hence the Production
  System part of the <b>CLIPS</b> acronym). Version 5.0 of <b>CLIPS</b>,
  released in the spring of 1991, introduced two new programming paradigms:
  procedural programming (as found in languages such as C and Ada;) and
  object-oriented programming (as found in languages such as the Common Lisp
  Object System and Smalltalk). The object-oriented programming language
  provided within <b>CLIPS</b> is called the <b>CLIPS</b> Object-Oriented
  Language (COOL). Version 5.1 of <b>CLIPS</b>, released in the fall of 1991,
  was primarily a software maintenance upgrade required to support the newly
  developed and/or enhanced X Window, MS-DOS, and Macintosh interfaces. Version
  6.0, released in the Spring of 1993, added fully integrated object/rule
  pattern matching and support features for rule-based software engineering.
  Version 6.1, released in the Summer of 1998, added C++ compatibility and
  functions for profiling performance.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Because of its portability, extensibility, capabilities, and low-cost,
  <b>CLIPS</b> has received widespread acceptance throughout the government,
  industry, and academia. The development of <b>CLIPS</b> has helped to improve
  the ability to deliver expert system technology throughout the public and
  private sectors for a wide range of applications and diverse computing
  environments. <b>CLIPS</b> is being used by over 5,000 users throughout the
  public and private community including: all NASA sites and branches of the
  military, numerous federal bureaus, government contractors, universities, and
  many private companies.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>CLIPS</b> is now maintained as public domain software by the main program
  authors who no longer work for NASA.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
