<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
run_erl - Redirect Erlang input and output streams on Unix
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The run_erl program is specific to Unix systems. This
program redirects the standard input and standard output
streams so that all output can be logged. It also lets the
program <br>
to_erl connect to the Erlang console, making it possible to
monitor and debug an embedded system remotely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information about the
use, see the Embedded System User&rsquo;s Guide in System
Documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXPORTS <br>
run_erl [-daemon] pipe_dir/ log_dir &quot;exec command arg1
arg2 ...&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-daemon: <br>
This option is highly recommended. It makes run_erl run in
the background completely detached from any controlling
terminal and the command returns to the caller imme&acirc;
<br>
diately. Without this option, run_erl must be started using
several tricks in the shell to detach it completely from the
terminal in use when starting it. The option <br>
must be the first argument to run_erl on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pipe_dir: <br>
The named pipe, usually /tmp/. It must be suffixed by a /
(slash), that is, /tmp/epipes/, not /tmp/epipes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_dir: <br>
The log files, that is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* One log file, run_erl.log,
which logs progress and warnings from the run_erl program
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Up to five log files at
maximum 100 KB each with the content of the standard streams
from and to the command. (Both the number of logs and sizes
can be changed by <br>
environment variables, see section Environment Variables
below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the logs are full, run_erl
deletes and reuses the oldest log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;exec command arg1 arg2
...&quot;: <br>
A space-separated string specifying the program to be
executed. The second field is typically a command name such
as erl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES CONCERNING THE LOG FILES
<br>
While running, run_erl sends all output, uninterpreted, to a
log file. The file is named erlang.log.N, where N is an
integer. When the log is &quot;full&quot; (default log size
is 100 KB), <br>
run_erl starts to log in file erlang.log.(N+1), until N
reaches a certain number (default 5), whereupon N starts at
1 again and the oldest files start getting overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no output comes from the
Erlang shell, but the Erlang machine still seems to be
alive, an &quot;ALIVE&quot; message is written to the log;
it is a time stamp and is written, by default, <br>
after 15 minutes of inactivity. Also, if output from Erlang
is logged, but more than 5 minutes (default) has passed
since last time we got anything from Erlang, a time stamp is
<br>
written in the log. The &quot;ALIVE&quot; messages look as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">===== ALIVE
&lt;date-time-string&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other time stamps look as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=====
&lt;date-time-string&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">date-time-string is the date and
time the message is written, default in local time (can be
changed to UTC if needed). It is formatted with the ANSI-C
function strftime using the <br>
format string %a %b %e %T %Z %Y, which produces messages
like ===== ALIVE Thu May 15 10:13:36 MEST 2003; this can be
changed, see the next section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables are recognized by
run_erl and change the logging behavior. For more
information, see the previous section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUN_ERL_LOG_ALIVE_MINUTES: <br>
How long to wait for output (in minutes) before writing an
&quot;ALIVE&quot; message to the log. Defaults to 15,
minimum is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUN_ERL_LOG_ACTIVITY_MINUTES:
<br>
How long Erlang needs to be inactive before output is
preceded with a time stamp. Defaults to
RUN_ERL_LOG_ALIVE_MINUTES div 3, minimum is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUN_ERL_LOG_ALIVE_FORMAT: <br>
Specifies another format string to be used in the strftime C
library call. That is, specifying this to &quot;%e-%b-%Y, %T
%Z&quot; gives log messages with time stamps like
15-May-2003, <br>
10:23:04 MET. For more information, see the documentation
for the C library function strftime. Defaults to &quot;%a %b
%e %T %Z %Y&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUN_ERL_LOG_ALIVE_IN_UTC: <br>
If set to anything else than 0, it makes all times displayed
by run_erl to be in UTC (GMT, CET, MET, without Daylight
Saving Time), rather than in local time. This does not <br>
affect data coming from Erlang, only the logs output
directly by run_erl. Application SASL can be modified
accordingly by setting the Erlang application variable
utc_log to <br>
true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUN_ERL_LOG_GENERATIONS: <br>
Controls the number of log files written before older files
are reused. Defaults to 5, minimum is 2, maximum is
1000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUN_ERL_LOG_MAXSIZE: <br>
The size, in bytes, of a log file before switching to a new
log file. Defaults to 100000, minimum is 1000, maximum is
about 2^30.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUN_ERL_DISABLE_FLOWCNTRL: <br>
If defined, disables input and output flow control for the
pty opend by run_erl. Useful if you want to remove any risk
of accidentally blocking the flow control by using <br>
Ctrl-S (instead of Ctrl-D to detach), which can result in
blocking of the entire Beam process, and in the case of
running heart as supervisor even the heart process becomes
<br>
blocked when writing log message to terminal, leaving the
heart process unable to do its work.</p>
