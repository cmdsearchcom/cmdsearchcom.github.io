This program tries to help you find a letter mnemonic matching a given phone
  number.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It emits to standard output each possible pronounceable mnemonic, one per line,
  using the American standard mapping of dial letters to numbers (2 goes to ABC,
  3 to DEF, 4 to GHI, 5 to JKL, 6 to MNO, 7 to PRS, 8 to TUV, 9 to XYZ).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program uses a table of pronounceable letter-triples derived from a
  dictionary scan. Each potential mnemonic must be such that all of its
  letter-triples are in the table to be emitted. About 30% of possible triples
  are considered pronounceable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A typical 7-digit phone number has 19,683 possible mnemonics, but this test
  usually cuts the list down to a few hundred or so, a reasonable number to
  eyeball-check. For some numbers, the list will, sadly, be empty.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It's best to leave out punctuation such as dashes and parens.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
The filtering method doesn't know what plausible medial triples are not
  reasonable at the beginnings and ends of words.
<div class="Pp"></div>
I'm not sure what table position 0 (which is what 0 and 1 are mapped to) means.
  If you figure it out, you tell me. I really should have generated my own
  table, but that would have been more work than this seemed worth -- if your
  number contains either, you probably need to generate your mnemonic in
  disjoint pieces around the digits anyway.
