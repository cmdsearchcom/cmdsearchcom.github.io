<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perldelta - what is new for perl v5.16.3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.16.2
release and the 5.16.3 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.16.1, first read perl5162delta,
which describes differences between 5.16.1 and 5.16.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Core Enhancements <br>
No changes since 5.16.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
This release contains one major and a number of minor
security fixes. These latter are included mainly to allow
the test suite to pass cleanly with the clang
compiler&rsquo;s address <br>
sanitizer facility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVE-2013-1667: memory exhaustion
with arbitrary hash keys <br>
With a carefully crafted set of hash keys (for example
arguments on a URL), it is possible to cause a hash to
consume a large amount of memory and CPU, and thus possibly
to <br>
achieve a Denial-of-Service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This problem has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wrap-around with IO on long
strings <br>
Reading or writing strings greater than 2**31 bytes in size
could segfault due to integer wraparound.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This problem has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">memory leak in Encode <br>
The UTF-8 encoding implementation in Encode.xs had a memory
leak which has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.16.0.
If any exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deprecations <br>
There have been no deprecations since 5.16.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
Updated Modules and Pragmata <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Encode has been upgraded from version 2.44
to version 2.44_01.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Module::CoreList
has been upgraded from version 2.76 to version 2.76_02.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; XS::APItest has
been upgraded from version 0.38 to version 0.39.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known Problems <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acknowledgements <br>
Perl 5.16.3 represents approximately 4 months of development
since Perl 5.16.2 and contains approximately 870 lines of
changes across 39 files from 7 authors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl continues to flourish into
its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and
developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that <br>
became Perl 5.16.3:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Andy Dougherty, Chris
&rsquo;BinGOs&rsquo; Williams, Dave Rolsky, David Mitchell,
Michael Schroeder, Ricardo Signes, Yves Orton.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list above is almost
certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from
version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much <br>
appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl
bug tracker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a more complete list of all
of Perl&rsquo;s historical contributors, please see the
AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . <br>
There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the
Perl Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the bug you are reporting has
security implications, which make it inappropriate to send
to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to
<br>
perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the
core committers, who will be able to help assess the impact
<br>
of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the
release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use <br>
this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for
modules independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
