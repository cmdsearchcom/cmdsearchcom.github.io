<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bristol - a synthesiser emulation package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
startBristol -mini -jack -midi seq [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
bristol is a vintage synthesiser software emulator suite.
The application consists of an engine itself called bristol
and a graphical user interface called brighton. The
graphi&acirc; <br>
cal interface is a bitmap manipulation library to present
the diverse synth devices such as potentiometers, buttons,
sliders, patch cables and which generates the messages to
<br>
configure the synth emulator. The engine is an
infrastructure that hosts the emulator code that couples
together the different audio operators required to generate
the audio. <br>
The engine and GUI are started together with the
startBristol script which sets up the required environment
for the two to connect together. It is not generally
envisaged that <br>
bristol and brighton be started outside of the script
however there are options to the script to only start one or
the other. Bristol also has a command line interface that
can <br>
be used rather than the GUI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default connection between
the engine and GUI is a TCP socket using a SYSEX format
message taken from MIDI. Optionally the code will use a unix
domain socket for improved <br>
security. The GUI and engine do not need to be resident on
the same system if suitable parameters are given, this
feature requires the TCP domain sockets be used. The engine
can <br>
also accept requests from multiple brighton interfaces and
run all the emulators at the same time, multitimbraly,
sharing voices between them and pre-empting where necessary.
If <br>
an emulator is started in monophonic mode then it is
preallocated a voice that will never be pre-empted and which
runs continuously, ie, by default it will continue to run
even <br>
when no piano keys are pressed. The polyphonic code will
only run the voice algorithms whilst the key gate is open,
the gate being derived from the voice envelope state. The
<br>
engine supports minimally 32 voices per default, if an
emulator requests less then its emulation is configured with
a soft limit. If more are requested then more voices are
cre&acirc; <br>
ated however the upper limit is imposed at 128 voices. A
voice is an engine structure that allows for allocation and
executing, the actual code run by a voice can be any of the
<br>
emulator algorithms which is how multitimbral operation is
supported. The voice allocation process is &rsquo;last note
precedence&rsquo; and whilst others are available for the
monophonic <br>
instruments, this is the only polyphonic assignment
algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This package should be started
with the startBristol script. The script will start up the
bristol synthesiser binaries, evaluating the correct library
paths and executable paths. <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Synthesiser:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-voices &lt;n&gt; <br>
The selected emulator will start with this number of voices.
The engine will always create 32 voices but only allocate
this subset to the emulator. If the selected value <br>
is greater than 32 then the greater number of voices is
allocated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mono Run the emulator in
monophonic mode. This is not really an alias for
&rsquo;-voices 1&rsquo; as it additionally configures
parameters such as &rsquo;-retrig -lvel -wwf -hnp&rsquo;.
These addi&acirc; <br>
tional options can be overridden if desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lnp Select low note precedence
logic. This only applies to monophonic synthesisers and all
of the note precedence affect the legato playing style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hnp Select high note precedence
logic. This only applies to monophonic synthesisers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nnp Select no note precedence,
this is the default and operates as a last note precedence
selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-retrig <br>
Request a trigger event for each note that is played AND
notes that are released. The trigger will cause the
envelopes to cycle. They will not return to zero by default
<br>
however some of the emulations have that as a GUI control.
Without this flag triggers are only sent for the first
pressed note of a sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lvel Configure velocity
inheritance for all legato notes - the first note of a
sequence will have a velocity value that is applied to all
subsequent notes. This option is a <br>
toggle: applying twice will disable the feature. This is
important with regards to the emulators as many of the mono
synths with set lvel per default. The following <br>
options may not work as expected:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">startBristol -mini -lvel</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The issue is that -mini enables
legato velocity so the -lvel switch will toggle it off
again. The same applies to -retrig.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-channel &lt;c&gt; <br>
Start the emulator to respond on this MIDI channel, default
1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lowkey &lt;n&gt; <br>
Configure the lowest note for which the emulator should
respond. This defaults to &rsquo;0&rsquo; but can be used to
define key splits and ranges for different synths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-highkey &lt;n&gt; <br>
Configure the highest note for which the emulator should
respond. This defaults to &rsquo;127&rsquo; but can be used
to define key splits and ranges for different synths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-detune &lt;%&gt; <br>
Request the emulator run with a level of temperature
sensitivity. The default value is defined by the emulator,
typically 100 or 200. The detune is applied to a voice at
<br>
note on only and is a random value within the range defined
here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gain &lt;gn&gt; <br>
Output signal gain level for the emulator. These can be used
to normalise the signal levels from different synths when
played together. The default value is defined by the <br>
synth itself, this is an override.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pwd &lt;s&gt; <br>
Pitch wheel depth in semitones, default 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-velocity &lt;v&gt; <br>
Velocity curve for the emulator. Default is 520, an
exponential curve for a hard playing style. Value
&rsquo;0&rsquo; is flat (no touch sensitivity). Values up to
100 are linear <br>
scaled maps. The velocity map is table of points that is
interpolated linearly: you may only have to define the
inflexion points, however if you want smooth curves you <br>
will have to define each of the 128 velocity values that are
used in noteon/noteoff events. The emulation only has a
single table of gain levels for each key.velocity <br>
index, the engine by contrast has two tables, one for each
on/off event however that is an integer map, not a gain
map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several default tables
if you do not want to specify your own interpolated curve.
Each table is the gain for the Midi velocity value given in
the note event, it <br>
has 128 entries. The following are implmented:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">100-199 Convex curves for a soft
touch keyboard player <br>
200-499 Concave curves for a hard touch, linear up to
quadratic function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next set up to 525 are
repeats of the above but with less granularity. In the above
range the value of 200 is linear, as is 510 below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">500-509 Convex curves for a soft
touch keyboard player <br>
510 linear <br>
511-25 Concave curves for a hard touched player.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then there are a couple of
specific curves</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">550 logarithmic <br>
560 parabolic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The values up to 100 consists of
two digit numbers. The first digit defines how late the line
starts (it is linear) to ramp up, and the second digit is
how late it reaches <br>
1.0. The value of 09 is almost the linear mapping above as
it starts from 0 and ends almost at the end. A value of 49
would be for a heavy player, it is zero for a large <br>
part of the velocity table, and then ramps up to max gain
(1.0) close the end of the table. Note that these table
could also have been defined with velocityMap definitions
<br>
as they are linear interpolations. A present release will
include curves to smooth things out a little.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option 520 is a squared
powercurve and feels quite natural although that is very
subjective. Perhaps its natural for a hard player and it
could be a better default than <br>
the linear curve.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value 1000 will invert the
mapping, so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1510 - linear from 1.0 down to
0.0 as velocity increases <br>
1520 - exponential, from 1.0 down to 0.0 as velocity
increases</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The engine mapping is applied
before the emulation mapping given here. There are
reasonable arguments to make this table logarithmic - you
are welcome to do so. There are <br>
no limits to the values here other than negative values are
not mapped, so this table can also be used to compensate for
volume levels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-glide &lt;s&gt; <br>
Duration of nogte glide in seconds, default 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-emulate &lt;name&gt; <br>
Search for the named emulator and invoke it, otherwise exit.
Invoking an emulation this was is currently the default, it
implies extra parameters for voicecount, gain, <br>
glide, pitchwheel depth, detune, etc. The default is
hammondB3. The -emulate option also implies -register to the
emulator name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-register &lt;name&gt; <br>
Use a specific name when registering with Jack and ALSA. By
default the engine will use the name &rsquo;bristol&rsquo;
however this can be confusing if multiple engines are being
used <br>
and this can be used to override the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lwf Select lightweight filters
for the emulator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nwf Select normalweight
filters, the default. These are about twice as expensive as
lightweight filters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wwf Select welterweight
filters, this are again about double the CPU load as the
normal filters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hwf Select heavyweight filters.
These are roughly twice the welterweight filter. Whilst
their is a noticable audible difference between -lwf and
-nwf, it is debatable whether <br>
the difference between -nwf, -wwf and -hwf is other than
visible in the CPU load. The default filter for any -mono
synth is -wwf which can be overridden with something <br>
line &rsquo;-mini -mono -nwf&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-blo &lt;h&gt; <br>
Number of bandwidth limited harmonics to map. The value of
zero will select infintite bandwidth, default is 31.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-blofraction &lt;f&gt; <br>
The engine uses precomputed tables for all frequencies where
the maximum harmonic does not exceed this fraction of the
samplerate. The default, 0.8, is already above <br>
nyquist as a tradeoff betweeen content and distortion.
Values tending towards 1.0 are heavily aliased at the higher
frequencies naturally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-scala &lt;file&gt; <br>
The engine will read the given scala file and map it into
its frequency tables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User Interface:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quality &lt;n&gt; <br>
The color cache depth will affect the rendering speed. The
lower values start showing loss of clarity, the higher
values start using thousands of colors which is where the
<br>
performance is affected, value is bpp, default is 6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-scale &lt;s&gt; <br>
Each of the emulators has a default window sisze, this size
can be scaled up or downwards if desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-width &lt;n&gt; <br>
The pixel width defines the smaller of two sizees that can
be configured. It works with the -scale and -autozoom
options for flipping between different sizes on mouse <br>
Enter/Leave of the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-autozoom <br>
Minimise window on exit, maximise on enter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-raise Automatically raise the
window on Enter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lower Automatically lower the
window on Leave. It is noted here that the use of autozoom,
raise and lower may have undesirable effects with some
window managers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rud Constrain the rotary
controller tracking to mouse up/down motion, not to actually
track the mouse position. The value will be a fraction of
the current window size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-antialias &lt;%&gt; <br>
For some window sizes there will be pixelation of the
rendered imagas unless some antialias is applied. With large
zoom values this is automatically set up. Value is a <br>
percentage, default is 30.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-aliastype
&lt;pre/texture/all&gt; <br>
There are three antialiasing options,
&Acirc;&acute;pre&Acirc;&acute; will apply it to the text
silkscreens, &Acirc;&acute;texture&Acirc;&acute; will apply
it to the surface bitmaps and
&Acirc;&acute;all&Acirc;&acute; will apply it everywhere
<br>
including devices rendered. The default is pre however this
parameter is only applied if -antialias has a value other
than zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-opacity &lt;%&gt; <br>
Brighton uses a transparency layer for some features such as
the ARP 2600 patch cables. This is the default transparency.
It can be adjusted later with the ^o/^O/^t con&acirc; <br>
trol codes in the GUI. Default is 50 percent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pixmap <br>
Use the X11 pixmap interface rather than the default XImage
interface to the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dct &lt;ms&gt; <br>
Double click timeout for button events, etc, 250 ms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tracking <br>
Prevent the GUI piano keyboard image from tracking MIDI
events, small reduction in CPU overhead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keytoggle <br>
The default GUI behaviour for tuning keys on with the mouse
is to latch them, this allows for playing chords on the
polyphonics. This option will disable the latch to that <br>
keys are played only whilst held with the mousebutton.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-neutral <br>
Initial the emulator with a null patch, all parameters will
have the value of zero to allow for a patch to be built from
the bottom up, completely from scratch. This is <br>
equivalent to &rsquo;-load -1&rsquo;, negative memory
locations will not be saved, ie, you cannot save to the null
patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-load &lt;m&gt; <br>
Initial memory number to load at startup. Default is 0 for
most emulators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-import &lt;pathname&gt; <br>
Import a memory from a disk file to the active patch at
start time. This patch can then be saved to another location
and allows for interexchange of memories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbi &lt;m&gt; <br>
The master bank index allows for access to extra memory ID.
This value times 1000 is added to the memory ID saved/loaded
by the GUI so the GUI can access for example 8 <br>
banks of 8 memories but using -mbi you can actually save
multiple sets of 64 memories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-activesense &lt;ms&gt; <br>
The rate at which hello messages are sent from GUI to engine
to ensure it is still active. If the transmission fails then
the GUI will exit, if the engine does not receive <br>
updates it will also exit. Zero will disable active
sense.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ast &lt;m&gt; <br>
The engine timeout period on active sense messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mct &lt;m&gt; <br>
The MIDI cycle timeout is a busy waiting GUI timer for MIDI
events, used when the GUI takes a MIDI interface for direct
event tracking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ar|-aspect <br>
All of the emulators will attempt to maintain an aspect
ratio for their windows so that they look
&rsquo;normal&rsquo;. This conflicts with some tiling window
managers so can be dis&acirc; <br>
abled. It may also cause some excessive remapping of windows
when they are resized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iconify <br>
Open the window in the iconified state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-window <br>
Do not map any window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cli Enable the text based
command line interface to the engine. This can be used in
connjuction with -window however if compiled without support
for any windowing system the <br>
-window option is implied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-libtest <br>
Do not start the engine, nor attempt to connect to it, just
post the GUI for testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GUI Shortcuts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operational options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-engine <br>
Do not start a new engine. The GUI will attempt to connect
to an existing engine on the host and port configuration
(cq). If the connection is built then the engine will <br>
operate both emulators and voice allocations will be shared
amongst them. All of the emulator outputs are folded back
onto the same stereo output, excepting where extra <br>
Jack control inputs are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gui Do not start the GUI, only
the engine. The GUI will attempt to connect to the engine on
the configured host and port values. If it does not respond
then the GUI will exit <br>
with some rather terse messaging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-server <br>
Start the engine as a permanant server that does not exit
with the last emulator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-daemon <br>
Run the engine as a daemon with disconnected controlling
terminal. This does not imply the -server option, nor does
it imply the -log option for logging to the file sys&acirc;
<br>
tem, nor -syslog which might also be applicable to a
daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-watchdog &lt;s&gt; <br>
Timeout for the audio thread initialisation. If the thread
does not activate within this period then the engine will
gracefully exit rather than wait around for connec&acirc;
<br>
tions indefinitely. Default period is 30 seconds. This is
not active in -server or -daemon mode. In normal operation
the audio thread will be launched within a couple of <br>
seconds but if the engine and GUI are started separately
then this timeout demands that a GUI be started before the
timer expires.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-log Redirect logging output to
a file. The default file is /var/log/bristol.log and
/var/log/brighton.log and if they are not available then
$HOME/.bristol/log directory is <br>
used. The selection of /var/log is to prevent logging to
root in the event that the engine is invoked by this
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-syslog <br>
Redirect logging output to syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-console <br>
Maintain the controlling terminal as output for logging
messages, remove the timestampes for readability purposes.
This can also be configured with the environment vari&acirc;
<br>
able BRISTOL_LOG_CONSOLE=true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rc Do not load any bristolrc
parameter file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-exec The final process to be
requested by the startBristol script will be called as an
exec such that it maintains amongst other things the PID of
the parent. This option will <br>
override the exec and leave the script waiting for the
processes to exit. There implications of not using this
parameter, some of the cleanup code is part of the wrapping
<br>
shellscript, per default this is not called due to the exec
request. This flag is default but should only really be
required for LADI compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stop Stop all the running
bristol engines. This will indirectly result in termination
of any GUI due to active sensing although that can be
disabled. The use case is to stop <br>
any -server -daemon engines running in the background. The
back end to the option is pkill.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-exit Stop all the running
bristol engines and GUI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kill &lt;-emulator&gt; <br>
Stop all the running bristol engines and GUI that have been
associated with the given emulator. If bristol was started
with &rsquo;-mini&rsquo; it can now be killed with -mini so
that <br>
other emulators are not terminated. If there are multiple
mini running they will naturally die also. If the engine is
running multitimbral GUI then the other associated <br>
GUI will also exit in addition to the mini.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cache &lt;pathname&gt; <br>
The default location for new memories and emulator profiles,
the default is ~/.bristol and it will be searched before the
system/factory default directory <br>
/usr/local/share/bristol when emulators are started and
memories are loaded. If the pathname does not exist then it
is created if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-memdump &lt;pathname&gt;
[-emulate &lt;synth&gt;] <br>
Create the target directory
&lt;pathname&gt;/memory/&lt;synth&gt; and copy first the
factory default memories for the synth, then the user
private memories. This can be used with ses&acirc; <br>
sion management to make a copy of all synth memories in a
session. If the target directory already exists then no copy
operation takes place but the directory does replace <br>
the -cache default to make this the new location for saved
memories for that session. The -emulate option is required,
if it is not provided then the default hammondB3 is <br>
taken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-debug &lt;1-16&gt; <br>
Debug level, values above 12 can be very verbose and only
the value 0 is arguably realtime safe as it avoids printf()
in the engine compute thread.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-readme [-&lt;e&gt;] <br>
Display the program readme information. Show the readme for
just a single emulator if desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-glwf Only allow the use of
&rsquo;-lwf&rsquo; for all emulators, no overrides.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-host &lt;hostname&gt; <br>
Connect to the engine on the hostname, default is localhost.
This is used in conjuction with -engine to distribute the
GUI. The hostname accepts syntax such as host&acirc; <br>
name:port to fix both the host and port for a remote
connection to the engine. If the host portion is the token
&rsquo;unix&rsquo; then a local named socket is created
rather than a <br>
TCP connection. In this instance a specific port number can
be given to create the named socket /tmp/br.&lt;port&gt; and
if the port is not specified then a random numeric index
<br>
is chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-port &lt;p&gt; <br>
Connect to the given TCP port for GUI/engine messaging,
default 5028. If the port is alreeady in use then the
startup with fail. For starting multiple bristols with GUI
<br>
then this option should be discarded and the script will
look for a free port number for each invocation. It is
incorrect to mix this option with -host parameters that <br>
take a value host:port or unix:port as the results will be
indeterminate depending on the order the parameters are
submitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quiet Redirect debug and
diagnostic output to /dev/null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gmc Open a MIDI interface in
the GUI. Per default the engine will own the only MIDI
interface for bristol and will redistribute events to the
GUI. It is possible to disable <br>
the forwarding and attach both GUI and engine to midi
devices if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-forward <br>
Disable MIDI event forwarding globally. Per default the
engine opens a MIDI interface and is connected to the
physical keyboards, control surfaces and/or sequencers. It
<br>
will forward MIDI events to the GUI for tracking. This
option disables the feature. When disabled the GUI will not
reflect the piano keybaord state, nor will it track CC <br>
motion unless the options &rsquo;-gmc&rsquo; is given to
open a MIDI connection in the GUI and that the user connects
the same control surfaces to the GUI via this alternative
chan&acirc; <br>
nel. This option is logically identical to
&Acirc;&acute;-localforward
-remoteforward&Acirc;&acute;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-localforward <br>
This will prevent the GUI from forwarding MIDI messages to
the engine. This is not to prevent MIDI message loops as the
forwarding only ever occurs from MIDI interfaces to <br>
TCP connections between GUI and engine. This option will
prevent messages from any surfaces that are connected to the
GUI from forwarding to the engine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-remoteforward <br>
This will prevent the engine from forwarding to the GUI but
still allow the GUI to forward to the engine. If the GUI is
given a MIDI connection with the -gmc option, and <br>
control surfaces are applied to both processes then the
-forward option should be used to globally prevent event
redistribution. Failure to do so will not result in loops,
<br>
just one-for-one duplication of events. It is possible to
connect the control surfaces just to the GUI when the -gmc
option is used, this gives the possibility to have a <br>
local keyboard and GUI but drive an engine on a remote
systems. Their is admittedly additional latency involved
with handling the MIDI messages from the GUI to the remote
<br>
engine over TCP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-oss Configure OSS defaults for
audio and MIDI interfaces</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-alsa Configure ALSA defaults
for audio and MIDI interfaces. The MIDI interface is an ALSA
SEQ port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jack Configure Jack defaults
for audio and MIDI interfaces. At the time of writing this
option causes some issues as it selects Jack MIDI which
currently requires a bridging <br>
daemon to operate. The options &rsquo;-jack -midi seq&rsquo;
would be a more typical configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jackstats <br>
Do not request audio parameters from the jack server, take
the bristol system defaults or the configured parameters.
The bristol defaults will invariably fail however the <br>
call to bristoljackstats is sometimes superfluous and this
can speed up the initial startup times. Using this parameter
will typically require that the options -rate and <br>
-count are also provided. TP -jsmuuid &lt;UUID&gt; This is
for sole use of the Jack Session Manager</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jsmfile &lt;path&gt; <br>
This is for sole use of the Jack Session Manager</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jsmd &lt;ms&gt; <br>
Jack session manager delay before session events are
distributed internally. Event execution is delayed in the
GUI by a default of 5000ms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-session <br>
Disable all session management including JSM and LADI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sleep &lt;n&gt; <br>
Stall the initialisation process for &rsquo;n&rsquo;
seconds. This is to work around what appears to be race a
condition when using a session manager to initialise
multiple bristol <br>
clients as they all vie for the same TCP port
identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jdo Jack Dual Open: let the
audio and midi threads register as independent clients with
Jack. Per default the audio thread will open as a jack
client and the MIDI connection <br>
is piggypbacked as another port rather than as another
client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o &lt;filename&gt; <br>
Generate a raw audio output of the final stage samples to a
file. The format will be 16bit stereo interleaved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nrp Enable support for NRP
events in both GUI and engine. This is to be used with care
as NRP in the engine can have unexpected results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-enrp Enable NRP support in the
engine only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gnrp Enable NRP events in the
GUI. This is required to allow the GUI (and hence the
engine) to be driven from some MIDI control surfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nrpcc &lt;n&gt; <br>
Maximum number of NRP to map. The default is 128, seen as
sufficient for any of the current emulators but the mixer
will require more if it is every released.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Audio driver:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-audio [oss|alsa|jack] <br>
Audio driver overrides. Depending on the order of the
switches it is possible to set a group of global defaults
(-jack/oss/alsa) then have specific re-selection of
compo&acirc; <br>
nents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-audiodev &lt;dev&gt; <br>
Audio device name. For Jack, this will be the name
registered with the Jack daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-count &lt;samples&gt; <br>
Number of samples/frames in processing period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-outgain &lt;gn&gt; <br>
Output signal normalisation level, per emulator default
4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ingain &lt;gn&gt; <br>
Input signal normalisation level, per emulator default
4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-preload &lt;periods&gt; <br>
Number of audio buffers to prewrite to the audio output on
start. This is not active with the Jack drivers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rate &lt;hz&gt; <br>
Sampling rate, defaults to 44100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-priority &lt;p&gt; <br>
Realtime priority requested by the engine audio thread,
default 75. Zero will disable RT processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-autoconn <br>
Automatically connect the engine input and output to the
first Jack IO ports found. This can also be achieved with
the environment variable BRISTOL_AUTOCONN=true</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-multi &lt;c&gt; <br>
Multiple IO port requests, only works with Jack and
currently only the ARP 2600 gives access to these ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-migc &lt;f&gt; <br>
Input signal normalisation level for the multi IO ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mogc &lt;f&gt; <br>
Output signal normalisation level for the multi IO
ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Midi driver:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-midi [oss|[raw]alsa|jack] <br>
Audio driver overrides. Depending on the order of the
switches it is possible to set a group of global defaults
(-jack/oss/alsa) then have specific re-selection of
compo&acirc; <br>
nents such as in &Acirc;&acute;-jack -midi
seq&Acirc;&acute;. The default MIDI driver is &rsquo;-midi
seq&rsquo; but that can be overriden with compile time
options such as --enable-jack-default-midi to ./con&acirc;
<br>
figure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mididev &lt;dev&gt; <br>
MIDI device namee to be opened (OSS/ALSA).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mididbg <br>
Request MIDI level 1 debuging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mididbg2 <br>
Request MIDI level 2 debuging. Both can be selected for
level 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sysid &lt;0xXXXXXXXX&gt; <br>
Configure an alternative SYSEX identifier for the engine.
The default is the value 0x534C6162 for historical reasons,
this is not a free development ID but it is not <br>
assigned so should not cause conflict.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LADI driver (level 1
compliant):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ladi brighton <br>
Execute LADI messages in the GUI only</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ladi bristol <br>
Execute LADI messages in the engine only</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ladi &lt;memory&gt; <br>
The LADI state memory for save operations. This should be
unique for each LADI session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
startBristol -mini <br>
Run a minimoog using ALSA interface for audio and midi
(seq). The emulator will default to monophonic, high note
precedence with retrigger and legato velocity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">startBristol -alsa <br>
Run a hammondB3 using ALSA interface for audio and midi.
This is equivalent to all the following options: -b3 -audio
alsa -audiodev plughw:0,0 -midi seq -mididev plughw:0 <br>
-count 256 -preload 4 -port 5028 -voices 32 -channel 1 -rate
44100</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">startBristol -explorer -voices 1
<br>
Run a moog explorer as a monophonic instrument, using ALSA
interface for audio and midi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">startBristol -prophet -alsa
-channel 3 <br>
Run a prophet-5 using ALSA for audio and midi (on channel
3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">startBristol -b3 -count 512
-preload 2 <br>
Run a hammond b3 with a 512 samples in a period, and preload
two such buffers before going active. Some Live! cards need
this larger buffer size with ALSA drivers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">startBristol -oss -audiodev
/dev/dsp1 -vox -voices 8 <br>
Run a vox continental using OSS device 1, and default midi
device /dev/midi0. Operate with just 8 voices out of the 32
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">startBristol -b3 -audio alsa
-audiodev plughw:0,0 -seq -mididev 128.0 <br>
Run a B3 emulation over the ALSA PCM plug interface, using
the ALSA sequencer over client 128, port 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">startBristol -juno &amp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">startBristol -prophet -channel 2
-engine <br>
Start two synthesisers, a juno and a prophet. Both
synthesisers will will be executed on one engine
(multitimbral) with 32 voices between them. The juno will be
on default <br>
midi channel (1), and the prophet on channel 2. Output over
the same default ALSA audio device. The 32 voices will never
all get used as these emulators will run per <br>
default with a lower soft limit. They can be run with more
voices however that would require suitable values to the
-voices option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">startBristol -juno -jack
-register juno -voices 32 &amp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">startBristol -prophet -jack
-register prophet -channel 2 -voices 32 <br>
Start two synthesisers, a juno and a prophet5. Each synth is
totally independent with its own GUI and own engine. Each
engine will register separately with the jack dae&acirc;
<br>
mon. They will respectively register the names
&rsquo;juno&rsquo; and &rsquo;prophet&rsquo; with Jack and
ALSA so that they can be differentiated in the respective
control programmes such as <br>
aconnect and qjackctl. The outputs will be visible
separately in these control programs and can thus be routed
independently. Each synth can use up to 32 voices and there
<br>
will only be CPU contention - these are separate engine
process with 32 voices each.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
The bristolrc file can be created in the BRISTOL_CACHE
directory (default value ${HOME}/.bristol/bristolrc) and the
users prefered options placed as the content. The file will
be <br>
read as a single line and incorporated onto the command
lines for both bristol and brighton. There is an additional
variable BRISTOL_RC which can point to another location if
<br>
necessary. This can be used to simply the command line for
all parameters that a user provides with each invocation.
The parameters can be all on a single line of the file or
<br>
one per line. The parameters from this file will preceed the
user specified ones such that the RC defaults may be
overridden on the comand line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
BRISTOL <br>
This indicates the location of the bristol installation for
the binaries, bitmaps and related data reside. The default
depends on the prefix used for the system build, <br>
/usr/local/share/bristol and /usr/share/bristol are
typical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BRISTOL_CACHE <br>
The cache is where memories and emulator profiles (keyboard
maps and MIDI Continuous Controller maps) are saved. The
default is ${HOME}/.bristol</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BRISTOL_RC <br>
Location of the bristol runcom file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BRISTOL_LOG_CONSOLE <br>
Force debuging output to be sent to console without
timestamping, log file or syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BRISTOL_AUTOCONN <br>
Attempt to automatically connect the bristol audio inputs
and outputs when using Jack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BRISTOL_AUTO_LEFT <br>
If BRISTOL_AUTOCON is set to anything other than
&rsquo;0&rsquo; this will be the default Jack port for the
bristol left channel output. There is no default, if
AUTOCONN has been <br>
requested this will be the first jack playback channel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BRISTOL_AUTO_RIGHT <br>
If BRISTOL_AUTOCON is set to anything other than
&rsquo;0&rsquo; this will be the default Jack port for the
bristol right channel output. There is no default, if
AUTOCONN has been <br>
requested this will be the second jack playback channel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BRISTOL_AUTO_IN <br>
If BRISTOL_AUTOCON is set to anything other than
&rsquo;0&rsquo; this will be the default Jack port for the
bristol (mono) input channel. There is no default, if
AUTOCONN is set this <br>
will be the first jack capture channel.</p>
