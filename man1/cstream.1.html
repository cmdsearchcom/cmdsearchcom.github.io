<p>cstream(1) BSD General Commands Manual cstream(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cstream &acirc; direct data streams, with bandwidth
limiting, FIFO, audio, duplication and extended reporting
support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cstream [-b num] [-B num] [-i filename] [-I string] [-l] [-n
num] [-o filename] [-O string] [-p filename] [-t num] [-T
num] [-v num] [-V] [filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Cstream filters data streams, much like the UNIX tool dd(1).
It has a more traditional command line syntax, support for
precise bandwidth limiting and reporting and support for
<br>
FIFOs. Data limits and throughput rate calculation will work
for files &gt; 4 GB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cstream reads from the standard
input and writes to the standard output, if no filenames are
given. It will also &rsquo;generate&rsquo; or
&rsquo;sink&rsquo; data if desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b num Set the block size used
for read/write to num. The default is 8192 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B num Buffer input up to num
bytes before writing. The default is the blocksize. It is an
error to set this to anything below the blocksize. Useful
when writing tapes and simi&acirc; <br>
lar that prefer few large writes of many small.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c num Concurrent operation. Use
a separate process for output. This is especially useful in
combination with the -B option. <br>
0 = use one process only (default) <br>
1 = read process will buffer <br>
2 = write process will buffer <br>
3 = both processes will buffer. <br>
In combination with a large buffer size this will often load
your memory heavily, every time the reader transfers the
buffer it collected to the writer. If you use -c <br>
3 and have a buffer size of 128 Megabytes 256 MB of memory
will be touched at once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i num</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o num Set the file names to use
for input or output, respectively. If the output file name
is &quot;-&quot;, data will just be discarded. If the input
file name is &quot;-&quot;, data will be gen&acirc; <br>
erated &rsquo;out of the void&rsquo;. If these options
aren&rsquo;t given, stdin/stout will be used. If you need to
give -o or -i options and want stdin/stdout, specify the
empty string, <br>
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cstream -i&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If TCP support has been compiled
in (default), hostname:portnumber will try to connect to the
specified host at the specified port and :portnumber will
open a TCP socket <br>
on the local machine and wait for a connection to arrive.
SECURITY NOTE: cstream includes no mechanism to restrict the
hosts that may connect to this port. Unless your <br>
machine has other network filters, anyone will be able to
connect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O string <br>
Specify the type of input and output file, respectively.
<br>
If string <br>
includes &rsquo;f&rsquo;, a fifo will be created. <br>
If string <br>
includes &rsquo;a&rsquo;, the file will be assumed to be an
opensound-compatible audio device and will be switched to
CD-like settings. <br>
If string <br>
includes &rsquo;t&rsquo;, a copy of the stream will be sent
to file descriptor 3. <br>
If string <br>
includes &rsquo;N&rsquo;, TCP will not be used for that file
even if the name has a &quot;:&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Include line count in
statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n num Limit the total amount of
data to num. If there is more input available, it will be
discarded, cstream will exit after the limit has been
reached. If there is less <br>
input, the limit will not be reached and no error will be
signaled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">num may have a trailing
&rsquo;k&rsquo;, &rsquo;m&rsquo; or &rsquo;g&rsquo; which
means Kilobytes, Megabytes or Gigabytes (where Kilo = 1024).
This applies to all numeric options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p filename <br>
Write the process id of cstream to filename. If cstream uses
a separate writer process (option -c), this is the pid of
the parent (reader) process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t num Limit the throughput of
the data stream to num bytes/second. Limiting is done at the
input side, you can rely on cstream not accepting more than
this rate. If the number <br>
you give is positive, cstream accumulates errors and tries
to keep the overall rate at the specified value, for the
whole session. If you give a negative number, it is an <br>
upper limit for each read/write system call pair. In other
words: the negative number will never exceed that limit, the
positive number will exceed it to make good for <br>
previous underutilization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T num Report throughput every
num seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v num Set verbose level to num.
By default, it is set to 0, which means no messages are
displayed as long as no errors occur. A value of 1 means
that total amount of data and <br>
throughput will be displayed at the end of program run. A
value of 2 means the transfer rate since the end of the
first read/write pair will also be reported (useful when
<br>
there is an initial delay). A value of 3 means there will
also be separate measurements for read and write. This
option is resource-consuming and currently isn&rsquo;t
imple&acirc; <br>
mented. A value of 4 means that notices about each single
read/write will be displayed. High values include all
message types of lower values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print version number to
stdout and exit with 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename A single filename as
the last argument without an option switch will be used as
input file if -i has not been used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGINFO Sending SIGUSR1 (or
SIGINFO, which is usually mapped to Control-T on you
keyboard) to cstream causes it to display throughput rates
to stderr. The stream will continue as <br>
if nothing happened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR2 Exit and report
throughput rates, if requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP I found myself sending
SIGHUP accidentally too often. But ignoring or misusing
SIGHUP is not an option for me. Thus, when cstream received
SIGHUP, it will wait 5 seconds <br>
for another SIGHUP, to give users a chance to correct a
possible mistake. If no additional SIGHUP is received,
cstream kills itself with SIGHUP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
cstream -o tmpfile -v 1 -n 384m -i - <br>
Writes 384 Megabytes of unspecified data to file tmpfile and
display verbose throughput rate. Makes a good benchmark, the
speed of /dev/null varies too much from system to <br>
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cstream -i tmpfile -v 1 -n 384m
-o - <br>
Read the same file back in and discard data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cstream -b 2000 -t 10000
/var/log/messages <br>
Will display the file in a more or less watchable speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump 0sf 400000 - / | cstream -v
1 -b 32768 -o /dev/rst0 -p pidfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill -USR1 &lsquo;cat
pidfile&lsquo; <br>
Write the output from dump(1) to tape. Each time the signal
is sent, the throughput and data rate so far will be
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cstream -t 176400 -i /dev/dsp0
-I f -o - <br>
Makes kind of a soundcard emulator which may be used to test
audio applications that need something to write to that
limits the data rate as a real soundcard does. This <br>
obviously doesn&rsquo;t work when the application tries to
write data using mmap(2) and the application has to ignore
errors when it tries to set soundcard parameters using <br>
ioctl(2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cstream -t 176400 -i /dev/dsp0
-I f -o /dev/dsp1 -O f <br>
Similar soundcard emulator, except that it allows you to
grab the data your applications sends to it from the other
fifo, while still having precise timing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cstream -Oa -o /dev/dsp0
myhost.mydomain.com:17324 <br>
Connects port 3333 on host myhost.mydomain.com and whatever
data it finds there will be sent to the soundcard, with
appropriate settings for CD quality stero play.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cstream -i myaudiofile.raw -o
:17324 <br>
This will open a TCP server on port 17324 and waits until
someone connects (for example, the command line from the
previous example). Then it will send the contents of <br>
myaudiofile.raw down the TCP stream (for the previous audio
example, typically a CD audiotrack like you get from the
tosha or cdparanoia utilities).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cstream -OD -o myfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Write to file myfile with
O_DIRECT. That usually means that the filesystem buffer
cache will not try to cache this file. You can use that to
prevent copying operations <br>
from eating up physical memory. Note that when cstream
encounters a write error it will switch the output file from
O_DIRECT to a normal file and write all further blocks <br>
without O_DIRECT if writes without O_DIRECT succeed. In
practice that usually means that your last block, if not a
multiple of the filesystem block size, will still be <br>
written into the file (the maximum amount of data written
without O_DIRECT is your blocksize minus one). That way
cstream ensures that the output file has the length of <br>
the input, however odd the length was and no matter what
restrictions your OS places on O_DIRECT output. Again,
cstream will *not* pad the output to the block size, you
<br>
get the same file and file size as if not using O_DIRECT, at
the cost of switching to non-O_DIRECT whenever a block is
not the right size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cstream -i :3333 | dd obs=8192 |
./cstream -omyfile -v7 -OD <br>
This is what you need to do to buffer TCP input, so that the
last cstream will not switch away from O_DIRECT prematurely
because of short reads. If your input can do short <br>
reads (e.g. from TCP), and you want to ensure that O_DIRECT
stays in effect, you need a buffer between the TCP stream
and the O_DIRECT stream. Since cstream does not yet <br>
support different input and output block sizes, dd is
suitable here. Note that this is only necessary if the OS
requires multiples of the filesystem block size for <br>
O_DIRECT. At the time of this writing this construct is
needed on Linux for using TCP streams with O_DIRECT, but it
is not needed on FreeBSD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cstream -OS -o myfile <br>
Writes to file myfile with O_SYNC. This means by the time
the system call returns the data is known to be on disk.
This is not the same thing as O_DIRECT. O_DIRECT can <br>
do its own buffering, with O_SYNC there is no buffering at
all. At the time of this writing, O_SYNC on both Linux and
FreeBSD is very slow (1/5th to 1/10th of normal <br>
write) and O_DIRECT is reasonably fast (1/4th to 1/2 of
normal write). You can combined O_SYNC and O_DIRECT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERRORS <br>
Exit code 0 means success.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exit code 1 means a command line
syntax usage error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exit code 2 means other errors,
especially system errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bugs <br>
There should be an option to begin writing directly after
the first read ended and then fill the buffer with reads in
the background. Right now writing will not begin before the
<br>
reader has filled the buffer completely for the first
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not a bug: the code to do
O_DIRECT is reasonably sophisticated. It will fall back to
normal I/O on errors. But before doing that it knows about
both filesystem blocksize require&acirc; <br>
ments (will default I/O blocksize to whatever the filesystem
of the output file is in) and page alignment requirements
(I/O will happen from a page-aligned buffer). However, the
<br>
combination of concurrent read/writes (-c options) and
O_DIRECT has not been tested beyond basic verification that
it gets some tests right.</p>
