<p>TALK(1) BSD General Commands Manual TALK(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
talk &acirc; talk to another user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
talk person [ttyname]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Talk is a visual communication program which copies lines
from your terminal to that of another user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">person If you wish to talk to
someone on your own machine, then person is just the
person&rsquo;s login name. If you wish to talk to a user on
another host, then person is of the form <br>
&acirc;user@host&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ttyname If you wish to talk to a
user who is logged in more than once, the ttyname argument
may be used to indicate the appropriate terminal name, where
ttyname is of the form <br>
&acirc;ttyXX&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When first called, talk sends
the message <br>
Message from TalkDaemon@his_machine... <br>
talk: connection requested by your_name@your_machine. <br>
talk: respond with: talk your_name@your_machine</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to the user you wish to talk to.
At this point, the recipient of the message should reply by
typing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">talk your_name@your_machine</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It doesn&rsquo;t matter from
which machine the recipient replies, as long as his
login-name is the same. Once communication is established,
the two parties may type simultaneously, with <br>
their output appearing in separate windows. Typing control-L
&acirc;^L&acirc; will cause the screen to be reprinted,
while your erase, kill, and word kill characters will behave
normally. To <br>
exit, just type your interrupt character; talk then moves
the cursor to the bottom of the screen and restores the
terminal to its previous state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Permission to talk may be denied
or granted by use of the mesg(1) command. At the outset
talking is allowed. Certain commands, in particular nroff(1)
and pr(1), disallow messages <br>
in order to prevent messy output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/hosts to find the recipient&rsquo;s machine <br>
/var/run/utmp to find the recipient&rsquo;s tty</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
mail(1), mesg(1), who(1), write(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The version of talk(1) released with 4.3BSD uses a protocol
that is incompatible with the protocol used in the version
released with 4.2BSD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The talk command appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>
