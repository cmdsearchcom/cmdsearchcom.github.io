<p>PERLQNX(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLQNX(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlqnx - Perl version 5 on QNX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
As of perl5.7.2 all tests pass under:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QNX 4.24G <br>
Watcom 10.6 with Beta/970211.wcc.update.tar.F <br>
socket3r.lib Nov21 1996.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of perl5.8.1 there is at
least one test still failing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some tests may complain under
known circumstances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See below and hints/qnx.sh for
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under QNX 6.2.0 there are still
a few tests which fail. See below and hints/qnx.sh for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Required Software for Compiling
Perl on QNX4 <br>
As with many unix ports, this one depends on a few
&quot;standard&quot; unix utilities which are not
necessarily standard for QNX4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/bin/sh <br>
This is used heavily by Configure and then by perl itself.
QNX4&rsquo;s version is fine, but Configure will choke on
the 16-bit version, so if you are running QNX 4.22, link
<br>
/bin/sh to /bin32/ksh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ar This is the standard unix
library builder. We use wlib. With Watcom 10.6, when wlib is
linked as &quot;ar&quot;, it behaves like ar and all is
fine. Under 9.5, a cover is required. <br>
One is included in ../qnx</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nm This is used (optionally) by
configure to list the contents of libraries. I will generate
a cover function on the fly in the UU directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpp Configure and perl need a
way to invoke a C preprocessor. I have created a simple
cover for cc which does the right thing. Without this,
Configure will create its own wrapper <br>
which works, but it doesn&rsquo;t handle some of the command
line arguments that perl will throw at it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">make <br>
You really need GNU make to compile this. GNU make ships by
default with QNX 4.23, but you can get it from quics for
earlier versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Outstanding Issues with Perl on
QNX4 <br>
There is no support for dynamically linked libraries in
QNX4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish to compile with the
Socket extension, you need to have the TCP/IP toolkit, and
you need to make sure that -lsocket locates the correct copy
of socket3r.lib. Beware <br>
that the Watcom compiler ships with a stub version of
socket3r.lib which has very little functionality. Also
beware the order in which wlink searches directories for
libraries. <br>
You may have /usr/lib/socket3r.lib pointing to the correct
library, but wlink may pick up
/usr/watcom/10.6/usr/lib/socket3r.lib instead. Make sure
they both point to the correct <br>
library, that is,
/usr/tcptk/current/usr/lib/socket3r.lib.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following tests may report
errors under QNX4:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dist/Cwd/Cwd.t will complain if
&lsquo;pwd&lsquo; and cwd don&rsquo;t give the same results.
cwd calls &lsquo;fullpath -t&lsquo;, so if you cd
&lsquo;fullpath -t&lsquo; before running the test, it will
pass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lib/File/Find/taint.t will
complain if &rsquo;.&rsquo; is in your PATH. The PATH test
is triggered because cwd calls &lsquo;fullpath
-t&lsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ext/IO/lib/IO/t/io_sock.t:
Subtests 14 and 22 are skipped due to the fact that the
functionality to read back the non-blocking status of a
socket is not implemented in QNX&rsquo;s <br>
TCP/IP. This has been reported to QNX and it may work with
later versions of TCP/IP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t/io/tell.t: Subtest 27 is
failing. We are still investigating.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QNX auxiliary files <br>
The files in the &quot;qnx&quot; directory are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qnx/ar <br>
A script that emulates the standard unix archive (aka
library) utility. Under Watcom 10.6, ar is linked to wlib
and provides the expected interface. With Watcom 9.5, a
cover <br>
function is required. This one is fairly crude but has
proved adequate for compiling perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qnx/cpp <br>
A script that provides C preprocessing functionality.
Configure can generate a similar cover, but it doesn&rsquo;t
handle all the command-line options that perl throws at it.
This <br>
might be reasonably placed in /usr/local/bin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Outstanding issues with perl
under QNX6 <br>
The following tests are still failing for Perl 5.8.1 under
QNX 6.2.0:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">op/sprintf.........................FAILED
at test 91 <br>
lib/Benchmark......................FAILED at test 26</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is due to a bug in the C
library&rsquo;s printf routine.
printf(&quot;&rsquo;%e&rsquo;&quot;, 0. ) produces
&rsquo;0.000000e+0&rsquo;, but ANSI requires
&rsquo;0.000000e+00&rsquo;. QNX has acknowledged the
bug.</p>
