<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
r.sim.water is a landscape scale simulation model of
overland flow designed for spatially variable terrain, soil,
cover and rainfall excess conditions. A 2D shallow water
flow is <br>
described by the bivariate form of Saint Venant equations.
The numerical solution is based on the concept of duality
between the field and particle representation of the modeled
<br>
quantity. Green&acirc;s function Monte Carlo method, used to
solve the equation, provides robustness necessary for
spatially variable conditions and high resolutions (Mitas
and <br>
Mitasova 1998). The key inputs of the model include
elevation (elevation raster map), flow gradient vector given
by first-order partial derivatives of elevation field (dx
and dy <br>
raster maps), rainfall excess rate (rain raster map or
rain_value single value) and a surface roughness coefficient
given by Manning&acirc;s n (man raster map or man_value
single <br>
value). Partial derivatives raster maps can be computed
along with interpolation of a DEM using the -d option in
v.surf.rst module. If elevation raster map is already
provided, <br>
partial derivatives can be computed using r.slope.aspect
module. Partial derivatives are used to determine the
direction and magnitude of water flow velocity. To include a
prede&acirc; <br>
fined direction of flow, map algebra can be used to replace
terrain-derived partial derivatives with pre-defined partial
derivatives in selected grid cells such as man-made
chan&acirc; <br>
nels, ditches or culverts. Equations (2) and (3) from this
report can be used to compute partial derivates of the
predefined flow using its direction given by aspect and
slope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The module automatically
converts horizontal distances from feet to metric system
using database/projection information. Rainfall excess is
defined as rainfall intensity - infil&acirc; <br>
tration rate and should be provided in [mm/hr]. Rainfall
intensities are usually available from meteorological
stations. Infiltration rate depends on soil properties and
land <br>
cover. It varies in space and time. For saturated soil and
steady-state water flow it can be estimated using saturated
hydraulic conductivity rates based on field measurements
<br>
or using reference values which can be found in literature.
Optionally, user can provide an overland flow infiltration
rate map infil or a single value infil_value in [mm/hr] <br>
that control the rate of infiltration for the already
flowing water, effectively reducing the flow depth and
discharge. Overland flow can be further controlled by
permeable <br>
check dams or similar type of structures, the user can
provide a map of these structures and their permeability
ratio in the map flow_control that defines the probability
of par&acirc; <br>
ticles to pass through the structure (the values will be
0-1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output includes a water depth
raster map depth in [m], and a water discharge raster map
discharge in [m3/s]. Error of the numerical solution can be
analyzed using the error <br>
raster map (the resulting water depth is an average, and err
is its RMSE). The output vector points map output_walkers
can be used to analyze and visualize spatial distribution
<br>
of walkers at different simulation times (note that the
resulting water depth is based on the density of these
walkers). The spatial distribution of numerical error
associated <br>
with path sampling solution can be analysed using the output
error raster file [m]. This error is a function of the
number of particles used in the simulation and can be
reduced <br>
by increasing the number of walkers given by parameter
nwalkers. Duration of simulation is controlled by the
niterations parameter. The default value is 10 minutes,
reaching the <br>
steady-state may require much longer time, depending on the
time step, complexity of terrain, land cover and size of the
area. Output walker, water depth and discharge maps can <br>
be saved during simulation using the time series flag -t and
output_step parameter defining the time step in minutes for
writing output files. Files are saved with a suffix
rep&acirc; <br>
resenting time since the start of simulation in minutes
(e.g. wdepth.05, wdepth.10). Monitoring of water depth at
specific points is supported. A vector map with observation
<br>
points and a path to a logfile must be provided. For each
point in the vector map which is located in the
computational region the water depth is logged each time
step in the <br>
logfile. The logfile is organized as a table. A single
header identifies the category number of the logged vector
points. In case of invalid water depth data the value -1 is
<br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overland flow is routed based on
partial derivatives of elevation field or other landscape
features influencing water flow. Simulation equations
include a diffusion term (diffu&acirc; <br>
sion_coeff parameter) which enables water flow to overcome
elevation depressions or obstacles when water depth exceeds
a threshold water depth value (hmax), given in [m]. When it
<br>
is reached, diffusion term increases as given by halpha and
advection term (direction of flow) is given as
&quot;prevailing&quot; direction of flow computed as average
of flow directions <br>
from the previous hbeta number of grid cells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
A 2D shallow water flow is described by the bivariate form
of Saint Venant equations (e.g., Julien et al., 1995). The
continuity of water flow relation is coupled with the
momen&acirc; <br>
tum conservation equation and for a shallow water overland
flow, the hydraulic radius is approximated by the normal
flow depth. The system of equations is closed using the
Man&acirc; <br>
ning&acirc;s relation. Model assumes that the flow is close
to the kinematic wave approximation, but we include a
diffusion-like term to incorporate the impact of diffusive
wave <br>
effects. Such an incorporation of diffusion in the water
flow simulation is not new and a similar term has been
obtained in derivations of diffusion-advection equations for
over&acirc; <br>
land flow, e.g., by Lettenmeier and Wood, (1992). In our
reformulation, we simplify the diffusion coefficient to a
constant and we use a modified diffusion term. The diffusion
<br>
constant which we have used is rather small (approximately
one order of magnitude smaller than the reciprocal
Manning&acirc;s coefficient) and therefore the resulting
flow is close to <br>
the kinematic regime. However, the diffusion term improves
the kinematic solution, by overcoming small shallow pits
common in digital elevation models (DEM) and by smoothing
out <br>
the flow over slope discontinuities or abrupt changes in
Manning&acirc;s coefficient (e.g., due to a road, or other
anthropogenic changes in elevations or cover).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Green&acirc;s function
stochastic method of solution. <br>
The Saint Venant equations are solved by a stochastic method
called Monte Carlo (very similar to Monte Carlo methods in
computational fluid dynamics or to quantum Monte Carlo <br>
approaches for solving the Schrodinger equation (Schmidt and
Ceperley, 1992, Hammond et al., 1994; Mitas, 1996)). It is
assumed that these equations are a representation of
sto&acirc; <br>
chastic processes with diffusion and drift components
(Fokker-Planck equations).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Monte Carlo technique has
several unique advantages which are becoming even more
important due to new developments in computer technology.
Perhaps one of the most signifi&acirc; <br>
cant Monte Carlo properties is robustness which enables us
to solve the equations for complex cases, such as
discontinuities in the coefficients of differential
operators (in our <br>
case, abrupt slope or cover changes, etc). Also, rough
solutions can be estimated rather quickly, which allows us
to carry out preliminary quantitative studies or to rapidly
<br>
extract qualitative trends by parameter scans. In addition,
the stochastic methods are tailored to the new generation of
computers as they provide scalability from a single
work&acirc; <br>
station to large parallel machines due to the independence
of sampling points. Therefore, the methods are useful both
for everyday exploratory work using a desktop computer and
<br>
for large, cutting-edge applications using high performance
computing.</p>
