Only the most useful options are given above; see below for a more complete list

  documentation for details.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The C preprocessor, often known as <i>cpp</i>, is a <i>macro processor</i> that
  is used automatically by the C compiler to transform your program before
  compilation. It is called a macro processor because it allows you to define
  <i>macros</i>, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The C preprocessor is intended to be used only with C, C++, and Objective-C
  source code. In the past, it has been abused as a general text processor. It
  will choke on input which does not obey C's lexical rules. For example,
  apostrophes will be interpreted as the beginning of character constants, and
  cause errors. Also, you cannot rely on it preserving characteristics of the
  input which are not significant to C-family languages. If a Makefile is
  preprocessed, all the hard tabs will be removed, and the Makefile will not
  work.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Having said that, you can often get away with using cpp on things which are not
  C. Other Algol-ish programming languages are often safe (Pascal, Ada, etc.) So
  is assembly, with caution. <b>-traditional-cpp</b> mode preserves more white
  space, and is otherwise more permissive. Many of the problems can be avoided
  by writing C or C++ style comments instead of native language comments, and
  keeping macros simple.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Wherever possible, you should use a preprocessor geared to the language you are
  writing in. Modern versions of the GNU assembler have macro facilities. Most
  high level programming languages have their own conditional compilation and
  inclusion mechanism. If all else fails, try a true general text processor,
  such as GNU M4.
<div class="Pp"></div>
C preprocessors vary in some details. This manual discusses the GNU C
  preprocessor, which provides a small superset of the features of ISO Standard
  C. In its default mode, the GNU C preprocessor does not do a few things
  required by the standard. These are features which are rarely, if ever, used,
  and may cause surprising changes to the meaning of a program which does not
  expect them. To get strict ISO Standard C, you should use the <b>-std=c90</b>,
  <b>-std=c99</b> or <b>-std=c11</b> options, depending on which version of the
  standard you want. To get all the mandatory diagnostics, you must also use
  <b>-pedantic</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This manual describes the behavior of the ISO preprocessor. To minimize
  gratuitous differences, where the ISO preprocessor's behavior does not
  conflict with traditional semantics, the traditional preprocessor should
  behave the same way. The various differences that do exist are detailed in the
  section <b>Traditional</b> <b>Mode</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For clarity, unless noted otherwise, references to <b>CPP</b> in this manual
  refer to GNU CPP.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The <b>cpp</b> command expects two file names as arguments, <i>infile</i> and
  <i>outfile</i>. The preprocessor reads <i>infile</i> together with any other
  files it specifies with <b>#include</b>. All the output generated by the
  combined input files is written in <i>outfile</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Either <i>infile</i> or <i>outfile</i> may be <b>-</b>, which as <i>infile</i>
  means to read from standard input and as <i>outfile</i> means to write to
  standard output. If either file is omitted, it means the same as if <b>-</b>
  had been specified for that file. You can also use the <b>-o</b>
  <i>outfile</i> option to specify the output file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Unless otherwise noted, or the option ends in <b>=</b>, all options which take
  an argument may have that argument appear either immediately after the option,
  or with a space between option and argument: <b>-Ifoo</b> and <b>-I foo</b>
  have the same effect.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
  may <i>not</i> be grouped: <b>-dM</b> is very different from
  <b>-d&#x00A0;-M</b>.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-D</b> <i>name</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Predefine <i>name</i> as a macro, with definition 1.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-D</b> <i>name</i><b>=</b><i>definition</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The contents of <i>definition</i> are tokenized and
      processed as if they appeared during translation phase three in a
      <b>#define</b> directive. In particular, the definition is truncated by
      embedded newline characters.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like program you
      may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to protect characters such as
      spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write its
      argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign (if
      any). Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so you should quote the
      option. With <b>sh</b> and <b>csh</b>,
      <b>-D'</b><i>name</i><b>(</b><i>args...</i>
      <b>)=</b><i>definition</i><b>'</b> works.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>-D</b> and <b>-U</b> options are processed in the order they are given

    This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as

      you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with <b>-MF</b>,
      or use an environment variable like <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b>. Debug
      output is still sent to the regular output stream as normal.

You can use <b>-I</b> to override a system header file, substituting your own
  version, since these directories are searched before the standard system
  header file directories. However, you should not use this option to add
  directories that contain vendor-supplied system header files; use
  <b>-isystem</b> for that.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>-isystem</b> and <b>-idirafter</b> options also mark the directory as a
  system directory, so that it gets the same special treatment that is applied
  to the standard system directories.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with
  <b>-isystem</b>, is also specified with <b>-I</b>, the <b>-I</b> option is
  ignored. The directory is still searched but as a system directory at its
  normal position in the system include chain. This is to ensure that GCC's
  procedure to fix buggy system headers and the ordering for the
  &quot;#include_next&quot; directive are not inadvertently changed. If you
  really need to change the search order for system directories, use the
  <b>-nostdinc</b> and/or <b>-isystem</b> options.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
This section describes the environment variables that affect how CPP operates.
  You can use them to specify directories or prefixes to use when searching for
  include files, or to control dependency output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as <b>-I</b>,
  and control dependency output with options like <b>-M</b>. These take
  precedence over environment variables, which in turn take precedence over the
  configuration of GCC.
<dl class="Bl-tag">

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by
      a special character, much like <b>PATH</b>, in which to look for header
      files. The special character, &quot;PATH_SEPARATOR&quot;, is
      target-dependent and determined at GCC build time. For Microsoft
      Windows-based targets it is a semicolon, and for almost all other targets
      it is a colon.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>CPATH</b> specifies a list of directories to be searched as if specified
      with <b>-I</b>, but after any paths given with <b>-I</b> options on the
      command line. This environment variable is used regardless of which
      language is being preprocessed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the
      particular language indicated. Each specifies a list of directories to be
      searched as if specified with <b>-isystem</b>, but after any paths given
      with <b>-isystem</b> options on the command line.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to search
      its current working directory. Empty elements can appear at the beginning
      or end of a path. For instance, if the value of <b>CPATH</b> is
      &quot;:/special/include&quot;, that has the same effect as
      <b>-I.&#x00A0;-I/special/include</b>.</dd>

      the compiler. System header files are ignored in the dependency output.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The value of <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b> can be just a file name, in which
      case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target name
      from the source file name. Or the value can have the form <i>file</i><b>
      </b> <i>target</i>, in which case the rules are written to file
      <i>file</i> using <i>target</i> as the target name.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining the
      options <b>-MM</b> and <b>-MF</b>, with an optional <b>-MT</b> switch
    too.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This variable is the same as <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b>
      (see above), except that system header files are not ignored, so it
      implies <b>-M</b> rather than <b>-MM</b>. However, the dependence on the
      main input file is omitted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If this variable is set, its value specifies a UNIX
      timestamp to be used in replacement of the current date and time in the
      &quot;__DATE__&quot; and &quot;__TIME__&quot; macros, so that the embedded
      timestamps become reproducible.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The value of <b>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</b> must be a UNIX timestamp, defined as
      the number of seconds (excluding leap seconds) since 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00
      represented in ASCII; identical to the output of

      that support the %s extension in the &quot;date&quot; command.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
