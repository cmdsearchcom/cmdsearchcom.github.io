<p>MAIL(1) BSD General Commands Manual MAIL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mail, mailx, Mail &acirc; send and receive mail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mail [-dEIinv] [-a header] [-b bcc-addr] [-c cc-addr] [-r
from-addr] [-s subject] [--] to-addr ... <br>
mail [-dEIiNnv] -f [file] <br>
mail [-dEIiNnv] [-u user]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mail is an intelligent mail processing system which has a
command syntax reminiscent of ed(1) with lines replaced by
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Specify additional header
fields on the command line such as &quot;X-Loop:
foo@bar&quot; etc. You have to use quotes if the string
contains spaces. This argument may be specified <br>
more than once, the headers will then be concatenated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b bcc-addr <br>
Send blind carbon copies to bcc-addr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c cc-addr <br>
Send carbon copies to list of users. cc-addr should be a
comma separated list of names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Causes mail to output all
sorts of information useful for debugging mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Don&rsquo;t send messages
with an empty body.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Use an alternate mailbox.
Defaults to the user&rsquo;s mbox if no file is specified.
When quit, mail writes undeleted messages back to this
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Forces mail to run in
interactive mode, even when input is not a terminal. In
particular, the special ~ command character, used when
sending mail, is only available inter&acirc; <br>
actively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Ignore tty interrupt signals.
This is particularly useful when using mail on noisy phone
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Inhibits initial display of
message headers when reading mail or editing a mail
folder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Inhibits reading /etc/mail.rc
upon startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r from-addr <br>
Use from-addr as the from address in the message and
envelope. Overrides any from options in the startup
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s subject <br>
Specify subject on command line (only the first argument
after the -s flag is used as a subject; be careful to quote
subjects containing spaces).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u user <br>
Equivalent to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ mail -f /var/mail/user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">except that locking is done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose mode. The details of
delivery are displayed on the user&rsquo;s terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- End of options. Any further
argument is treated as a direct receipient address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: For security reasons the
-- separator is strongly recommended for scripts that need
to send mails to addresses obtained from untrusted sources
(such as web forms).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Startup actions <br>
At startup time, mail will execute commands in the system
command file, /etc/mail.rc, unless explicitly told not to by
using the -n option. Next, the commands in the user&rsquo;s
per&acirc; <br>
sonal command file ~/.mailrc are executed. mail then
examines its command line options to determine whether the
user requested a new message to be sent or existing messages
in a <br>
mailbox to be examined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sending mail <br>
To send a message to one or more people, mail can be invoked
with arguments which are the names of people to whom the
mail will be sent. You are then expected to type in your
mes&acirc; <br>
sage, followed by a control-D (&acirc;^D&acirc;) at the
beginning of a line. The section below, Replying to or
originating mail, describes some features of mail available
to help you compose <br>
your letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reading mail <br>
In normal usage, mail is given no arguments and checks your
mail out of the post office, then prints out a one line
header of each message found. The current message is
initially <br>
set to the first message (numbered 1) and can be printed
using the print command (which can be abbreviated p). Moving
among the messages is much like moving between lines in <br>
ed(1); you may use + and - to shift forwards and backwards,
or simply enter a message number to move directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disposing of mail <br>
After examining a message you can delete (d) or reply (r) to
it. Deletion causes the mail program to forget about the
message. This is not irreversible; the message can be <br>
undeleted (u) by giving its number, or the mail session can
be aborted by giving the exit (x) command. Deleted messages,
however, will usually disappear, never to be seen again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying messages <br>
Commands such as print and delete can be given a list of
message numbers as arguments to apply to a number of
messages at once. Thus delete 1 2 deletes messages 1 and 2,
while <br>
delete 1-5 deletes messages 1 through 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Messages may also be selected
using one of the following categories:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* all messages <br>
$ last message <br>
:d deleted messages <br>
:n new messages <br>
:o old messages <br>
:r read messages <br>
:u unread messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus the command top, which
prints the first few lines of a message, could be used in
top * to print the first few lines of all messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replying to or originating mail
<br>
You can use the reply command to set up a response to a
message, sending it back to the person who it was from. Text
you then type in, up to an end-of-file, defines the contents
<br>
of the message. While you are composing a message, mail
treats lines beginning with the tilde (&acirc;~&acirc;)
character specially. For instance, typing ~m (alone on a
line) will place a <br>
copy of the current message into the response, right
shifting it by a single tab-stop (see the indentprefix
variable, below). Other escapes will set up subject fields,
add and <br>
delete recipients to the message, and allow you to escape to
an editor to revise the message or to a shell to run some
commands. (These options are given in the summary
below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ending a mail processing session
<br>
You can end a mail session with the quit (q) command.
Messages which have been examined go to your mbox file
unless they have been deleted, in which case they are
discarded. <br>
Unexamined messages go back to the post office (see the -f
option above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Personal and system wide
distribution lists <br>
It is also possible to create personal distribution lists so
that, for instance, you can send mail to
&acirc;cohorts&acirc; and have it go to a group of people.
Such lists can be defined by <br>
placing a line like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias cohorts bill ozalp jkf
mark kridle@ucbcory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in the file .mailrc in your home
directory. The current list of such aliases can be displayed
with the alias command in mail. System wide distribution
lists can be created by <br>
editing /etc/aliases, (see aliases(5)); these are kept in a
different syntax. In mail you send, personal aliases will be
expanded in mail sent to others so that they will be able
<br>
to reply to the recipients. System wide aliases are not
expanded when the mail is sent, but any reply returned to
the machine will have the system wide alias expanded as all
mail <br>
goes through an MTA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recipient address specifications
<br>
Recipient addresses (any of the &acirc;To&acirc;,
&acirc;Cc&acirc; or &acirc;Bcc&acirc; header fields) are
subject to expansion when the expandaddr option is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An address may be expanded as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; An address that
starts with a pipe (&acirc;|&acirc;) character is treated as
a command to run. The command immediately following the
&acirc;|&acirc; is executed with the message as its standard
<br>
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; An address that
starts with a &acirc;+&acirc; character is treated as a
folder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; An address that
contains a &acirc;/&acirc; character but no &acirc;!&acirc;,
&acirc;%&acirc;, or &acirc;@&acirc; characters is also
treated as a folder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If none of the
above apply, the recipient is treated as a local or network
mail address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the expandaddr option is not
set (the default), no expansion is performed and the
recipient is treated as a local or network mail address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Network mail (ARPA, UUCP,
Berknet) <br>
See mailaddr(7) for a description of network addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mail has a number of options
which can be set in the .mailrc file to alter its behavior;
thus set askcc enables the askcc feature. (These options are
summarized below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUMMARY <br>
(Adapted from the &acirc;Mail Reference Manual&acirc;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each command is typed on a line
by itself, and may take arguments following the command
word. The command need not be typed in its entirety -- the
first command which matches the <br>
typed prefix is used. For commands which take message lists
as arguments, if no message list is given, then the next
message forward which satisfies the command&rsquo;s
requirements is <br>
used. If there are no messages forward of the current
message, the search proceeds backwards, and if there are no
good messages at all, mail types &acirc;No applicable
messages&acirc; and <br>
aborts the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Print out the preceding
message. If given a numeric argument n, goes to the nth
previous message and prints it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= Prints the currently selected
message number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Prints a brief summary of
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! Executes the shell (see sh(1)
and csh(1)) command which follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias (a) With no arguments,
prints out all currently defined aliases. With one argument,
prints out that alias. With more than one argument, creates
a new alias or changes an <br>
old one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alternates <br>
(alt) The alternates command is useful if you have accounts
on several machines. It can be used to inform mail that the
listed addresses are really you. When you reply to <br>
messages, mail will not send a copy of the message to any of
the addresses listed on the alternates list. If the
alternates command is given with no argument, the current
<br>
set of alternate names is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chdir (cd or ch) Changes the
user&rsquo;s working directory to that specified, if given.
If no directory is given, then changes to the user&rsquo;s
login directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copy (c) The copy command does
the same thing that save does, except that it does not mark
the messages it is used on for deletion when you quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete (d) Takes a list of
messages as argument and marks them all as deleted. Deleted
messages will not be saved in mbox, nor will they be
available for most other commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dp (also dt) Deletes the current
message and prints the next message. If there is no next
message, mail says &acirc;No more messages.&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">edit (e) Takes a list of
messages and points the text editor at each one in turn. On
return from the editor, the message is read back in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exit (ex or x) Effects an
immediate return to the shell without modifying the
user&rsquo;s system mailbox, his mbox file, or his edit file
in -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file (fi) The same as
folder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">folder (fo) The folder command
switches to a new mail file or folder. With no arguments, it
tells you which file you are currently reading. If you give
it an argument, it will <br>
write out changes (such as deletions) you have made in the
current file and read in the new file. Some special
conventions are recognized for the name. # means the
previ&acirc; <br>
ous file, % means your system mailbox, %user means
user&rsquo;s system mailbox, &amp; means your mbox file, and
+folder means a file in your folder directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">folders <br>
List the names of the folders in your folder directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">from (f) Takes a list of
messages and prints their message headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">headers <br>
(h) Lists the current windowful of headers. To view the next
or previous group of headers, see the z command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help A synonym for ?.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hold (ho, also preserve) Takes a
message list and marks each message therein to be saved in
the user&rsquo;s system mailbox instead of in mbox. Does not
override the delete command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignore Add the list of header
fields named to the ignored list. Header fields in the
ignore list are not printed on your terminal when you print
a message. This command is very <br>
handy for suppression of certain machine-generated header
fields. The Type and Print commands can be used to print a
message in its entirety, including ignored fields. If <br>
ignore is executed with no arguments, it lists the current
set of ignored fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inc Incorporate any new messages
that have arrived while mail is being read. The new messages
are added to the end of the message list, and the current
message is reset to be <br>
the first new mail message. This does not renumber the
existing message list, nor does it cause any changes made so
far to be saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list (l) List the valid mail
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mail (m) Takes as argument login
names and distribution group names and sends mail to those
people.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mbox Indicate that a list of
messages be sent to mbox in your home directory when you
quit. This is the default action for messages if you do not
have the hold option set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">more (mo) Takes a message list
and invokes the pager on that list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">next (n) (like + or CR) Goes to
the next message in sequence and types it. With an argument
list, types the next matching message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">preserve <br>
(pre) A synonym for hold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print (P) Like print but also
prints out ignored header fields. See also print, ignore,
and retain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print (p) Takes a message list
and types out each message on the user&rsquo;s terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit (q) Terminates the session,
saving all undeleted, unsaved messages in the user&rsquo;s
mbox file in his login directory, preserving all messages
marked with hold or preserve or <br>
never referenced in his system mailbox, and removing all
other messages from his system mailbox. If new mail has
arrived during the session, the message &acirc;You have new
<br>
mail&acirc; is given. If given while editing a mailbox file
with the -f flag, then the edit file is rewritten. A return
to the shell is effected, unless the rewrite of edit <br>
file fails, in which case the user can escape with the exit
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reply (R) Reply to originator.
Does not reply to other recipients of the original
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reply (r) Takes a message list
and sends mail to the sender and all recipients of the
specified message. The default message must not be
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">respond <br>
A synonym for reply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">retain Add the list of header
fields named to the retained list. Only the header fields in
the retain list are shown on your terminal when you print a
message. All other header <br>
fields are suppressed. The Type and Print commands can be
used to print a message in its entirety. If retain is
executed with no arguments, it lists the current set of <br>
retained fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">save (s) Takes a message list
and a filename and appends each message in turn to the end
of the file. The filename in quotes, followed by the line
count and character count is <br>
echoed on the user&rsquo;s terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">saveignore <br>
saveignore is to save what ignore is to print and type.
Header fields thus marked are filtered out when saving a
message by save or when automatically saving to mbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">saveretain <br>
saveretain is to save what retain is to print and type.
Header fields thus marked are the only ones saved with a
message when saving by save or when automatically saving
<br>
to mbox. saveretain overrides saveignore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set (se) With no arguments,
prints all variable values. Otherwise, sets option.
Arguments are of the form option=value (no space before or
after =) or option. Quotation <br>
marks may be placed around any part of the assignment
statement to quote blanks or tabs, i.e., set
indentprefix=&quot;-&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell (sh) Invokes an
interactive version of the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size Takes a message list and
prints out the size in characters of each message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source The source command reads
commands from a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">top Takes a message list and
prints the top few lines of each. The number of lines
printed is controlled by the variable toplines and defaults
to five.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Type (T) Identical to the Print
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type (t) A synonym for
print.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unalias <br>
Takes a list of names defined by alias commands and discards
the remembered groups of users. The group names no longer
have any significance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">undelete <br>
(u) Takes a message list and marks each message as not being
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unread (U) Takes a message list
and marks each message as not having been read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unset Takes a list of option
names and discards their remembered values; the inverse of
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">visual (v) Takes a message list
and invokes the display editor on each message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">write (w) Similar to save,
except that only the message body (without the header) is
saved. Extremely useful for such tasks as sending and
receiving source program text over the <br>
message system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xit (x) A synonym for exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">z mail presents message headers
in windowfuls as described under the headers command. You
can move mail&rsquo;s attention forward to the next window
with the z command. Also, you <br>
can move to the previous window by using z-.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tilde/escapes <br>
Here is a summary of the tilde escapes, which are used when
composing messages to perform special functions. Tilde
escapes are only recognized at the beginning of lines. The
name <br>
&acirc;tilde escape&acirc; is somewhat of a misnomer since
the actual escape character can be set by the option
escape.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~bname ... <br>
Add the given names to the list of carbon copy recipients
but do not make the names visible in the Cc: line
(&quot;blind&quot; carbon copy).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~cname ... <br>
Add the given names to the list of carbon copy
recipients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~d Read the file dead.letter
from your home directory into the message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~e Invoke the text editor on the
message collected so far. After the editing session is
finished, you may continue appending text to the
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~Fmessages <br>
Identical to ~f, except all message headers are
included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~fmessages <br>
Read the named messages into the message being sent. If no
messages are specified, read in the current message. Message
headers currently being ignored (by the ignore or <br>
retain command) are not included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~h Edit the message header
fields by typing each one in turn and allowing the user to
append text to the end or modify the field by using the
current terminal erase and kill <br>
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~Mmessages <br>
Identical to ~m, except all message headers are
included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~mmessages <br>
Read the named messages into the message being sent,
indented by a tab or by the value of indentprefix. If no
messages are specified, read the current message. Message
<br>
headers currently being ignored (by the ignore or retain
command) are not included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~p Print out the message
collected so far, prefaced by the message header fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~q Abort the message being sent,
copying the message to dead.letter in your home directory if
save is set. <br>
~Rstring <br>
Use string as the Reply-To field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~rfilename <br>
~&lt;filename <br>
Read the named file into the message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~sstring <br>
Cause the named string to become the current subject
field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~tname ... <br>
Add the given names to the direct recipient list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~v Invoke an alternate editor
(defined by the VISUAL option) on the message collected so
far. Usually, the alternate editor will be a screen editor.
After you quit the edi&acirc; <br>
tor, you may resume appending text to the end of your
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~wfilename <br>
Write the message onto the named file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~x Abort the message being sent.
No message is copied to ~/dead.letter, even if save is
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~? Prints a brief summary of
tilde escapes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~!command <br>
Execute the indicated shell command, then return to the
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~|command <br>
Pipe the message through the command as a filter. If the
command gives no output or terminates abnormally, retain the
original text of the message. The command fmt(1) is <br>
often used as command to rejustify the message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~:mail-command <br>
~_mail-command <br>
Execute the given mail command. Not all commands, however,
are allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~~string <br>
Insert the string of text in the message prefaced by a
single ~. If you have changed the escape character, then you
should double that character in order to send it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~. Simulate end of file on
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mail options <br>
Options are controlled via set and unset commands. Options
may be either binary, in which case it is only significant
to see whether they are set or not; or string, in which case
<br>
the actual value is of interest. The binary options include
the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">append Causes messages saved in
mbox to be appended to the end rather than prepended. This
should always be set (perhaps in /etc/mail.rc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ask, asksub <br>
Causes mail to prompt you for the subject of each message
you send. If you respond with simply a newline, no subject
field will be sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">askbcc Causes you to be prompted
for additional blind carbon copy recipients at the end of
each message. Responding with a newline indicates your
satisfaction with the current <br>
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">askcc Causes you to be prompted
for additional carbon copy recipients at the end of each
message. Responding with a newline indicates your
satisfaction with the current list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoinc <br>
Causes new mail to be automatically incorporated when it
arrives. Setting this is similar to issuing the inc command
at each prompt, except that the current message is not <br>
reset when new mail arrives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoprint <br>
Causes the delete command to behave like dp; thus, after
deleting a message, the next one will be typed
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug Setting the binary option
debug is the same as specifying -d on the command line and
causes mail to output all sorts of information useful for
debugging mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dot The binary option dot causes
mail to interpret a period alone on a line as the terminator
of a message you are sending.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expandaddr <br>
Causes mail to expand message recipient addresses, as
explained in the section Recipient address
specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">from Causes mail to use the
specified sender address in the &acirc;From:&acirc; field of
the message header. A stripped down version of the address
is also used in the message envelope. <br>
If unset, the message will not include an explicit sender
address and a default value will be added by the MTA,
typically &acirc;user@host&acirc;. This value can be
overridden by <br>
specifying the -r flag on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hold This option is used to hold
messages in the system mailbox by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignore Causes interrupt signals
from your terminal to be ignored and echoed as
@&rsquo;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignoreeof <br>
An option related to dot is ignoreeof which makes mail
refuse to accept a control-D as the end of a message.
ignoreeof also applies to mail command mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keep Setting this option causes
mail to truncate your system mailbox instead of deleting it
when it&rsquo;s empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keepsave <br>
Messages saved with the save command are not normally saved
in mbox at quit time. Use this option to retain those
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">metoo Usually, when a group is
expanded that contains the sender, the sender is removed
from the expansion. Setting this option causes the sender to
be included in the group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noheader <br>
Setting the option noheader is the same as giving the -N
flag on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nosave Normally, when you abort
a message with two interrupt characters (usually control-C),
mail copies the partial letter to the file dead.letter in
your home directory. Set&acirc; <br>
ting the binary option nosave prevents this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quiet Suppresses the printing of
the version when first invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replyall <br>
Reverses the sense of reply and Reply commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">searchheaders <br>
If this option is set, then a message-list specifier in the
form &acirc;/x:y&acirc; will expand to all messages
containing the substring &acirc;y&acirc; in the header field
&acirc;x&acirc;. The string search <br>
is case insensitive. If &acirc;x&acirc; is omitted, it will
default to the &acirc;Subject&acirc; header field. The form
&acirc;/to:y&acirc; is a special case, and will expand to
all messages containing the <br>
substring &acirc;y&acirc; in the &acirc;To&acirc;,
&acirc;Cc&acirc; or &acirc;Bcc&acirc; header fields. The
check for &acirc;to&acirc; is case sensitive, so that
&acirc;/To:y&acirc; can be used to limit the search for
&acirc;y&acirc; to just the &acirc;To:&acirc; <br>
field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skipempty <br>
Don&rsquo;t send messages with an empty body.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbose <br>
Setting the option verbose is the same as using the -v flag
on the command line. When mail runs in verbose mode, the
actual delivery of messages is displayed on the user&rsquo;s
<br>
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option string values <br>
EDITOR Pathname of the text editor to use in the edit
command and ~e escape. If not defined, /usr/bin/ex is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LISTER Pathname of the directory
lister to use in the folders command. Default is
/bin/ls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MBOX The name of the mbox file.
It can be the name of a folder. The default is
&acirc;mbox&acirc; in the user&rsquo;s home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAGER Pathname of the program to
use in the more command or when the crt variable is set. The
default paginator more(1) is used if this option is not
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPLYTO If set, will be used to
initialize the Reply-To field for outgoing messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHELL Pathname of the shell to
use in the ! command and the ~! escape. A default shell is
used if this option is not defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR Directory in which
temporary files are stored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VISUAL Pathname of the text
editor to use in the visual command and ~v escape. If not
defined, /usr/bin/vi is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">crt The valued option crt is
used as a threshold to determine how long a message must be
before PAGER is used to read it. If crt is set without a
value, then the height <br>
of the terminal screen stored in the system is used to
compute the threshold (see stty(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">escape If defined, the first
character of this option gives the character to use in the
place of ~ to denote escapes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">folder The name of the directory
to use for storing folders of messages. If this name begins
with a &acirc;/&acirc;, mail considers it to be an absolute
pathname; otherwise, the folder <br>
directory is found relative to your home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indentprefix String used by the
~m tilde escape for indenting messages, in place of the
normal tab character (&acirc;^I&acirc;). Be sure to quote
the value if it contains spaces or tabs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">record If defined, gives the
pathname of the file used to record all outgoing mail. If
not defined, then outgoing mail is not so saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">screen Size of window of message
headers for z.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sendmail Pathname to an
alternative mail delivery system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">toplines If defined, gives the
number of lines of a message to be printed out with the top
command; normally, the first five lines are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
mail utilizes the HOME, LOGNAME, USER, SHELL, DEAD, PAGER,
LISTER, EDITOR, VISUAL, REPLYTO, MAIL, MAILRC, and MBOX
environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the MAIL environment variable
is set, its value is used as the path to the user&rsquo;s
mail spool.</p>
