<p>DEBCHANGE(1) General Commands Manual DEBCHANGE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
debchange - Tool for maintenance of the debian/changelog
file in a source package</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
debchange [options] [text ...] <br>
dch [options] [text ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
debchange or its alias dch will add a new comment line to
the Debian changelog in the current source tree. This
command must be run from within that tree. If the text of
the <br>
change is given on the command line, debchange will run in
batch mode and simply add the text, with line breaks as
necessary, at the appropriate place in debian/changelog (or
the <br>
changelog specified by options, as described below). If no
text is specified then debchange will run the editor as
determined by sensible-editor for you to edit the file. (The
<br>
environment variables VISUAL and EDITOR are used in this
order to determine which editor to use.) Editors which
understand the +n option for starting the editing on a
specified <br>
line will use this to move to the correct line of the file
for editing. If the editor is quit without modifying the
temporary file, debchange will exit without touching the
<br>
existing changelog. Note that the changelog is assumed to be
encoded with the UTF-8 encoding. If it is not, problems may
occur. Please see the iconv(1) manpage to find out how <br>
to convert changelogs from legacy encodings. Finally, a
changelog or NEWS file can be created from scratch using the
--create option described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debchange also supports
automatically producing bug-closing changelog entries, using
the --closes option. This will usually query the BTS, the
Debian Bug Tracking System (see <br>
https://bugs.debian.org/) to determine the title of the bug
and the package in which it occurs. This behaviour can be
stopped by giving a --noquery option or by setting the
con&acirc; <br>
figuration variable DEBCHANGE_QUERY_BTS to no, as described
below. In either case, the editor (as described above) will
always be invoked to give an opportunity to modify the <br>
entries, and the changelog will be accepted whether or not
modifications are made. An extra changelog entry can be
given on the command line in addition to the closes
entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At most one of --append,
--increment, --edit, --release, and --newversion may be
specified as listed below. If no options are specified,
debchange will use heuristics to guess <br>
whether or not the package has been successfully released,
and behave as if --increment had been specified if the
package has been released, or otherwise as if --append has
been <br>
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two different sets of heuristics
can be used, as controlled by the --release-heuristic option
or the DEBCHANGE_RELEASE_HEURISTIC configuration variable.
The default changelog <br>
heuristic assumes the package has been released unless its
changelog contains UNRELEASED in the distribution field. If
this heuristic is enabled then the distribution will <br>
default to UNRELEASED in new changelog entries, and the
--mainttrailer option described below will be automatically
enabled. This can be useful if a package can be released by
<br>
different maintainers, or if you do not keep the upload
logs. The alternate log heuristic determines if a package
has been released by looking for an appropriate dupload(1)
or <br>
dput(1) log file in the parent directory. A warning will be
issued if the log file is found but a successful upload is
not recorded. This may be because the previous upload was
<br>
performed with a version of dupload prior to 2.1 or because
the upload failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If either --increment or
--newversion is used, the name and email for the new version
will be determined as follows. If the environment variable
DEBFULLNAME is set, this will be <br>
used for the maintainer full name; if not, then NAME will be
checked. If the environment variable DEBEMAIL is set, this
will be used for the email address. If this variable has
<br>
the form &quot;name &lt;email&gt;&quot;, then the maintainer
name will also be taken from here if neither DEBFULLNAME nor
NAME is set. If this variable is not set, the same test is
performed on <br>
the environment variable EMAIL. Next, if the full name has
still not been determined, then use getpwuid(3) to determine
the name from the password file. If this fails, use the <br>
previous changelog entry. For the email address, if it has
not been set from DEBEMAIL or EMAIL, then look in
/etc/mailname, then attempt to build it from the username
and FQDN, <br>
otherwise use the email address in the previous changelog
entry. In other words, it&rsquo;s a good idea to set
DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME when using this script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support is included for
changelogs that record changes by multiple co-maintainers of
a package. If an entry is appended to the current
version&rsquo;s entries, and the maintainer is <br>
different from the maintainer who is listed as having done
the previous entries, then lines will be added to the
changelog to tell which maintainers made which changes.
Currently <br>
only one of the several such styles of recording this
information is supported, in which the name of the
maintainer who made a set of changes appears on a line
before the <br>
changes, inside square brackets. This can be switched on and
off using the --[no]multimaint option or the
DEBCHANGE_MULTIMAINT configuration file option; the default
is to enable <br>
it. Note that if an entry has already been marked in this
way, then this option will be silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the directory name of the
source tree has the form package-version, then debchange
will also attempt to rename it if the (upstream) version
number changes. This can be pre&acirc; <br>
vented by using the --preserve command line or configuration
file option as described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --force-bad-version or
--allow-lower-version is used, debchange will not stop if
the new version is less than the current one. This is
especially useful while doing back&acirc; <br>
ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Directory name checking <br>
In common with several other scripts in the devscripts
package, debchange will climb the directory tree until it
finds a debian/changelog file. As a safeguard against stray
<br>
files causing potential problems, it will examine the name
of the parent directory once it finds the debian/changelog
file, and check that the directory name corresponds to the
<br>
package name. Precisely how it does this is controlled by
two configuration file variables
DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL and
DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX, and their corre&acirc; <br>
sponding command-line options --check-dirname-level and
--check-dirname-regex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL
can take the following values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Never check the directory
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Only check the directory name
if we have had to change directory in our search for
debian/changelog. This is the default behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Always check the directory
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directory name is checked by
testing whether the current directory name (as determined by
pwd(1)) matches the regex given by the configuration file
option <br>
DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX or by the command line option
--check-dirname-regex regex. Here regex is a Perl regex (see
perlre(3perl)), which will be anchored at the beginning <br>
and the end. If regex contains a &rsquo;/&rsquo;, then it
must match the full directory path. If not, then it must
match the full directory name. If regex contains the string
&Acirc;&acute;PACKAGE&rsquo;, <br>
this will be replaced by the source package name, as
determined from the changelog. The default value for the
regex is: &Acirc;&acute;PACKAGE(-.+)?&rsquo;, thus matching
directory names such as <br>
PACKAGE and PACKAGE-version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default changelog to be
edited is debian/changelog; however, this can be changed
using the --changelog or --news options or the CHANGELOG
environment variable, as described <br>
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--append, -a <br>
Add a new changelog entry at the end of the current
version&rsquo;s entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--increment, -i <br>
Increment either the final component of the Debian release
number or, if this is a native Debian package, the version
number. On Ubuntu or Tanglu, this will also change <br>
the suffix from buildX to ubuntu1/tanglu1. Use -R, --rebuild
for a no change rebuild increment. This creates a new
section at the beginning of the changelog with appro&acirc;
<br>
priate headers and footers. Also, if this is a new version
of a native Debian package, the directory name is changed to
reflect this. If DEBCHANGE_RELEASE_HEURISTIC is <br>
changelog (default) and the current release is UNRELEASED,
this will only change the version of the current changelog
stanza. Otherwise, this will create a new changelog <br>
stanza with the new version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--newversion version, -v version
<br>
This specifies the version number (including the Debian
release part) explicitly and behaves as the --increment
option in other respects. It will also change the
direc&acirc; <br>
tory name if the upstream version number has changed. If
DEBCHANGE_RELEASE_HEURISTIC is changelog (default) and the
current release is UNRELEASED, this will only change <br>
the version of the current changelog stanza. Otherwise, this
will create a new changelog stanza with the new version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--edit, -e <br>
Edit the changelog in an editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--release, -r <br>
Finalize the changelog for a release. Update the changelog
timestamp. If the distribution is set to UNRELEASED, change
it to the distribution from the previous changelog <br>
entry (or another distribution as specified by
--distribution). If there are no previous changelog entries
and an explicit distribution has not been specified,
unstable <br>
will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force-save-on-release <br>
When --release is used, an editor is opened to allow
inspection of the changelog. The user is required to save
the file to accept the modified changelog, otherwise the
<br>
original will be kept (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-force-save-on-release <br>
Do not do so. Note that a dummy changelog entry may be
supplied in order to achieve the same effect - e.g.
debchange --release &quot;&quot;. The entry will not be
added to the <br>
changelog but its presence will suppress the editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--create <br>
This will create a new debian/changelog file (or NEWS if the
--news option is used). You must be in the top-level
directory to use this; no directory name checking will <br>
be performed. The package name and version can either be
specified using the --package and --newversion options,
determined from the directory name using the <br>
--fromdirname option or entered manually into the generated
changelog file. The maintainer name is determined from the
environment if this is possible, and the distribu&acirc;
<br>
tion is specified either using the --distribution option or
in the generated changelog file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--empty <br>
When used in combination with --create, suppress the
automatic addition of an &quot;initial release&quot;
changelog entry (so that the next invocation of debchange
adds the first <br>
entry). Note that this will cause a dpkg-parsechangelog
warning on the next invocation due to the lack of
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--package package <br>
This specifies the package name to be used in the new
changelog; this may only be used in conjunction with the
--create, --increment and --newversion options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nmu, -n <br>
Increment the Debian release number for a non-maintainer
upload by either appending a &quot;.1&quot; to a non-NMU
version number (unless the package is Debian native, in
which case <br>
&quot;+nmu1&quot; is appended) or by incrementing an NMU
version number, and add an NMU changelog comment. This
happens automatically if the packager is neither in the
Maintainer <br>
nor the Uploaders field in debian/control, unless
DEBCHANGE_AUTO_NMU is set to no or the --no-auto-nmu option
is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bin-nmu <br>
Increment the Debian release number for a binary
non-maintainer upload by either appending a &quot;+b1&quot;
to a non-binNMU version number or by incrementing a binNMU
version num&acirc; <br>
ber, and add a binNMU changelog comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--qa, -q <br>
Increment the Debian release number for a Debian QA Team
upload, and add a QA upload changelog comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rebuild, -R <br>
Increment the Debian release number for a no-change rebuild
by appending a &quot;build1&quot; or by incrementing a
rebuild version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--security, -s <br>
Increment the Debian release number for a Debian Security
Team non-maintainer upload, and add a Security Team upload
changelog comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--team Increment the Debian
release number for a team upload, and add a Team upload
changelog comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--upstream, -U <br>
Don&rsquo;t append distro-name1 to the version on a derived
distribution. Increment the Debian version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bpo Increment the Debian
release number for an upload to jessie-backports, and add a
backport upload changelog comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--local, -lsuffix <br>
Add a suffix to the Debian version number for a local
build.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force-bad-version, -b <br>
Force a version number to be less than the current one
(e.g., when backporting).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-lower-version pattern
<br>
Allow a version number to be less than the current one if
the new version matches the specified pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force-distribution <br>
Force the provided distribution to be used, even if it
doesn&rsquo;t match the list of known distributions (e.g.
for unofficial distributions).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--auto-nmu <br>
Attempt to automatically determine whether a change to the
changelog represents a Non Maintainer Upload. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-auto-nmu <br>
Disable automatic NMU detection. Equivalent to setting
DEBCHANGE_AUTO_NMU to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fromdirname, -d <br>
This will take the upstream version number from the
directory name, which should be of the form package-version.
If the upstream version number has increased from the <br>
most recent changelog entry, then a new entry will be made
with version number version-1 (or version if the package is
Debian native), with the same epoch as the previous <br>
package version. If the upstream version number is the same,
this option will behave in the same way as -i.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--closes nnnnn[,nnnnn ...] <br>
Add changelog entries to close the specified bug numbers.
Also invoke the editor after adding these entries. Will
generate warnings if the BTS cannot be contacted (and <br>
--noquery has not been specified), or if there are problems
with the bug report located.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no]query <br>
Should we attempt to query the BTS when generating closes
entries?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preserve, -p <br>
Preserve the source tree directory name if the upstream
version number (or the version number of a Debian native
package) changes. See also the configuration variables <br>
section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-preserve, --nopreserve <br>
Do not preserve the source tree directory name
(default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--vendor vendor <br>
Override the distributor ID over the default returned by
dpkg-vendor. This name is used for heuristics applied to new
package versions and for sanity checking of the tar&acirc;
<br>
get distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--distribution dist, -D dist
<br>
Use the specified distribution in the changelog entry being
edited, instead of using the previous changelog
entry&rsquo;s distribution for new entries or the existing
value for <br>
existing entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--urgency urgency, -u urgency
<br>
Use the specified urgency in the changelog entry being
edited, instead of using the default &quot;medium&quot; for
new entries or the existing value for existing entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--changelog file, -c file <br>
This will edit the changelog file instead of the standard
debian/changelog. This option overrides any CHANGELOG
environment variable setting. Also, no directory
travers&acirc; <br>
ing or checking will be performed when this option is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--news [newsfile] <br>
This will edit newsfile (by default, debian/NEWS) instead of
the regular changelog. Directory searching will be
performed. The changelog will be examined in order to <br>
determine the current package version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no]multimaint <br>
Should we indicate that parts of a changelog entry have been
made by different maintainers? Default is yes; see the
discussion above and also the DEBCHANGE_MULTIMAINT <br>
configuration file option below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no]multimaint-merge <br>
Should all changes made by the same author be merged into
the same changelog section? Default is no; see the
discussion above and also the DEBCHANGE_MULTIMAINT_MERGE
con&acirc; <br>
figuration file option below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--maintmaint, -m <br>
Do not modify the maintainer details previously listed in
the changelog. This is useful particularly for sponsors
wanting to automatically add a sponsorship message
with&acirc; <br>
out disrupting the other changelog details. Note that there
may be some interesting interactions if multi-maintainer
mode is in use; you will probably wish to check the <br>
changelog manually before uploading it in such cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--controlmaint, -M <br>
Use maintainer details from the debian/control Maintainer
field rather than relevant environment variables
(DEBFULLNAME, DEBEMAIL, etc.). This option might be useful
to <br>
restore details of the main maintainer in the changelog
trailer after a bogus edit (e.g. when -m was intended but
forgot) or when releasing a package in the name of the <br>
main maintainer (e.g. the team).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no]mainttrailer, -t <br>
If mainttrailer is set, it will avoid modifying the existing
changelog trailer line (i.e. the maintainer and date-stamp
details), unless used with options that require the <br>
trailer to be modified (e.g. --create, --release, -i, --qa,
etc.) This option differs from --maintmaint in that it will
use multi-maintainer mode if appropriate, with the <br>
exception of editing the trailer. See also the
DEBCHANGE_MAINTTRAILER configuration file option below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check-dirname-level N <br>
See the above section &quot;Directory name checking&quot;
for an explanation of this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check-dirname-regex regex <br>
See the above section &quot;Directory name checking&quot;
for an explanation of this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-conf, --noconf <br>
Do not read any configuration files. This can only be used
as the first option given on the command-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--release-heuristic
log|changelog <br>
Controls how debchange determines if a package has been
released, when deciding whether to create a new changelog
entry or append to an existing changelog entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help, -h <br>
Display a help message and exit successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Display version and copyright information and exit
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION VARIABLES <br>
The two configuration files /etc/devscripts.conf and
~/.devscripts are sourced in that order to set configuration
variables. Command line options can be used to override
config&acirc; <br>
uration file settings. Environment variable settings are
ignored for this purpose. The currently recognised variables
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBCHANGE_PRESERVE <br>
If this is set to yes, then it is the same as the --preserve
command line parameter being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBCHANGE_QUERY_BTS <br>
If this is set to no, then it is the same as the --noquery
command line parameter being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL,
DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX <br>
See the above section &quot;Directory name checking&quot;
for an explanation of these variables. Note that these are
package-wide configuration variables, and will therefore
affect <br>
all devscripts scripts which check their value, as described
in their respective manpages and in devscripts.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBCHANGE_RELEASE_HEURISTIC <br>
Controls how debchange determines if a package has been
released, when deciding whether to create a new changelog
entry or append to an existing changelog entry. Can be <br>
either log or changelog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBCHANGE_MULTIMAINT <br>
If set to no, debchange will not introduce
multiple-maintainer distinctions when a different maintainer
appends an entry to an existing changelog. See the
discussion <br>
above. Default is yes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBCHANGE_MULTIMAINT_MERGE <br>
If set to yes, when adding changes in multiple-maintainer
mode debchange will check whether previous changes by the
current maintainer exist and add the new changes to the <br>
existing block rather than creating a new block. Default is
no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBCHANGE_MAINTTRAILER <br>
If this is set to no, then it is the same as the
--nomainttrailer command line parameter being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBCHANGE_TZ <br>
Use this timezone for changelog entries. Default is the
user/system timezone as shown by &lsquo;date -R&lsquo; and
affected by the environment variable TZ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBCHANGE_LOWER_VERSION_PATTERN
<br>
If this is set, then it is the same as the
--allow-lower-version command line parameter being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBCHANGE_AUTO_NMU <br>
If this is set to no then debchange will not attempt to
automatically determine whether the current changelog stanza
represents an NMU. The default is yes. See the dis&acirc;
<br>
cussion of the --nmu option above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBCHANGE_FORCE_SAVE_ON_RELEASE
<br>
If this is set to no, then it is the same as the
--no-force-save-on-release command line parameter being
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBCHANGE_VENDOR <br>
Use this vendor instead of the default (dpkg-vendor output).
See --vendor for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DEBEMAIL, EMAIL, DEBFULLNAME, NAME <br>
See the above description of the use of these environment
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHANGELOG <br>
This variable specifies the changelog to edit in place of
debian/changelog. No directory traversal or checking is
performed when this variable is set. This variable is <br>
overridden by the --changelog command-line setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VISUAL, EDITOR <br>
These environment variables (in this order) determine the
editor used by sensible-editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
debc(1), debclean(1), dput(1), dupload(1),
