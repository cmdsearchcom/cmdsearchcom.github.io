<p>DMTCP(1) Distributed MultiThreaded CheckPointing
DMTCP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dmtcp - Distributed MultiThreaded Checkpointing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dmtcp_coordinator [port]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dmtcp_launch command
[args...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dmtcp_restart ckpt_FILE1.dmtcp
[ckpt_FILE2.dmtcp...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dmtcp_command
coordinatorCommand</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
DMTCP is a tool to transparently checkpointing the state of
an arbitrary group of programs spread across many machines
and connected by sockets. It does not modify the
user&rsquo;s <br>
program nor the operating system. MTCP is a standalone
component of DMTCP available as a checkpointing library for
a single process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
For each command, the --help or -h flag will show the
command-line options. Most command line options can also be
controlled through environment variables. These can be set
in <br>
bash with &quot;export NAME=value&quot; or in tcsh with
&quot;setenv NAME value&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">DMTCP_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL=integer
<br>
Time in seconds between automatic checkpoints. Checkpoints
can also be initiated manually by typing &rsquo;c&rsquo;
into the coordinator. (default: 0, disabled;
dmtcp_coordinator <br>
only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DMTCP_HOST=string <br>
Hostname where the cluster-wide coordinator is running.
(default: localhost; dmtcp_launch, dmtcp_restart only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DMTCP_PORT=integer <br>
The port the cluster-wide coordinator listens on. (default:
7779)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DMTCP_GZIP=(1|0) <br>
Set to &quot;0&quot; to disable compression of checkpoint
images. (default: 1, compression enabled; dmtcp_launch only)
WARNING: gzip adds seconds. Without gzip, ckpt/restart is
<br>
often less than 1 s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DMTCP_CHECKPOINT_DIR=path <br>
Directory to store checkpoint images in. (default: ./)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DMTCP_SIGCKPT=integer <br>
Internal signal number to use for checkpointing. Must not be
used by the user program. (default: SIGUSR2; dmtcp_launch
only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DMTCP_COORDINATOR <br>
Each computation to be checkpointed must include a DMTCP
coordinator process. One can explicitly start a coordinator
through dmtcp_coordinator, or allow one to be started <br>
implicitly in background by either dmtcp_launch or
dmtcp_restart to operate. The address of the unique
coordinator should be specified by dmtcp_launch,
dmtcp_restart, and <br>
dmtcp_command either through the --host and --port
command-line flags or through the the DMTCP_HOST and
DMTCP_PORT environment variables. If neither is given, the
host-port pair <br>
defaults to localhost-7779. The host-port pair associated
with a particular coordinator is given by the command-line
flags used in the dmtcp_coordinator command, or the
environ&acirc; <br>
ment variables then in effect, or the default of
localhost-7779.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The coordinator is stateless and
is not checkpointed. On restart, one can use an existing or
a new coordinator. Multiple computations under DMTCP control
can coexist by provid&acirc; <br>
ing a unique coordinator (with a unique host-port pair) for
each such computation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The coordinator initiates a
checkpoint for all processes in its computation group.
Checkpoints can be: performed automatically on an interval
(see DMTCP_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL <br>
above); or initiated manually on the standard input of the
coordinator (see next paragraph); or initiated directly
under program control by the comptuation through the
dmtcpaware <br>
API (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The coordinator accepts the
following commands on its standard input. Each command
should be followed by the &lt;return&gt; key. The commands
are: <br>
l : List connected nodes <br>
s : Print status message <br>
c : Checkpoint all nodes <br>
f : Force a restart even if there are missing nodes
(debugging) <br>
k : Kill all nodes <br>
q : Kill all nodes and quit <br>
? : Show this message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Coordinator commands can also be
issued remotely using dmtcp_command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE USAGE <br>
1. In a separate terminal window, start the
dmtcp_coodinator. <br>
(See previous section.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dmtcp_coordinator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. In separate terminal(s),
replace each command(s) with &quot;dmtcp_launch <br>
[command]&quot;. The checkpointed program will connect to
the coordinator specified by DMTCP_HOST and DMTCP_PORT. New
threads will be checkpointed as part of the process. <br>
Child processes will automatically be checkpointed. Remote
processes started via ssh will automatically checkpointed.
(Internally, DMTCP modifies the ssh command line to <br>
call dmtcp_launch on the remote host.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dmtcp_launch ./myprogram</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. To manually initiate a
checkpoint, either run the command below <br>
or type &quot;c&quot; followed by &lt;return&gt; into the
coordinator. Checkpoint files for each process will be
written to DMTCP_CHECKPOINT_DIR. The dmtcp_coordinator will
write <br>
&quot;dmtcp_restart_script.sh&quot; to its working
directory. This script contains the necessary calls to
dmtcp_restart to restart the entire computation, including
remote pro&acirc; <br>
cesses created via ssh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dmtcp_command -c <br>
OR: dmtcp_command --checkpoint</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. To restart, one should
execute dmtcp_restart_script.sh, which is <br>
created by the dmtcp_coordinator in its working directory at
the time of checkpoint. One can optionally edit this script
to migrate processes to different hosts. By <br>
default, only one restarted process will be restarted in the
foreground and receive the standard input. The script may be
edited to choose which process will be restarted <br>
in the foreground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./dmtcp_restart_script.sh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DMTCPAWARE API <br>
DMTCP provides a programming interface to allow checkpointed
applications to interact with dmtcp. In the source
distribution, see dmtcpaware/dmtcpaware.h for the functions
<br>
available. See test/dmtcpaware[123].c for three example
applications. For an example of its usage, try:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd test; rm dmtcpaware1; make
dmtcpaware1; ./autotest -v dmtcpaware1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user application should link
with libdmtcpaware.so (-ldmtcpaware) and use the header file
dmtcp/dmtcpaware.h.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DMTCP PLUGIN MODULES <br>
The source distribution includes a top-level plugin
directory, with examples of how to write a plugin module for
DMTCP. Further examples are in the test/plugin directory.
The <br>
plugin feature adds three new user-programmable
capabilities. A plugin may: add wrappers around system
calls; take special actions at during certain events (e.g.
pre-checkpoint, <br>
resume/post-checkpoint, restart); and may insert key-value
pairs into a database at restart time that is then available
to be queried by the restarted processes of a computation.
<br>
(The events available to the plugin feature form a superset
of the events available with the dmtcpaware interface.) One
or more plugins are invoked via a list of colon-separated
<br>
absolute pathnames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dmtcp_launch --with-plugin
PLUGIN1[:PLUGIN2]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN CODE <br>
A target program under DMTCP control normally returns the
same return code as if executed without DMTCP. However, if
DMTCP fails (as opposed to the target program failing), <br>
DMTCP returns a DMTCP-specific return code, rc (or rc+1,
rc+2 for two special cases), where rc is the integer value
of the environment variable DMTCP_FAIL_RC if set, or else
the <br>
default value, 99.</p>
