The <b>asmail</b> is a X11 application that acts as an e-mail monitor for a
  number of various format mailboxes. The <b>asmail</b> provides a distinctive
  Afterstep window manager look and feel and features multiple options to allow
  the customization.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Basically, the tool shows you the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
- The background image changes depending on whether
<br/>
 there is e-mail in your mailboxes or not.
<br/>
 Custom images may be loaded and used for animation
<br/>
 sequences.
<div class="Pp"></div>
- The tool will display the number of e-mails waiting
<br/>
 in each mailbox and/or the total numbers for all
<br/>
 mailboxes together.
<div class="Pp"></div>
- For each mailbox, there is a status indicator that
<br/>
 shows whether the update is running at this moment
<br/>
 and indicates if there is an error. The same indicator
<br/>
 shows up next to the summary line.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The folowing indicators are used for the status display:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 <b>R</b> An update on the mailbox is running at this moment.
<br/>
 For small mailboxes with fast access, you may never
<br/>
 actually see it - so fast it disappears.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 <b>L</b> An error occured that has to do with the login
<br/>
 procedure. Most probably, your name/password
<br/>
 combination was not accepted by the server.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 <b>C</b> A connection problem. <b>asmail</b> could not
<br/>
 connect to the server for some reason. The reasons
<br/>
 may be many - server down, network unreachable,
<br/>
 service not available and so on.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 <b>T</b> A time-out has occured while <b>asmail</b> was
<br/>
 waiting for the server's answer. If you have a
<br/>
 frequent problem with this but the server seems
<br/>
 to be available in other applicaitons, try
<br/>
 increasing the &quot;timeout&quot; setting for the mailbox.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 <b>F</b> This is an indicator of a general error condition.
<br/>
 Something is wrong, maybe the configuration is not
<br/>
 correct, or the mailbox is not readable. Check the
<br/>
 output of <b>asmail</b> by running from the terminal -
<br/>
 this should give you an idea of what is wrong.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The resource files may be specified with a command line option. The logic of
  <b>asmail</b> is simple: first it parses the resource file that you specified
  on the command line. If you do not specify the resource file on the command
  line, <b>asmail</b> will look in the default location (~/.asmailrc). If it
  exists, <b>asmail</b> will parse that one. If no configuration file was given
  on the command line and there is no configuration file in the default
  location, <b>asmail</b> will attempt to monitor the mailbox specified by the
  <b>$MAILBOX</b> environment variable.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>How asmail distinguishes between old and new mail.</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>UNIX mailbox</b> format does not contain any indication on the outside.
  The mailbox must be parsed to check if some e-mail is new. Parsing the mailbox
  is an expensive operation, especially if the mailbox is large. <b>asmail</b>
  checks the mailbox file modification time with the <b>stat</b>(2) system call.
  When the file modification time changes, the mailbox is parsed. The lines
  &quot; <b>From </b>&quot; are counted and taken to be the number of e-mails in
  the box. After each &quot; <b>From </b>&quot; line, asmail looks for the
  &quot; <b>Status:</b>&quot; header. This header contains flags when the
  message was seen and read. Messages without this header line (or with an empty
  header) are considered to be new.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>Maildir</b> format is very well-behaved. There are separate folders for
  old and new e-mails so we just count the number of files in &quot;
  <b>cur</b>&quot; and &quot; <b>new</b>&quot; subdirectories. The &quot;
  <b>tmp</b>&quot; subdirectory is ignored since this is the temporary storage
  and is not supposed to be taken into account.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>mH</b> format is somewhere between Maildir and the UNIX mailbox formats.
  It is used by mh, nmh, balsa and xfmail among others. The messages are all
  stored in separate files, one message per file, and all of the messages in a
  single directory. Each message file is named with an increasing number, so the
  first message recieved in the mailbox is stored as &quot;1&quot; and the 39th
  message is stored as &quot;39&quot;. There are two ways that the status of the
  messages are kept track of. Traditionally, the mH tools used a file called
  &quot; <b>.mh_sequences</b>&quot;, which is stored in the mH directory, to
  keep track of status. This file contains a series of sequences, each one
  starting with a token followed by a colon and then by a series of message
  numebrs, representing the messages that belong to that sequence. It looks
  something like this:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">unseen: 1 2 3-5 19 25-31</div>
Although there are many sequences, some standard and some user-defined, if the
  <b>use-mh-sequences</b> configuration option is set to &quot;yes&quot; for
  that mailbox, then asmail will parse this file, looking for the
  &quot;unseen&quot; sequence to determine how many messages are new. Some mail
  clients don't use the .mh_sequences file and instead treat the files in the mH
  mailbox just like a collection of seperate messages from a UNIX mailbox. So,
  if the <b>use-mh-sequences</b> configuration option is set to &quot;no&quot;,
  or is not specified at all, then asmail will parse all of the files in the mH
  directory, searching for the <b>Status</b> header. Therefore, this mode is
  definitely the most &quot;processor hungry&quot; format from the point of view
  of <b>asmail</b>. mh, nmh, and newer versions of balsa utilize the
  .mh_sequences file, while older versions of balsa and xfmail do not. It is not
  known how other clients treat mH mailboxes.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>POP3</b> protocol does not support the notion of new or old e-mail. Your
  e-mail client keeps a list of messages and can tell whether you read one of
  them or not. Since <b>asmail</b> does not keep a list of messages there is no
  way to tell a new message from the old one. Ok, so what we do is assume that
  all e-mail is new at start-up. This is a logical assumption for most of the
  people because they store the e-mail locally and remove it from the server.
  Others are out of luck. Now, when the number of messages decreases, we assume
  that you read all your e-mail and deleted some, so all messages are marked as
  old. When the number of messages increases, we assume that the new mail
  arrived and we report the additional mail as new.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>IMAP</b> protocol is very well behaved, it reports the number of new
  e-mails and the number of old e-mails if you ask politely :) Since we open the
  mailbox in read-only mode, we do not cause any status changes for the mailbox
  on the server. The <b>IMAP</b> server will store a special e-mail into your
  mailbox if it is in UNIX format. This e-mail allows the server to keep track
  of the new and old e-mails. The server will not report this e-mail into the
  number of e-mails, so that if you check your <b>UNIX mailbox</b> directly the
  number of messages will be one more.

</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Verbose mode. In this mode, <b>asmail</b> will
  print the information about mailboxes onto the controlling terminal. The
  information includes: number of updates requested, per mailbox: thread PID, [
  <b>R</b>]unning or idle, any errors are signalled with leters (see above) and
  the number of e-mails in the format new/old. This mode is useful for debugging
  or could be used to monitor mailboxes without X Windows interface (give the
  <b>-nox</b> option).</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-f resource file</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Specifies the alternative location for the

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-geometry X geometry specification</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Specifies the size and position of the
  application on the screen in the standard X11 format (see <b>XParseGeometry
  (3x)</b> for details):
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-noconfig</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Forces <b>asmail</b> to ignore the resource
  file even if one is present. <b>asmail</b> will run with all default settings
  and check the Unix mailbox specified by the <b>$MAIL</b> environment
  variable.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-nox</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Starts the <b>asmail</b> application in the
  terminal-only mode. The X Windows interface is not started. The configuration
  file is still parsed as usual though.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This option implies <b>-v</b> option.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-insecure</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Usually, <b>asmail</b> will check that the
  resource file has the <b>600</b> mode, that is there are no access rights for
  &quot;group&quot; and &quot;others&quot;. If such access rights are granted,
  <b>asmail</b> will complain and exit. This is done to make you remember the
  passwords you put into the resource file. If there are no passwords stored in
  the file (e.g. you are using UNIX mailbox on the local machine) the check is
  not applied.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This option forces <b>asmail</b> to continue operation even if the resource file
  has insecure permissions and passwords are stored in that file.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-iconic</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option will cause <b>asmail</b> to start
  up as an icon rather than as a normal window. The application can still be
  de-iconized and iconized as usual.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-withdrawn</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option will cause <b>asmail</b> to start
  up in a so-called &quot;withdrawn&quot; mode. This mode is used by
  <b>WindowMaker</b> window manager to dock the application into their version
  of the <b>Wharf</b>.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RESOURCE_FILE_SYNTAX"><a class="selflink" href="#RESOURCE_FILE_SYNTAX">RESOURCE
  FILE SYNTAX</a></h1>
The syntax of the resource file is described in a separate man page under
  <b>asmailrc</b> (5).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INVOCATION"><a class="selflink" href="#INVOCATION">INVOCATION</a></h1>
<b>asmail</b> can be called in different ways. The most common invocation is the
  command line:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	user@host[1]% asmail &amp;
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
Another way to call <b>asmail</b> is from the window manager:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	*Wharf &quot;asmail&quot; nil Swallow &quot;asmail&quot; /usr/local/bin/asmail &amp;
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
This line, when placed in the <i>wharf</i> file in the users Afterstep
  configuration directory will cause <b>asmail</b> to become a button on the
  <b>Wharf (1)</b> button bar under the <b>afterstep (1)</b> window manager.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
My programs do not have bugs, they just develop random features ;-)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Well, there are limitations. All the strings for the color names, file names,
  and other strings have the length limit of 256 characters (terminating zero
  included). The program will complain about very long names in the
  configuration file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The number of mailboxes is not limited by the space on the icon but the stats
  will be chopped (not shown) if you have too many and they do not fit into the
  icon. Make sure you pick up a tall icon if you have many mailboxes and want to
  see info on each of them because they are shown from the top down and there is
  no way to change this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The information about mailboxes will not appear when you use &quot;shaped&quot;
  windows with transparency if it is printed in the transparent area.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>asmail</b> may interfere with your mail client program when you use the POP3
  server. There is no way to login to the POP3 server twice (from the mail
  client and <b>asmail</b>), so there is an inherent race condition between the
  two. The one that tries to log in second, will fail. <b>asmail</b> logs out
  immediately after checking so your mail client will have a much higher chance
  of precluding <b>asmail</b> from logging in than the other way around.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the program is not satisfied with the specification of one of the mailboxes,
  it will print an error message, set the status for that mailbox to <b>F</b>
  (Failed) and exit the thread (only the thread that is responsible for handling
  that particular mailbox). Other mailboxes will be checked normally. Check the
  standard output of the tool to see what the problem is.
