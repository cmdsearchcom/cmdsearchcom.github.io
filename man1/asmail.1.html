<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
asmail - the AfterStep e-mail monitor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
asmail [-h] [-V] [-v] [-nox] <br>
[-insecure] <br>
[-noconfig] <br>
[-f resource file] <br>
[-geometry X geometry specification] <br>
[-iconic] <br>
[-withdrawn]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The asmail is a X11 application that acts as an e-mail
monitor for a number of various format mailboxes. The asmail
provides a distinctive Afterstep window manager look and
feel <br>
and features multiple options to allow the
customization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Basically, the tool shows you
the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The background image changes
depending on whether <br>
there is e-mail in your mailboxes or not. <br>
Custom images may be loaded and used for animation <br>
sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The tool will display the
number of e-mails waiting <br>
in each mailbox and/or the total numbers for all <br>
mailboxes together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- For each mailbox, there is a
status indicator that <br>
shows whether the update is running at this moment <br>
and indicates if there is an error. The same indicator <br>
shows up next to the summary line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The folowing indicators are used
for the status display:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R An update on the mailbox is
running at this moment. <br>
For small mailboxes with fast access, you may never <br>
actually see it - so fast it disappears.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L An error occured that has to
do with the login <br>
procedure. Most probably, your name/password <br>
combination was not accepted by the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C A connection problem. asmail
could not <br>
connect to the server for some reason. The reasons <br>
may be many - server down, network unreachable, <br>
service not available and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T A time-out has occured while
asmail was <br>
waiting for the server&rsquo;s answer. If you have a <br>
frequent problem with this but the server seems <br>
to be available in other applicaitons, try <br>
increasing the &quot;timeout&quot; setting for the
mailbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F This is an indicator of a
general error condition. <br>
Something is wrong, maybe the configuration is not <br>
correct, or the mailbox is not readable. Check the <br>
output of asmail by running from the terminal - <br>
this should give you an idea of what is wrong.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The resource files may be
specified with a command line option. The logic of asmail is
simple: first it parses the resource file that you specified
on the command line. If you <br>
do not specify the resource file on the command line, asmail
will look in the default location (~/.asmailrc). If it
exists, asmail will parse that one. If no configuration file
<br>
was given on the command line and there is no configuration
file in the default location, asmail will attempt to monitor
the mailbox specified by the $MAILBOX environment
vari&acirc; <br>
able.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How asmail distinguishes between
old and new mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The UNIX mailbox format does not
contain any indication on the outside. The mailbox must be
parsed to check if some e-mail is new. Parsing the mailbox
is an expensive operation, <br>
especially if the mailbox is large. asmail checks the
mailbox file modification time with the stat(2) system call.
When the file modification time changes, the mailbox is
parsed. <br>
The lines &quot;From &quot; are counted and taken to be the
number of e-mails in the box. After each &quot;From &quot;
line, asmail looks for the &quot;Status:&quot; header. This
header contains flags when <br>
the message was seen and read. Messages without this header
line (or with an empty header) are considered to be new.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Maildir format is very
well-behaved. There are separate folders for old and new
e-mails so we just count the number of files in
&quot;cur&quot; and &quot;new&quot; subdirectories. The
&quot;tmp&quot; <br>
subdirectory is ignored since this is the temporary storage
and is not supposed to be taken into account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mH format is somewhere
between Maildir and the UNIX mailbox formats. It is used by
mh, nmh, balsa and xfmail among others. The messages are all
stored in separate files, one <br>
message per file, and all of the messages in a single
directory. Each message file is named with an increasing
number, so the first message recieved in the mailbox is
stored as <br>
&quot;1&quot; and the 39th message is stored as
&quot;39&quot;. There are two ways that the status of the
messages are kept track of. Traditionally, the mH tools used
a file called &quot;.mh_sequences&quot;, <br>
which is stored in the mH directory, to keep track of
status. This file contains a series of sequences, each one
starting with a token followed by a colon and then by a
series of <br>
message numebrs, representing the messages that belong to
that sequence. It looks something like this: <br>
unseen: 1 2 3-5 19 25-31 <br>
Although there are many sequences, some standard and some
user-defined, if the use-mh-sequences configuration option
is set to &quot;yes&quot; for that mailbox, then asmail will
parse this <br>
file, looking for the &quot;unseen&quot; sequence to
determine how many messages are new. Some mail clients
don&rsquo;t use the .mh_sequences file and instead treat the
files in the mH mailbox <br>
just like a collection of seperate messages from a UNIX
mailbox. So, if the use-mh-sequences configuration option is
set to &quot;no&quot;, or is not specified at all, then
asmail will <br>
parse all of the files in the mH directory, searching for
the Status header. Therefore, this mode is definitely the
most &quot;processor hungry&quot; format from the point of
view of <br>
asmail. mh, nmh, and newer versions of balsa utilize the
.mh_sequences file, while older versions of balsa and xfmail
do not. It is not known how other clients treat mH
mail&acirc; <br>
boxes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The POP3 protocol does not
support the notion of new or old e-mail. Your e-mail client
keeps a list of messages and can tell whether you read one
of them or not. Since asmail <br>
does not keep a list of messages there is no way to tell a
new message from the old one. Ok, so what we do is assume
that all e-mail is new at start-up. This is a logical
assump&acirc; <br>
tion for most of the people because they store the e-mail
locally and remove it from the server. Others are out of
luck. Now, when the number of messages decreases, we assume
<br>
that you read all your e-mail and deleted some, so all
messages are marked as old. When the number of messages
increases, we assume that the new mail arrived and we report
the <br>
additional mail as new.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The IMAP protocol is very well
behaved, it reports the number of new e-mails and the number
of old e-mails if you ask politely :) Since we open the
mailbox in read-only mode, we <br>
do not cause any status changes for the mailbox on the
server. The IMAP server will store a special e-mail into
your mailbox if it is in UNIX format. This e-mail allows the
<br>
server to keep track of the new and old e-mails. The server
will not report this e-mail into the number of e-mails, so
that if you check your UNIX mailbox directly the number of
<br>
messages will be one more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION OPTIONS <br>
-h <br>
prints a short description and usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
Version control. Prints out the version of the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
Verbose mode. In this mode, asmail will print the
information about mailboxes onto the controlling terminal.
The information includes: number of updates requested, per
<br>
mailbox: thread PID, [R]unning or idle, any errors are
signalled with leters (see above) and the number of e-mails
in the format new/old. This mode is useful for debugging
<br>
or could be used to monitor mailboxes without X Windows
interface (give the -nox option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f resource file <br>
Specifies the alternative location for the resource file.
The default location is ~/.asmailrc If the alternative file
is specified, the default location is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-geometry X geometry
specification <br>
Specifies the size and position of the application on the
screen in the standard X11 format (see XParseGeometry (3x)
for details):</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">[=][&lt;width&gt;{xX}&lt;height&gt;][{+-}&lt;xoffset&gt;{+-}&lt;yoffset&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noconfig <br>
Forces asmail to ignore the resource file even if one is
present. asmail will run with all default settings and check
the Unix mailbox specified by the $MAIL environment <br>
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nox <br>
Starts the asmail application in the terminal-only mode. The
X Windows interface is not started. The configuration file
is still parsed as usual though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option implies -v
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-insecure <br>
Usually, asmail will check that the resource file has the
600 mode, that is there are no access rights for
&quot;group&quot; and &quot;others&quot;. If such access
rights are granted, asmail <br>
will complain and exit. This is done to make you remember
the passwords you put into the resource file. If there are
no passwords stored in the file (e.g. you are using <br>
UNIX mailbox on the local machine) the check is not
applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option forces asmail to
continue operation even if the resource file has insecure
permissions and passwords are stored in that file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iconic <br>
This option will cause asmail to start up as an icon rather
than as a normal window. The application can still be
de-iconized and iconized as usual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-withdrawn <br>
This option will cause asmail to start up in a so-called
&quot;withdrawn&quot; mode. This mode is used by WindowMaker
window manager to dock the application into their version of
<br>
the Wharf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESOURCE FILE SYNTAX <br>
The syntax of the resource file is described in a separate
man page under asmailrc (5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INVOCATION <br>
asmail can be called in different ways. The most common
invocation is the command line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user@host[1]% asmail &amp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another way to call asmail is
from the window manager:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*Wharf &quot;asmail&quot; nil
Swallow &quot;asmail&quot; /usr/local/bin/asmail &amp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This line, when placed in the
wharf file in the users Afterstep configuration directory
will cause asmail to become a button on the Wharf (1) button
bar under the afterstep (1) <br>
window manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
My programs do not have bugs, they just develop random
features ;-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Well, there are limitations. All
the strings for the color names, file names, and other
strings have the length limit of 256 characters (terminating
zero included). The program <br>
will complain about very long names in the configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of mailboxes is not
limited by the space on the icon but the stats will be
chopped (not shown) if you have too many and they do not fit
into the icon. Make sure you <br>
pick up a tall icon if you have many mailboxes and want to
see info on each of them because they are shown from the top
down and there is no way to change this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The information about mailboxes
will not appear when you use &quot;shaped&quot; windows with
transparency if it is printed in the transparent area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">asmail may interfere with your
mail client program when you use the POP3 server. There is
no way to login to the POP3 server twice (from the mail
client and asmail), so there is <br>
an inherent race condition between the two. The one that
tries to log in second, will fail. asmail logs out
immediately after checking so your mail client will have a
much <br>
higher chance of precluding asmail from logging in than the
other way around.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the program is not satisfied
with the specification of one of the mailboxes, it will
print an error message, set the status for that mailbox to F
(Failed) and exit the thread <br>
(only the thread that is responsible for handling that
particular mailbox). Other mailboxes will be checked
normally. Check the standard output of the tool to see what
the prob&acirc; <br>
lem is.</p>
