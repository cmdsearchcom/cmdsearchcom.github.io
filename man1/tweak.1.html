<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tweak - efficient hex editor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tweak [-l | -f] [-e] [-w width] [-o offset] filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tweak is a hex editor. It allows you to edit a file at very
low level, letting you see the full and exact binary
contents of the file. It can be useful for modifying binary
files <br>
such as executables, editing disk or CD images, debugging
programs that generate binary file formats incorrectly, and
many other things.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike simpler hex editors,
tweak possesses a fully functional insert mode. This is not
useful when editing many of the types of file described
above, but can be useful in other <br>
situations. Also, an insert mode makes it easy to use tweak
to construct new files from scratch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you open a file in tweak,
you can expect to see the screen contents looking something
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">00000000 7F 45 4C 46 01 01 01 00
.ELF.... <br>
00000008 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ........ <br>
00000010 02 00 03 00 01 00 00 00 ........ <br>
00000018 D0 8E 04 08 34 00 00 00 ....4... <br>
00000020 2C EF 01 00 00 00 00 00 ,.......</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The central column shows you the
hexadecimal value of each byte in the file you are editing.
The column on the right shows the ASCII interpretation of
those bytes, where applica&acirc; <br>
ble. In the example above, the sequence 45 4C 46 on the
first line translates into the ASCII upper-case letters
&lsquo;ELF&rsquo;, but the subsequent sequence 01 01 01 00
does not have any <br>
printable ASCII representation and so the right-hand column
simply prints dots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The column on the left shows the
position within the file of the start of each row.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In fact, when you start tweak,
you will usually see 16 bytes of the file per row, not 8 as
shown above. However, this is configurable if your screen is
narrower - or wider - than <br>
the usual 80 columns, or if the file you are editing
consists of fixed-size records of some other size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, tweak does not load
its entire input file into memory. Instead, it loads it
lazily, reading from the file on disk when you request a
view of a part of the file it <br>
doesn&rsquo;t have stored. When you modify the file, it
stores your modifications in memory, but continues to refer
to the original disk file for the parts you have not
touched. This <br>
means you can edit extremely large files (for example,
entire CD images) without difficulty; opening such a file is
instantaneous, making modifications causes tweak&rsquo;s
memory <br>
usage to grow with the size of the changes rather than the
size of the whole file, and only when saving the altered
version will tweak have to read through the entire input
file <br>
to write the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, this mode of operation
has a disadvantage, which is that if the input file is
modified by another program while tweak is running,
tweak&rsquo;s internal data structures will <br>
not be sufficient to keep track, and it is likely that the
file written out will contain a mixture of the old and new
contents of the input file. Therefore, you can disable this
<br>
lazy loading if you need to; see the -e option below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
This section lists the command-line options supported by
tweak.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Runs tweak in
&lsquo;fix&rsquo; mode, i.e. with the insert function
entirely disabled. This might be useful if you are editing a
file in which the insert mode is of no use (executa&acirc;
<br>
bles, for example, tend to have strong dependencies on
precise file offsets which make it almost impossible to
insert data in one without rendering it unusable) and you
<br>
want to avoid turning it on by mistake.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Runs tweak in
&lsquo;look&rsquo; mode. In this mode tweak does not allow
you to modify the data at all; it becomes simply a tool for
examining a file in detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Runs tweak in
&lsquo;eager&rsquo; mode. In this mode tweak will read its
entire input file when starting up. This causes it to take
up more memory, but means that it has no dependency <br>
on the input file remaining unmodified, and other programs
can alter it if they need to without causing trouble.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w width <br>
Specifies the number of bytes tweak will display per line.
The default is 16, which fits neatly in an 80-column
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o offset <br>
If this option is specified, tweak will ensure that the
given file offset occurs at the start of a line. For
example, if you loaded a file using the options -w 8 -o
0x13, <br>
you might see a display a bit like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">00000000 7F 45 4C .EL <br>
00000003 46 01 01 01 00 00 00 00 F....... <br>
0000000B 00 00 00 00 00 02 00 03 ........ <br>
00000013 00 01 00 00 00 D0 8E 04 ........ <br>
0000001B 08 34 00 00 00 2C EF 01 .4...,..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By putting only three bytes of
the file on the very first line, tweak has arranged that the
file offset 0x13 (19 in decimal) appears at the beginning of
the fourth line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You might use this option if you
knew you were editing a file in a particular format. For
example, if your file contained a 53-byte header followed by
a series of 22-byte <br>
records, you might find it useful to specify the options -w
22 -o 53. This would arrange that after the header, each
individual record of the file would appear on pre&acirc;
<br>
cisely one line of tweak&rsquo;s display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D If this option is specified,
tweak will not attempt to load and edit a file at all, but
will simply produce its default .tweakrc file on standard
output. This is a useful <br>
way to give yourself a starting point if you want to begin
reconfiguring tweak&rsquo;s keyboard layout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEYS <br>
This section describes all the editing keys supported by
tweak by default. The default key bindings for tweak are
basically Emacs-like.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Movement keys <br>
The Emacs cursor movement keys should all work, and their
counterparts in ordinary function keys ought to work
too:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; ^P and ^N go to
the previous and next lines; Up and Down should do the
same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; ^B and ^F go
back and forward one character; Left and Right should do the
same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; M-v and ^V go up
and down one screenful at a time; Page Up and Page Down
should do the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; ^A and ^E go to
the beginning and end of the line; Home and End should do
the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Press M-&lt; and M-&gt; go to
the beginning and end of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Press ^X g to go to a particular
byte position in the file; you will be asked to type in the
position you want. You can enter it in decimal, or as a hex
number with &lsquo;0x&rsquo; before <br>
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Editing keys <br>
Press Return to move the cursor between the hex section of
the screen and the ASCII section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When in the hex section, you can
enter hexadecimal digits to alter data; when in the ASCII
section, you can directly type ASCII text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In ASCII mode, you can also
press ^Q to literally quote the next input character; for
example, if you want to insert a Control-V, you can press
^Q^V and tweak will automatically <br>
insert the byte value 0x16.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Press ^X^I, or the Insert key if
you have one, to toggle between overwrite mode and insert
mode. In insert mode, typing hex or ASCII input will insert
new bytes containing the <br>
values you provide. Also, you can then press Backspace to
delete the byte to the left of the cursor, or ^D or Delete
to delete the byte under the cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cut and paste <br>
Press ^@ (this character may be generated by the key
combination Control-@, or Control-2, or Control-Space) to
mark the end of a selection region. After you do this, the
bytes <br>
between that mark and the cursor will be highlighted. Press
^@ again to abandon the selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Press M-w while a selection is
active to copy the selected region into tweak&rsquo;s cut
buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In insert mode, you also have
the option of pressing ^W to cut the selected region
completely out of the file and place it in the cut
buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, press ^Y to paste the
cut buffer contents back into the file (this will overwrite
or insert depending on the current mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Searching <br>
Press ^S to search for a byte sequence. You will be asked to
enter some text to search for on the bottom line of the
screen. You can type this text in ASCII, or as a sequence of
<br>
hex byte values prefixed with backslashes (. For example, if
you wanted to search for the byte value 5 followed by the
word &lsquo;hello&rsquo;, you might enter 5hello. If you
want to <br>
specify a literal backslash character, you can either enter
it in hex (as 5C), or simply double it on input (\).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Press ^R to search backwards
instead of forwards from the current cursor position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since tweak deals in pure binary
data, searches are always case-sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controlling the display <br>
If you press ^X w, you will be asked to enter a new display
width. This has the same effect as passing the -w option on
the command line. Similarly, pressing ^X o allows you to
<br>
enter a new display offset, equivalent to the -o option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the current file
position and file size are displayed on tweak&rsquo;s status
line in hex. If you prefer them in decimal, you can press ^X
x or ^X h to toggle them between <br>
hex and decimal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous <br>
Press ^L to redraw the screen and recentre the cursor. Press
^Z to suspend tweak and return temporarily to the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Press ^X^S to save the file you
are editing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Press ^X^C to exit tweak. (If
you do this with changes unsaved, you will be asked whether
you want to save them.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
tweak&rsquo;s keyboard bindings are configurable. It will
attempt to read a file from your home directory called
.tweakrc, and if it finds one it will use the keyboard
bindings <br>
described in it. If it does not find one, it will use its
internal default bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of the directives in
.tweakrc are of the form &lsquo;bind command-name
key&rsquo;. For example, &lsquo;bind exit ^X^C&rsquo;.
Additionally, there are two other directives, width and
offset, which <br>
give the default display parameters if no -w and -o options
are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The easiest way to learn about
the .tweakrc file is to begin by having tweak output its
internal default one:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tweak -D &gt; $HOME/.tweakrc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then you can read the default
file, learn the tweak internal command names, and edit the
file to do what you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
This man page probably ought to contain an explicit list of
internal command names, rather than simply referring you to
the default .tweakrc.</p>
