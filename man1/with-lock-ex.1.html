<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
with-lock-ex - file locker</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
with-lock-ex -w|-q|-f lockfile command args ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
with-lock-ex will open and lock the lockfile for writing and
then feed the remainder of its arguments to exec(2); when
that process terminates the fd will be closed and the file
<br>
unlocked automatically by the kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file does not exist it is
created, with permissions rw for each user class for which
the umask has w.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-w Wait for the lock to be available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Fail (printing a message to
stderr and exiting 255) if the lock cannot be acquired
immediately because another process has it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Silently do nothing (ie, exit
0 instead of executing the specified process) if the lock
cannot be acquired immediately because another process has
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STALE LOCKS <br>
The locking protocol used does not suffer from stale locks.
If the lock cannot be acquired, one or more running
processes must currently hold the lock; if the lock needs to
be <br>
freed those processes should be killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under no circumstances should
&lsquo;stale lock cleaner&rsquo; cron jobs, or the like, be
instituted. In systems where a great many locks may exist,
old lockfiles may be removed from cron <br>
but only if each lock is acquired before the lockfile is
removed, for example with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">with-lock-ex -q lockfile rm
lockfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEADLOCKS <br>
There is no deadlock detection. In a system with several
locks, a lock hierarchy should be established, such that for
every pair of locks A and B which a process might lock <br>
simultaneously, either A&gt;B or B&gt;A where the relation
&gt; is transitive and noncyclic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then, for any two locks X and Y
with X&gt;Y it is forbidden to acquire X while holding Y.
Instead, acquire X first, or release Y before (re)acquiring
X and Y in that order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(There are more complicated ways
of avoiding deadlocks, but a lock hierarchy is simple to
understand and implement. If it does not meet your needs,
consult the literature.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOCKING PROTOCOL <br>
The locking protocol used by with-lock-ex is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The lock is held by a process
(or group of processes) which holds an fcntl exclusive lock
on the first byte of the plain file which has the specified
name. A holder of the lock <br>
(and only a holder of the lock) may delete the file or
change the inode to which the name refers, and as soon as it
does so it ceases to hold the lock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any process may create the file
if it does not exist. There is no need for the file to
contain any actual data. Indeed, actually using the file for
data storage is strongly <br>
disrecommended, as this will foreclose most strategies for
reliable update. Use a separate lockfile instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ability to obtain the lock
corresponds to write permission on the file (and of course
permission to create the file, if it does not already
exist). However, processes with only <br>
read permission on the file can prevent the lock being
acquired at all; therefore lockfiles should not usually be
world-readable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a (group of) processes
wishes to acquire the lock, it should open the file (with
O_CREAT) and lock it with fcntl(2) F_RWLCK, operation
F_SETLK or F_SETLKW. If this succeeds <br>
it should fstat the file descriptor it has, and the file by
its path. If the device and inode match then the lock has
been acquired and remains acquired until that group of
pro&acirc; <br>
cesses changes which file the name refers to, deletes the
file, or releases the fcntl lock. If they do not then
another process acquired the lock and deleted the file in
the <br>
meantime; you must now close your filedescriptor and start
again. with-lock-ex follows this specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that flock(2) is a
different kind of lock to fcntl(2). with-lock-ex uses
fcntl.</p>
