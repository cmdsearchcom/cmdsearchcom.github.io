with-lock-ex will open and lock the lockfile for writing and then feed the
  remainder of its arguments to <b>exec</b>(2); when that process terminates the
  fd will be closed and the file unlocked automatically by the kernel.

If the file does not exist it is created, with permissions <b>rw</b> for each
  user class for which the umask has <b>w</b>.

The locking protocol used does not suffer from stale locks. If the lock cannot
  be acquired, one or more running processes must currently hold the lock; if
  the lock needs to be freed those processes should be killed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Under no circumstances should `stale lock cleaner' cron jobs, or the like, be
  instituted. In systems where a great many locks may exist, old lockfiles may
  be removed from cron but only if each lock is acquired before the lockfile is
  removed, for example with
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>with-lock-ex -q</b> <i>lockfile</i> <b>rm</b>
      <i>lockfile</i></dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DEADLOCKS"><a class="selflink" href="#DEADLOCKS">DEADLOCKS</a></h1>
There is no deadlock detection. In a system with several locks, a lock hierarchy
  should be established, such that for every pair of locks <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>
  which a process might lock simultaneously, either <i>A</i>&gt;<i>B</i> or
  <i>B</i>&gt;<i>A</i> where the relation &gt; is transitive and noncyclic.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then, for any two locks <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> with <i>X</i>&gt;<i>Y</i> it is
  forbidden to acquire <i>X</i> while holding <i>Y</i>. Instead, acquire
  <i>X</i> first, or release <i>Y</i> before (re)acquiring <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>
  in that order.
<div class="Pp"></div>
(There are more complicated ways of avoiding deadlocks, but a lock hierarchy is
  simple to understand and implement. If it does not meet your needs, consult
  the literature.)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LOCKING_PROTOCOL"><a class="selflink" href="#LOCKING_PROTOCOL">LOCKING
  PROTOCOL</a></h1>
The locking protocol used by <b>with-lock-ex</b> is as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
The lock is held by a process (or group of processes) which holds an fcntl
  exclusive lock on the first byte of the plain file which has the specified
  name. A holder of the lock (and only a holder of the lock) may delete the file
  or change the inode to which the name refers, and as soon as it does so it
  ceases to hold the lock.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any process may create the file if it does not exist. There is no need for the
  file to contain any actual data. Indeed, actually using the file for data
  storage is strongly disrecommended, as this will foreclose most strategies for
  reliable update. Use a separate lockfile instead.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Ability to obtain the lock corresponds to write permission on the file (and of
  course permission to create the file, if it does not already exist). However,
  processes with only read permission on the file can prevent the lock being
  acquired at all; therefore lockfiles should not usually be world-readable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a (group of) processes wishes to acquire the lock, it should open the file
  (with <b>O_CREAT</b>) and lock it with <b>fcntl</b>(2) <b>F_RWLCK</b>,
  operation <b>F_SETLK</b> or <b>F_SETLKW</b>. If this succeeds it should fstat
  the file descriptor it has, and the file by its path. If the device and inode
  match then the lock has been acquired and remains acquired until that group of
  processes changes which file the name refers to, deletes the file, or releases
  the fcntl lock. If they do not then another process acquired the lock and
  deleted the file in the meantime; you must now close your filedescriptor and
  start again. <b>with-lock-ex</b> follows this specification.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that <b>flock</b>(2) is a different kind of lock to <b>fcntl</b>(2).
  <b>with-lock-ex</b> uses <b>fcntl</b>.
