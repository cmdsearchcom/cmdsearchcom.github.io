<p>GIT-CVSSERVER(1) Git Manual GIT-CVSSERVER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-cvsserver - A CVS server emulator for Git</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
SSH:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export CVS_SERVER=&quot;git
cvsserver&quot; <br>
cvs -d :ext:user@server/path/repo.git co
&lt;HEAD_name&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pserver (/etc/inetd.conf):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvspserver stream tcp nowait
nobody /usr/bin/git-cvsserver git-cvsserver pserver</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usage:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git-cvsserver [options]
[pserver|server] [&lt;directory&gt; ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
All these options obviously only make sense if enforced by
the server side. They have been implemented to resemble the
git-daemon(1) options as closely as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--base-path &lt;path&gt; <br>
Prepend path to requested CVSROOT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--strict-paths <br>
Don&acirc;t allow recursing into subdirectories</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--export-all <br>
Don&acirc;t check for gitcvs.enabled in config. You also
have to specify a list of allowed directories (see below) if
you want to use this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print version information and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, -H, --help <br>
Print usage information and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;directory&gt; <br>
You can specify a list of allowed directories. If no
directories are given, all are allowed. This is an
additional restriction, gitcvs access still needs to be
enabled by the <br>
gitcvs.enabled config option unless --export-all was given,
too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This application is a CVS emulation layer for Git.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is highly functional.
However, not all methods are implemented, and for those
methods that are implemented, not all switches are
implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Testing has been done using both
the CLI CVS client, and the Eclipse CVS plugin. Most
functionality works fine with both of these clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
CVS clients cannot tag, branch or perform Git merges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git-cvsserver maps Git branches
to CVS modules. This is very different from what most CVS
users would expect since in CVS modules usually represent
one or more directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
1. If you are going to offer CVS access via pserver, add a
line in /etc/inetd.conf like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvspserver stream tcp nowait
nobody git-cvsserver pserver</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Some inetd servers let you
specify the name of the executable independently of the
value of argv[0] (i.e. the name the program assumes it was
executed with). In this <br>
case the correct line in /etc/inetd.conf looks like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvspserver stream tcp nowait
nobody /usr/bin/git-cvsserver git-cvsserver pserver</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only anonymous access is
provided by pserve by default. To commit you will have to
create pserver accounts, simply add a gitcvs.authdb setting
in the config file of the <br>
repositories you want the cvsserver to allow writes to, for
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[gitcvs] <br>
authdb = /etc/cvsserver/passwd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of these files is
username followed by the crypted password, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">myuser:$1Oyx5r9mdGZ2 <br>
myuser:$1$BA)@$vbnMJMDym7tA32AamXrm./</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the htpasswd
facility that comes with Apache to make these files, but
Apache&acirc;s MD5 crypt method differs from the one used by
most C library&acirc;s crypt() function, so <br>
don&acirc;t use the -m option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively you can produce
the password with perl&acirc;s crypt() operator:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -e &rsquo;my ($user, $pass)
= @ARGV; printf &quot;%s:%s0, $user, crypt($user,
$pass)&rsquo; $USER password</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then provide your password via
the pserver method, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvs
-d:pserver:someuser:somepassword &lt;at&gt;
server/path/repo.git co &lt;HEAD_name&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No special setup is needed for
SSH access, other than having Git tools in the PATH. If you
have clients that do not accept the CVS_SERVER environment
variable, you can rename <br>
git-cvsserver to cvs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Newer CVS versions (&gt;=
1.12.11) also support specifying CVS_SERVER directly in
CVSROOT like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvs -d &quot;:ext;CVS_SERVER=git
cvsserver:user@server/path/repo.git&quot; co
&lt;HEAD_name&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This has the advantage that it
will be saved in your CVS/Root files and you don&acirc;t
need to worry about always setting the correct environment
variable. SSH users restricted to <br>
git-shell don&acirc;t need to override the default with
CVS_SERVER (and shouldn&acirc;t) as git-shell understands
cvs to mean git-cvsserver and pretends that the other end
runs the real <br>
cvs better.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. For each repo that you want
accessible from CVS you need to edit config in the repo and
add the following section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[gitcvs] <br>
enabled=1 <br>
# optional for debugging <br>
logfile=/path/to/logfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: you need to ensure each
user that is going to invoke git-cvsserver has write access
to the log file and to the database (see Database Backend.
If you want to offer <br>
write access over SSH, the users of course also need write
access to the Git repository itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You also need to ensure that
each repository is &quot;bare&quot; (without a Git index
file) for cvs commit to work. See gitcvs-migration(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All configuration variables can
also be overridden for a specific method of access. Valid
method names are &quot;ext&quot; (for SSH access) and
&quot;pserver&quot;. The following example <br>
configuration would disable pserver access while still
allowing access over SSH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[gitcvs] <br>
enabled=0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[gitcvs &quot;ext&quot;] <br>
enabled=1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If you didn&acirc;t specify
the CVSROOT/CVS_SERVER directly in the checkout command,
automatically saving it in your CVS/Root files, then you
need to set them explicitly in your <br>
environment. CVSROOT should be set as per normal, but the
directory should point at the appropriate Git repo. As
above, for SSH clients not restricted to git-shell, <br>
CVS_SERVER should be set to git-cvsserver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export
CVSROOT=:ext:user@server:/var/git/project.git <br>
export CVS_SERVER=&quot;git cvsserver&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. For SSH clients that will
make commits, make sure their server-side .ssh/environment
files (or .bashrc, etc., according to their specific shell)
export appropriate values for <br>
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL, GIT_COMMITTER_NAME, and
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL. For SSH clients whose login shell is
bash, .bashrc may be a reasonable alternative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Clients should now be able to
check out the project. Use the CVS module name to indicate
what Git head you want to check out. This also sets the name
of your newly <br>
checked-out directory, unless you tell it otherwise with -d
&lt;dir_name&gt;. For example, this checks out master branch
to the project-master directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvs co -d project-master
master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DATABASE BACKEND <br>
git-cvsserver uses one database per Git head (i.e. CVS
module) to store information about the repository to
maintain consistent CVS revision numbers. The database needs
to be <br>
updated (i.e. written to) after every commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the commit is done directly
by using git (as opposed to using git-cvsserver) the update
will need to happen on the next repository access by
git-cvsserver, independent of <br>
access method and requested operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That means that even if you
offer only read access (e.g. by using the pserver method),
git-cvsserver should have write access to the database to
work reliably (otherwise you need <br>
to make sure that the database is up-to-date any time
git-cvsserver is executed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default it uses SQLite
databases in the Git directory, named
gitcvs.&lt;module_name&gt;.sqlite. Note that the SQLite
backend creates temporary files in the same directory as the
<br>
database file on write so it might not be enough to grant
the users using git-cvsserver write access to the database
file without granting them write access to the directory,
<br>
too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The database can not be reliably
regenerated in a consistent form after the branch it is
tracking has changed. Example: For merged branches,
git-cvsserver only tracks one branch <br>
of development, and after a git merge an incrementally
updated database may track a different branch than a
database regenerated from scratch, causing inconsistent CVS
revision <br>
numbers. git-cvsserver has no way of knowing which branch it
would have picked if it had been run incrementally
pre-merge. So if you have to fully or partially (from old
backup) <br>
regenerate the database, you should be suspicious of
pre-existing CVS sandboxes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can configure the database
backend with the following configuration variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuring database backend
<br>
git-cvsserver uses the Perl DBI module. Please also read its
documentation if changing these variables, especially about
DBI-&gt;connect().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitcvs.dbname <br>
Database name. The exact meaning depends on the selected
database driver, for SQLite this is a filename. Supports
variable substitution (see below). May not contain <br>
semicolons (;). Default: %Ggitcvs.%m.sqlite</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitcvs.dbdriver <br>
Used DBI driver. You can specify any available driver for
this here, but it might not work. cvsserver is tested with
DBD::SQLite, reported to work with DBD::Pg, and reported
<br>
not to work with DBD::mysql. Please regard this as an
experimental feature. May not contain colons (:). Default:
SQLite</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitcvs.dbuser <br>
Database user. Only useful if setting dbdriver, since SQLite
has no concept of database users. Supports variable
substitution (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitcvs.dbpass <br>
Database password. Only useful if setting dbdriver, since
SQLite has no concept of database passwords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitcvs.dbTableNamePrefix <br>
Database table name prefix. Supports variable substitution
(see below). Any non-alphabetic characters will be replaced
with underscores.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All variables can also be set
per access method, see above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable substitution <br>
In dbdriver and dbuser you can use the following
variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%G <br>
Git directory name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%g <br>
Git directory name, where all characters except for
alpha-numeric ones, ., and - are replaced with _ (this
should make it easier to use the directory name in a
filename <br>
if wanted)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%m <br>
CVS module/Git head name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%a <br>
access method (one of &quot;ext&quot; or
&quot;pserver&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%u <br>
Name of the user running git-cvsserver. If no name can be
determined, the numeric uid is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
These variables obviate the need for command-line options in
some circumstances, allowing easier restricted usage through
git-shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GIT_CVSSERVER_BASE_PATH takes
the place of the argument to --base-path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GIT_CVSSERVER_ROOT specifies a
single-directory whitelist. The repository must still be
configured to allow access through git-cvsserver, as
described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When these environment variables
are set, the corresponding command-line arguments may not be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ECLIPSE CVS CLIENT NOTES <br>
To get a checkout with the Eclipse CVS client:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Select &quot;Create a new
project &acirc; From CVS checkout&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Create a new location. See
the notes below for details on how to choose the right
protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Browse the modules available.
It will give you a list of the heads in the repository. You
will not be able to browse the tree from there. Only the
heads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Pick HEAD when it asks what
branch/tag to check out. Untick the &quot;launch commit
wizard&quot; to avoid committing the .project file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Protocol notes: If you are using
anonymous access via pserver, just select that. Those using
SSH access should choose the ext protocol, and configure ext
access on the <br>
Preferences&acirc;Team&acirc;CVS&acirc;ExtConnection pane.
Set CVS_SERVER to &quot;git cvsserver&quot;. Note that
password support is not good when using ext, you will
definitely want to have SSH keys <br>
setup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, you can just use
the non-standard extssh protocol that Eclipse offer. In that
case CVS_SERVER is ignored, and you will have to replace the
cvs utility on the <br>
server with git-cvsserver or manipulate your .bashrc so that
calling cvs effectively calls git-cvsserver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLIENTS KNOWN TO WORK <br>
&Acirc;&middot; CVS 1.12.9 on Debian</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; CVS 1.11.17 on
MacOSX (from Fink package)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Eclipse 3.0,
3.1.2 on MacOSX (see Eclipse CVS Client Notes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; TortoiseCVS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATIONS SUPPORTED <br>
All the operations required for normal use are supported,
including checkout, diff, status, update, log, add, remove,
commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most CVS command arguments that
read CVS tags or revision numbers (typically -r) work, and
also support any git refspec (tag, branch, commit ID, etc).
However, CVS revision <br>
numbers for non-default branches are not well emulated, and
cvs log does not show tags or branches at all.
(Non-main-branch CVS revision numbers superficially resemble
CVS <br>
revision numbers, but they actually encode a git commit ID
directly, rather than represent the number of revisions
since the branch point.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that there are two ways to
checkout a particular branch. As described elsewhere on this
page, the &quot;module&quot; parameter of cvs checkout is
interpreted as a branch name, and it <br>
becomes the main branch. It remains the main branch for a
given sandbox even if you temporarily make another branch
sticky with cvs update -r. Alternatively, the -r argument
can <br>
indicate some other branch to actually checkout, even though
the module is still the &quot;main&quot; branch. Tradeoffs
(as currently implemented): Each new &quot;module&quot;
creates a new database <br>
on disk with a history for the given module, and after the
database is created, operations against that main branch are
fast. Or alternatively, -r doesn&acirc;t take any extra disk
<br>
space, but may be significantly slower for many operations,
like cvs update.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to refer to a git
refspec that has characters that are not allowed by CVS, you
have two options. First, it may just work to supply the git
refspec directly to the <br>
appropriate CVS -r argument; some CVS clients don&acirc;t
seem to do much sanity checking of the argument. Second, if
that fails, you can use a special character escape mechanism
that <br>
only uses characters that are valid in CVS tags. A sequence
of 4 or 5 characters of the form (underscore
(&quot;_&quot;), dash (&quot;-&quot;), one or two
characters, and dash (&quot;-&quot;)) can encode <br>
various characters based on the one or two letters:
&quot;s&quot; for slash (&quot;/&quot;), &quot;p&quot; for
period (&quot;.&quot;), &quot;u&quot; for underscore
(&quot;_&quot;), or two hexadecimal digits for any byte
value at all <br>
(typically an ASCII number, or perhaps a part of a UTF-8
encoded character).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Legacy monitoring operations are
not supported (edit, watch and related). Exports and tagging
(tags and branches) are not supported at this stage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CRLF Line Ending Conversions
<br>
By default the server leaves the -k mode blank for all
files, which causes the CVS client to treat them as a text
files, subject to end-of-line conversion on some
platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can make the server use the
end-of-line conversion attributes to set the -k modes for
files by setting the gitcvs.usecrlfattr config variable. See
gitattributes(5) for more <br>
information about end-of-line conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, if
gitcvs.usecrlfattr config is not enabled or the attributes
do not allow automatic detection for a filename, then the
server uses the gitcvs.allbinary config for <br>
the default setting. If gitcvs.allbinary is set, then file
not otherwise specified will default to -kb mode. Otherwise
the -k mode is left blank. But if gitcvs.allbinary is set
<br>
to &quot;guess&quot;, then the correct -k mode will be
guessed based on the contents of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For best consistency with cvs,
it is probably best to override the defaults by setting
gitcvs.usecrlfattr to true, and gitcvs.allbinary to
&quot;guess&quot;.</p>
