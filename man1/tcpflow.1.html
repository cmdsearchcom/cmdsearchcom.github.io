<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tcpflow - TCP flow recorder</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tcpflow [-aBcCDhpsvVZ] [-b max_bytes] [-d debug_level]
[-[eE] scanner] [-f max_fds] [-F[ctTXMkmg]] [-i iface] [-L
semlock] [-m min_bytes] [-o outdir] [-r file1.pcap] <br>
[-R file0.pcap] [-Sname=value] [-T[filename template]]
[-wfile] [-x scanner] [-X file.xml] [expression]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part
of TCP connections (flows), and stores the data in a way
that is convenient for protocol analysis or debugging. <br>
Rather than showing packet-by-packet information, tcpflow
reconstructs the actual data streams and stores each flow in
a separate file for later analysis. tcpflow understands <br>
TCP sequence numbers and will correctly reconstruct data
streams regardless of retransmissions or out-of-order
delivery. tcpflow provides control over filenames for
automatic <br>
binning of connections by protocol, IP adress or connection
number, and has a sophisticated plug-in system for
decompressing compressed HTTP connections, undoing MIME
encoding, <br>
or calling user-provided programs for post-processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default tcpflow stores all
captured data in files that have names of the form:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">192.168.101.102.02345-010.011.012.013.45103</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">...where the contents of the
above file would be data transmitted from host
192.168.101.102 port 2345, to host 10.11.12.13 port
45103.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to simply process a
few hundred thousand packets and see what you have, try
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcpflow -a -o outdir -Fk -r
packets.pcap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will cause tcpflow to
perform (-a) all processing, store the output in a directory
called outdir, bin the output in directories of 1000
connections each, and read its input <br>
from the file packets.pcap. More sophisticiated processing
is possible, of course.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a Enable all processing. Same as -e all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Force binary output even when
printing to console with -C or -c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b max_bytes <br>
Specifies the maximum size of a captured flow. Any bytes
beyond max_bytes from the first byte captured will be
discarded. The default is to store an unlimited number of
<br>
bytes per flow. Note: previous versions of tcpflow could
only store a maximum of 4GiB per flow, but version 1.4 and
above can really store an unlimited amount of bytes. <br>
Good thing that modern disks are so big, eh?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Console print. Print the
contents of packets to stdout as they are received, without
storing any captured data to files (implies</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Console print without the
packet source and destination details being printed. Print
the contents of packets to stdout as they are received,
without storing any captured <br>
data to files (implies -e When outputting to the console
each flow will be output in different colors (blue for
client to server flows, red for server to client flows, <br>
green for undecided flows). -s ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Console output should be in
hex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Debug level. Set the level of
debugging messages printed to stderr to debug_level. Higher
numbers produce more messages. -d 0 causes completely silent
operation. -d 1 <br>
, the default, produces minimal status messages. -d 10
produces verbose output equivalent to -v . Numbers higher
than 10 can produce a large amount of debugging
informa&acirc; <br>
tion useful only to developers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E name <br>
Disable all scanners and then enable scanner name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e name <br>
Enable scanner name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e all Enables all scanners.
Same as -a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e http <br>
Perform HTTP post-processing (&quot;After&quot; processing).
If the output file is</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">208.111.153.175.00080-192.168.001.064.37314,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then the post-processing will
create the files:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">208.111.153.175.00080-192.168.001.064.37314-HTTP
<br>
208.111.153.175.00080-192.168.001.064.37314-HTTPBODY</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the HTTPBODY was compressed
with GZIP, you may get a third file as well: <br>

208.111.153.175.00080-192.168.001.064.37314-HTTPBODY-GZIP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional information about
these streams, such as their MD5 hash value, is also written
to the DFXML file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F[format] <br>
Specifies format for output filenames. Format specifiers: c
appends the connection counter to ALL filenames. t prepends
each filename with a Unix timestamp. T prepends <br>
each filename with an ISO-8601 timestamp. X Do not output
any files (other than the report.xml report files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-FM Include MD5 of each flow in
the DFXML output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-FX Suppresses file output
entirely (DFXML file is still produced).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Fk bin output in 1K
directories</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Fm bin output in 1M directories
(2 levels)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Fg bin output in 1G directories
(3 levels) -T[format] Specifies an arbitrary template for
filenames. %A expands to source IP address. %a expands to
source IP port. %B <br>
expands to destination IP address. %a expands to destination
IP port. %T expands to timestamp in ISO8601 format. %t
expands to timestamp in Unix time_t format. %V <br>
expands to &quot;--&quot; if a VLAN is present. %v expands
to the VLAN number if a VLAN is present. %C expands to
&quot;c&quot; if the connection count&gt;0. %c expands to
the connection <br>
count if the connection count&gt;0. %# always expands to the
connection count. %% prints a &quot;%&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmax_fds <br>
Max file descriptors used. Limit the number of file
descriptors used by tcpflow to max_fds. Higher numbers use
more system resources, but usually perform better. If the
<br>
underlying operating system supports the setrlimit() system
call, the OS will be asked to enforce the requested limit.
The default is for tcpflow to use the maximum num&acirc;
<br>
ber of file descriptors allowed by the OS. The -v option
will report how many file descriptors tcpflow is using.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Help. Print usage information
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hh More help. Print more usage
information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i iface <br>
Interface name. Capture packets from the network interface
named iface. If no interface is specified with -i , a
reasonable default will be used by libpcap automati&acirc;
<br>
cally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L semlock_name <br>
Specifies that semlock_name should be used as a Unix
semaphore to prevent two different copies of tcpflow running
in two different processes but outputing to the same <br>
standard output from printing on top of each other. This is
an application of Unix named semaphores; bet you have never
seen one before.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Treat the following arguments
as filenames with an assumed -r command before each one.
This allows you to read a lot of files at once with shell
globbing. For example, to <br>
process all of the pcap files in the current directory, use
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcpflow -o out -a -l *.pcap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J Output flow information to
console in multiple colors. NOTE: This option was changed
from tcpflow 1.3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m min_size <br>
Forces a new connection output file when there is a skip in
the TCP session of min_size bytes or more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o outdir <br>
Specifies the output directory where the transcript files
will be written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P No purge. Normally tcpflow
removes connections from the hash table after the connection
is closed with a FIN. This conserves memory but takes
additional CPU time. Select&acirc; <br>
ing this option causes the std::tr1:unordered_map to grow
without bounds, as tcpflow did prior to version 1.1. That
makes tcpflow run faster if there are less than 10
mil&acirc; <br>
lion connections, but can lead to out-of-memory errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p No promiscuous mode.
Normally, tcpflow attempts to put the network interface into
promiscuous mode before capturing packets. The -p option
tells tcpflow not to put the <br>
interface into promiscuous mode. Note that it might already
be in promiscuous mode for some other reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet mode --- don&rsquo;t
print warnings. Currently the only warning that tcpflow
prints is a warning when more than 10,000 files are created
that the user should have provided <br>
the -Fk, -Fm, or -Fg options. We might have other warnings
in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Read from file. Read packets
from file, which was created using the -w option of
tcpdump(1). This option may be repeated any number of times.
Standard input is used if <br>
file is &quot;-&quot;. Note that for this option to be
useful, tcpdump&rsquo;s -s option should be used to set the
snaplen to the MTU of the interface (e.g., 1500) while
capturing pack&acirc; <br>
ets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Read from a file, but only to
complete TCP flows. This option is used when tcpflow is used
to process a series of files that are captured over time.
For each time period <br>
n, file filen.pcap should be processed with R -r filen.pcap,
while file(n-1).pcap should be processed with R -R
file(n-1).pcap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sname=value <br>
Sets a name parameter to be equal to value for a plug-in.
Use -hh to find out all of the settable parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Strip non-printables. Convert
all non-printable characters to the &quot;.&quot; character
before printing packets to the console or storing them to a
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print the version number and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose operation. Verbosely
describe tcpflow&rsquo;s operation. Equivalent to -d 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w filename.pcap <br>
Write packets that were not processed to filename.pcap.
Typically this will be UDP packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X filename.xml <br>
Write a DFXML report file to filename.xml. The file contains
a record of every tcp connection, how the tcpflow program
was compiled, and the computer on which tcpflow was <br>
run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z Don&rsquo;t decompress
gzip-compressed streams.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To record all packets arriving at or departing from sundown
and extract all of the HTTP attachments: <br>
tcpflow -e scan_http -o outdir host sundown</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To record traffic between helios
and either hot or ace and bin the results into 1000 files
per directory and calculate the MD5 of each flow: <br>
tcpflow -X report.xml -e scan_md5 -o outdir -Fk host helios
and hot or ace</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Please send bug reports to simsong@acm.org.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcpflow currently does not
understand IP fragments. Flows containing IP fragments will
not be recorded correctly.</p>
