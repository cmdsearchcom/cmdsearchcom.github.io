ucf - Update Configuration File: preserve user changes in configuration files
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>ucf</b> [<i>options</i>] <i>&lt;New File&gt;</i> <i>&lt;Destination&gt;</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ucf</b> [<i>options</i>] <i>--purge</i> <i>&lt;Destination&gt;</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This utility provides a means of asking the user whether or not to accept new
  versions of configuration files provided by the package maintainer, with
  various heuristics designed to minimize interaction time. It uses debconf to
  interact with the user, as per Debian policy. In the SYNOPSIS above, <i>New
  file</i> is the configuration file as provided by the package (either shipped
  with the package, or generated by the maintainer scripts on the fly), and
  <i>Destination</i> is the location (usually under /etc) where the real
  configuration file lives, and is potentially modified by the end user. Since
  the files edited would be real files, and not symbolic links, <b>ucf</b>
  follows and resolves symbolic links before acting. As far as possible, ucf
  attempts to preserve the ownership and permission of the <i>New file</i> as it
  is copied to the new location.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This script attempts to provide conffile like handling for files installed under
  <i>/etc</i> not shipped in a <b>Debian</b> package, but handled by the
  postinst instead. <b>Debian</b> policy states that files under <i>/etc</i>
  which are configuration files <b>must</b> preserve user changes, and this
  applies to files handled by maintainer scripts as well. Using <b>ucf,</b> one
  may ship a bunch of default configuration files somewhere in <i>/usr</i> (
  <i>/usr/share/&lt;pkg&gt;</i> is a good location), and maintain files in
  <i>/etc,</i> preserving user changes and in general offering the same
  facilities while upgrading that <b>dpkg</b> normally provides for
  <i>&#x201C;conffiles&#x201D;</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a file that had
  not been provided <i>conffile</i> like protection to come under this schema,
  and attempts to minimize questions asked at install time. Indeed, the
  transitioning facility is better than the one offered by <b>dpkg</b> while
  transitioning a file from a <i>non-conffile</i> to <i>conffile</i> status. The
  second form in the SYNOPSIS above is for purging information about the
  configuration file when the package is purged; and is critical for allowing
  smooth reinstallations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
During the course of operations, when working with configuration files,
  <b>ucf</b> optionally creates copies of versions of the configuration file in
  question. For example, a file with the suffix <i>ucf-old</i> holds the old
  version of a configuration file replaced by <b>ucf.</b> Also, copies of the
  configuration file with the suffixes <i>ucf-new</i> and <i>ucf-dist</i> may be
  created; and the maintainer scripts should consider purging copies of the
  configuration file with these extensions during purge.

      the new file matches that in the hashfile. In short, remember to use this
      option in the postrm for every configuration file managed by ucf when the
      package is being purged (assuming ucf itself exists). <i>Note:</i> ucf

      have these changes merged in. This allows one to get new upstream changes
      merged in even while retaining local modifications to the configuration
      file. This is accomplished by taking the configuration file and stashing
      it in a cache area during registration, and using diff3 during the install
      (the stashed file name is a munged version of the full path of the
      configuration file to avoid name space clashes). <i>Note</i> This option

      disable/cripple debconf before running ucf (since ucf did not prompt with

      from a maintainer script that uses debconf. This option lets it know that
      the maintainer script has not told debconf to stop, or redirected its
      stdio from debconf, or anything of the sort -- and thus it is safe to use
      debconf even when the script discovers that debconf is running. Packages

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#USAGE">USAGE</a></h1>
The most common case usage is pretty simple: a single line invocation in the
  postinst on configure, and another single line in the postrm to tell
  <b>ucf</b> to forget about the configuration file on purge (using the --purge
  option) is all that is needed (assuming ucf is still on the system).
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is recommended that you also register any file being managed by <b>ucf</b>
  with the ucf registry; this associates the configuration file with the package
  it belongs to. This is done with a simple call to <b>ucfr.</b> Users may then
  query the association between a configuration file and the package using the
  tool <b>ucfq.</b> Please see the appropriate manual pages for details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a file maintained by maintainer scripts is being transitioned from an
  unprotected status to the protection afforded by the script, the maintainer
  can help ease the transition by reducing the questions that may be asked at
  installation time. Specifically, questions should not be asked if the file in
  question is an unmodified version that was one shipped in a previous version
  of this package; and the maintainer can help by telling the script about the
  historical md5sums that published versions of this file contained.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The way to do this is to either create a file called <b>&lt;New
  file&gt;.md5sum,</b> with one md5sum on each line, (the file names you use are
  ignored, except for the entry named default), or create a directory, called
  <b>&lt;New file&gt;.md5sum.d,</b> which should contain any number of files,
  each containing a single line, namely, the md5sum of a previous version of
  <b>&lt;New file&gt;.</b> The names of these files are not important, with one
  exception: The file called default is treated specially. For example, the
  author personally uses either package version numbers or release code names,
  like <i>7.6.3,</i> or <i>potato.</i> If none of the historical md5sums match,
  we are almost certain that either the historical record of md5sums is not
  complete, or the user has changed the configuration file.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_default_historical_md5sum"><a class="selflink" href="#The_default_historical_md5sum">The
  default historical md5sum</a></h2>
The exception to the rule about names mentioned earlier is that if no md5sums
  match, and if the file <b>&lt;New file&gt;.md5sum.d/default</b> exists, or if
  there is a line corresponding to a <i>default</i> file in <b>&lt;New
  file&gt;.md5sum,</b> it shall be used as the default md5sum of the
  <i>previous</i> version of the package assumed to have been installed on this
  machine. As you can see, unless there are limited number of previously
  released packages (like just one), the maintainer is also making an informed
  guess, but the option is provided to the maintainer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the file <b>&lt;New file&gt;.md5sum,</b> or the directory <b>&lt;New
  file&gt;.md5sum.d</b> does not exist, or none of the md5sums match, we test
  the installed <i>&lt;Destination&gt;</i> file to see whether it is the same as
  the <i>&lt;New file&gt;.</i> If not, we ask the user whether they want us to
  replace the file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An additional facility is also offered: optionally, ucf can store one old
  version of the maintainers copy of the configuration file, and, on upgrade,
  calculate the changes made in the maintainers version of the configuration
  file, and apply that patch to the local version of the file (on user request,
  of course). There is also a preview facility where the user can inspect the
  results of such a merge, before asking the action to be taken.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES">ENVIRONMENT
  VARIABLES</a></h1>
The variable <b>UCF_FORCE_CONFFNEW,</b> if set, forces the new file to always
  overwrite the installed destination file, while the variable
  <b>UCF_FORCE_CONFFOLD,</b> if set silently retains the installed file.
  <b>UCF_FORCE_CONFFMISS</b> is only applicable when the installed destination
  file does not exist (perhaps due to user removal),and forces ucf to recreate
  the missing file (the default behaviour is to honor the users wishes and not
  recreate the locally deleted file).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></h1>
This script creates the file <i>new_file.md5sum,</i> and it may copy the file
  (presumably shipped with the package) <i>&lt;New file&gt;</i> to its
  destination, <i>&lt;Destination&gt;.</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>/var/lib/ucf/hashfile,</i> and <i>/var/lib/ucf/hashfile.X,</i> where <i>X</i>
  is a small integer, where previous versions of the hashfile are stored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>/etc/ucf.conf</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
If the package <i>foo</i> wants to use ucf to handle user interaction for
  configuration file <i>foo.conf,</i> a version of which is provided in the
  package as <i>/usr/share/foo/configuration,</i> a simple invocation of ucf in
  the post inst file is all that is needed:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ucf</b> <i>/usr/share/foo/configuration</i> <i>/etc/foo.conf</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
On purge, one should tell ucf to forget about the file (see detailed examples in
  /usr/share/doc/ucf/examples):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ucf</b> <i>--purge</i> <i>/etc/foo.conf</i> Please note that purge can also
  be used to make ucf forget the previous state of the files, and when the
  package is next installed or updated, ucf will ask the user to replace the
  current cofiguration file. Do this if you want to change your decision to not
  update to a maintainer provided version of the configuration file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The motivation for this script was to provide conffile like handling for start
  files for emacs lisp packages (for example,
  <i>/etc/emacs21/site-start.d/50psgml-init.el</i> ) These start files are not
  shipped with the package, instead, they are installed during the post
  installation configuration phase by the script
  <i>/usr/lib/emacsen-common/emacs-package-install $package_name.</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This script is meant to be invoked by the packages install script at
  <i>/usr/lib/emacsen-common/packages/install/$package_name</i> for each flavour
  of installed emacsen by calling it with the proper values of new file (
  <i>/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/&lt;pkg&gt;/&lt;pkg-init.el</i> ), and dest file
  ( <i>/etc/emacs21/site-start.d/50&lt;pkg-init.el</i> ), and it should do the
  rest.
