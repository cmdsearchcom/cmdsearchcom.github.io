<b class="Nm" title="Nm">Ping</b> uses the ICMP protocol's mandatory
  ECHO_REQUEST datagram to elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway.
  ECHO_REQUEST datagrams (``pings'') have an IP and ICMP header, followed by a
  &#x201C;struct timeval&#x201D; and then an arbitrary number of ``pad'' bytes
  used to fill out the packet. The options are as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><a class="selflink" href="#c"><b class="Fl" title="Fl" id="c">-c</b></a>
    <var class="Ar" title="Ar">count</var></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Stop after sending (and receiving)

  <dd class="It-tag">Set the <code class="Dv" title="Dv">SO_DEBUG</code> option
      on the socket being used.</dd>
  <dt class="It-tag"><a class="selflink" href="#f"><b class="Fl" title="Fl" id="f">-f</b></a></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Flood ping. Outputs packets as fast as they come back or
      one hundred times per second, whichever is more. For every ECHO_REQUEST
      sent a period ``.'' is printed, while for every ECHO_REPLY received a
      backspace is printed. This provides a rapid display of how many packets
      are being dropped. Only the super-user may use this option.

<div class="Pp"></div>
When using <b class="Nm" title="Nm">ping</b> for fault isolation, it should
  first be run on the local host, to verify that the local network interface is
  up and running. Then, hosts and gateways further and further away should be
  ``pinged''. Round-trip times and packet loss statistics are computed. If
  duplicate packets are received, they are not included in the packet loss
  calculation, although the round trip time of these packets is used in
  calculating the minimum/average/maximum round-trip time numbers. When the
  specified number of packets have been sent (and received) or if the program is
  terminated with a <code class="Dv" title="Dv">SIGINT</code>, a brief summary
  is displayed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement and management.
  Because of the load it can impose on the network, it is unwise to use
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">ping</b> during normal operations or from automated
  scripts.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ICMP_PACKET_DETAILS"><a class="selflink" href="#ICMP_PACKET_DETAILS">ICMP
  PACKET DETAILS</a></h1>
An IP header without options is 20 bytes. An ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packet contains
  an additional 8 bytes worth of ICMP header followed by an arbitrary amount of
  data. When a <var class="Ar" title="Ar">packetsize</var> is given, this
  indicated the size of this extra piece of data (the default is 56). Thus the
  amount of data received inside of an IP packet of type ICMP ECHO_REPLY will
  always be 8 bytes more than the requested data space (the ICMP header).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the data space is at least eight bytes large,
  <b class="Nm" title="Nm">ping</b> uses the first eight bytes of this space to
  include a timestamp which it uses in the computation of round trip times. If
  less than eight bytes of pad are specified, no round trip times are given.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DUPLICATE_AND_DAMAGED_PACKETS"><a class="selflink" href="#DUPLICATE_AND_DAMAGED_PACKETS">DUPLICATE
  AND DAMAGED PACKETS</a></h1>
<b class="Nm" title="Nm">Ping</b> will report duplicate and damaged packets.
  Duplicate packets should never occur, and seem to be caused by inappropriate
  link-level retransmissions. Duplicates may occur in many situations and are
  rarely (if ever) a good sign, although the presence of low levels of
  duplicates may not always be cause for alarm.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Damaged packets are obviously serious cause for alarm and often indicate broken
  hardware somewhere in the <b class="Nm" title="Nm">ping</b> packet's path (in
  the network or in the hosts).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TRYING_DIFFERENT_DATA_PATTERNS"><a class="selflink" href="#TRYING_DIFFERENT_DATA_PATTERNS">TRYING
  DIFFERENT DATA PATTERNS</a></h1>
The (inter)network layer should never treat packets differently depending on the
  data contained in the data portion. Unfortunately, data-dependent problems
  have been known to sneak into networks and remain undetected for long periods
  of time. In many cases the particular pattern that will have problems is
  something that doesn't have sufficient ``transitions'', such as all ones or
  all zeros, or a pattern right at the edge, such as almost all zeros. It isn't
  necessarily enough to specify a data pattern of all zeros (for example) on the
  command line because the pattern that is of interest is at the data link
  level, and the relationship between what you type and what the controllers
  transmit can be complicated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This means that if you have a data-dependent problem you will probably have to
  do a lot of testing to find it. If you are lucky, you may manage to find a
  file that either can't be sent across your network or that takes much longer
  to transfer than other similar length files. You can then examine this file
  for repeated patterns that you can test using the
  <b class="Fl" title="Fl">-p</b> option of <b class="Nm" title="Nm">ping</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TTL_DETAILS"><a class="selflink" href="#TTL_DETAILS">TTL
  DETAILS</a></h1>
The TTL value of an IP packet represents the maximum number of IP routers that
  the packet can go through before being thrown away. In current practice you
  can expect each router in the Internet to decrement the TTL field by exactly
  one.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The TCP/IP specification states that the TTL field for TCP packets should be set
  to 60, but many systems use smaller values (4.3 BSD uses 30, 4.2 used 15).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The maximum possible value of this field is 255, and most Unix systems set the
  TTL field of ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to 255. This is why you will find you
  can ``ping'' some hosts, but not reach them with
  <a class="Xr" title="Xr">telnet(1)</a> or <a class="Xr" title="Xr">ftp(1)</a>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In normal operation ping prints the ttl value from the packet it receives. When
  a remote system receives a ping packet, it can do one of three things with the
  TTL field in its response:
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li class="It-bullet">Not change it; this is what Berkeley Unix systems did
      before the <span class="Ux">4.3BSD-Tahoe</span> release. In this case the
      TTL value in the received packet will be 255 minus the number of routers
      in the round-trip path.</li>
  <li class="It-bullet">Set it to 255; this is what current Berkeley Unix
      systems do. In this case the TTL value in the received packet will be 255
      minus the number of routers in the path <a class="Xr" title="Xr">from</a>
      the remote system <i class="Em" title="Em">to</i> the
      <b class="Nm" title="Nm">ping</b><i class="Em" title="Em">ing</i>
    host.</li>
  <li class="It-bullet">Set it to some other value. Some machines use the same
      value for ICMP packets that they use for TCP packets, for example either
      30 or 60. Others may use completely wild values.</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Many Hosts and Gateways ignore the RECORD_ROUTE option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The maximum IP header length is too small for options like RECORD_ROUTE to be
  completely useful. There's not much that that can be done about this, however.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Flood pinging is not recommended in general, and flood pinging the broadcast
  address should only be done under very controlled conditions.
