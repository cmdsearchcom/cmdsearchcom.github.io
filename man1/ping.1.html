<p>PING(1) BSD General Commands Manual PING(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ping &acirc; send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network
hosts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ping [-Rdfnqrv] [-c count] [-i wait] [-l preload] [-p
pattern] [-s packetsize] host</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ping uses the ICMP protocol&rsquo;s mandatory ECHO_REQUEST
datagram to elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or
gateway. ECHO_REQUEST datagrams
(&lsquo;&lsquo;pings&rsquo;&rsquo;) have an IP and ICMP <br>
header, followed by a &acirc;struct timeval&acirc; and then
an arbitrary number of &lsquo;&lsquo;pad&rsquo;&rsquo; bytes
used to fill out the packet. The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c count <br>
Stop after sending (and receiving) count ECHO_RESPONSE
packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Set the SO_DEBUG option on
the socket being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Flood ping. Outputs packets
as fast as they come back or one hundred times per second,
whichever is more. For every ECHO_REQUEST sent a period
&lsquo;&lsquo;.&rsquo;&rsquo; is printed, while for <br>
every ECHO_REPLY received a backspace is printed. This
provides a rapid display of how many packets are being
dropped. Only the super-user may use this option. This can
<br>
be very hard on a network and should be used with
caution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i wait <br>
Wait wait seconds between sending each packet. The default
is to wait for one second between each packet. This option
is incompatible with the -f option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l preload <br>
If preload is specified, ping sends that many packets as
fast as possible before falling into its normal mode of
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Numeric output only. No
attempt will be made to lookup symbolic names for host
addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pattern <br>
You may specify up to 16 &lsquo;&lsquo;pad&rsquo;&rsquo;
bytes to fill out the packet you send. This is useful for
diagnosing data-dependent problems in a network. For
example, &acirc;-p ff&acirc; will <br>
cause the sent packet to be filled with all ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet output. Nothing is
displayed except the summary lines at startup time and when
finished.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Record route. Includes the
RECORD_ROUTE option in the ECHO_REQUEST packet and displays
the route buffer on returned packets. Note that the IP
header is only large enough <br>
for nine such routes. Many hosts ignore or discard this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Bypass the normal routing
tables and send directly to a host on an attached network.
If the host is not on a directly-attached network, an error
is returned. This option <br>
can be used to ping a local host through an interface that
has no route through it (e.g., after the interface was
dropped by routed(8)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s packetsize <br>
Specifies the number of data bytes to be sent. The default
is 56, which translates into 64 ICMP data bytes when
combined with the 8 bytes of ICMP header data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose output. ICMP packets
other than ECHO_RESPONSE that are received are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using ping for fault
isolation, it should first be run on the local host, to
verify that the local network interface is up and running.
Then, hosts and gateways further and <br>
further away should be &lsquo;&lsquo;pinged&rsquo;&rsquo;.
Round-trip times and packet loss statistics are computed. If
duplicate packets are received, they are not included in the
packet loss calcula&acirc; <br>
tion, although the round trip time of these packets is used
in calculating the minimum/average/maximum round-trip time
numbers. When the specified number of packets have been sent
<br>
(and received) or if the program is terminated with a
SIGINT, a brief summary is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program is intended for use
in network testing, measurement and management. Because of
the load it can impose on the network, it is unwise to use
ping during normal opera&acirc; <br>
tions or from automated scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ICMP PACKET DETAILS <br>
An IP header without options is 20 bytes. An ICMP
ECHO_REQUEST packet contains an additional 8 bytes worth of
ICMP header followed by an arbitrary amount of data. When a
<br>
packetsize is given, this indicated the size of this extra
piece of data (the default is 56). Thus the amount of data
received inside of an IP packet of type ICMP ECHO_REPLY will
<br>
always be 8 bytes more than the requested data space (the
ICMP header).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the data space is at least
eight bytes large, ping uses the first eight bytes of this
space to include a timestamp which it uses in the
computation of round trip times. If less <br>
than eight bytes of pad are specified, no round trip times
are given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DUPLICATE AND DAMAGED PACKETS
<br>
Ping will report duplicate and damaged packets. Duplicate
packets should never occur, and seem to be caused by
inappropriate link-level retransmissions. Duplicates may
occur in <br>
many situations and are rarely (if ever) a good sign,
although the presence of low levels of duplicates may not
always be cause for alarm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Damaged packets are obviously
serious cause for alarm and often indicate broken hardware
somewhere in the ping packet&rsquo;s path (in the network or
in the hosts).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRYING DIFFERENT DATA PATTERNS
<br>
The (inter)network layer should never treat packets
differently depending on the data contained in the data
portion. Unfortunately, data-dependent problems have been
known to <br>
sneak into networks and remain undetected for long periods
of time. In many cases the particular pattern that will have
problems is something that doesn&rsquo;t have sufficient
&lsquo;&lsquo;tran&acirc; <br>
sitions&rsquo;&rsquo;, such as all ones or all zeros, or a
pattern right at the edge, such as almost all zeros. It
isn&rsquo;t necessarily enough to specify a data pattern of
all zeros (for exam&acirc; <br>
ple) on the command line because the pattern that is of
interest is at the data link level, and the relationship
between what you type and what the controllers transmit can
be com&acirc; <br>
plicated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that if you have a
data-dependent problem you will probably have to do a lot of
testing to find it. If you are lucky, you may manage to find
a file that either can&rsquo;t be <br>
sent across your network or that takes much longer to
transfer than other similar length files. You can then
examine this file for repeated patterns that you can test
using the -p <br>
option of ping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TTL DETAILS <br>
The TTL value of an IP packet represents the maximum number
of IP routers that the packet can go through before being
thrown away. In current practice you can expect each router
<br>
in the Internet to decrement the TTL field by exactly
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The TCP/IP specification states
that the TTL field for TCP packets should be set to 60, but
many systems use smaller values (4.3 BSD uses 30, 4.2 used
15).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The maximum possible value of
this field is 255, and most Unix systems set the TTL field
of ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to 255. This is why you will
find you can &lsquo;&lsquo;ping&rsquo;&rsquo; some <br>
hosts, but not reach them with telnet(1) or ftp(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In normal operation ping prints
the ttl value from the packet it receives. When a remote
system receives a ping packet, it can do one of three things
with the TTL field in its <br>
response:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Not change it;
this is what Berkeley Unix systems did before the
4.3BSD-Tahoe release. In this case the TTL value in the
received packet will be 255 minus the number of <br>
routers in the round-trip path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Set it to 255;
this is what current Berkeley Unix systems do. In this case
the TTL value in the received packet will be 255 minus the
number of routers in the path from the <br>
remote system to the pinging host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Set it to some
other value. Some machines use the same value for ICMP
packets that they use for TCP packets, for example either 30
or 60. Others may use completely wild val&acirc; <br>
ues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Many Hosts and Gateways ignore the RECORD_ROUTE option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The maximum IP header length is
too small for options like RECORD_ROUTE to be completely
useful. There&rsquo;s not much that that can be done about
this, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flood pinging is not recommended
in general, and flood pinging the broadcast address should
only be done under very controlled conditions.</p>
