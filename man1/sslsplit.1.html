<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sslsplit -- transparent SSL/TLS interception</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>

[...] <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
SSLsplit is a tool for man-in-the-middle attacks against
SSL/TLS encrypted network connections. It is intended to be
useful for network forensics, application security analysis
<br>
and penetration testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSLsplit is designed to
transparently terminate connections that are redirected to
it using a network address translation engine. SSLsplit then
terminates SSL/TLS and initiates <br>
a new SSL/TLS connection to the original destination
address, while logging all data transmitted. Besides NAT
based operation, SSLsplit also supports static destinations
and <br>
using the server name indicated by SNI as upstream
destination. SSLsplit is purely a transparent proxy and
cannot act as a HTTP or SOCKS proxy configured in a browser.
See NAT <br>
ENGINES and PROXY SPECIFICATIONS below for specifics on the
different modes of operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSLsplit supports plain TCP,
plain SSL, HTTP and HTTPS connections over both IPv4 and
IPv6. SSLsplit fully supports Server Name Indication (SNI)
and is able to work with RSA, <br>
DSA and ECDSA keys and DHE and ECDHE cipher suites.
Depending on the version of OpenSSL, SSLsplit supports SSL
3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2, and optionally SSL 2.0 as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For SSL and HTTPS connections,
SSLsplit generates and signs forged X509v3 certificates
on-the-fly, mimicking the original server
certificate&rsquo;s subject DN, subjectAltName exten&acirc;
<br>
sion and other characteristics. SSLsplit has the ability to
use existing certificates of which the private key is
available, instead of generating forged ones. SSLsplit
sup&acirc; <br>
ports NULL-prefix CN certificates but otherwise does not
implement exploits against specific certificate verification
vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS stacks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSLsplit implements a number of
defences against mechanisms which would normally prevent
MitM attacks or make them more difficult. SSLsplit can deny
OCSP requests in a generic <br>
way. For HTTP and HTTPS connections, SSLsplit removes
response headers for HPKP in order to prevent public key
pinning, for HSTS to allow the user to accept untrusted
certifi&acirc; <br>
cates, and Alternate Protocols to prevent switching to
QUIC/SPDY. HTTP compression, encodings and keep-alive are
disabled to make the logs more readable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an experimental feature,
SSLsplit supports STARTTLS and similar mechanisms, where a
protocol starts on a plain text TCP connection and is later
upgraded to SSL/TLS through <br>
protocol-specific means, such as the STARTTLS command in
SMTP. SSLsplit supports generic upgrading of TCP connections
to SSL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSLsplit does not automagically
redirect any network traffic. To actually implement an
attack, you also need to redirect the traffic to the system
running sslsplit. Your <br>
options include running sslsplit on a legitimate router, ARP
spoofing, ND spoofing, DNS poisoning, deploying a rogue
access point (e.g. using hostap mode), physical recabling,
<br>
malicious VLAN reconfiguration or route injection,
/etc/hosts modification and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c pemfile <br>
Use CA certificate from pemfile to sign certificates forged
on-the-fly. If pemfile also contains the matching CA private
key, it is also loaded, otherwise it must be pro&acirc; <br>
vided with -k. If pemfile also contains Diffie-Hellman group
parameters, they are also loaded, otherwise they can be
provided with -g. If -t is also given, SSLsplit will <br>
only forge a certificate if there is no matching certificate
in the provided certificate directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C pemfile <br>
Use CA certificates from pemfile as extra certificates in
the certificate chain. This is needed if the CA given with
-k and -c is a sub-CA, in which case any intermediate <br>
CA certificates and the root CA certificate must be included
in the certificate chain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Detach from TTY and run as a
daemon, logging error messages to syslog instead of standard
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Run in debug mode, log lots
of debugging information to standard error. This also forces
foreground mode and cannot be used with -d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e engine <br>
Use engine as the default NAT engine for proxyspecs without
explicit NAT engine, static destination address or SNI mode.
engine can be any of the NAT engines supported by <br>
the system, as returned by -E.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E List all supported NAT
engines available on the system and exit. See NAT ENGINES
for a list of NAT engines currently supported by
SSLsplit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F logspec <br>
Log connection content to separate log files with the given
path specification (see LOG SPECIFICATIONS below). For each
connection, a log file will be written, which will <br>
contain both directions of data as transmitted. Information
about the connection will be contained in the filename
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g pemfile <br>
Use Diffie-Hellman group parameters from pemfile for
Ephemereal Diffie-Hellman (EDH/DHE) cipher suites. If -g is
not given, SSLsplit first tries to load DH parameters <br>
from the PEM files given by -K, -k or -c. If no DH
parameters are found in the key files, built-in group
parameters are automatically used. The -g option is only
avail&acirc; <br>
able if SSLsplit was built against a version of OpenSSL
which supports Diffie-Hellman cipher suites.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G curve <br>
Use the named curve for Ephemereal Elliptic Curve
Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) cipher suites. If -G is not given, a
default curve (prime256v1) is used automatically. The -G
<br>
option is only available if SSLsplit was built against a
version of OpenSSL which supports Elliptic Curve
Diffie-Hellman cipher suites.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display help on usage and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i For each connection, find the
local process owning the connection. This makes process
information such as pid, owner:group and executable path for
connections originating <br>
on the same system as SSLsplit available to the connect log
and enables the respective -F path specification directives.
-i is available on Mac OS X and FreeBSD; support <br>
for other platforms has not been implemented yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j jaildir <br>
Change the root directory to jaildir using chroot(2) after
opening files. Note that this has implications for sni
proxyspecs. Depending on your operating system, you <br>
will need to copy files such as /etc/resolv.conf to jaildir
in order for name resolution to work. Using sni proxyspecs
depends on name resolution. Some operating systems <br>
require special device nodes such as /dev/null to be present
within the jail. Check your system&rsquo;s documentation for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k pemfile <br>
Use CA private key from pemfile to sign certificates forged
on-the-fly. If pemfile also contains the matching CA
certificate, it is also loaded, otherwise it must be
pro&acirc; <br>
vided with -c. If pemfile also contains Diffie-Hellman group
parameters, they are also loaded, otherwise they can be
provided with -g. If -t is also given, SSLsplit will <br>
only forge a certificate if there is no matching certificate
in the provided certificate directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K pemfile <br>
Use private key from pemfile for the leaf certificates
forged on-the-fly. If -K is not given, SSLsplit will
generate a random 1024-bit RSA key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l logfile <br>
Log connections to logfile in a single line per connection
format, including addresses and ports and some HTTP and SSL
information, if available. SIGUSR1 will cause log&acirc;
<br>
file to be re-opened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L logfile <br>
Log connection content to logfile. The content log will
contain a parsable log format with transmitted data,
prepended with headers identifying the connection and the
<br>
data length of each logged segment. SIGUSR1 will cause
logfile to be re-opened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m When dropping privileges
using -u, override the target primary group to be set to
group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O Deny all Online Certificate
Status Protocol (OCSP) requests on all proxyspecs and for
all OCSP servers with an OCSP response of tryLater, causing
OCSP clients to temporar&acirc; <br>
ily accept even revoked certificates. HTTP requests are
being treated as OCSP requests if the method is GET and the
URI contains a syntactically valid OCSPRequest ASN.1 <br>
structure parsable by OpenSSL, or if the method is POST and
the Content-Type is application/ocsp-request. For this to be
effective, SSLsplit must be handling traffic des&acirc; <br>
tined to the port used by the OCSP server. In particular,
SSLsplit must be configured to receive traffic to all ports
used by OCSP servers of targetted certificates <br>
within the certdir specified by -t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pidfile <br>
Write the process ID to pidfile and refuse to run if the
pidfile is already in use by another process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Passthrough SSL/TLS
connections which cannot be split instead of dropping them.
Connections cannot be split if -c and -k are not given and
the site does not match any <br>
certificate loaded using -t, or if the connection to the
original server gives SSL/TLS errors. Specifically, this
happens if the site requests a client certificate. In <br>
these situations, passthrough with -P results in
uninterrupted service for the clients, while dropping is the
more secure alternative if unmonitored connections must be
<br>
prevented. Passthrough mode currently does not apply to
SSL/TLS errors in the connection from the client, since the
connection from the client cannot easily be retried. <br>
Specifically, -P does not currently work for clients that do
not accept forged certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r proto <br>
Force SSL/TLS protocol version on both client and server
side to proto by selecting the respective OpenSSL method
constructor instead of the default SSLv23_method() which
<br>
supports all protocol versions. This is useful when
analyzing traffic to a server that only supports a specific
version of SSL/TLS and does not implement proper protocol
<br>
negotiation. Depending on build options and the version of
OpenSSL that is used, the following values for proto are
accepted: ssl2, ssl3, tls10, tls11 and tls12. Note <br>
that SSL 2.0 support is not built in by default because some
servers don&rsquo;t handle SSL 2.0 Client Hello messages
gracefully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R proto <br>
Disable the SSL/TLS protocol version proto on both client
and server side by disabling the respective protocols in
OpenSSL. To disable multiple protocol versions, -R can <br>
be given multiple times. If -r is also given, there will be
no effect in disabling other protocol versions. Disabling
protocol versions is useful when analyzing traffic <br>
to a server that does not handle some protocol versions
well, or to test behaviour with different protocol versions.
Depending on build options and the version of OpenSSL <br>
that is used, the following values for proto are accepted:
ssl2, ssl3, tls10, tls11 and tls12. Note that SSL 2.0
support is not built in by default because some servers <br>
don&rsquo;t handle SSL 2.0 Client Hello messages
gracefully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s ciphers <br>
Use OpenSSL ciphers specification for both server and client
SSL/TLS connections. If -s is not given, a cipher list of
ALL:-aNULL is used. Normally, SSL/TLS implementa&acirc; <br>
tions choose the most secure cipher suites, not the fastest
ones. By specifying an appropriate OpenSSL cipher list, the
set of cipher suites can be limited to fast algo&acirc; <br>
rithms, or eNULL cipher suites can be added. Note that for
connections to be successful, the SSLsplit cipher suites
must include at least one cipher suite supported by <br>
both the client and the server of each connection. See
ciphers(1) for details on how to construct OpenSSL cipher
lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S logdir <br>
Log connection content to separate log files under logdir.
For each connection, a log file will be written, which will
contain both directions of data as transmitted. <br>
Information about the connection will be contained in the
filename only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t certdir <br>
Use private key, certificate and certificate chain from PEM
files in certdir for connections to hostnames matching the
respective certificates, instead of using certifi&acirc;
<br>
cates forged on-the-fly. A single PEM file must contain a
single private key, a single certificate and optionally
intermediate and root CA certificates to use as
certifi&acirc; <br>
cate chain. When using -t, SSLsplit will first attempt to
use a matching certificate loaded from certdir. If -c and -k
are also given, certificates will be forged on- <br>
the-fly for sites matching none of the common names in the
certificates loaded from certdir. Otherwise, connections
matching no certificate will be dropped, or if -P is <br>
given, passed through without splitting SSL/TLS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Drop privileges after opening
sockets and files by setting the real, effective and stored
user IDs to user and loading the appropriate primary and
ancillary groups. If -u <br>
is not given, SSLsplit will drop privileges to the stored
UID if EUID != UID (setuid bit scenario), or to nobody if
running with full root privileges (EUID == UID == 0). <br>
Due to an Apple bug, -u cannot be used with pf proxyspecs on
Mac OS X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Display version and compiled
features information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w gendir <br>
Write generated keys and certificates to individual files in
gendir. For keys, the key identifier is used as filename,
which consists of the SHA-1 hash of the ASN.1 bit <br>
string of the public key, as referenced by the
subjectKeyIdentifier extension in certificates. For
certificates, the SHA-1 fingerprints of the original and the
used <br>
(forged) certificate are combined to form the filename. Note
that only newly generated certificates are written to
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W gendir <br>
Same as -w, but also write original certificates and
certificates not newly generated, such as those loaded from
-t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z Disable SSL/TLS compression
on all connections. This is useful if your limiting factor
is CPU, not network bandwidth. The -Z option is only
available if SSLsplit was <br>
built against a version of OpenSSL which supports disabling
compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROXY SPECIFICATIONS <br>
Proxy specifications (proxyspecs) consist of the connection
type, listen address and static forward address or address
resolution mechanism (NAT engine, SNI DNS lookup):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">https listenaddr port
[nat-engine|fwdaddr port|sni port] <br>
ssl listenaddr port [nat-engine|fwdaddr port|sni port] <br>
http listenaddr port [nat-engine|fwdaddr port] <br>
tcp listenaddr port [nat-engine|fwdaddr port] <br>
autossl listenaddr port [nat-engine|fwdaddr port]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">https SSL/TLS interception with
HTTP protocol decoding, including the removal of HPKP, HSTS
and Alternate Protocol response headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssl SSL/TLS interception without
any lower level protocol decoding; decrypted connection
content is treated as opaque stream of bytes and not
modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http Plain TCP connection
without SSL/TLS, with HTTP protocol decoding, including the
removal of HPKP, HSTS and Alternate Protocol response
headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp Plain TCP connection without
SSL/TLS and without any lower level protocol decoding;
decrypted connection content is treated as opaque stream of
bytes and not modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autossl <br>
Plain TCP connection until a Client Hello SSL/TLS message
appears in the byte stream, then automatic upgrade to
SSL/TLS interception. This is generic,
protocol-indepen&acirc; <br>
dent STARTTLS support, that may erroneously trigger on byte
sequences that look like Client Hello messages even though
there was no actual STARTTLS command issued. This <br>
is an experimental feature and may in its current state miss
some Client Hello messages depending on circumstances. YMMV.
Testing and patches highly welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">listenaddr port <br>
IPv4 or IPv6 address and port or service name to listen on.
This is the address and port where the NAT engine should
redirect connections to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nat-engine <br>
NAT engine to query for determining the original destination
address and port of transparently redirected connections. If
no engine is given, the default engine is used, <br>
unless overridden with -e. When using a NAT engine, sslsplit
needs to run on the same system as the NAT rules redirecting
the traffic to sslsplit. See NAT ENGINES for a <br>
list of supported NAT engines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fwdaddr port <br>
Static destination address, IPv4 or IPv6, with port or
service name. When this is used, connections are forwarded
to the given server address and port. If fwdaddr is a <br>
hostname, it will be resolved to an IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sni port <br>
Use the Server Name Indication (SNI) hostname sent by the
client in the Client Hello SSL/TLS message to determine the
IP address of the server to connect to. This only <br>
works for ssl and https proxyspecs and needs a port or
service name as an argument. Because this requires DNS
lookups, it is preferrable to use NAT engine lookups (see
<br>
above), except when that is not possible, such as when there
is no supported NAT engine or when running sslsplit on a
different system than the NAT rules redirecting the <br>
actual connections. Note that when using -j with sni, you
may need to prepare jaildir to make name resolution work
from within the chroot directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
A running sslsplit accepts SIGINT and SIGQUIT for a clean
shutdown and SIGUSR1 to re-open the long-living log files
(-l and -L). Per-connection log files (-S and -F) are not
re- <br>
opened because their filename is specific to the
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOG SPECIFICATIONS <br>
Log specifications are composed of zero or more printf-style
directives; ordinary characters are included directly in the
output path. SSLsplit current supports the following <br>
directives:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%T The initial connection time
as an ISO 8601 UTC timestamp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%d The destination host and
port, separated by a comma, IPv6 addresses using underscore
instead of colon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%D The destination host, IPv6
addresses using underscore instead of colon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%p The destination port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s The source host and port,
separated by a comma, IPv6 addresses using underscore
instead of colon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%S The source host, IPv6
addresses using underscore instead of colon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%q The source port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%x The name of the local
process. Requires -i to be used. If process information is
unavailable, this directive will be omitted from the output
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%X The full path of the local
process. Requires -i to be used. If process information is
unavailable, this directive will be omitted from the output
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%u The username or numeric uid
of the local process. Requires -i to be used. If process
information is unavailable, this directive will be omitted
from the output path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%g The group name or numeric gid
of the local process. Requires -i to be used. If process
information is unavailable, this directive will be omitted
from the output path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%% A literal &rsquo;%&rsquo;
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAT ENGINES <br>
SSLsplit currently supports the following NAT engines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pf OpenBSD packet filter (pf)
rdr/rdr-to NAT redirects, also available on FreeBSD, NetBSD
and Mac OS X. Fully supported, including IPv6. Note that
SSLsplit needs permission <br>
to open /dev/pf for reading, which by default means that it
needs to run under root privileges. Assuming inbound
interface em0, first in old (FreeBSD, Mac OS X), then in
<br>
new (OpenBSD 4.7+) syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rdr pass on em0 proto tcp from

443 rdr-to 127.0.0.1 port 10443</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipfw FreeBSD IP firewall (IPFW)
divert sockets, also available on Mac OS X. Available on
FreeBSD and OpenBSD using pf divert-to. Fully supported on
FreeBSD and OpenBSD, <br>
including IPv6. Only supports IPv4 on Mac OS X due to the
ancient version of IPFW included. First in IPFW, then in pf
divert-to syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipfw add fwd ::1,10080 tcp from

443 divert-to 127.0.0.1 port 10443</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipfilter <br>
IPFilter (ipfilter, ipf), available on many systems,
including FreeBSD, NetBSD, Linux and Solaris. Note that
SSLsplit needs permission to open /dev/ipnat for reading,
<br>
which by default means that it needs to run under root
privileges. Only supports IPv4 due to limitations in the
SIOCGNATL ioctl(2) interface. Assuming inbound interface
<br>
bge0:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rdr bge0 0.0.0.0/0 port 80 -&gt;
127.0.0.1 port 10080 <br>
rdr bge0 0.0.0.0/0 port 443 -&gt; 127.0.0.1 port 10443</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netfilter <br>
Linux netfilter using the iptables REDIRECT target. Only
supports IPv4 due to limitations in the SO_ORIGINAL_DST
getsockopt(2) interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -s

443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 10443</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that SSLsplit is only able
to accept incoming connections if it binds to the correct IP
address (e.g. 192.0.2.1) or on all interfaces (0.0.0.0).
REDIRECT uses the <br>
local interface address of the incoming interface as target
IP address, or 127.0.0.1 for locally generated packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tproxy Linux netfilter using the
iptables TPROXY target together with routing table magic to
allow non-local traffic to originate on local sockets. Fully

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Matching the above NAT engine configuration samples,
intercept HTTP and HTTPS over IPv4 and IPv6 using forged
certificates with CA private key ca.key and certificate
ca.crt, log&acirc; <br>
ging connections to connect.log and connection data into
separate files under /tmp (add -e nat-engine to select the
appropriate engine if multiple engines are available on your
<br>
system):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sslsplit -k ca.key -c ca.crt -l
connect.log -L /tmp https ::1 10443 https 127.0.0.1 10443
http ::1 10080 http 127.0.0.1 10080</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the Linux netfilter engine is
used with the iptables REDIRECT target, it is important to
listen to the correct IP address (e.g. 192.0.2.1) or on all
interfaces (0.0.0.0), oth&acirc; <br>
erwise SSLsplit is not able to accept incoming
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Intercepting IMAP/IMAPS using
the same settings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sslsplit -k ca.key -c ca.crt -l
connect.log -L /tmp ssl ::1 10993 ssl 127.0.0.1 10993 tcp
::1 10143 tcp 127.0.0.1 10143</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A more targetted setup, HTTPS
only, using certificate/chain/key files from /path/to/cert.d
and statically redirecting to www.example.org instead of
querying a NAT engine:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sslsplit -t /path/to/cert.d -l
connect.log -L /tmp https ::1 10443 www.example.org 443
https 127.0.0.1 10443 www.example.org 443</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The original example, but using
SSL options optimized for speed by disabling compression and
selecting only fast cipher cipher suites and using a
precomputed private key leaf.key <br>
for the forged certificates. Most significant speed increase
is gained by choosing fast algorithms and small keysizes for
the CA and leaf private keys. Check openssl speed for <br>
algorithm performance on your system. Note that clients may
not support all algorithms and key sizes. Also, some clients
warn their users about cipher suites they consider <br>
weak.</p>

http ::1 10080 http 127.0.0.1 10080</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The original example, but
running as a daemon under user sslsplit and writing a PID
file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sslsplit -d -p
/var/run/sslsplit.pid -u sslsplit -k ca.key -c ca.crt -l
connect.log -L /tmp https ::1 10443 https 127.0.0.1 10443
http ::1 10080 http 127.0.0.1 10080</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
SSLsplit is able to handle a relatively high number of
listeners and connections due to a multithreaded, event
based architecture based on libevent, taking advantage of
platform <br>
specific select() replacements such as kqueue. The main
thread handles the listeners and signalling, while a number
of worker threads equal to twice the number of CPU cores is
<br>
used for handling the actual connections in separate event
bases, including the CPU-intensive SSL/TLS handling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Care has been taken to choose
well-performing data structures for caching certificates and
SSL sessions. Logging is implemented in separate disk writer
threads to ensure that <br>
socket event handling threads don&rsquo;t have to block on
disk I/O. DNS lookups are performed asynchroniously.
SSLsplit uses SSL session caching on both ends to minimize
the amount <br>
of full SSL handshakes, but even then, the limiting factor
in handling SSL connections are the actual bignum
computations.</p>
