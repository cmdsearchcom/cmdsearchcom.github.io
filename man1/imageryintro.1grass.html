<p style="margin-top: 1em">Image processing in GRASS GIS
<br>
Image processing in general <br>
Digital numbers and physical values
(reflection/radiance-at-sensor):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Satellite imagery is commonly
stored in Digital Numbers (DN) for minimizing the storage
volume, i.e. the originally sampled analog physical value
(color, temperature, etc) is <br>
stored a discrete representation in 8-16 bits. For example,
Landsat data are stored in 8bit values (i.e., ranging from 0
to 255); other satellite data may be stored in 10 or 16 <br>
bits. Having data stored in DN, it implies that these data
are not yet the observed ground reality. Such data are
called &quot;at-satellite&quot;, for example the amount of
energy sensed <br>
by the sensor of the satellite platform is encoded in 8 or
more bits. This energy is called radiance-at-sensor. To
obtain physical values from DNs, satellite image providers
use <br>
a linear transform equation (y = a * x + b) to encode the
radiance-at-sensor in 8 to 16 bits. DNs can be turned back
into physical values by applying the reverse formula (x = (y
<br>
- b) / a).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GRASS GIS module
i.landsat.toar easily transforms Landsat DN to
radiance-at-sensor (top of atmosphere, TOA). The equivalent
module for ASTER data is i.aster.toar. For other <br>
satellites, r.mapcalc can be employed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reflection/radiance-at-sensor
and surface reflectance</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When radiance-at-sensor has been
obtained, still the atmosphere influences the signal as
recorded at the sensor. This atmospheric interaction with
the sun energy reflected back <br>
into space by ground/vegetation/soil needs to be corrected.
The need of removing atmospheric artifacts stems from the
fact that the atmosphericic conditions are changing over
<br>
time. Hence, to gain comparability between Earth surface
images taken at different times, atmospheric need to be
removed converting at-sensor values which are top of
atmosphere <br>
to surface reflectance values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In GRASS GIS, there are two ways
to apply atmospheric correction for satellite imagery. A
simple, less accurate way for Landsat is with
i.landsat.toar, using the DOS correction <br>
method. The more accurate way is using i.atcorr (which
supports many satellite sensors). The atmospherically
corrected sensor data represent surface reflectance, which
ranges <br>
theoretically from 0% to 100%. Note that this level of data
correction is the proper level of correction to calculate
vegetation indices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In GRASS GIS, image data are
identical to raster data. However, a couple of commands are
explicitly dedicated to image processing. The geographic
boundaries of the <br>
raster/imagery file are described by the north, south, east,
and west fields. These values describe the lines which bound
the map at its edges. These lines do NOT pass through <br>
the center of the grid cells at the edge of the map, but
along the edge of the map itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a general rule in GRASS:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Raster/imagery output maps
have their bounds and resolution equal to those of the
current region.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Raster/imagery input maps are
automatically cropped/padded and rescaled (using
nearest-neighbor resampling) to match the current
region.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Imagery import <br>
The module r.in.gdal offers a common interface for many
different raster and satellite image formats. Additionally,
it also offers options such as on-the-fly location creation
or <br>
extension of the default region to match the extent of the
imported raster map. For special cases, other import modules
are available. Always the full map is imported. Imagery <br>
data can be group (e.g. channel-wise) with i.group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For importing scanned maps, the
user will need to create a x,y-location, scan the map in the
desired resolution and save it into an appropriate raster
format (e.g. tiff, jpeg, <br>
png, pbm) and then use r.in.gdal to import it. Based on
reference points the scanned map can be rectified to obtain
geocoded data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Image processing operations <br>
GRASS raster/imagery map processing is always performed in
the current region settings (see g.region), i.e. the current
region extent and current raster resolution is used. If <br>
the resolution differs from that of the input raster map(s),
on-the-fly resampling is performed (nearest neighbor
resampling). If this is not desired, the input map(s)
has/have <br>
to be resampled beforehand with one of the dedicated
modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Geocoding of imagery data <br>
GRASS is able to geocode raster and image data of various
types:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; unreferenced
scanned maps by defining four corner points (i.group,
i.target, g.gui.gcp, i.rectify)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; unreferenced
satellite data from optical and Radar sensors by defining a
certain number of ground control points (i.group, i.target,
g.gui.gcp, i.rectify)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; interactive
graphical Ground Control Point (GCP) manager</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Visualizing (true) color
composites <br>
To quickly combine the first three channels to a near
natural color image, the GRASS command d.rgb can be used or
the graphical GIS manager (wxGUI). It assigns each channel
to a <br>
color which is then mixed while displayed. With a bit more
work of tuning the grey scales of the channels, nearly
perfect colors can be achieved. Channel histograms can be
shown <br>
with d.histogram.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Calculation of vegetation
indices <br>
An example for indices derived from multispectral data is
the NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index). To study
the vegetation status with NDVI, the Red and the Near <br>
Infrared channels (NIR) are taken as used as input for
simple map algebra in the GRASS command r.mapcalc (ndvi =
1.0 * (nir - red)/(nir + red)). With r.colors an optimized
&quot;ndvi&quot; <br>
color table can be assigned afterward. Also other vegetation
indices can be generated likewise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Calibration of thermal channel
<br>
The encoded digital numbers of a thermal infrared channel
can be transformed to degree Celsius (or other temperature
units) which represent the temperature of the observed land
<br>
surface. This requires a few algebraic steps with r.mapcalc
which are outlined in the literature to apply gain and bias
values from the image metadata.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Image classification <br>
Single and multispectral data can be classified to user
defined land use/land cover classes. In case of a single
channel, segmentation will be used. GRASS supports the
following <br>
methods:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Radiometric
classification:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Unsupervised
classification (i.cluster, i.maxlik) using the Maximum
Likelihood classification method</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Supervised
classification (i.gensig or g.gui.iclass, i.maxlik) using
the Maximum Likelihood classification method</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Combined
radiometric/geometric (segmentation based)
classification:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Supervised
classification (i.gensigset, i.smap)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Object-oriented
classification:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Unsupervised
classification (segmentation based: i.segment) <br>
Kappa statistic can be calculated to validate the results
(r.kappa). Covariance/correlation matrices can be calculated
with r.covar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Image fusion <br>
In case of using multispectral data, improvements of the
resolution can be gained by merging the panchromatic channel
with color channels. GRASS provides the HIS (i.rgb.his, <br>
i.his.rgb) and the Brovey and PCA transform (i.pansharpen)
methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Radiometric corrections <br>
Atmospheric effects can be removed with i.atcorr. Correction
for topographic/terrain effects is offered in i.topo.corr.
Clouds in LANDSAT data can be identified and removed <br>
with i.landsat.acca. Calibrated digital numbers of LANDSAT
and ASTER imagery may be converted to top-of-atmosphere
radiance or reflectance and temperature (i.aster.toar,
i.land&acirc; <br>
sat.toar).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Time series processing <br>
GRASS also offers support for time series processing
(r.series). Statistics can be derived from a set of
coregistered input maps such as multitemporal satellite
data. The common <br>
univariate statistics and also linear regression can be
calculated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Evapotranspiration modeling <br>
In GRASS, several types of evapotranspiration (ET) modeling
methods are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Reference ET:
Hargreaves (i.evapo.mh), Penman-Monteith (i.evapo.pm);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Potential ET:
Priestley-Taylor (i.evapo.pt);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Actual ET:
i.evapo.time. <br>
Evaporative fraction: i.eb.evapfr, i.eb.hsebal01.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Energy balance <br>
Emissivity can be calculated with i.emissivity. Several
modules support the calculation of the energy balance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Actual
evapotranspiration for diurnal period (i.eb.eta);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Evaporative
fraction and root zone soil moisture (i.eb.evapfr);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Sensible heat
flux iteration (i.eb.hsebal01);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Net radiation
approximation (i.eb.netrad);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Soil heat flux
approximation (i.eb.soilheatflux).</p>
