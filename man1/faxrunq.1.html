<p>faxrunq(1) mgetty+sendfax manual faxrunq(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
faxrunq - send fax jobs queued by faxspool(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
faxrunq</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Run the fax queue set up by faxspool(1), try to send all
faxes, record result, remove job and send notify mails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">faxrunq looks for all the jobs
queued by faxspool(1) to /var/spool/fax/outgoing/*. For each
job in the queue, faxrunq tries to send it, using
sendfax(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the send succeeds, the job is
removed from the queue, and a &quot;success&quot; mail is
sent to the originator of the spooled job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the send fails, it&rsquo;s
logged, and faxrunq proceeds to the next job. If the job
fails five times &quot;fatally&quot;, that is, not with a
locked or engaged line, but with &quot;NO CARRIER&quot; (no
<br>
fax machine, or line noise), the job is suspended, and the
requestor gets a mail, telling him so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">faxrunq can be run from the
command line (but make sure the user doing this has write
access to the modem device and to the fax queue, that is,
usually this should be done by <br>
&quot;fax&quot; or &quot;root&quot;). In a production
environment, it&rsquo;s more useful to start faxrunq from
cron(8) in regular intervals, like &quot;run it every 5
minutes&quot;. See the cron(8) and/or <br>
crontab(1) man pages for this (which man page exists depends
on your system).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-q Tells faxrunq to be quiet, that is, suppress all status
messages. Error messages will still be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/spool/fax/outgoing/stop <br>
if this file exists, faxrunq (and faxrunqd) will do nothing.
You can use this to stop queue processing while testing
something, or if you know that the modem(s) are <br>
unavailable and do not want to run into oany error messages,
etc.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/spool/fax/outgoing/faxqueue_done
<br>
Every time faxrunq (or faxrunqd) run the fax queue, a time
stamp is written into that file. It is used by faxspool to
display a warning if the queue hasn&rsquo;t been run <br>
recently (so faxes may get stuck).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
Some aspects of the behaviour of faxrunq can be controlled
by a configuration file, /etc/mgetty+sendfax/faxrunq.config.
In this file, you can use the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">success-send-mail [y/n] <br>
A boolean parameter that controls whether a mail will be
sent after successful completition of the fax job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">failure-send-mail [y/n] <br>
A boolean parameter that controls whether a mail will be
sent after the fax job has failed more than the maximum
number of times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">success-call-program
&lt;name&gt; <br>
Here, you can specify a program that will be run when the
fax has been successfully sent. It will be passed two
command line parameters. The first is the full path to the
<br>
fax JOB file (see faxq(5)), the second is the last exit code
from sendfax (for success-call-program, this is always
&quot;0&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">failure-call-program
&lt;name&gt; <br>
Similar to the &quot;success-call-program&quot;, this
program will be run when the fax has been failed too often
and faxrunq gives up. This script could, for example, print
out the <br>
fax on a printer so that it can be sent manually on a paper
fax machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxfail-costly &lt;n&gt; <br>
This specifies the number of times that a fax may fail
&quot;fatally&quot;, that is, causing telephone costs
(explained above). The default value is 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxfail-total &lt;m&gt; <br>
This is the absolute maximum number of times that faxrunq
will try to send any given fax. The default value is 10.
(Right now, it&rsquo;s not yet implemented).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete-sent-jobs [y/n] <br>
Determines whether faxrunq should delete jobs after sending,
or leave them in the fax queue (while moving the
&quot;JOB&quot; file to &quot;JOB.done&quot;) so that they
can be seen at by <br>
&quot;faxq -o&quot;. The default value is &quot;do not
delete sent faxes&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">acct-log &lt;path&gt; <br>
Specifies where faxrunq should protocol success and failure
of each try to send a fax job. The default location is
/var/spool/fax/outgoing/acct.log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are some other options
that are allowed, but ignored. These are: max-modems, and
faxrunqd-log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">They are used by faxrunqd(8)
(which reads the same config file, but has more
options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
faxrunq doesn&rsquo;t handle proper time scheduling yet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t use faxrunq if you
have malevolent users with access to the fax spool. It
doesn&rsquo;t handle all cases of file movement tricks
correctly. Use faxrunqd(8) instead, which does <br>
it correctly (this point is mostly moot if the fax queue is
set up correctly - that is, owned by &rsquo;fax&rsquo;, mode
755, and faxrunq(1) is also run as user
&rsquo;fax&rsquo;).</p>
