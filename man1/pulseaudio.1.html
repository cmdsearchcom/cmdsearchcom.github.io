<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
PulseAudio is a networked low-latency sound server for
Linux, POSIX and Windows systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h | --help <br>
Show help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Show version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dump-conf <br>
Load the daemon configuration file daemon.conf (see below),
parse remaining configuration options on the command line
and dump the resulting daemon configuration, in a <br>
format that is compatible with daemon.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dump-modules <br>
List available loadable modules. Combine with -v for a more
elaborate listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dump-resample-methods <br>
List available audio resamplers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cleanup-shm <br>
Identify stale PulseAudio POSIX shared memory segments in
/dev/shm and remove them if possible. This is done
implicitly whenever a new daemon starts up or a client tries
<br>
to connect to a daemon. It should normally not be necessary
to issue this command by hand. Only available on systems
with POSIX shared memory segments implemented via a <br>
virtual file system mounted to /dev/shm (e.g. Linux).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--start <br>
Start PulseAudio if it is not running yet. This is different
from starting PulseAudio without --start which would fail if
PA is already running. PulseAudio is guaranteed <br>
to be fully initialized when this call returns. Implies
--daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k | --kill <br>
Kill an already running PulseAudio daemon of the calling
user (Equivalent to sending a SIGTERM).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check <br>
Return 0 as return code when the PulseAudio daemon is
already running for the calling user, or non-zero otherwise.
Produces no output on the console except for errors to <br>
stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--system[=BOOL] <br>
Run as system-wide instance instead of per-user. Please note
that this disables certain features of PulseAudio and is
generally not recommended unless the system knows no <br>
local users (e.g. is a thin client). This feature needs
special configuration and a dedicated UNIX user set up. It
is highly recommended to combine this with --disallow- <br>
module-loading (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D | --daemonize[=BOOL] <br>
Daemonize after startup, i.e. detach from the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fail[=BOOL] <br>
Fail startup when any of the commands specified in the
startup script default.pa (see below) fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--high-priority[=BOOL] <br>
Try to acquire a high Unix nice level. This will only
succeed if the calling user has a non-zero RLIMIT_NICE
resource limit set (on systems that support this), or
we&rsquo;re <br>
called SUID root (see below), or we are configure to be run
as system daemon (see --system above). It is recommended to
enable this, since it is only a negligible security <br>
risk (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--realtime[=BOOL] <br>
Try to acquire a real-time scheduling for PulseAudio&rsquo;s
I/O threads. This will only succeed if the calling user has
a non-zero RLIMIT_RTPRIO resource limit set (on systems <br>
that support this), or we&rsquo;re called SUID root (see
below), or we are configure to be run as system daemon (see
--system above). It is recommended to enable this only for
<br>
trusted users, since it is a major security risk (see
below).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disallow-module-loading[=BOOL]
<br>
Disallow module loading after startup. This is a security
feature since it disallows additional module loading during
runtime and on user request. It is highly recommended <br>
when --system is used (see above). Note however, that this
breaks certain features like automatic module loading on hot
plug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disallow-exit[=BOOL] <br>
Disallow user requested exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exit-idle-time=SECS <br>
Terminate the daemon when idle and the specified number of
seconds passed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--scache-idle-time=SECS <br>
Unload autoloaded samples from the cache when the
haven&rsquo;t been used for the specified number of
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-level[=LEVEL] <br>
If an argument is passed, set the log level to the specified
value, otherwise increase the configured verbosity level by
one. The log levels are numerical from 0 to 4, <br>
corresponding to error, warn, notice, info, debug. Default
log level is notice, i.e. all log messages with lower log
levels are printed: error, warn, notice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v | --verbose <br>
Increase the configured verbosity level by one (see
--log-level above). Specify multiple times to increase log
level multiple times.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-target={auto,syslog,journal,stderr,file:PATH,newfile:PATH}
<br>
Specify the log target. If set to auto (which is the
default), then logging is directed to syslog when
--daemonize is passed, otherwise to STDERR. If set to
journal log&acirc; <br>
ging is directed to the systemd journal. If set to
file:PATH, logging is directed to the file indicated by
PATH. newfile:PATH is otherwise the same as file:PATH, but
<br>
existing files are never overwritten. If the specified file
already exists, a suffix is added to the file name to avoid
overwriting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-meta[=BOOL] <br>
Show source code location in log messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-time[=BOOL] <br>
Show timestamps in log messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-backtrace=FRAMES <br>
When FRAMES is greater than 0, log for each message a stack
trace up to the number of specified stack frames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p | --dl-search-path=PATH <br>
Set the search path for dynamic shared objects
(plugins).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resample-method=METHOD <br>
Use the specified resampler by default (See
--dump-resample-methods above for possible values).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-pid-file[=BOOL] <br>
Create a PID file. If this options is disabled it is
possible to run multiple sound servers per user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-cpu-limit[=BOOL] <br>
Do not install CPU load limiter on platforms that support
it. By default, PulseAudio will terminate itself when it
notices that it takes up too much CPU time. This is
use&acirc; <br>
ful as a protection against system lockups when real-time
scheduling is used (see below). Disabling this mechanism is
useful when debugging PulseAudio with tools like val&acirc;
<br>
grind(1) which slow down execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-shm[=BOOL] <br>
PulseAudio clients and the server can exchange audio data
via POSIX shared memory segments (on systems that support
this). If disabled PulseAudio will communicate exclu&acirc;
<br>
sively over sockets. Please note that data transfer via
shared memory segments is always disabled when PulseAudio is
running with --system enabled (see above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L | --load=&quot;MODULE
ARGUMENTS&quot; <br>
Load the specified plugin module with the specified
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F | --file=FILENAME <br>
Run the specified script on startup. May be specified
multiple times to specify multiple scripts to be run in
order. Combine with -n to disable loading of the default
<br>
script default.pa (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Open a command interpreter on
STDIN/STDOUT after startup. This may be used to configure
PulseAudio dynamically during runtime. Equivalent to
--load=module-cli.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Don&rsquo;t load default
script file default.pa (see below) on startup. Useful in
conjunction with -C or --file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.config/pulse/daemon.conf, /etc/pulse/daemon.conf:
configuration settings for the PulseAudio daemon. If the
version in the user&rsquo;s home directory does not exist
the global con&acirc; <br>
figuration file is loaded. See pulse-daemon.conf(5) for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.config/pulse/default.pa,
/etc/pulse/default.pa: the default configuration script to
execute when the PulseAudio daemon is started. If the
version in the user&rsquo;s home directory <br>
does not exist the global configuration script is loaded.
See default.pa(5) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.config/pulse/client.conf,
/etc/pulse/client.conf: configuration settings for
PulseAudio client applications. If the version in the
user&rsquo;s home directory does not exist the <br>
global configuration file is loaded. See
pulse-client.conf(5) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
SIGINT, SIGTERM: the PulseAudio daemon will shut down (Same
as --kill).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP: dump a long status
report to STDOUT or syslog, depending on the
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1: load module-cli,
allowing runtime reconfiguration via STDIN/STDOUT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR2: load
module-cli-protocol-unix, allowing runtime reconfiguration
via a AF_UNIX socket. See pacmd(1) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNIX GROUPS AND USERS <br>
Group pulse-rt: if the PulseAudio binary is marked SUID
root, then membership of the calling user in this group
decides whether real-time and/or high-priority scheduling is
<br>
enabled. Please note that enabling real-time scheduling is a
security risk (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Group pulse-access: if
PulseAudio is running as a system daemon (see --system
above) access is granted to members of this group when they
connect via AF_UNIX sockets. If PulseAu&acirc; <br>
dio is running as a user daemon this group has no
meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User pulse, group pulse: if
PulseAudio is running as a system daemon (see --system
above) and is started as root the daemon will drop
privileges and become a normal user process <br>
using this user and group. If PulseAudio is running as a
user daemon this user and group has no meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REAL-TIME AND HIGH-PRIORITY
SCHEDULING <br>
To minimize the risk of drop-outs during playback it is
recommended to run PulseAudio with real-time scheduling if
the underlying platform supports it. This decouples the
sched&acirc; <br>
uling latency of the PulseAudio daemon from the system load
and is thus the best way to make sure that PulseAudio always
gets CPU time when it needs it to refill the hardware <br>
playback buffers. Unfortunately this is a security risk on
most systems, since PulseAudio runs as user process, and
giving realtime scheduling privileges to a user process
always <br>
comes with the risk that the user misuses it to lock up the
system -- which is possible since making a process real-time
effectively disables preemption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To minimize the risk PulseAudio
by default does not enable real-time scheduling. It is
however recommended to enable it on trusted systems. To do
that start PulseAudio with <br>
--realtime (see above) or enabled the appropriate option in
daemon.conf. Since acquiring realtime scheduling is a
privileged operation on most systems, some special changes
to <br>
the system configuration need to be made to allow them to
the calling user. Two options are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On newer Linux systems the
system resource limit RLIMIT_RTPRIO (see setrlimit(2) for
more information) can be used to allow specific users to
acquire real-time scheduling. This <br>
can be configured in /etc/security/limits.conf, a resource
limit of 9 is recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, the SUID root bit
can be set for the PulseAudio binary. Then, the daemon will
drop root privileges immediately on startup, however retain
the CAP_NICE capability <br>
(on systems that support it), but only if the calling user
is a member of the pulse-rt group (see above). For all other
users all capabilities are dropped immediately. The
advan&acirc; <br>
tage of this solution is that the real-time privileges are
only granted to the PulseAudio daemon -- not to all the
user&rsquo;s processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, if the risk of
locking up the machine is considered too big to enable
real-time scheduling, high-priority scheduling can be
enabled instead (i.e. negative nice <br>
level). This can be enabled by passing --high-priority (see
above) when starting PulseAudio and may also be enabled with
the appropriate option in daemon.conf. Negative nice
lev&acirc; <br>
els can only be enabled when the appropriate resource limit
RLIMIT_NICE is set (see setrlimit(2) for more information),
possibly configured in /etc/security/limits.conf. A <br>
resource limit of 31 (corresponding with nice level -11) is
recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The PulseAudio client libraries check for the existence of
the following environment variables and change their local
configuration accordingly:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PULSE_SERVER: the server string
specifying the server to connect to when a client asks for a
sound server connection and doesn&rsquo;t explicitly ask for
a specific server. The server <br>
string is a list of server addresses separated by whitespace
which are tried in turn. A server address consists of an
optional address type specifier (unix:, tcp:, tcp4:, tcp6:),
<br>
followed by a path or host address. A host address may
include an optional port number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PULSE_SINK: the symbolic name
of the sink to connect to when a client creates a playback
stream and doesn&rsquo;t explicitly ask for a specific
sink.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PULSE_SOURCE: the symbolic name
of the source to connect to when a client creates a record
stream and doesn&rsquo;t explicitly ask for a specific
source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PULSE_BINARY: path of
PulseAudio executable to run when server auto-spawning is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PULSE_CLIENTCONFIG: path of
file that shall be read instead of client.conf (see above)
for client configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PULSE_COOKIE: path of file that
contains the PulseAudio authentication cookie. Defaults to
~/.config/pulse/cookie.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These environment settings take
precedence -- if set -- over the configuration settings from
client.conf (see above).</p>
