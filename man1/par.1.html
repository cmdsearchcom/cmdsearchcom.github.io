<b>par</b> is a filter which copies its input to its output, changing all white
  characters (except newlines) to spaces, and reformatting each paragraph.
  Paragraphs are separated by protected, blank, and bodiless lines (see the
  <small>TERMINOLOGY</small> section for definitions), and optionally delimited
  by indentation (see the <b>d</b> option in the <small>OPTIONS</small>
  section).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each output paragraph is generated from the corresponding input paragraph as
  follows:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
1)&#x00A0;An optional prefix and/or suffix is removed from each input line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2)&#x00A0;The remainder is divided into words (separated by spaces).
<div class="Pp"></div>
3)&#x00A0;The words are joined into lines to make an eye-pleasing paragraph.
<div class="Pp"></div>
4)&#x00A0;The prefixes and suffixes are reattached.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If there are suffixes, spaces are inserted before them so that they all end in
  the same column.

<b>par</b> is necessarily complex. For those who wish to use it immediately and
  understand it later, assign the <b>PARINIT</b> environment variable the
  following value:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">rTbgqR B=.,?_A_a Q=_s&gt;|</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The spaces, question mark, greater-than sign, and vertical bar will probably
  have to be escaped or quoted to prevent your shell from interpreting them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The documentation, though precise, is unfortunately not well-written for the
  end-user. Your best bet is probably to read quickly the
  <small>DESCRIPTION,</small> <small>TERMINOLOGY,</small>
  <small>OPTIONS,</small> and <small>ENVIRONMENT</small> sections, then read
  carefully the <small>EXAMPLES</small> section, referring back to the
  <small>OPTIONS</small> and <small>TERMINOLOGY</small> sections as needed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For the &quot;power user&quot;, a full understanding of <b>par</b> will require
  multiple readings of the <small>TERMINOLOGY,</small> <small>OPTIONS,</small>
  <small>DETAILS,</small> and <small>EXAMPLES</small> sections.

If a <small>NUL</small> character appears in the value of an environment

<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the <b>PARINIT</b> variable, together with the <b>B</b>, <b>P</b>, and
  <b>Q</b> options, renders the other environment variables unnecessary. They
  are included for backward compatibility.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DETAILS"><a class="selflink" href="#DETAILS">DETAILS</a></h1>
Lines are terminated by newline characters, but the newlines are not considered
  to be included in the lines. If the last character of the input is a
  non-newline, a newline will be inferred immediately after it (but if the input
  is empty, no newline will be inferred; the number of input lines will be 0).
  Thus, the input can always be viewed as a sequence of lines.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Protected lines are copied unchanged from the input to the output. All other
  input lines, as they are read, have any <small>NUL</small> characters removed,
  and every white character (except newlines) turned into a space. Actually,
  each tab character is turned into <i>Tab</i> - (<i>n</i> % <i>Tab</i>) spaces,
  where <i>n</i> is the number of characters preceeding the tab character on the
  line (evaluated after earlier tab characters have been expanded).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Blank lines in the input are transformed into empty lines in the output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>repeat</i> is 0, all bodiless lines are vacant, and they are all simply
  stripped of trailing spaces before being output. If <i>repeat</i> is not 0,
  only vacant lines whose suffixes have length 0 are treated that way; other
  bodiless lines have the number of instances of their repeat characters
  increased or decreased until the length of the line is <i>width</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>expel</i> is 1, superfluous lines are not output. If <i>quote</i> and
  <i>invis</i> are both 1, there may be invisible lines; they are not output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The input is divided into segments, which are divided into blocks, which are
  divided into IPs. The exact process depends on the values of <i>quote</i> and
  <i>div</i> (see <b>q</b> and <b>d</b> in the <small>OPTIONS</small> section).
  The remainder of this section describes the process which is applied
  independently to each IP to construct the corresponding OP.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After the values of the parameters are determined (see the
  <small>OPTIONS</small> section), the first <i>prefix</i> characters and the
  last <i>suffix</i> characters of each input line are removed and remembered.
  It is an error for any line to contain fewer than
  <i>prefix</i>&#x00A0;+&#x00A0;<i>suffix</i> characters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The remaining text is treated as a sequence of characters, not lines. The text
  is broken into words, which are separated by spaces. That is, a word is a
  maximal sub-sequence of non-spaces. If <i>guess</i> is 1, some words might be
  merged (see <b>g</b> in the <small>OPTIONS</small> section). The first word
  includes any spaces that preceed it on the same line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Let <i>L</i> = <i>width</i> - <i>prefix</i> - <i>suffix</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>Report</i> is 0, some words may get chopped up at this point (see <b>R</b>
  in the <small>OPTIONS</small> section).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The words are reassembled, preserving their order, into lines. If <i>just</i> is
  0, adjacent words within a line are separated by a single space, (or sometimes
  two if <i>guess</i> is 1), and line breaks are chosen so that the paragraph
  satisfies the following properties:
<div style="margin-left: 1.00in;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
1)&#x00A0;No line contains more than <i>L</i> characters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2)&#x00A0;If <i>fit</i> is 1, the difference between the lengths of the shortest
  and longest lines is as small as possible.
<div class="Pp"></div>
3)&#x00A0;The shortest line is as long as possible, subject to properties 1 and
  2.
<div class="Pp"></div>
4)&#x00A0;Let <i>target</i> be <i>L</i> if <i>fit</i> is 0, or the length of the
  longest line if <i>fit</i> is 1. The sum of the squares of the differences
  between <i>target</i> and the lengths of the lines is as small as possible,
  subject to properties 1, 2, and 3.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>last</i> is 0, the last line does not count as a line for the purposes of
  properties 2, 3, and 4 above.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If all the words fit on a single line, the properties as worded above don't make
  much sense. In that case, no line breaks are inserted.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>just</i> is 1, adjacent words within a line are separated by one space (or
  sometimes two if <i>guess</i> is 1) plus zero or more extra spaces. The value
  of <i>fit</i> is disregarded, and line breaks are chosen so that the paragraph
  satisfies the following properties:
<div style="margin-left: 1.00in;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
1)&#x00A0;Every line contains exactly <i>L</i> characters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2)&#x00A0;The largest inter-word gap is as small as possible, subject to
  property 1. (An inter-word gap consists only of the extra spaces, not the
  regular spaces.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
3)&#x00A0;The sum of the squares of the lengths of the inter-word gaps is as
  small as possible, subject to properties 1 and 2.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 0.50in;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>last</i> is 0, the last line does not count as a line for the purposes of
  property 1, and it does not require or contain any extra spaces.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Extra spaces are distributed as uniformly as possible among the inter-word gaps
  in each line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In a justified paragraph, every line must contain at least two words, but that's
  not always possible to accomplish. If the paragraph cannot be justified, it is
  considered an error.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the number of lines in the resulting paragraph is less than <i>hang</i>,
  empty lines are added at the end to bring the number of lines up to
  <i>hang</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>just</i> is 0 and <i>touch</i> is 1, <i>L</i> is changed to be the length
  of the longest line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>suffix</i> is not 0, each line is padded at the end with spaces to bring
  its length up to <i>L</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To each line is prepended <i>prefix</i> characters. Let <i>n</i> be the number
  of lines in the IP, let <i>afp</i> be the augmented fallback prelen of the IP,
  and let <i>fs</i> be the fallback suflen of the IP. The characters which are
  prepended to the <i>i</i>th line are chosen as follows:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
1)&#x00A0;If <i>i</i> &lt;= <i>n</i>, the characters are copied from the ones
  that were removed from the beginning of the <i>n</i>th input line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2)&#x00A0;If <i>i</i> &gt; <i>n</i> &gt; <i>hang</i>, the characters are copied
  from the ones that were removed from the beginning of the last input line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
3)&#x00A0;If <i>i</i> &gt; <i>n</i> and <i>n</i> &lt;= <i>hang</i>, the first
  min(<i>afp</i>,<i>prefix</i>) of the characters are copied from the ones that
  were removed from the beginning of the last input line, and the rest are all
  spaces.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then to each line is appended <i>suffix</i> characters. The characters which are
  appended to the <i>i</i>th line are chosen as follows:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
1)&#x00A0;If <i>i</i> &lt;= <i>n</i>, the characters are copied from the ones
  that were removed from the end of the <i>n</i>th input line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2)&#x00A0;If <i>i</i> &gt; <i>n</i> &gt; <i>hang</i>, the characters are copied
  from the ones that were removed from the end of the last input line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
3)&#x00A0;If <i>i</i> &gt; <i>n</i> and <i>n</i> &lt;= <i>hang</i>, the first
  min(<i>fs</i>,<i>suffix</i>) of the characters are copied from the ones that
  were removed from the beginning of the last input line, and the rest are all
  spaces.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, the lines are printed to the output as the OP.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DIAGNOSTICS"><a class="selflink" href="#DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</a></h1>
If there are no errors, <b>par</b> returns <b>EXIT_SUCCESS</b> (see
  <b>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</b>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If there is an error, an error message will be printed to the output, and
  <b>par</b> will return <b>EXIT_FAILURE</b>. If the error is local to a single
  paragraph, the preceeding paragraphs will have been output before the error
  was detected. Line numbers in error messages are local to the IP in which the
  error occurred. All error messages begin with &quot;par&#x00A0;error:&quot; on
  a line by itself. Error messages concerning command line or environment
  variable syntax are accompanied by the same usage message that the help option
  produces.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Of course, trying to print an error message would be futile if an error resulted
  from an output function, so <b>par</b> doesn't bother doing any error checking
  on output functions.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
The superiority of <b>par</b>'s dynamic programming algorithm over a greedy
  algorithm (such as the one used by <b>fmt</b>) can be seen in the following
  example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Original paragraph (note that each line begins with 8 spaces):
<div style="margin-left: -0.50in;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        We the people of the United States,
        in order to form a more perfect union,
        establish justice,
        insure domestic tranquility,
        provide for the common defense,
        promote the general welfare,
        and secure the blessing of liberty
        to ourselves and our posterity,
        do ordain and establish the Constitution
        of the United States of America.
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
After a greedy algorithm with width = 39:
<div style="margin-left: -0.50in;">
<div class="Pp"></div>

</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The line breaks chosen by <b>par</b> are clearly more eye-pleasing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>par</b> is most useful in conjunction with the text-filtering features of an
  editor, such as the ! commands of <b>vi</b>. You may wish to add the following
  lines to your <b>.exrc</b> file:
<div style="margin-left: -0.50in;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        &quot; use Bourne shell for speed:
        set shell=/bin/sh
        &quot;
        &quot; reformat paragraph with no arguments:
        map ** {!}par^M}
        &quot;
        &quot; reformat paragraph with arguments:
        map *^V  {!}par
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the leading spaces must be removed, and that what is shown as ^M and
  ^V really need to be ctrl-M and ctrl-V. Also note that the last map command
  contains two spaces following the ctrl-V, plus one at the end of the line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To reformat a simple paragraph delimited by blank lines in <b>vi</b>, you can
  put the cursor anywhere in it and type &quot; <b>**</b>&quot; (star star). If
  you need to supply arguments to par, you can type &quot;
  <b>*&#x00A0;</b>&quot; (star space) instead, then type the arguments.

The <i>guess</i> feature guesses wrong in cases like the following:
<div style="margin-left: -0.50in;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        I calc'd the approx.
        Fermi level to 3 sig. digits.
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
With <i>guess</i> = 1, <b>par</b> will incorrectly assume that
  &quot;approx.&quot; ends a sentence. If the input were:
<div style="margin-left: -0.50in;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        I calc'd the approx. Fermi
        level to 3 sig. digits.
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
then <b>par</b> would refuse to put a line break between &quot;approx.&quot; and
  &quot;Fermi&quot; in the output, mainly to avoid creating the first situation
  (in case the paragraph were to be fed back through <b>par</b> again). This
  non-breaking space policy does come in handy for cases like
  &quot;Mr.&#x00A0;Johnson&quot; and &quot;Jan.&#x00A0;1&quot;, though.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>guess</i> feature only goes one way. <b>par</b> can preserve wide
  sentence breaks in a paragraph, or remove them, but it can't insert them if
  they aren't already in the input.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you use tabs, you may not like the way <b>par</b> handles (or doesn't handle)
  them. It expands them into spaces. I didn't let <b>par</b> output tabs because
  tabs don't make sense. Not everyone's terminal has the same tab settings, so
  text files containing tabs are sometimes mangled. In fact, almost every text
  file containing tabs gets mangled when something is inserted at the beginning
  of each line (when quoting e-mail or commenting out a section of a shell
  script, for example), making them a pain to edit. In my opinion, the world
  would be a nicer place if everyone stopped using tabs, so I'm doing my part by
  not letting <b>par</b> output them. (Thanks to Eric Stuebe for showing me the
  light about tabs.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is currently no way for the length of the output prefix to differ from the
  length of the input prefix. Ditto for the suffix. I may consider adding this
  capability in a future release, but right now I'm not sure how I'd want it to
  work.

Par began in July 1993 as a small program designed to do one narrow task:
  reformat a single paragraph that might have a border on either side. It was
  pretty clean back then. Over the next three months, it very rapidly expanded
  to handle multiple paragraphs, offer more options, and take better guesses, at
  the cost of becoming extremely complex, and very unclean. It is nowhere near
  the optimal design for the larger task it now tries to address. Its only
  redeeming features are that it is extremely useful (I find it indispensable),
  extremely portable, and very stable (between the release of version 1.41 on
  1993-Oct-31 and the release of version 1.52 on 2001-Apr-29, no incorrect
  behavior was reported).

Back in 1993 I had very little experience at writing documentation for users, so
  the documentation for Par became rather nightmarish. There is no separation
  between how-it-works (which is painfully complex) and how-to-use-it (which is
  fairly simple, if you can ever figure it out).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Someday I ought to reexamine the problem, and redesign a new, clean solution
  from scratch. I don't know when I might get enough free time to start on such
  a project. Text files may be obsolete by then.

If I knew of any bugs, I wouldn't release the package. Of course, there may be
  bugs that I haven't yet discovered.
