<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
par is a filter which copies its input to its output,
changing all white characters (except newlines) to spaces,
and reformatting each paragraph. Paragraphs are separated by
<br>
protected, blank, and bodiless lines (see the TERMINOLOGY
section for definitions), and optionally delimited by
indentation (see the d option in the OPTIONS section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each output paragraph is
generated from the corresponding input paragraph as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) An optional prefix and/or
suffix is removed from each input line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) The remainder is divided into
words (separated by spaces).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3) The words are joined into
lines to make an eye-pleasing paragraph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4) The prefixes and suffixes are
reattached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are suffixes, spaces
are inserted before them so that they all end in the same
column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUICK START <br>
par is necessarily complex. For those who wish to use it
immediately and understand it later, assign the PARINIT
environment variable the following value:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rTbgqR B=.,?_A_a Q=_s&gt;|</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The spaces, question mark,
greater-than sign, and vertical bar will probably have to be
escaped or quoted to prevent your shell from interpreting
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The documentation, though
precise, is unfortunately not well-written for the end-user.
Your best bet is probably to read quickly the DESCRIPTION,
TERMINOLOGY, OPTIONS, and ENVI&acirc; <br>
RONMENT sections, then read carefully the EXAMPLES section,
referring back to the OPTIONS and TERMINOLOGY sections as
needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the &quot;power user&quot;,
a full understanding of par will require multiple readings
of the TERMINOLOGY, OPTIONS, DETAILS, and EXAMPLES
sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERMINOLOGY <br>
Miscellaneous terms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">charset syntax <br>
A way of representing a set of characters as a string. The
set includes exactly those characters which appear in the
string, except that the underscore (_) is an <br>
escape character. Whenever it appears, it must begin one of
the following escape sequences:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">__ = an underscore</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_s = a space</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_b = a backslash (</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_q = a single quote
(&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_Q = a double quote (&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_A = all upper case letters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_a = all lower case letters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_0 = all decimal digits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_xhh = the character represented
by the two hexadecimal digits hh (which may be upper or
lower case)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The NUL character must not
appear in the string, but it may be included in the set with
the _x00 sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">error A condition which causes
par to abort. See the DIAGNOSTICS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IP Input paragraph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OP Output paragraph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">parameter <br>
A symbol which may take on unsigned integral values. There
are several parameters whose values affect the behavior of
par. Parameters can be assigned values using <br>
command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Types of characters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alphanumeric character <br>
An upper case letter, lower case letter, or decimal
digit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">body character <br>
A member of the set of characters defined by the PARBODY
environment variable (see the ENVIRONMENT section) and/or
the B option (see the OPTIONS section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">protective character <br>
A member of the set of characters defined by the PARPROTECT
environment variable and/or the P option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quote character <br>
A member of the set of characters defined by the PARQUOTE
environment variable and/or the Q option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">terminal character <br>
A period, question mark, exclamation point, or colon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">white character <br>
A space, formfeed, newline, carriage return, tab, or
vertical tab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Functions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comprelen <br>
Given a non-empty sequence S of lines, let c be their
longest common prefix. If the parameter body is 0, place a
divider just after the leading non-body characters <br>
in c (at the beginning if there are none). If body is 1,
place the divider just after the last non-space non-body
character in c (at the beginning if there is <br>
none), then advance the divider over any immediately
following spaces. The comprelen of S is the number of
characters preceeding the divider.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comsuflen <br>
Given a non-empty sequence S of lines, let p be the
comprelen of S. Let T be the set of lines which result from
stripping the first p characters from each line in <br>
S. Let c be the longest common suffix of the lines in T. If
body is 0, place a divider just before the trailing non-body
characters in c (at the end if there are <br>
none), then advance the divider over all but the last of any
immediately following spaces. If body is 1, place the
divider just before the first non-space non-body <br>
character, then back up the divider over one immediately
preceeding space if there is one. The comsuflen of S is the
number of characters following the divider.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fallback prelen (suflen) <br>
The fallback prelen (suflen) of an IP is: the comprelen
(comsuflen) of the IP, if the IP contains at least two
lines; otherwise, the comprelen (comsuflen) of the <br>
block containing the IP, if the block contains at least two
lines; otherwise, the length of the longer of the prefixes
(suffixes) of the bodiless lines just above <br>
and below the block, if the segment containing the block has
any bodiless lines; otherwise, 0. (See below for the
definitions of block, segment, and bodiless <br>
line.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">augmented fallback prelen <br>
Let fp be the fallback prelen of an IP. If the IP contains
more than one line, or if quote is 0, then the augmented
fallback prelen of the IP is simply fp. Other&acirc; <br>
wise, it is fp plus the number of quote characters
immediately following the first fp characters of the
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quoteprefix <br>
The quoteprefix of a line is the longest string of quote
characters appearing at the beginning of the line, after
this string has been stripped of any trailing spa&acirc;
<br>
ces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Types of lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blank line <br>
An empty line, or a line whose first character is not
protective and which contains only spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">protected line <br>
An input line whose first character is protective.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bodiless line <br>
A line which is order k bodiless for some k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">order k bodiless line <br>
There is no such thing as an order 0 bodiless line. Suppose
S is a a contiguous subsequence of a segment (see below)
containing at least two lines, containing no <br>
order k-1 bodiless lines, bounded above and below by order
k-1 bodiless lines and/or the beginning/end of the segment.
Let p and s be the comprelen and comsuflen <br>
of S. Any member of S which, if stripped of its first p and
last s characters, would be blank (or, if the parameter
repeat is non-zero, would consist of the same <br>
character repeated at least repeat times), is order k
bodiless. The first p characters of the bodiless line
comprise its prefix; the last s characters comprise its <br>
suffix. The character which repeats in the middle is called
its repeat character. If the middle is empty, the space is
taken to be its repeat character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vacant line <br>
A bodiless line whose repeat character is the space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">superfluous line <br>
Only blank and vacant lines may be superfluous. If
contiguous vacant lines lie at the beginning or end of a
segment, they are all superfluous. But if they lie <br>
between two non-vacant lines within a segment, then all are
superfluous except one&acirc;the one which contains the
fewest non-spaces. In case of a tie, the first of the <br>
tied lines is chosen. Similarly, if contiguous blank lines
lie outside of any segments at the beginning or end of the
input, they are all superfluous. But if they <br>
lie between two segments and/or protected lines, then all
are superfluous except the first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Groups of lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">segment <br>
A contiguous sequence of input lines containing no protected
or blank lines, bounded above and below by protected lines,
blank lines, and/or the beginning/end of <br>
the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">block A contiguous subsequence
of a segment containing no bodiless lines, bounded above and
below by bodiless lines and/or the beginning/end of the
segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Types of words:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">capitalized word <br>
If the parameter cap is 0, a capitalized word is one which
contains at least one alphanumeric character, whose first
alphanumeric character is not a lower case let&acirc; <br>
ter. If cap is 1, every word is considered a capitalized
word. (See the c option in the OPTIONS section.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curious word <br>
A word which contains a terminal character c such that there
are no alphanumeric characters in the word after c, but
there is at least one alphanumeric character in <br>
the word before c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Any command line argument may begin with one minus sign (-)
which is ignored. Generally, more than one option may appear
in a single command line argument, but there are
excep&acirc; <br>
tions: The help, version, B, P, and Q options must have
whole arguments all to themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help Causes all remaining
arguments to be ignored. No input is read. A usage message
is printed on the output briefly describing the options used
by par.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version Causes all remaining
arguments to be ignored. No input is read. &quot;par
1.52&quot; is printed on the output. Of course, this will
change in future releases of Par.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bopset op is a single character,
either an equal sign (=), a plus sign (+), or a minus sign
(-), and set is a string using charset syntax. If op is an
equal sign, the set of <br>
body characters is set to the character set defined by set.
If op is a plus/minus sign, the characters in the set
defined by set are added/removed to/from the existing <br>
set of body characters defined by the PARBODY environment
variable and any previous B options. It is okay to add
characters that are already in the set or to remove <br>
characters that are not in the set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Popset Just like the B option,
except that it applies to the set of protective
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qopset Just like the B option,
except that it applies to the set of quote characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All remaining options are used
to set values of parameters. Values set by command line
options hold for all paragraphs. Unset parameters are given
default values. Any parame&acirc; <br>
ters whose default values depend on the IP (namely prefix
and suffix), if left unset, are recomputed separately for
each paragraph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The approximate role of each
variable is described here. See the DETAILS section for the
rest of the story.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first six parameters, hang,
prefix, repeat, suffix, Tab, and width, may be set to any
unsigned decimal integer less than 10000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h[hang] Mainly affects the
default values of prefix and suffix. Defaults to 0. If the h
option is given without a number, the value 1 is inferred.
(See also the p and s <br>
options.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p[prefix] The first prefix
characters of each line of the OP are copied from the first
prefix characters of the corresponding line of the IP. If
there are more than hang+1 lines <br>
in the IP, the default value is the comprelen of all the
lines in the IP except the first hang of them. Otherwise,
the default value is the augmented fallback prelen <br>
of the IP. If the p option is given without a number, prefix
is unset, even if it had been set earlier. (See also the h
and q options.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r[repeat] If repeat is non-zero,
bodiless lines have the number of instances of their repeat
characters increased or decreased until the length of the
line is width. The exact <br>
value of repeat affects the definition of bodiless line.
Defaults to 0. If the r option is given without a number,
the value 3 is inferred. (See also the w option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s[suffix] The last suffix
characters of each line of the OP are copied from the last
suffix characters of the corresponding line of the IP. If
there are more than hang+1 lines <br>
in the IP, the default value is the comsuflen of all the
lines of the IP except the first hang of them. Otherwise,
the default value is the fallback suflen of the IP. <br>
If the s option is given without a number, suffix is unset,
even if it had been set earlier. (See also the h
option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T[Tab] Tab characters in the
input are expanded to spaces, assuming tab stops every Tab
columns. Must not be 0. Defaults to 1. If the T option is
given without a number, <br>
the value 8 is inferred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w[width] No line in the OP may
contain more than width characters, not including the
trailing newlines. Defaults to 72. If the w option is given
without a number, the value 79 <br>
is inferred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remaining thirteen
parameters, body, cap, div, Err, expel, fit, guess, invis,
just, last, quote, Report, and touch, may be set to either 0
or 1. If the number is absent in <br>
the option, the value 1 is inferred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b[body] If body is 1, prefixes
may not contain any trailing body characters, and suffixes
may not contain any leading body characters. (Actually, the
situation is complicated <br>
by space characters. See comprelen and comsuflen in the
Terminology section.) If body is 0, prefixes and suffixes
may not contain any body characters at all. <br>
Defaults to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c[cap] If cap is 1, all words
are considered capitalized. This currently affects only the
application of the g option. Defaults to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d[div] If div is 0, each block
becomes an IP. If div is 1, each block is subdivided into
IPs as follows: Let p be the comprelen of the block. Let a
line&rsquo;s status be 1 if <br>
its (p+1)st character is a space, 0 otherwise. Every line in
the block whose status is the same as the status of the
first line will begin a new paragraph. Defaults <br>
to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E[Err] If Err is 1, messages to
the user (caused by the help and version options, or by
errors) are sent to the error stream instead of the output
stream. Defaults to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e[expel] If expel is 1,
superfluous lines are withheld from the output. Defaults to
0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f[fit] If fit is 1 and just is
0, par tries to make the lines in the OP as nearly the same
length as possible, even if it means making the OP narrower.
Defaults to 0. (See <br>
also the j option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g[guess] If guess is 1, then
when par is choosing line breaks, whenever it encounters a
curious word followed by a capitalized word, it takes one of
two special actions. If the <br>
two words are separated by a single space in the input, they
will be merged into one word with an embedded non-breaking
space. If the two words are separated by more <br>
than one space, or by a line break, par will insure that
they are separated by two spaces, or by a line break, in the
output. Defaults to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i[invis] If invis is 1, then
vacant lines inserted because quote is 1 are invisible; that
is, they are not output. If quote is 0, invis has no effect.
Defaults to 0. (See <br>
also the q option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">j[just] If just is 1, par
justifies the OP, inserting spaces between words so that all
lines in the OP have length width (except the last, if last
is 0). Defaults to 0. (See <br>
also the w, l, and f options.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l[last] If last is 1, par tries
to make the last line of the OP about the same length as the
others. Defaults to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q[quote] If quote is 1, then
before each segment is scanned for bodiless lines, par
supplies vacant lines between different quotation nesting
levels as follows: For each pair <br>
of adjacent lines in the segment, (scanned from the top
down) which have different quoteprefixes, one of two actions
is taken. If invis is 0, and either line consists <br>
entirely of quote characters and spaces (or is empty), that
line is truncated to the longest common prefix of the two
lines (both are truncated if both qualify). Oth&acirc; <br>
erwise, a line consisting of the longest common prefix of
the two lines is inserted between them. quote also affects
the default value of prefix. Defaults to 0. (See <br>
also the p and i options.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R[Report] If Report is 1, it is
considered an error for an input word to contain more than L
= (width - prefix - suffix) characters. Otherwise, such
words are chopped after each <br>
Lth character into shorter words. Defaults to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t[touch] Has no effect if suffix
is 0 or just is 1. Otherwise, if touch is 0, all lines in
the OP have length width. If touch is 1, the length of the
lines is decreased until <br>
the suffixes touch the body of the OP. Defaults to the
logical OR of fit and last. (See also the s, j, w, f, and l
options.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an argument begins with a
number, that number is assumed to belong to a p option if it
is 8 or less, and to a w option otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the value of any parameter is
set more than once, the last value is used. When unset
parameters are assigned default values, hang and quote are
assigned before prefix, and <br>
fit and last are assigned before touch (because of the
dependencies).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is an error if width &lt;=
prefix + suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
PARBODY Determines the initial set of body characters (which
are used for determining comprelens and comsuflens), using
charset syntax. If PARBODY is not set, the set of body <br>
characters is initially empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARINIT If set, par will read
command line options from PARINIT before it reads them from
the command line. Within the value of PARINIT, arguments are
separated by white char&acirc; <br>
acters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARPROTECT <br>
Determines the set of protective characters, using charset
syntax. If PARPROTECT is not set, the set of protective
characters is initially empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARQUOTE Determines the set of
quote characters, using charset syntax. If PARQUOTE is not
set, the set of quote characters initially contains only the
greater-than sign (&gt;) and <br>
the space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a NUL character appears in
the value of an environment variable, it and the rest of the
string will not be seen by par.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the PARINIT variable,
together with the B, P, and Q options, renders the other
environment variables unnecessary. They are included for
backward compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DETAILS <br>
Lines are terminated by newline characters, but the newlines
are not considered to be included in the lines. If the last
character of the input is a non-newline, a newline will <br>
be inferred immediately after it (but if the input is empty,
no newline will be inferred; the number of input lines will
be 0). Thus, the input can always be viewed as a <br>
sequence of lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Protected lines are copied
unchanged from the input to the output. All other input
lines, as they are read, have any NUL characters removed,
and every white character (except <br>
newlines) turned into a space. Actually, each tab character
is turned into Tab - (n % Tab) spaces, where n is the number
of characters preceeding the tab character on the line <br>
(evaluated after earlier tab characters have been
expanded).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blank lines in the input are
transformed into empty lines in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If repeat is 0, all bodiless
lines are vacant, and they are all simply stripped of
trailing spaces before being output. If repeat is not 0,
only vacant lines whose suffixes have <br>
length 0 are treated that way; other bodiless lines have the
number of instances of their repeat characters increased or
decreased until the length of the line is width.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If expel is 1, superfluous lines
are not output. If quote and invis are both 1, there may be
invisible lines; they are not output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The input is divided into
segments, which are divided into blocks, which are divided
into IPs. The exact process depends on the values of quote
and div (see q and d in the <br>
OPTIONS section). The remainder of this section describes
the process which is applied independently to each IP to
construct the corresponding OP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the values of the
parameters are determined (see the OPTIONS section), the
first prefix characters and the last suffix characters of
each input line are removed and remem&acirc; <br>
bered. It is an error for any line to contain fewer than
prefix + suffix characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remaining text is treated as
a sequence of characters, not lines. The text is broken into
words, which are separated by spaces. That is, a word is a
maximal sub-sequence of <br>
non-spaces. If guess is 1, some words might be merged (see g
in the OPTIONS section). The first word includes any spaces
that preceed it on the same line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Let L = width - prefix -
suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Report is 0, some words may
get chopped up at this point (see R in the OPTIONS
section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The words are reassembled,
preserving their order, into lines. If just is 0, adjacent
words within a line are separated by a single space, (or
sometimes two if guess is 1), and <br>
line breaks are chosen so that the paragraph satisfies the
following properties:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) No line contains more than L
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) If fit is 1, the difference
between the lengths of the shortest and longest lines is as
small as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3) The shortest line is as long
as possible, subject to properties 1 and 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4) Let target be L if fit is 0,
or the length of the longest line if fit is 1. The sum of
the squares of the differences between target and the
lengths of the lines is as <br>
small as possible, subject to properties 1, 2, and 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If last is 0, the last line does
not count as a line for the purposes of properties 2, 3, and
4 above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If all the words fit on a single
line, the properties as worded above don&rsquo;t make much
sense. In that case, no line breaks are inserted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If just is 1, adjacent words
within a line are separated by one space (or sometimes two
if guess is 1) plus zero or more extra spaces. The value of
fit is disregarded, and line <br>
breaks are chosen so that the paragraph satisfies the
following properties:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) Every line contains exactly L
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) The largest inter-word gap is
as small as possible, subject to property 1. (An inter-word
gap consists only of the extra spaces, not the regular
spaces.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3) The sum of the squares of the
lengths of the inter-word gaps is as small as possible,
subject to properties 1 and 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If last is 0, the last line does
not count as a line for the purposes of property 1, and it
does not require or contain any extra spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extra spaces are distributed as
uniformly as possible among the inter-word gaps in each
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a justified paragraph, every
line must contain at least two words, but that&rsquo;s not
always possible to accomplish. If the paragraph cannot be
justified, it is considered <br>
an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the number of lines in the
resulting paragraph is less than hang, empty lines are added
at the end to bring the number of lines up to hang.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If just is 0 and touch is 1, L
is changed to be the length of the longest line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If suffix is not 0, each line is
padded at the end with spaces to bring its length up to
L.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To each line is prepended prefix
characters. Let n be the number of lines in the IP, let afp
be the augmented fallback prelen of the IP, and let fs be
the fallback suflen of the <br>
IP. The characters which are prepended to the ith line are
chosen as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) If i &lt;= n, the characters
are copied from the ones that were removed from the
beginning of the nth input line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) If i &gt; n &gt; hang, the
characters are copied from the ones that were removed from
the beginning of the last input line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3) If i &gt; n and n &lt;= hang,
the first min(afp,prefix) of the characters are copied from
the ones that were removed from the beginning of the last
input line, and the rest are <br>
all spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then to each line is appended
suffix characters. The characters which are appended to the
ith line are chosen as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) If i &lt;= n, the characters
are copied from the ones that were removed from the end of
the nth input line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) If i &gt; n &gt; hang, the
characters are copied from the ones that were removed from
the end of the last input line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3) If i &gt; n and n &lt;= hang,
the first min(fs,suffix) of the characters are copied from
the ones that were removed from the beginning of the last
input line, and the rest are <br>
all spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, the lines are printed
to the output as the OP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
If there are no errors, par returns EXIT_SUCCESS (see
&lt;stdlib.h&gt;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is an error, an error
message will be printed to the output, and par will return
EXIT_FAILURE. If the error is local to a single paragraph,
the preceeding paragraphs <br>
will have been output before the error was detected. Line
numbers in error messages are local to the IP in which the
error occurred. All error messages begin with &quot;par
error:&quot; <br>
on a line by itself. Error messages concerning command line
or environment variable syntax are accompanied by the same
usage message that the help option produces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course, trying to print an
error message would be futile if an error resulted from an
output function, so par doesn&rsquo;t bother doing any error
checking on output functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The superiority of par&rsquo;s dynamic programming algorithm
over a greedy algorithm (such as the one used by fmt) can be
seen in the following example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Original paragraph (note that
each line begins with 8 spaces):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We the people of the United
States, <br>
in order to form a more perfect union, <br>
establish justice, <br>
insure domestic tranquility, <br>
provide for the common defense, <br>
promote the general welfare, <br>
and secure the blessing of liberty <br>
to ourselves and our posterity, <br>
do ordain and establish the Constitution <br>
of the United States of America.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After a greedy algorithm with
width = 39:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We the people of the United <br>
States, in order to form a more <br>
perfect union, establish <br>
justice, insure domestic <br>
tranquility, provide for the <br>
common defense, promote the <br>
general welfare, and secure the <br>
blessing of liberty to <br>
ourselves and our posterity, do <br>
ordain and establish the <br>
Constitution of the United <br>
States of America.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After &quot;par 39&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We the people of the United <br>
States, in order to form a <br>
more perfect union, establish <br>
justice, insure domestic <br>
tranquility, provide for the <br>
common defense, promote the <br>
general welfare, and secure <br>
the blessing of liberty to <br>
ourselves and our posterity, <br>
do ordain and establish the <br>
Constitution of the United <br>
States of America.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The line breaks chosen by par
are clearly more eye-pleasing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">par is most useful in
conjunction with the text-filtering features of an editor,
such as the ! commands of vi. You may wish to add the
following lines to your .exrc file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot; use Bourne shell for
speed: <br>
set shell=/bin/sh <br>
&quot; <br>
&quot; reformat paragraph with no arguments: <br>
map ** {!}par^M} <br>
&quot; <br>
&quot; reformat paragraph with arguments: <br>
map *^V {!}par</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the leading spaces
must be removed, and that what is shown as ^M and ^V really
need to be ctrl-M and ctrl-V. Also note that the last map
command contains two spaces <br>
following the ctrl-V, plus one at the end of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To reformat a simple paragraph
delimited by blank lines in vi, you can put the cursor
anywhere in it and type &quot;**&quot; (star star). If you
need to supply arguments to par, you can <br>
type &quot;* &quot; (star space) instead, then type the
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rest of this section is a
series of before-and-after pictures showing some typical
uses of par. In all cases, no environment variables are
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The guess feature only goes one
way. par can preserve wide sentence breaks in a paragraph,
or remove them, but it can&rsquo;t insert them if they
aren&rsquo;t already in the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use tabs, you may not
like the way par handles (or doesn&rsquo;t handle) them. It
expands them into spaces. I didn&rsquo;t let par output tabs
because tabs don&rsquo;t make sense. Not <br>
everyone&rsquo;s terminal has the same tab settings, so text
files containing tabs are sometimes mangled. In fact, almost
every text file containing tabs gets mangled when something
<br>
is inserted at the beginning of each line (when quoting
e-mail or commenting out a section of a shell script, for
example), making them a pain to edit. In my opinion, the
world <br>
would be a nicer place if everyone stopped using tabs, so
I&rsquo;m doing my part by not letting par output them.
(Thanks to Eric Stuebe for showing me the light about
tabs.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is currently no way for
the length of the output prefix to differ from the length of
the input prefix. Ditto for the suffix. I may consider
adding this capability in a <br>
future release, but right now I&rsquo;m not sure how
I&rsquo;d want it to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APOLOGIES <br>
Par began in July 1993 as a small program designed to do one
narrow task: reformat a single paragraph that might have a
border on either side. It was pretty clean back then. <br>
Over the next three months, it very rapidly expanded to
handle multiple paragraphs, offer more options, and take
better guesses, at the cost of becoming extremely complex,
and <br>
very unclean. It is nowhere near the optimal design for the
larger task it now tries to address. Its only redeeming
features are that it is extremely useful (I find it
indis&acirc; <br>
pensable), extremely portable, and very stable (between the
release of version 1.41 on 1993-Oct-31 and the release of
version 1.52 on 2001-Apr-29, no incorrect behavior was <br>
reported).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Back in 1993 I had very little
experience at writing documentation for users, so the
documentation for Par became rather nightmarish. There is no
separation between how-it-works <br>
(which is painfully complex) and how-to-use-it (which is
fairly simple, if you can ever figure it out).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Someday I ought to reexamine the
problem, and redesign a new, clean solution from scratch. I
don&rsquo;t know when I might get enough free time to start
on such a project. Text files <br>
may be obsolete by then.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If I knew of any bugs, I wouldn&rsquo;t release the package.
Of course, there may be bugs that I haven&rsquo;t yet
discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you find any bugs (in the
program or in the documentation), or if you have any
suggestions, please send e-mail to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">amc@cs.berkeley.edu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When reporting a bug, please
include the exact input and command line options used, and
the version number of par, so that I can reproduce it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The latest release of Par is
available on the Web at:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These addresses will change.
I&rsquo;ll try to leave forward pointers.</p>
