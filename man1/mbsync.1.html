<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mbsync - synchronize IMAP4 and Maildir mailboxes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mbsync [options ...] {{channel[:box[{,|0...]]|group}
...|-a}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mbsync is a command line application which synchronizes
mailboxes; currently Maildir and IMAP4 mailboxes are
supported. New messages, message deletions and flag changes
can be <br>
propagated both ways; the operation set can be selected in a
fine-grained manner. <br>
Synchronization is based on unique message identifiers
(UIDs), so no identification conflicts can occur (unlike
with some other mail synchronizers). OTOH, mbsync is
susceptible <br>
to UID validity changes (that should never happen, but see
&quot;Compatibility&quot; in the README). Synchronization
state is kept in one local text file per mailbox pair; these
files are <br>
protected against concurrent mbsync processes. Mailboxes can
be safely modified while mbsync operates (see INHERENT
PROBLEMS below for a minor exception). Multiple replicas of
<br>
each mailbox can be maintained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c, --config file <br>
Read configuration from file. By default, the configuration
is read from ~/.mbsyncrc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --all <br>
Select all configured channels. Any channel/group
specifications on the command line are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --list <br>
Don&rsquo;t synchronize anything, but list all mailboxes in
the selected channels and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C[m][s],
--create[-master|-slave] <br>
Override any Create options from the config file. See
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R[m][s],
--remove[-master|-slave] <br>
Override any Remove options from the config file. See
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X[m][s],
--expunge[-master|-slave] <br>
Override any Expunge options from the config file. See
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{-n|-N|-d|-f|-0|-F},
{--new|--renew|--delete|--flags|--noop|--full} <br>
{-L|-H}[n][N][d][f],
{--pull|--push}[-new|-renew|-delete|-flags]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Override any Sync options from
the config file. See below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Display a summary of command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Display version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --verbose <br>
Enable verbose mode, which displays what is currently
happening.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D[C][m][M][n|N][s]],
--debug[-crash|-maildir|-main|-net|-net-all|-sync] <br>
Enable debugging categories: <br>
C, crash - use built-in crash handler <br>
m, maildir - print maildir debug info <br>
M, main - print main debug info <br>
n, net - print network traffic (protocol only) <br>
N, net-all - print network traffic (including payloads) <br>
s, sync - print synchronization debug info <br>
All categories except crash implictly enable verbose mode.
Without category specification, all categories except
net-all are enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Suppress progress counters (this is implicit if stdout is no
TTY, or any debugging categories are enabled) and notices.
If specified twice, suppress warning messages as <br>
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
The configuration file is mandatory; mbsync will not run
without it. Lines starting with a hash mark (#) are comments
and are ignored entirely. Configuration items are keywords
<br>
followed by one or more arguments; arguments containing
spaces must be enclosed in double quotes (&quot;), and
literal double quotes and backslashes ( must be
backslash-escaped. <br>
All keywords (including those used as arguments) are
case-insensitive. Bash-like home directory expansion using
the tilde (~) is supported in all options which represent
local <br>
paths. There are a few global options, the rest applies to
particular sections. Sections are started by a section
keyword and are terminated by an empty line or end of file.
<br>
Every section defines an object with an identifier unique
within that object class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two basic object
classes: Stores and Channels. A Store defines a collection
of mailboxes; basically a folder, either local or remote. A
Channel connects two Stores, <br>
describing the way the two are synchronized. <br>
There are two auxiliary object classes: Accounts and Groups.
An Account describes the connection part of remote Stores,
so a server connection can be shared between multiple <br>
Stores. A Group aggregates multiple Channels to save typing
on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File system locations (in
particular, Path and Inbox) use the Store&rsquo;s internal
path separators, which may be slashes, periods, etc., or
even combinations thereof. <br>
Mailbox names, OTOH, always use canonical path separators,
which are Unix-like forward slashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All Stores <br>
These options can be used in all supported Store types. <br>
In this context, the term &quot;remote&quot; describes the
second Store within a Channel, and not necessarily a remote
server. <br>
The special mailbox INBOX exists in every Store; its
physical location in the file system is Store type
specific.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Path path <br>
The location of the Store in the (server&rsquo;s) file
system. If this is no absolute path, the reference point is
Store type specific. This string is prepended to the mailbox
<br>
names addressed in this Store, but is not considered part of
them; this is important for Patterns in the Channels
section. Note that you must append a slash if you want <br>
to specify an entire directory. (Default: none)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MaxSize size[k|m][b] <br>
Messages larger than that will not be propagated into this
Store. This is useful for weeding out messages with large
attachments. K and M can be appended to the size to <br>
specify KiBytes resp. MeBytes instead of bytes. B is
accepted but superfluous. If size is 0, the maximum message
size is unlimited. (Default: 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MapInbox mailbox <br>
Create a virtual mailbox (relative to Path) which aliases
the INBOX. Makes sense in conjunction with Patterns in the
Channels section, though with a Maildir slave, you <br>
probably want to place Inbox under Path instead. This
virtual mailbox does not support subfolders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flatten delim <br>
Flatten the hierarchy within this Store by substituting the
canonical hierarchy delimiter / with delim. This can be
useful when the MUA used to access the Store provides <br>
suboptimal handling of hierarchical mailboxes, as is the
case with Mutt. A common choice for the delimiter is .. <br>
Note that flattened sub-folders of the INBOX always end up
under Path, including the &quot;INBOXdelim&quot; prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trash mailbox <br>
Specifies a mailbox (relative to Path) to copy deleted
messages to prior to expunging. See RECOMMENDATIONS and
INHERENT PROBLEMS below. (Default: none)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TrashNewOnly yes|no <br>
When trashing, copy only not yet propagated messages. This
makes sense if the remote Store has a Trash as well (with
TrashNewOnly no). (Default: no)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TrashRemoteNew yes|no <br>
When expunging the remote Store, copy not yet propagated
messages to this Store&rsquo;s Trash. When using this, the
remote Store does not need an own Trash at all, yet all
mes&acirc; <br>
sages are archived. (Default: no)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Maildir Stores <br>
The reference point for relative Paths is the current
working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As mbsync needs UIDs, but no
standardized UID storage scheme exists for Maildir, mbsync
supports two schemes, each with its pros and cons. <br>
The native scheme is stolen from the latest Maildir patches
to c-client and is therefore compatible with pine. The UID
validity is stored in a file named .uidvalidity; the UIDs
<br>
are encoded in the file names of the messages. <br>
The alternative scheme is based on the UID mapping used by
isync versions 0.8 and 0.9.x. The invariant parts of the
file names of the messages are used as keys into a Berkeley
<br>
database named .isyncuidmap.db, which holds the UID validity
as well. <br>
The native scheme is faster, more space efficient,
endianness independent and &quot;human readable&quot;, but
will be disrupted if a message is copied from another
mailbox without getting <br>
a new file name; this would result in duplicated UIDs sooner
or later, which in turn results in a UID validity change,
making synchronization fail. The alternative scheme would
<br>
fail if a MUA changed a message&rsquo;s file name in a part
mbsync considers invariant; this would be interpreted as a
message deletion and a new message, resulting in unnecessary
<br>
traffic. <br>
Mutt is known to work fine with both schemes. <br>
Use mdconvert to convert mailboxes from one scheme to the
other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MaildirStore name <br>
Define the Maildir Store name, opening a section for its
parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AltMap yes|no <br>
Use the alternative UID storage scheme for mailboxes in this
Store. This does not affect mailboxes that do already have a
UID storage scheme; use mdconvert to change it. <br>
(Default: no)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inbox path <br>
The location of the INBOX. This is not relative to Path, but
it is allowed to place the INBOX inside the Path. (Default:
~/Maildir)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">InfoDelimiter delim <br>
The character used to delimit the info field from a
message&rsquo;s basename. The Maildir standard defines this
to be the colon, but this is incompatible with DOS/Windows
file <br>
systems. (Default: the value of FieldDelimiter)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMAP4 Accounts <br>
IMAPAccount name <br>
Define the IMAP4 Account name, opening a section for its
parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Host host <br>
Specify the DNS name or IP address of the IMAP server. <br>
If Tunnel is used, this setting is needed only if SSLType is
not None and CertificateFile is not used, in which case the
host name is used for certificate subject verifi&acirc; <br>
cation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Port port <br>
Specify the TCP port number of the IMAP server. (Default:
143 for IMAP, 993 for IMAPS) <br>
If Tunnel is used, this setting is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User username <br>
Specify the login name on the IMAP server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pass password <br>
Specify the password for username on the IMAP server. Note
that this option is not required. If neither a password nor
a password command is specified in the configura&acirc; <br>
tion file, mbsync will prompt you for a password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PassCmd [+]command <br>
Specify a shell command to obtain a password rather than
specifying a password directly. This allows you to use
password files and agents. The command must produce <br>
exactly one line on stdout; the trailing newline is
optional. Prepend + to the command to indicate that it
produces TTY output (e.g., a decryption password prompt);
fail&acirc; <br>
ure to do so will merely produce messier output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tunnel command <br>
Specify a command to run to establish a connection rather
than opening a TCP socket. This allows you to run an IMAP
session over an SSH tunnel, for example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AuthMechs type ... <br>
The list of acceptable authentication mechanisms. In
addition to the mechanisms listed in the SASL registry (link
below), the legacy IMAP LOGIN mechanism is known. The <br>
wildcard * represents all mechanisms that are deemed secure
enough for the current SSLType setting. The actually used
mechanism is the most secure choice from the inter&acirc;
<br>
section of this list, the list supplied by the server, and
the installed SASL modules. (Default: *)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSLType {None|STARTTLS|IMAPS}
<br>
Select the connection security/encryption method: <br>
None - no security. This is the default when Tunnel is set,
as tunnels are usually secure. <br>
STARTTLS - security is established via the STARTTLS
extension after connecting the regular IMAP port 143. Most
servers support this, so it is the default (unless a tunnel
<br>
is used). <br>
IMAPS - security is established by starting SSL/TLS
negotiation right after connecting the secure IMAP port
993.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSLVersions [SSLv2] [SSLv3]
[TLSv1] [TLSv1.1] [TLSv1.2] <br>
Select the acceptable SSL/TLS versions. Use of SSLv2 is
strongly discouraged for security reasons, but might be the
only option on some very old servers. Generally, the <br>
newest TLS version is recommended, but as this confuses some
servers, TLSv1 is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SystemCertificates yes|no <br>
Whether the system&rsquo;s default root cerificate store
should be loaded. (Default: yes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CertificateFile path <br>
File containing additional X.509 certificates used to verify
server identities. Directly matched peer certificates are
always trusted, regardless of validity. <br>
Note that the system&rsquo;s default certificate store is
always used (unless SystemCertificates is disabled) and
should not be specified here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PipelineDepth depth <br>
Maximum number of IMAP commands which can be simultaneously
in flight. Setting this to 1 disables pipelining. This is
mostly a debugging only option. (Default: unlim&acirc; <br>
ited)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMAP Stores <br>
The reference point for relative Paths is whatever the
server likes it to be; probably the user&rsquo;s $HOME or
$HOME/Mail on that server. The location of INBOX is up to
the server as <br>
well and is usually irrelevant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMAPStore name <br>
Define the IMAP4 Store name, opening a section for its
parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Account account <br>
Specify which IMAP4 Account to use. Instead of defining an
Account and referencing it here, it is also possible to
specify all the Account options directly in the
Store&rsquo;s <br>
section - this makes sense if an Account is used for one
Store only anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseNamespace yes|no <br>
Selects whether the server&rsquo;s first
&quot;personal&quot; NAMESPACE should be prefixed to mailbox
names. Disabling this makes sense for some broken IMAP
servers. This option is mean&acirc; <br>
ingless if a Path was specified. (Default: yes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PathDelimiter delim <br>
Specify the server&rsquo;s hierarchy delimiter. (Default:
taken from the server&rsquo;s first &quot;personal&quot;
NAMESPACE) <br>
Do not abuse this to re-interpret the hierarchy. Use Flatten
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Channels <br>
Channel name <br>
Define the Channel name, opening a section for its
parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{Master|Slave} :store:[mailbox]
<br>
Specify the Master resp. Slave Store to be connected by this
Channel. If Patterns are specified, mailbox is interpreted
as a prefix which is not matched against the pat&acirc; <br>
terns, and which is not affected by mailbox list overrides.
Otherwise, if mailbox is omitted, INBOX is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pattern[s] [!]pattern ... <br>
Instead of synchronizing only one mailbox pair, synchronize
all mailboxes that match the pattern(s). The mailbox names
are the same on both Master and Slave. Patterns are <br>
IMAP4 patterns, i.e., * matches anything and % matches
anything up to the next hierarchy delimiter. Prepending ! to
a pattern makes it an exclusion. Multiple patterns can <br>
be specified (either by supplying multiple arguments or by
using Pattern multiple times); later matches take
precedence. <br>
Note that INBOX is not matched by wildcards, unless it lives
under Path. <br>
The mailbox list selected by Patterns can be overridden by a
mailbox list in a channel reference (a Group specification
or the command line). <br>
Example: &quot;Patterns % !Trash&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MaxSize size[k|m][b] <br>
Analogous to the homonymous option in the Stores section,
but applies equally to Master and Slave. Note that this
actually modifies the Stores, so take care not to provide
<br>
conflicting settings if you use the Stores in multiple
Channels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MaxMessages count <br>
Sets the maximum number of messages to keep in each Slave
mailbox. This is useful for mailboxes where you keep a
complete archive on the server, but want to mirror only <br>
the last messages (for instance, for mailing lists). The
messages that were the first to arrive in the mailbox
(independently of the actual date of the message) will be
<br>
deleted first. Messages that are flagged (marked as
important) and (by default) unread messages will not be
automatically deleted. If count is 0, the maximum number of
<br>
messages is unlimited (Default: 0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ExpireUnread yes|no <br>
Selects whether unread messages should be affected by
MaxMessages. Normally, unread messages are considered
important and thus never expired. This ensures that you
never <br>
miss new messages even after an extended absence. However,
if your archive contains large amounts of unread messages by
design, treating them as important would practi&acirc; <br>
cally defeat MaxMessages. In this case you need to enable
this option. (Default: no).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sync {None|[Pull] [Push] [New]
[ReNew] [Delete] [Flags]|All} <br>
Select the synchronization operation(s) to perform: <br>
Pull - propagate changes from Master to Slave. <br>
Push - propagate changes from Slave to Master. <br>
New - propagate newly appeared messages. <br>
ReNew - previously refused messages are re-evaluated for
propagation. Useful after flagging affected messages in the
source Store or enlarging MaxSize in the destination <br>
Store. <br>
Delete - propagate message deletions. This applies only to
messages that are actually gone, i.e., were expunged. The
affected messages in the remote Store are marked as <br>
deleted only, i.e., they won&rsquo;t be really deleted until
that Store is expunged. <br>
Flags - propagate flag changes. Note that Deleted/Trashed is
a flag as well; this is particularly interesting if you use
mutt with the maildir_trash option. <br>
All (--full on the command line) - all of the above. This is
the global default. <br>
None (--noop on the command line) - don&rsquo;t propagate
anything. Useful if you want to expunge only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pull and Push are direction
flags, while New, ReNew, Delete and Flags are type flags.
The two flag classes make up a two-dimensional matrix (a
table). Its cells are the <br>
individual actions to perform. There are two styles of
asserting the cells: <br>
In the first style, the flags select entire rows/colums in
the matrix. Only the cells which are selected both
horizontally and vertically are asserted. Specifying no <br>
flags from a class is like specifying all flags from this
class. For example, &quot;Sync Pull New Flags&quot; will
propagate new messages and flag changes from the Master to
the <br>
Slave, &quot;Sync New Delete&quot; will propagate message
arrivals and deletions both ways, and &quot;Sync Push&quot;
will propagate all changes from the Slave to the Master.
<br>
In the second style, direction flags are concatenated with
type flags; every compound flag immediately asserts a cell
in the matrix. In addition to at least one compound <br>
flag, the individual flags can be used as well, but as
opposed to the first style, they immediately assert all
cells in their respective row/column. For example, <br>
&quot;Sync PullNew PullDelete Push&quot; will propagate
message arrivals and deletions from the Master to the Slave
and any changes from the Slave to the Master. Note that it
is <br>
not allowed to assert a cell in two ways, e.g. &quot;Sync
PullNew Pull&quot; and &quot;Sync PullNew Delete Push&quot;
induce error messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create {None|Master|Slave|Both}
<br>
Automatically create missing mailboxes [on the
Master/Slave]. Otherwise print an error message and skip
that mailbox pair if a mailbox and the corresponding sync
state <br>
does not exist. (Global default: None)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove {None|Master|Slave|Both}
<br>
Propagate mailbox deletions [to the Master/Slave]. Otherwise
print an error message and skip that mailbox pair if a
mailbox does not exist but the corresponding sync <br>
state does. <br>
For MailDir mailboxes it is sufficient to delete the cur/
subdirectory to mark them as deleted. This ensures
compatibility with SyncState *. <br>
Note that for safety, non-empty mailboxes are never deleted.
<br>
(Global default: None)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expunge {None|Master|Slave|Both}
<br>
Permanently remove all messages [on the Master/Slave] marked
for deletion. See RECOMMENDATIONS below. (Global default:
None)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CopyArrivalDate {yes|no} <br>
Selects whether their arrival time should be propagated
together with the messages. Enabling this makes sense in
order to keep the time stamp based message sorting <br>
intact. Note that IMAP does not guarantee that the time
stamp (termed internal date) is actually the arrival time,
but it is usually close enough. (Default: no)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sync, Create, Remove, Expunge,
MaxMessages, and CopyArrivalDate can be used before any
section for a global effect. The global settings are
overridden by Channel-specific <br>
options, which in turn are overridden by command line
switches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SyncState {*|path} <br>
Set the location of this Channel&rsquo;s synchronization
state files. * means that the state should be saved in a
file named .mbsyncstate in the Slave mailbox itself; this
has <br>
the advantage that you needn&rsquo;t to care for the state
file if you delete the mailbox, but it works only with
Maildir mailboxes, obviously. Otherwise this is interpreted
as <br>
a string to prepend to the Slave mailbox name to make up a
complete path. <br>
This option can be used outside any section for a global
effect. In this case the appended string is made up
according to the pattern :master:master-box_:slave:slave-box
<br>
(see also FieldDelimiter below). <br>
(Global default: ~/.mbsync/).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Groups <br>
Group name [channel[:box[,...]]] ... <br>
Define the Group name, opening a section for its parameters.
Note that even though Groups have an own namespace, they
will &quot;hide&quot; Channels with the same name on the
com&acirc; <br>
mand line. <br>
One or more Channels can be specified on the same line. <br>
If you supply one or more boxes to a channel, they will be
used instead of what is specified in the Channel&rsquo;s
Patterns. The same can be done on the command line, except
<br>
that there newlines can be used as mailbox name separators
as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Channel[s] channel[:box[,...]]
... <br>
Add the specified channels to the group. This option can be
specified multiple times within a Group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Global Options <br>
FSync yes|no <br>
Selects whether mbsync performs forced flushing, which
determines the level of data safety after system crashes and
power outages. Disabling it is reasonably safe for <br>
file systems which are mounted with data=ordered mode.
Enabling it is a wise choice for file systems mounted with
data=writeback, in particular modern systems like ext4, <br>
btrfs and xfs. The performance impact on older file systems
may be disproportionate. (Default: yes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FieldDelimiter delim <br>
The character to use to delimit fields in the string
appended to a global SyncState. mbsync prefers to use the
colon, but this is incompatible with DOS/Windows file
sys&acirc; <br>
tems. This option is meaningless for SyncState if the latter
is *, obviously. However, it also determines the default of
InfoDelimiter. (Global default: ; on Windows, : <br>
everywhere else)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BufferLimit size[k|m][b] <br>
The per-Channel, per-direction instantaneous memory usage
above which mbsync will refrain from using more memory. Note
that this is no absolute limit, as even a single <br>
message can consume more memory than this. (Default:
10M)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSOLE OUTPUT <br>
If mbsync&rsquo;s output is connected to a console, it will
print progress counters by default. The output will look
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C: 1/2 B: 3/4 M: +13/13 *23/42
#0/0 S: +0/7 *0/0 #0/0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This represents the cumulative
progress over channels, boxes, and messages affected on
master and slave, respectively. The message counts represent
added messages, messages with <br>
updated flags, and trashed messages, respectively. No
attempt is made to calculate the totals in advance, so they
grow over time as more information is gathered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RECOMMENDATIONS <br>
Make sure your IMAP server does not auto-expunge deleted
messages - it is slow, and semantically somewhat
questionable. Specifically, Gmail needs to be configured not
to do it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, mbsync will not
delete any messages - deletions are propagated by marking
the messages as deleted on the remote store. Once you have
verified that your setup works, <br>
you will typically want to set Expunge to Both, so that
deletions become effective.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mbsync&rsquo;s built-in trash
functionality relies on mbsync doing the expunging of
deleted messages. This is the case when it propagates
deletions of previously propagated messages, <br>
and the trash is on the target store (typically your IMAP
server). <br>
However, when you intend mbsync to trash messages which were
not propagated yet, the MUA must mark the messages as
deleted without expunging them (e.g., Mutt&rsquo;s
maildir_trash <br>
option). Note that most messages are propagated a long time
before they are deleted, so this is a corner case you
probably do not want to optimize for. This also implies that
the <br>
TrashNewOnly and TrashRemoteNew options are typically not
very useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your server supports
auto-trashing (as Gmail does), it is probably a good idea to
rely on that instead of mbsync&rsquo;s trash functionality.
If you do that, and intend to synchro&acirc; <br>
nize the trash like other mailboxes, you should not use
mbsync&rsquo;s Trash option at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INHERENT PROBLEMS <br>
Changes done after mbsync has retrieved the message list
will not be synchronised until the next time mbsync is
invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using Trash on IMAP Stores
without the UIDPLUS extension (notably, M$ Exchange up to at
least 2010) bears a race condition: messages will be lost if
they are marked as deleted <br>
after the message list was retrieved but before the mailbox
is expunged. There is no risk as long as the IMAP mailbox is
accessed by only one client (including mbsync) at a <br>
time.</p>
