<p>mdoc-update(1) General Commands Manual
mdoc-update(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mdoc update - mdoc(5) documentation format support</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mdoc update [OPTIONS]* ASSEMBLIES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mdoc update is responsible for the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Creating documentation stubs
based on ASSEMBLIES. The stub-creation process will create
new mdoc(5) XML files for each type within ASSEMBLIES, and
provide documentation <br>
stubs for each member of those types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Update documentation stubs
based on ASSEMBLIES. Existing mdoc(5) documentation can be
updated to reflect changes within ASSEMBLIES, such as added
types and members, while <br>
preserving existing documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some limited circumstances,
renames will be tracked, minimizing the documentation burden
when e.g. a parameter is renamed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mdoc update does not rely on
documentation found within source code, though it can import
XML Documentation Comments via the -i option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See mdoc(1) and mdoc(5) for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--delete <br>
Allow mdoc update to delete members from documentation
files. The only members deleted are members which are no
longer present within ASSEMBLIES and are not present in <br>
any other assembly versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a type is no longer present,
the documentation file is not deleted, but is instead
renamed to have a .remove extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version detection is done with
the //AssemblyVersion elements; if there are no
//AssemblyVersion elements for a given &lt;Type&gt; or
&lt;Member/&gt;, then the &lt;Type&gt; will be renamed <br>
and/or the &lt;Member/&gt; will be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exceptions[=SOURCES] <br>
EXPERIMENTAL. This is not 100% reliable, but is intended to
serve as an aid for documentation writers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inspect member bodies to
determine what exceptions can be generated from the
member.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOURCES is an optional
comma-separated list of the following sources that should be
searched for exceptions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">added Only generate
&lt;exception/&gt; elements for members <br>
added during the current program execution. <br>
This keeps mdoc-update from re-generating <br>
&lt;exception/&gt; elements for all members (and thus <br>
prevents re-insertion for members that had the <br>
&lt;exception/&gt; elements removed). <br>
all Find exceptions created in the member itself, <br>
references to members in the same assembly, <br>
and references to members in dependent <br>
assemblies. <br>
asm Find exceptions created in the member itself and <br>
references to members within the same assembly <br>
as the member. <br>
depasm Find exceptions created in the member itself and <br>
references to members within dependent <br>
assemblies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If SOURCES isn&rsquo;t provided
(the default), then only exceptions created within the
member itself will be documented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS: Exception searching
is currently implemented by looking for the exception types
that are explicitly created based on the known compile-time
types. This has <br>
the following limitations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* This will not find exceptions
which are implicit to the IL, such as NullReferenceException
and IndexOutOfRangeException.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* This will find exceptions
which are not thrown, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">public void CreateAnException ()
<br>
{ <br>
Exception e = new Exception (); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* This will not
&quot;follow&quot; delegate and interface calls:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">public void UsesDelegates ()
<br>
{ <br>
Func&lt;int, int&gt; a = x =&gt; {throw new Exception ();};
<br>
a (4); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The function UsesDelegates()
won&rsquo;t have any exceptions documented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* This will find exceptions
which &quot;cannot happen&quot;, such as
ArgumentNullExceptions for arguments which are
&quot;known&quot; to be non-null:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">public void A () <br>
{ <br>
B (&quot;this parameter isn&rsquo;t null&quot;); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">public void B (string s) <br>
{ <br>
if (s == null) <br>
throw new ArgumentNullException (&quot;s&quot;); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the above, if
--exceptions=asm is provided then A() will be documented as
throwing an ArgumentNullException, which cannot happen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f=FLAG <br>
Specify a flag to alter behavior. Valid flags include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no-assembly-versions <br>
See the -fno-assembly-versions documentation, below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-assembly-versions <br>
Do not generate /Type/AssemblyInfo/AssemblyVersion and
/Type/Members/Member/AssemblyInfo elements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is useful to prevent
&quot;churn&quot; during updates. Normally, if a type or
member hasn&rsquo;t changed but the assembly version has
changed, then all types and members will be <br>
updated to include a new //AssemblyVersion element, thus
increasing the amount of changes that need review before
committing (assuming all changes are actually reviewed <br>
before commit).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: This will interact
badly with the --delete option, as --delete uses the
//AssemblyVersion elements to track version changes. Thus,
if you have a member which is <br>
present in an early assembly version and is removed in a
subsequent assembly version, such as
System.Text.UTF8Encoding.GetBytes(string) (which is present
in .NET 1.0 but <br>
not in .NET 2.0), then the member will be removed when the
--delete -fno-assembly-versions options are specified, the
member was present in an earlier version of the <br>
assembly, and the current version of the assembly does not
contain the member.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consequently, this option should
only be specified if types and members will never be removed
from an assembly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --import=FILE <br>
Import documentation found within FILE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE may contain either csc /doc
XML or ECMA-335 XML.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --lib=DIRECTORY <br>
Add DIRECTORY to the assembly search path, so that
dependencies of ASSEMBLIES can be found without documenting
those assemblies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --out=DIRECTORY <br>
Place the generated stubs into DIRECTORY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When updating documentation,
DIRECTORY is also the source directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r=ASSEMBLY <br>
ASSEMBLY is a dependency for one of ASSEMBLIES which should
not be documented but is required to process one of
ASSEMBLIES. Add the directory containing ASSEMBLY to the
<br>
assembly search path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is equivalent to
specifying -L &lsquo;dirname ASSEMBLY&lsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--since=VERSION <br>
When updating documentation for an assembly, if a type or
member is encountered which didn&rsquo;t exist in the
previous version of the assembly a &lt;since
version=&quot;VERSION&quot;/&gt; <br>
element will be inserted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--type=TYPE <br>
Only update documentation for the type TYPE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, -?, --help <br>
Display a help message and exit.</p>
