<p>PMLOGGER_CHECK(1) General Commands Manual
PMLOGGER_CHECK(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmlogger_check, pmlogger_daily, pmlogger_merge -
administration of Performance Co-Pilot archive log files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmlogger_check [-CNsTV] [-c control] [-l
logfile] <br>
$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmlogger_daily [-NorV] [-c control] [-k
discard] [-l logfile] [-m addresses] [-s size] [-t want] [-x
compress] [-X program] [-Y regex] <br>
$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmlogger_merge [-fNV] [input-basename ...
output-name]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This series of shell scripts and associated control files
may be used to create a customized regime of administration
and management for Performance Co-Pilot (see PCPintro(1))
<br>
archive log files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmlogger_daily is intended to be
run once per day, preferably in the early morning, as soon
after midnight as practicable. Its task is to aggregate and
rotate one or more sets <br>
of PCP archives. After some period, old PCP archives are
discarded. This period is 14 days by default, but may be
changed using the -k option. Two special values are
recognized <br>
for the period (discard), namely 0 to keep no archives
beyond the current one, and forever to prevent any archives
being discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Archive data files can
optionally be compressed after some period to conserve disk
space. This is particularly useful for large numbers of
pmlogger processes under the control <br>
of pmlogger_check. By default no compression is done. The -x
option enables compression and specifies the number of days
after which to compress archive data files, and the -X <br>
option specifies the program to use for compression - by
default this is xz(1). Use of the -Y option allows a regular
expression to be specified causing files in the set of <br>
files matched for compression to be omitted - this allows
only the data file to be compressed, and also prevents the
program from attempting to compress it more than once. The
<br>
default regex is
&quot;.(meta|index|Z|gz|bz2|zip|xz|lzma|lzo|lz4)$&quot; -
such files are filtered using the -v option to egrep(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To accommodate the evolution of
PMDAs and changes in production logging environments,
pmlogger_daily is integrated with pmlogrewrite(1) to allow
optional and automatic rewriting <br>
of archives before merging. If there are global rewriting
rules to be applied across all archives mentioned in the
control file(s), then create the directory <br>
$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogrewrite and place any pmlogrewrite(1)
rewriting rules in this directory. For rewriting rules that
are specific to only one family of archives, use the <br>
directory name from the control file(s) - i.e. the fourth
field - and create a file, or a directory, or a symbolic
link named pmlogrewrite within this directory and place the
<br>
required rewriting rule(s) in the pmlogrewrite file or in
files within the pmlogrewrite subdirectory. pmlogger_daily
will choose rewriting rules from the archive directory if
<br>
they exist, else rewriting rules from
$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogrewrite if that directory exists, else
no rewriting is attempted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -r command line option acts
as an over-ride and prevents all archive rewriting with
pmlogrewrite(1) independent of the presence of any rewriting
rule files or directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default all possible archives
will be merged. The -o option reinstates the old behaviour
in which only yesterday&rsquo;s archives will be considered
as merge candidates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the special case where only a
single input archive needs to be merged, pmlogmv(1) is used
to rename the archive, rather than copy the input archive
using pmlogger_merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -M option may be used to
disable archive merging (or renaming) and rewriting (-M
implies -r). This is most useful in cases where the archives
are being incrementally copied <br>
to a remote repository, e.g. using rsync(1). Merging,
renaming and rewriting all risk an increase in the
synchronization load, especially immediately after
pmlogger_daily has <br>
run, so -M may be useful in these cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To assist with debugging or
diagnosing intermittent failures the -t option may be used.
This will turn on very verbose tracing (-VV) and capture the
trace output in a file named <br>
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/daily.datestamp.trace, where datestamp
is the time pmlogger_daily was run in the format
YYYYMMDD.HH.MM. In addition, the want argument will ensure
that <br>
trace files created with -t will be kept for want days and
then discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, if the PCP
&lsquo;&lsquo;notices&rsquo;&rsquo; file
($PCP_LOG_DIR/NOTICES) is larger than 20480 bytes,
pmlogger_daily will rename the file with a
&lsquo;&lsquo;.old&rsquo;&rsquo; suffix, and start a new
<br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;notices&rsquo;&rsquo; file. The rotate
threshold may be changed from 20480 to size bytes using the
-s option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of the -m option causes
pmlogger_daily to construct a summary of the
&lsquo;&lsquo;notices&rsquo;&rsquo; file entries which were
generated in the last 24 hours, and e-mail that summary to
the set of <br>
space-separated addresses. This daily summary is stored in
the file $PCP_LOG_DIR/NOTICES.daily, which will be empty
when no new &lsquo;&lsquo;notices&rsquo;&rsquo; entries were
made in the previous 24 <br>
hour period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The script
$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmlogger_daily could be copied and modified
to implement a site-specific procedure for end-of-week
and/or end-of-month management for a set of PCP ar&acirc;
<br>
chives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmlogger_check may be run at any
time, and is intended to check that the desired set of
pmlogger(1) processes are running, and if not to re-launch
any failed loggers. Use of the <br>
-s option provides the reverse functionality, allowing the
set of pmlogger processes to be cleanly shutdown. Use of the
-C option queries the system service runlevel information
<br>
for pmlogger, and uses that to determine whether to start
processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -T option provides a terser
form of output for pmlogger_check that is most suitable for
a pmlogger &lsquo;&lsquo;farm&rsquo;&rsquo; where many
instances of pmlogger are expected to be running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmlogger_merge is a wrapper
script for pmlogextract(1) that merges all of the archive
logs matching the input-basename arguments, and creates a
new archive using output-name as <br>
the base name for the physical files that constitute an
archive log. The input-basename arguments may contain meta
characters in the style of sh(1). If specified, the -f
option <br>
causes all of the input files to be removed once the output
archive has been created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmlogger_merge is used by
pmlogger_daily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both pmlogger_daily and
pmlogger_check are controlled by PCP logger control file(s)
that specifies the pmlogger instances to be managed. The
default control file is $PCP_PMLOG&acirc; <br>
GERCONTROL_PATH, but an alternate may be specified using the
-c option. If the directory $PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH.d (or
control.d from the -c option) exists, then the contents <br>
of any additional control files therein will be appended to
the main control file (which must exist).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: The
$PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH and $PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH.d
files must not be writable by any user other than root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The control file(s) should be
customized according to the following rules that define for
the current version (1.1) of the control file format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Lines beginning with a
&lsquo;&lsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo; are comments. <br>
2. Lines beginning with a &lsquo;&lsquo;$&rsquo;&rsquo; are
assumed to be assignments to environment variables in the
style of sh(1), and all text following the
&lsquo;&lsquo;$&rsquo;&rsquo; will be eval&rsquo;ed by the
script <br>
reading the control file, and the corresponding variable
exported into the environment. This is particularly useful
to set and export variables into the environment of the <br>
administrative scripts, e.g. <br>
$ PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=20 <br>
3. There must be a version line in the initial control file
of the form: <br>
$ version=1.1 <br>
4. There should be one line in the control file(s) for each
pmlogger instance of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host y|n y|n directory args</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Fields within a line of the
control file(s) are usually separated by one or more spaces
or tabs (although refer to the description of the directory
field for some important <br>
exceptions). <br>
6. The first field is the name of the host that is the
source of the performance metrics for this pmlogger
instance. <br>
7. The second field indicates if this is a primary pmlogger
instance (y) or not (n). Since the primary logger must run
on the local host, and there may be at most one primary <br>
logger for a particular host, this field can be y for at
most one pmlogger instance, in which case the host name must
be the name of the local host. <br>
8. The third field indicates if this pmlogger instance needs
to be started under the control of pmsocks(1) to connect to
a pmcd through a firewall (y or n). <br>
9. The fourth field is a directory name. All files
associated with this pmlogger instance will be created in
this directory, and this will be the current directory for
the exe&acirc; <br>
cution of any programs required in the maintenance of those
archives. A useful convention is that primary logger
archives for the local host with hostname myhost are
main&acirc; <br>
tained in the directory $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/myhost (this
is where the default pmlogger start-up script in
$PCP_RC_DIR/pcp will create the archives), while archives
for the <br>
remote host mumble are maintained in
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/mumble. <br>
10. The directory field may contain embedded shell syntax
that will be evaluated by sh(1) to produce the real
directory name to be used. The allowed constructs are: <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Any text (including white space) enclosed
with $( and ). <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Any text (including white space) enclosed
with &lsquo; and &lsquo; (back quotes). <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Any text (including white space) enclosed
with &quot; and &quot; (double quotes). <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Any word containing a $ (assumed to
introduce an environment variable name). <br>
11. All other fields are interpreted as arguments to be
passed to pmlogger(1) and/or pmnewlog(1). Most typically
this would be the -c option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sample control
lines specify a primary logger on the local host (bozo), and
non-primary loggers to collect and log performance metrics
from the hosts wobbly and <br>
boing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$version=1.1 <br>
bozo y n $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/bozo -c config.default <br>
wobbly n n &quot;/store/wobbly/$(date +%Y)&quot; -c
./wobbly.config <br>
boing n n $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/boing -c
./pmlogger.config</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typical crontab(5) entries for
periodic execution of pmlogger_daily and pmlogger_check are
given in $PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogger/crontab (unless installed
by default in /etc/cron.d <br>
already) and shown below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># daily processing of archive
logs <br>
14 0 * * * $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmlogger_daily <br>
# every 30 minutes, check pmlogger instances are running
<br>
25,55 * * * * $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmlogger_check</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to ensure that mail is
not unintentionally sent when these scripts are run from
cron(8) diagnostics are always sent to a log file. By
default, this file is <br>
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/pmlogger_daily.log or
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/pmlogger_check.log but this can be
changed using the -l option. If this log file already exists
when the script <br>
starts, it will be renamed with a .prev suffix (overwriting
any log file saved earlier) before diagnostics are generated
to the log file. The -l and -t options cannot be used <br>
together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output from the cron
execution of the scripts may be extended using the -V option
to the scripts which will enable verbose tracing of their
activity. By default the scripts <br>
generate no output unless some error or warning condition is
encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH <br>
the PCP logger control file <br>
Warning: this file must not be writable by any user other
than root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH.d <br>
optional directory containing additional PCP logger control
files, typically one per host <br>
Warning: the files herein must not be writable by any user
other than root.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogger/crontab
<br>
sample crontab for automated script execution by $PCP_USER
(or root). Exists only if the platform does not support the
/etc/cron.d mechanism.</p>

<br>
default location for archives of performance information
collected from the host hostname</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/hostname/lock
<br>
transient lock file to guarantee mutual exclusion during
pmlogger administration for the host hostname - if present,
can be safely removed if neither pmlogger_daily nor <br>
pmlogger_check are running</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/hostname/Latest

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
