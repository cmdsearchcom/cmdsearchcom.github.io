<p>PERL5201DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL5201DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5201delta - what is new for perl v5.20.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.20.0
release and the 5.20.1 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.18.0, first read perl5200delta,
which describes differences between 5.18.0 and 5.20.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.20.0.
If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit
a report. See &quot;Reporting Bugs&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Performance Enhancements <br>
&Acirc;&middot; An optimization to avoid problems with COW
and deliberately overallocated PVs has been disabled because
it interfered with another, more important, optimization,
causing a <br>
slowdown on some platforms. [perl #121975]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121975&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Returning a
string from a lexical variable could be slow in some cases.
This has now been fixed. [perl #121977]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121977&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
Updated Modules and Pragmata <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Config::Perl::V has been upgraded from
version 0.20 to 0.22.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list of Perl versions
covered has been updated and some flaws in the parsing have
been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Exporter has
been upgraded from version 5.70 to 5.71.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Illegal POD syntax in the
documentation has been corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
ExtUtils::CBuilder has been upgraded from version 0.280216
to 0.280217.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Android builds now link to both
-lperl and $Config::Config{perllibs}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; File::Copy has
been upgraded from version 2.29 to 2.30.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The documentation now notes that
&quot;copy&quot; will not overwrite read-only files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Module::CoreList
has been upgraded from version 3.11 to 5.020001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list of Perl versions
covered has been updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The PathTools
module collection has been upgraded from version 3.47 to
3.48.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fallbacks are now in place when
cross-compiling for Android and $Config::Config{sh} is not
yet defined. [perl #121963]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121963&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; PerlIO::via has
been upgraded from version 0.14 to 0.15.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A minor portability improvement

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Unicode::UCD has
been upgraded from version 0.57 to 0.58.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The documentation includes many
clarifications and fixes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; utf8 has been
upgraded from version 1.13 to 1.13_01.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The documentation has some minor
formatting improvements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; version has been
upgraded from version 0.9908 to 0.9909.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">External libraries and Perl may
have different ideas of what the locale is. This is
problematic when parsing version strings if the
locale&rsquo;s numeric separator has been <br>
changed. Version parsing has been patched to ensure it
handles the locales correctly. [perl #121930]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121930&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documentation <br>
Changes to Existing Documentation <br>
perlapi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;av_len&quot; - Emphasize that this returns the highest
index in the array, not the size of the array. [perl
#120386]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120386&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Note that
&quot;SvSetSV&quot; doesn&rsquo;t do set magic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;sv_usepvn_flags&quot; - Fix documentation to mention
the use of &quot;NewX&quot; instead of &quot;malloc&quot;.
[perl #121869]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121869&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Clarify where
&quot;NUL&quot; may be embedded or is required to terminate
a string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlfunc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Clarify the
meaning of &quot;-B&quot; and &quot;-T&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;-l&quot;
now notes that it will return false if symlinks aren&rsquo;t
supported by the file system. [perl #121523]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121523&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Note that
&quot;each&quot;, &quot;keys&quot; and &quot;values&quot;
may produce different orderings for tied hashes compared to
other perl hashes. [perl #121404] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121404&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Note that
&quot;exec LIST&quot; and &quot;system LIST&quot; may fall
back to the shell on Win32. Only &quot;exec PROGRAM
LIST&quot; and &quot;system PROGRAM LIST&quot; indirect
object syntax will reliably avoid <br>
using the shell. This has also been noted in perlport. [perl
#122046]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122046&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Clarify the
meaning of &quot;our&quot;. [perl #122132]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122132&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlguts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Explain various
ways of modifying an existing SV&rsquo;s buffer. [perl
#116925]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=116925&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlpolicy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; We now have a
code of conduct for the p5p mailing list, as documented in
&quot;STANDARDS OF CONDUCT&quot; in perlpolicy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlre</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;/x&quot; modifier has been clarified to note that
comments cannot be continued onto the next line by escaping
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlsyn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Mention the use
of empty conditionals in &quot;for&quot;/&quot;while&quot;
loops for infinite loops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlxs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Added a
discussion of locale issues in XS code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Diagnostics <br>
The following additions or changes have been made to
diagnostic output, including warnings and fatal error
messages. For the complete list of diagnostic messages, see
perldiag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes to Existing Diagnostics
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; Variable length lookbehind not implemented
in regex m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Information about Unicode
behaviour has been added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration and Compilation
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; Building Perl no longer writes to the source
tree when configured with Configure&rsquo;s -Dmksymlinks
option. [perl #121585]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121585&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Support <br>
Platform-Specific Notes <br>
Android <br>
Build support has been improved for cross-compiling in
general and for Android in particular.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpenBSD <br>
Corrected architectures and version numbers used in
configuration hints when building Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solaris <br>
c99 options have been cleaned up, hints look for solstudio
as well as SUNWspro, and support for native
&quot;setenv&quot; has been added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VMS An old bug in feature
checking, mainly affecting pre-7.3 systems, has been
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windows <br>
%I64d is now being used instead of %lld for MinGW.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internal Changes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Added &quot;sync_locale&quot; in perlapi.
Changing the program&rsquo;s locale should be avoided by XS
code. Nevertheless, certain non-Perl libraries called from
XS, such as &quot;Gtk&quot; do so. <br>
When this happens, Perl needs to be told that the locale has
changed. Use this function to do so, before returning to
Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; A bug has been fixed where zero-length
assertions and code blocks inside of a regex could cause
&quot;pos&quot; to see an incorrect value. [perl #122460]
<br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122460&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Using
&quot;s///e&quot; on tainted utf8 strings could issue bogus
&quot;Malformed UTF-8 character (unexpected end of
string)&quot; warnings. This has now been fixed. [perl
#122148] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122148&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;system&quot; and friends should now work properly on
more Android builds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to an oversight, the value
specified through -Dtargetsh to Configure would end up being
ignored by some of the build process. This caused perls
cross-compiled for <br>
Android to end up with defective versions of
&quot;system&quot;, &quot;exec&quot; and backticks: the
commands would end up looking for /bin/sh instead of
/system/bin/sh, and so would fail for <br>
the vast majority of devices, leaving $! as
&quot;ENOENT&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Many issues have
been detected by Coverity &lt;http://www.coverity.com/&gt;
and fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acknowledgements <br>
Perl 5.20.1 represents approximately 4 months of development
since Perl 5.20.0 and contains approximately 12,000 lines of
changes across 170 files from 36 authors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Excluding auto-generated files,
documentation and release tools, there were approximately
2,600 lines of changes to 110 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl continues to flourish into
its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and
developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that <br>
became Perl 5.20.1:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list above is almost
certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from
version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much <br>
appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl
bug tracker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the changes included in
this version originated in the CPAN modules included in
Perl&rsquo;s core. We&rsquo;re grateful to the entire CPAN
community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a more complete list of all
of Perl&rsquo;s historical contributors, please see the
AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at https://rt.perl.org/
. There <br>
may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl
Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the bug you are reporting has
security implications, which make it inappropriate to send
to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to
<br>
perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the
core committers, who will be able to help assess the impact
<br>
of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the
release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use <br>
this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for
modules independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
