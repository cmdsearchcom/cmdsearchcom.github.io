<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
r.proj projects a raster map in a specified mapset of a
specified location from the projection of the input location
to a raster map in the current location. The projection <br>
information is taken from the current PROJ_INFO files, as
set and viewed with g.proj.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Introduction <br>
Map projections <br>
Map projections are a method of representing information
from a curved surface (usually a spheroid) in two
dimensions, typically to allow indexing through cartesian
coordinates. <br>
There are a wide variety of projections, with common ones
divided into a number of classes, including cylindrical and
pseudo-cylindrical, conic and pseudo-conic, and azimuthal
<br>
methods, each of which may be conformal, equal-area, or
neither.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The particular projection chosen
depends on the purpose of the project, and the size, shape
and location of the area of interest. For example, normal
cylindrical projections are <br>
good for maps which are of greater extent east-west than
north-south and in equatorial regions, while conic
projections are better in mid-latitudes; transverse
cylindrical pro&acirc; <br>
jections are used for maps which are of greater extent
north-south than east-west; azimuthal projections are used
for polar regions. Oblique versions of any of these may also
be <br>
used. Conformal projections preserve angular relationships,
and better preserve arc-length, while equal-area projections
are more appropriate for statistical studies and work in
<br>
which the amount of material is important.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Projections are defined by
precise mathematical relations, so the method of projecting
coordinates from a geographic reference frame
(latitude-longitude) into a projected carte&acirc; <br>
sian reference frame (eg metres) is governed by these
equations. Inverse projections can also be achieved. The
public-domain Unix software package PROJ.4 [1] has been
designed <br>
to perform these transformations, and the user&acirc;s
manual contains a detailed description of over 100 useful
projections. This also includes a programmers library of the
projec&acirc; <br>
tion methods to support other software development.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus, converting a vector map -
in which objects are located with arbitrary spatial
precision - from one projection into another is usually
accomplished by a simple two-step <br>
process: first the location of all the points in the map are
converted from the source through an inverse projection into
latitude-longitude, and then through a forward projec&acirc;
<br>
tion into the target. (Of course the procedure will be
one-step if either the source or target is in geographic
coordinates.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Converting a raster map, or
image, between different projections, however, involves
additional considerations. A raster may be considered to
represent a sampling of a process at <br>
a regular, ordered set of locations. The set of locations
that lie at the intersections of a cartesian grid in one
projection will not, in general, coincide with the sample
<br>
points in another projection. Thus, the conversion of raster
maps involves an interpolation step in which the values of
points at intermediate locations relative to the source <br>
grid are estimated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Projecting vector maps within
the GRASS GIS <br>
GIS data capture, import and transfer often requires a
projection step, since the source or client will frequently
be in a different projection to the working projection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some cases it is convenient
to do the conversion outside the package, prior to import or
after export, using software such as PROJ.4&acirc;s cs2cs
[1]. This is an easy method for <br>
converting an ASCII file containing a list of coordinate
points, since there is no topology to be preserved and cs2cs
can be used to process simple lists using a one-line
com&acirc; <br>
mand. The m.proj module provides a handy front end to
cs2cs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vector maps is generally more
complex, as parts of the data stored in the files will
describe topology, and not just coordinates. In GRASS GIS
the v.proj module is provided to <br>
reproject vector maps, transferring topology and attributes
as well as node coordinates. This program uses the
projection definition and parameters which are stored in the
<br>
PROJ_INFO and PROJ_UNITS files in the PERMANENT mapset
directory for every GRASS location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Design of r.proj <br>
As discussed briefly above, the fundamental step in
re-projecting a raster is resampling the source grid at
locations corresponding to the intersections of a grid in
the target <br>
projection. The basic procedure for accomplishing this,
therefore, is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r.proj converts a map to a new
geographic projection. It reads a map from a different
location, projects it and write it out to the current
location. The projected data is resam&acirc; <br>
pled with one of four different methods: nearest neighbor,
bilinear, bicubic iterpolation or lanczos.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The method=nearest method, which
performs a nearest neighbor assignment, is the fastest of
the three resampling methods. It is primarily used for
categorical data such as a land <br>
use classification, since it will not change the values of
the data cells. The method=bilinear method determines the
new value of the cell based on a weighted distance average
of <br>
the 4 surrounding cells in the input map. The method=bicubic
method determines the new value of the cell based on a
weighted distance average of the 16 surrounding cells in the
<br>
input map. The method=lanzcos method determines the new
value of the cell based on a weighted distance average of
the 25 surrounding cells in the input map. Compared to
bicubic, <br>
lanczos puts a higher weight on cells close to the center
and a lower weight on cells away from the center, resulting
in slightly better contrast.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bilinear, bicubic and
lanczos interpolation methods are most appropriate for
continuous data and cause some smoothing. The amount of
smoothing decreases from bilinear to <br>
bicubic to lanczos. These options should not be used with
categorical data, since the cell values will be altered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the bilinear, bicubic and
lanczos methods, if any of the surrounding cells used to
interpolate the new cell value are null, the resulting cell
will be null, even if the near&acirc; <br>
est cell is not null. This will cause some thinning along
null borders, such as the coasts of land areas in a DEM. The
bilinear_f, bicubic_f and lanczos_f interpolation methods
<br>
can be used if thinning along null edges is not desired.
These methods &quot;fall back&quot; to simpler interpolation
methods along null borders. That is, from lanczos to bicubic
to <br>
bilinear to nearest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If nearest neighbor assignment
is used, the output map has the same raster format as the
input map. If any of the interpolations is used, the output
map is written as floating <br>
point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that, following normal
GRASS conventions, the coverage and resolution of the
resulting grid is set by the current region settings, which
may be adjusted using g.region. The <br>
target raster will be relatively unbiased for all cases if
its grid has a similar resolution to the source, so that the
resampling/interpolation step is only a local operation.
<br>
If the resolution is changed significantly, then the
behaviour of the generalisation or refinement will depend on
the model of the process being represented. This will be
very <br>
different for categorical versus numerical data. Note that
three methods for the local interpolation step are
provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r.proj supports general datum
transformations, making use of the PROJ.4 co-ordinate system
translation library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
If output is not specified it is set to be the same as input
map name. <br>
If mapset is not specified, its name is assumed to be the
same as the current mapset&acirc;s name. <br>
If dbase is not specified it is assumed to be the current
database. The user only has to specify dbase if the source
location is stored in another separate GRASS database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To avoid excessive time
consumption when reprojecting a map the region and
resolution of the target location should be set
appropriately beforehand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A simple way to do this is to
check the projected bounds of the input map in the current
location&acirc;s projection using the -p flag. The -g flag
reports the same thing, but in a <br>
form which can be directly cut and pasted into a g.region
command. After setting the region in that way you might
check the cell resolution with &quot;g.region -p&quot; then
snap it to a <br>
regular grid with g.region&acirc;s -a flag. E.g. g.region -a
res=5 -p. Note that this is just a rough guide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A more involved, but more
accurate, way to do this is to generate a vector
&quot;box&quot; map of the region in the source location
using v.in.region -d. This &quot;box&quot; map is then
repro&acirc; <br>
jected into the target location with v.proj. Next the region
in the target location is set to the extent of the new
vector map with g.region along with the desired raster
resolu&acirc; <br>
tion (g.region -m can be used in Latitude/Longitude
locations to measure the geodetic length of a pixel). r.proj
is then run for the raster map the user wants to reproject.
In <br>
this case a little preparation goes a long way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When reprojecting whole-world
maps the user should disable map-trimming with the -n flag.
Trimming is not useful here because the module has the whole
map in memory anyway. <br>
Besides that, world &quot;edges&quot; are hard (or
impossible) to find in projections other than
latitude-longitude so results may be odd with trimming.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Inline method <br>
With GRASS running in the destination location use the -g
flag to show the input map&acirc;s bounds once projected
into the current working projection, then use that to set
the region <br>
bounds before performing the reprojection: <br>
