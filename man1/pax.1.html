<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The pax utility shall read, write, and write lists of the
members of archive files and copy directory hierarchies. A
variety of archive formats shall be supported; see the -x
<br>
format option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The action to be taken depends
on the presence of the -r and -w options. The four
combinations of -r and -w are referred to as the four modes
of operation: list, read, write, and <br>
copy modes, corresponding respectively to the four forms
shown in the SYNOPSIS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list In list mode (when neither
-r nor -w are specified), pax shall write the names of the
members of the archive file read from the standard input,
with pathnames matching the <br>
specified patterns, to standard output. If a named file is
of type directory, the file hierarchy rooted at that file
shall be listed as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">read In read mode (when -r is
specified, but -w is not), pax shall extract the members of
the archive file read from the standard input, with
pathnames matching the specified <br>
patterns. If an extracted file is of type directory, the
file hierarchy rooted at that file shall be extracted as
well. The extracted files shall be created performing <br>
pathname resolution with the directory in which pax was
invoked as the current working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an attempt is made to extract
a directory when the directory already exists, this shall
not be considered an error. If an attempt is made to extract
a FIFO when the <br>
FIFO already exists, this shall not be considered an
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ownership, access, and
modification times, and file mode of the restored files are
discussed under the -p option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">write In write mode (when -w is
specified, but -r is not), pax shall write the contents of
the file operands to the standard output in an archive
format. If no file operands are <br>
specified, a list of files to copy, one per line, shall be
read from the standard input. A file of type directory shall
include all of the files in the file hierarchy <br>
rooted at the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copy In copy mode (when both -r
and -w are specified), pax shall copy the file operands to
the destination directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no file operands are
specified, a list of files to copy, one per line, shall be
read from the standard input. A file of type directory shall
include all of the files in <br>
the file hierarchy rooted at the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The effect of the copy shall be
as if the copied files were written to an archive file and
then subsequently extracted, except that there may be hard
links between the <br>
original and the copied files. If the destination directory
is a subdirectory of one of the files to be copied, the
results are unspecified. If the destination directory <br>
is a file of a type not defined by the System Interfaces
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, the results are
implementation-defined; otherwise, it shall be an error for
the <br>
file named by the directory operand not to exist, not be
writable by the user, or not be a file of type
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In read or copy modes, if
intermediate directories are necessary to extract an archive
member, pax shall perform actions equivalent to the mkdir()
function defined in the System <br>
Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, called with the
following arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The intermediate
directory used as the path argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The value of the
bitwise-inclusive OR of S_IRWXU, S_IRWXG, and S_IRWXO as the
mode argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any specified pattern or file
operands are not matched by at least one file or archive
member, pax shall write a diagnostic message to standard
error for each one that did not <br>
match and exit with a non-zero exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The archive formats described in
the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section shall be automatically
detected on input. The default output archive format shall
be implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The spax implementation defaults
to -x ustar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A single archive can span
multiple files. The pax utility shall determine, in an
implementation-defined manner, what file to read or write as
the next file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the selected archive format
supports the specification of linked files, it shall be an
error if these files cannot be linked when the archive is
extracted, except that if the <br>
files to be linked are symbolic links and the system is not
capable of making hard links to symbolic links, then
separate copies of the symbolic link shall be created
instead. <br>
For archive formats that do not store file contents with
each name that causes a hard link, if the file that contains
the data is not extracted during this pax session, either
<br>
the data shall be restored from the original file, or a
diagnostic message shall be displayed with the name of a
file that can be used to extract the data. In traversing
directo&acirc; <br>
ries, pax shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering a
previously visited directory that is an ancestor of the last
file visited. When it detects an infinite loop, pax shall
<br>
write a diagnostic message to standard error and shall
terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The pax utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines, except that the order of presentation of the -o,
<br>
-p, and -s options is significant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the &quot;OTHER
OPTIONS&quot; section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Read an archive file from
standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Write files to the standard
output in the specified archive format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Append files to the end of
the archive. It is implementation-defined which devices on
the system support appending. Additional file formats
unspecified by this volume of <br>
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 may impose restrictions on
appending.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b blocksize <br>
Block the output at a positive decimal integer number of
bytes per write to the archive file. Devices and archive
formats may impose restrictions on blocking. Blocking <br>
shall be automatically determined on input. Conforming
applications shall not specify a blocksize value larger than
32256. Default blocking when creating archives depends <br>
on the archive format. (See the -x option below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Match all file or archive
members except those specified by the pattern or file
operands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Cause files of type directory
being copied or archived or archive members of type
directory being extracted or listed to match only the file
or archive member itself and <br>
not the file hierarchy rooted at the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f archive <br>
Specify the pathname of the input or output archive,
overriding the default standard input (in list or read
modes) or standard output (write mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H If a symbolic link
referencing a file of type directory is specified on the
command line, pax shall archive the file hierarchy rooted in
the file referenced by the link, <br>
using the name of the link as the root of the file
hierarchy. Otherwise, if a symbolic link referencing a file
of any other file type which pax can normally archive is
<br>
specified on the command line, then pax shall archive the
file referenced by the link, using the name of the link. The
default behavior shall be to archive the symbolic <br>
link itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Interactively rename files or
archive members. For each archive member matching a pattern
operand or file matching a file operand, a prompt shall be
written to the file <br>
/dev/tty. The prompt shall contain the name of the file or
archive member, but the format is otherwise unspecified. A
line shall then be read from /dev/tty. If this line <br>
is blank, the file or archive member shall be skipped. If
this line consists of a single period, the file or archive
member shall be processed with no modification to its <br>
name. Otherwise, its name shall be replaced with the
contents of the line. The pax utility shall immediately exit
with a non-zero exit status if end-of-file is encountered
<br>
when reading a response or if /dev/tty cannot be opened for
reading and writing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The results of extracting a hard
link to a file that has been renamed during extraction are
unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Prevent the overwriting of
existing files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l (The letter ell.) In copy
mode, hard links shall be made between the source and
destination file hierarchies whenever possible. If specified
in conjunction with -H or -L, <br>
when a symbolic link is encountered, the hard link created
in the destination file hierarchy shall be to the file
referenced by the symbolic link. If specified when
nei&acirc; <br>
ther -H nor -L is specified, when a symbolic link is
encountered, the implementation shall create a hard link to
the symbolic link in the source file hierarchy or copy the
<br>
symbolic link to the destination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L If a symbolic link
referencing a file of type directory is specified on the
command line or encountered during the traversal of a file
hierarchy, pax shall archive the <br>
file hierarchy rooted in the file referenced by the link,
using the name of the link as the root of the file
hierarchy. Otherwise, if a symbolic link referencing a file
<br>
of any other file type which pax can normally archive is
specified on the command line or encountered during the
traversal of a file hierarchy, pax shall archive the file
<br>
referenced by the link, using the name of the link. The
default behavior shall be to archive the symbolic link
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Select the first archive
member that matches each pattern operand. No more than one
archive member shall be matched for each pattern (although
members of type directory <br>
shall still match the file hierarchy rooted at that
file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o options <br>
Provide information to the implementation to modify the
algorithm for extracting or writing files. The value of
options shall consist of one or more comma-separated
key&acirc; <br>
words of the form:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">keyword[[:]=value][,keyword[[:]=value],...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some keywords apply only to
certain file formats, as indicated with each description.
Use of keywords that are inapplicable to the file format
being processed produces <br>
undefined results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keywords in the options argument
shall be a string that would be a valid portable filename as
described in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section <br>
3.276, Portable Filename Character Set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Keywords are not expected
to be filenames, merely to follow the same character
composition rules as portable filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keywords can be preceded with
white space. The value field shall consist of zero or more
characters; within value, the application shall precede any
literal comma with a <br>
backslash, which shall be ignored, but preserves the comma
as part of value. A comma as the final character, or a comma
followed solely by white space as the final charac&acirc;
<br>
ters, in options shall be ignored. Multiple -o options can
be specified; if keywords given to these multiple -o options
conflict, the keywords and values appearing later <br>
in command line sequence shall take precedence and the
earlier shall be silently ignored. The following keyword
values of options shall be supported for the file formats
<br>
as indicated:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete=pattern <br>
(Applicable only to the -x pax format.) When used in write
or copy mode, pax shall omit from extended header records
that it produces any keywords matching the <br>
string pattern. When used in read or list mode, pax shall
ignore any keywords matching the string pattern in the
extended header records. In both cases, matching <br>
shall be performed using the pattern matching notation
described in Patterns Matching a Single Character and
Patterns Matching Multiple Characters. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o delete=security.*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would suppress security-related
information. See pax Extended Header for extended header
record keyword usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When multiple -o delete=pattern
options are specified, the patterns shall be additive; all
keywords matching the specified string patterns shall be
omitted from <br>
extended header records that pax produces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exthdr.name=string <br>
(Applicable only to the -x pax format.) This keyword allows
user control over the name that is written into the ustar
header blocks for the extended header produced <br>
under the circumstances described in pax Header Block. The
name shall be the contents of string, after the following
character substitutions have been made:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&not;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;

<br>
Any other &rsquo;%&rsquo; characters in string produce

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no -o globexthdr.name=string
is specified, pax shall use the following default value:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$TMPDIR/GlobalHead.%p.%n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where $TMPDIR represents the
value of the TMPDIR environment variable. If TMPDIR is not
set, pax shall use /tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invalid=action <br>
(Applicable only to the -x pax format.) This keyword allows
user control over the action pax takes upon encountering
values in an extended header record that, in <br>
read or copy mode, are invalid in the destination hierarchy
or, in list mode, cannot be written in the codeset and
current locale of the implementation. The follow&acirc; <br>
ing are invalid values that shall be recognized by pax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ In read or copy mode, a
filename or link name that contains character encodings
invalid in the destination hierarchy. (For example, the name
may contain <br>
embedded NULs.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ In read or copy mode, a
filename or link name that is longer than the maximum
allowed in the destination hierarchy (for either a pathname
component or the <br>
entire pathname).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ In list mode, any character
string value (filename, link name, user name, and so on)
that cannot be written in the codeset and current locale of
the imple&acirc; <br>
mentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following mutually-exclusive
values of the action argument are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bypass In read or copy mode, pax
shall bypass the file, causing no change to the destination
hierarchy. In list mode, pax shall write all requested valid
values for <br>
the file, but its method for writing invalid values is
unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rename In read or copy mode, pax
shall act as if the -i option were in effect for each file
with invalid filename or link name values, allowing the user
to provide <br>
a replacement name interactively. In list mode, pax shall
behave identically to the bypass action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UTF-8 When used in read, copy,
or list mode and a filename, link name, owner name, or any
other field in an extended header record cannot be
translated from the <br>
pax UTF-8 codeset format to the codeset and current locale
of the implementation, pax shall use the actual UTF-8
encoding for the name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">write In read or copy mode, pax
shall write the file, translating the name, regardless of
whether this may overwrite an existing file with a valid
name. In list <br>
mode, pax shall behave identically to the bypass action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no -o invalid=option is
specified, pax shall act as if -o invalid= bypass were
specified. Any overwriting of existing files that may be
allowed by the -o <br>
invalid= actions shall be subject to permission(-p) and
modification time (-u) restrictions, and shall be suppressed
if the -k option is also specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">linkdata <br>
(Applicable only to the -x pax format.) In write mode, pax
shall write the contents of a file to the archive even when
that file is merely a hard link to a file <br>
whose contents have already been written to the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">listopt=format <br>
This keyword specifies the output format of the table of
contents produced when the -v option is specified in list
mode. See List Mode Format Specifications. To <br>
avoid ambiguity, the listopt= format shall be the only or
final keyword= value pair in a -o option-argument; all
characters in the remainder of the option-argument <br>
shall be considered part of the format string. When multiple
-o listopt= format options are specified, the format strings
shall be considered a single, concatenated <br>
string, evaluated in command line order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">times (Applicable only to the -x
pax format.) When used in write or copy mode, pax shall
include atime and mtime extended header records for each
file. See pax Extended <br>
Header File Times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to these keywords,
if the -x pax format is specified, any of the keywords and
values defined in pax Extended Header, including
implementation extensions, can <br>
be used in -o option-arguments, in either of two modes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keyword=value <br>
When used in write or copy mode, these keyword/value pairs
shall be included at the beginning of the archive as
typeflag g global extended header records. When used <br>
in read or list mode, these keyword/value pairs shall act as
if they had been at the beginning of the archive as typeflag
g global extended header records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keyword:=value <br>
When used in write or copy mode, these keyword/value pairs
shall be included as records at the beginning of a typeflag
x extended header for each file. (This shall <br>
be equivalent to the equal-sign form except that it creates
no typeflag g global extended header records.) When used in
read or list mode, these keyword/value pairs <br>
shall act as if they were included as records at the end of
each extended header; thus, they shall override any global
or file-specific extended header record key&acirc; <br>
words of the same names. For example, in the command:</p>

characters a , e, m, o, and p. Other implementation-defined
characters can be included. Multiple characteristics <br>
can be concatenated within the same string and multiple -p
options can be specified. The meaning of the specification
characters are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a Do not preserve file access
times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e Preserve the user ID, group
ID, file mode bits (see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE

modification times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Preserve the user ID and group

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Preserve the file mode bits.
Other implementation-defined file mode attributes may be
preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the preceding list,
&quot;preserve&quot; indicates that an attribute stored in
the archive shall be given to the extracted file, subject to
the permissions of the invoking <br>
process. The access and modification times of the file shall
be preserved unless otherwise specified with the -p option
or not stored in the archive. All attributes that <br>
are not preserved shall be determined as part of the normal
file creation action (see File Read, Write, and
Creation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither the e nor the o

group ID are not preserved for any reason, pax shall not set
the S_ISUID and S_ISGID <br>
bits of the file mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the preservation of any of
these items fails for any reason, pax shall write a
diagnostic message to standard error. Failure to preserve
these items shall affect the <br>
final exit status, but shall not cause the extracted file to
be deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If file characteristic letters
in any of the string option-arguments are duplicated or
conflict with each other, the ones given last shall take
precedence. For example, if <br>
-p eme is specified, file modification times are
preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s replstr <br>
Modify file or archive member names named by pattern or file
operands according to the substitution expression replstr,
using the syntax of the ed utility. The concepts of <br>
&quot;address&quot; and &quot;line&quot; are meaningless in
the context of the pax utility, and shall not be supplied.

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s /old/new/[gp]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where as in ed, old is a basic
regular expression and new can contain an ampersand,

extracted if the archive member is newer than the file. In
write mode, an archive file member with the same name <br>
as a file in the file system shall be superseded if the file
is newer than the archive member. If -a is also specified,
this is accomplished by appending to the archive; <br>
otherwise, it is unspecified whether this is accomplished by
actual replacement in the archive or by appending to the

IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 5, File Format Notation, with
<br>
the exceptions 1. through 5. defined in the EXTENDED
DESCRIPTION section of printf(3), plus the following
exceptions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. The sequence (keyword) can

following keywords:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Any of the Field
Name entries in ustar Header Block and Octet-Oriented cpio
Archive Entry. The implementation may support the cpio
keywords without the leading c_ <br>

pax Interchange Format <br>
A pax archive tape or file produced in the -x pax format
shall contain a series of blocks. The physical layout of the

<br>
ustar Interchange Format. Each file archived shall be
represented by the following sequence:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; An optional
header block with extended header records. This header block
is of the form described in pax Header Block, with a
typeflag value of x or g. The <br>
extended header records, described in pax Extended Header,
shall be included as the data for this header block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A header block
that describes the file. Any fields in the preceding
optional extended header shall override the associated
fields in this header block for this <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Zero or more
blocks that contain the contents of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the end of the archive file
there shall be two 512-byte blocks filled with binary zeros,
interpreted as an end-of-archive indicator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x Represents extended header
records for the following file in the archive (which shall
have its own ustar header block). The format of these
extended header records shall <br>
be as described in pax Extended Header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g Represents global extended
header records for the following files in the archive. The
format of these extended header records shall be as
described in pax Extended Header. <br>
Each value shall affect all subsequent files that do not
override that value in their own extended header record and
until another global extended header record is reached <br>
that provides another value for the same field. The typeflag
g global headers should not be used with interchange media
that could suffer partial data loss in transporting <br>
the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For both of these types, the
size field shall be the size of the extended header records
in octets. The other fields in the header block are not
meaningful to this version of the <br>
pax utility. However, if this archive is read by a pax
utility conforming to the ISO POSIX-2:1993 standard, the
header block fields are used to create a regular file that
con&acirc; <br>
tains the extended header records as data. Therefore, header
block field values should be selected to provide reasonable
file access to this regular file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A further difference from the
ustar header block is that data blocks for files of typeflag
1 (the digit one) (hard link) may be included, which means
that the size field may be <br>
greater than zero. Archives created by pax -o linkdata shall
include these data blocks with the hard links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pax Extended Header <br>
A pax extended header contains values that are inappropriate
for the ustar header block because of limitations in that
format: fields requiring a character encoding other than
<br>
that described in the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard, fields
representing file attributes not described in the ustar
header, and fields whose format or length do not fit the
require&acirc; <br>
ments of the ustar header. The values in an extended header
add attributes to the following file (or files; see the
description of the typeflag g header block) or override
values <br>
in the following header block(s), as indicated in the
following list of keywords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An extended header shall consist
of one or more records, each constructed as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%d %s=%s0, &lt;length&gt;,
&lt;keyword&gt;, &lt;value&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The extended header records
shall be encoded according to the ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000
standard (UTF-8). The &lt;length&gt; field, &lt;blank&gt;,
equals sign, and &lt;newline&gt; shown shall be lim&acirc;
<br>
ited to the portable character set, as encoded in UTF-8. The
&lt;keyword&gt; and &lt;value&gt; fields can be any UTF-8
characters. The &lt;length&gt; field shall be the decimal
length of the <br>
extended header record in octets, including the trailing
&lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;keyword&gt; field shall
be one of the entries from the following list or a keyword
provided as an implementation extension. Keywords consisting
entirely of lowercase letters, <br>
digits, and periods are reserved for future standardization.
A keyword shall not include an equals sign. (In the
following list, the notations &quot;file(s)&quot; or
&quot;block(s)&quot; is used to <br>
acknowledge that a keyword affects the following single file
after a typeflag x extended header, but possibly multiple
files after typeflag g. Any requirements in the list for
<br>
pax to include a record when in write or copy mode shall
apply only when such a record has not already been provided
through the use of the -o option. When used in copy mode,
pax <br>
shall behave as if an archive had been created with
applicable extended header records and then extracted.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">atime The file access time for
the following file(s), equivalent to the value of the
st_atime member of the stat structure for a file, as
described by the stat(2) function. The <br>

appropriate privilege required to do so. The format of the
&lt;value&gt; shall be as described in pax Extended Header
File <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">charset <br>
The name of the character set used to encode the data in the

The encoding is included in an extended header for
information only; when pax is used as described in IEEE Std

other <br>
encoding. The BINARY entry indicates unencoded binary
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used in write or copy mode,
it is implementation-defined whether pax includes a charset
extended header record for a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comment <br>
A series of characters used as a comment. All characters in
the &lt;value&gt; field shall be ignored by pax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gid The group ID of the group
that owns the file, expressed as a decimal number using
digits from the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard. This record shall
override the gid field in <br>
the following header block(s). When used in write or copy
mode, pax shall include a gid extended header record for
each file whose group ID is greater than 2097151 (octal <br>
7777777).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gname The group of the file(s),
formatted as a group name in the group database. This record
shall override the gid and gname fields in the following
header block(s), and any <br>
gid extended header record. When used in read, copy, or list
mode, pax shall translate the name from the UTF-8 encoding
in the header record to the character set appropri&acirc;
<br>
ate for the group database on the receiving system. If any
of the UTF-8 characters cannot be translated, and if the -o
invalid=UTF-8 option is not specified, the results <br>
are implementation-defined. When used in write or copy mode,
pax shall include a gname extended header record for each
file whose group name cannot be represented entirely <br>
with the letters and digits of the portable character
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">linkpath <br>
The pathname of a link being created to another file, of any
type, previously archived. This record shall override the
linkname field in the following ustar header <br>
block(s). The following ustar header block shall determine
the type of link created. If typeflag of the following
header block is 1, it shall be a hard link. If typeflag <br>
is 2, it shall be a symbolic link and the linkpath value
shall be the contents of the symbolic link. The pax utility
shall translate the name of the link (contents of the <br>
symbolic link) from the UTF-8 encoding to the character set
appropriate for the local file system. When used in write or
copy mode, pax shall include a linkpath extended <br>
header record for each link whose pathname cannot be
represented entirely with the members of the portable
character set other than NUL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mtime The file modification time
of the following file(s), equivalent to the value of the
st_mtime member of the stat structure for a file, as
described in the stat(2) function. <br>
This record shall override the mtime field in the following
header block(s). The modification time shall be restored if
the process has the appropriate privilege required <br>
to do so. The format of the &lt;value&gt; shall be as
described in pax Extended Header File Times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path The pathname of the
following file(s). This record shall override the name and
prefix fields in the following header block(s). The pax
utility shall translate the pathname <br>
of the file from the UTF-8 encoding to the character set
appropriate for the local file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used in write or copy mode,
pax shall include a path extended header record for each

<p style="margin-top: 1em">realtime.any <br>
The keywords prefixed by &quot;realtime.&quot; are reserved

<p style="margin-top: 1em">security.any <br>
The keywords prefixed by &quot;security.&quot; are reserved

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size The size of the file in
octets, expressed as a decimal number using digits from the
ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard. This record shall override the
size field in the following <br>

include a size extended header record for each file with a
size value greater than 8589934591 (octal <br>
77777777777).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uid The user ID of the file
owner, expressed as a decimal number using digits from the
ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard. This record shall override the
uid field in the following <br>
header block(s). When used in write or copy mode, pax shall
include a uid extended header record for each file whose
owner ID is greater than 2097151 (octal 7777777).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uname The owner of the following
file(s), formatted as a user name in the user database. This
record shall override the uid and uname fields in the
following header block(s), <br>
and any uid extended header record. When used in read, copy,
or list mode, pax shall translate the name from the UTF-8
encoding in the header record to the character set <br>
appropriate for the user database on the receiving system.
If any of the UTF-8 characters cannot be translated, and if
the -o invalid=UTF-8 option is not specified, the <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &lt;value&gt; field is
zero length, it shall delete any header block field,
previously entered extended header value, or global extended
header value of the same name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a keyword in an extended
header record (or in a -o option-argument) overrides or

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike the ustar header block
fields, NULs shall not delimit &lt;value&gt;s; all
characters within the &lt;value&gt; field shall be
considered data for the field. None of the length
limita&acirc; <br>
tions of the ustar header block fields in ustar Header Block
shall apply to the extended header records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pax Extended Header Keyword
Precedence <br>
This section describes the precedence in which the various
header records and fields and command line options are
selected to apply to a file in the archive. When pax is used
in <br>
read or list modes, it shall determine a file attribute in
the following sequence:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If -o delete=keyword-prefix
is used, the affected attributes shall be determined from
step 7., if applicable, or ignored otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If -o keyword:= is used, the
affected attributes shall be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If -o keyword:=value is used,
the affected attribute shall be assigned the value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. If there is a typeflag x
extended header record, the affected attribute shall be
assigned the &lt;value&gt;. When extended header records
conflict, the last one given in <br>
the header shall take precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. If -o keyword=value is used,
the affected attribute shall be assigned the value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. If there is a typeflag g
global extended header record, the affected attribute shall
be assigned the &lt;value&gt;. When global extended header
records conflict, the <br>
last one given in the global header shall take
precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. Otherwise, the attribute
shall be determined from the ustar header block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pax Extended Header File Times
<br>
The pax utility shall write an mtime record for each file in
write or copy modes if the file&rsquo;s modification time
cannot be represented exactly in the ustar header logical
record <br>
described in ustar Interchange Format. This can occur if the
time is out of ustar range, or if the file system of the
underlying implementation supports non-integer time
granu&acirc; <br>
larities and the time is not an integer. All of these time
records shall be formatted as a decimal representation of
the time in seconds since the Epoch. If a period
(&rsquo;.&rsquo;) deci&acirc; <br>
mal point character is present, the digits to the right of
the point shall represent the units of a subsecond timing
granularity, where the first digit is tenths of a second and
<br>
each subsequent digit is a tenth of the previous digit. In
read or copy mode, the pax utility shall truncate the time
of a file to the greatest value that is not greater than the
<br>
input header file time. In write or copy mode, the pax
utility shall output a time exactly if it can be represented
exactly as a decimal number, and otherwise shall generate
only <br>
enough digits so that the same time shall be recovered if
the file is extracted on a system whose underlying
implementation supports the same time granularity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ustar Interchange Format <br>
A ustar archive tape or file shall contain a series of
logical records. Each logical record shall be a fixed-size
logical record of 512 octets (see below). Although this
format <br>
may be thought of as being stored on 9-track
industry-standard 12.7 mm (0.5 in) magnetic tape, other
types of transportable media are not excluded. Each file
archived shall be <br>
represented by a header logical record that describes the
file, followed by zero or more logical records that give the
contents of the file. At the end of the archive file there
<br>
shall be two 512-octet logical records filled with binary
zeros, interpreted as an end-of-archive indicator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The logical records may be
grouped for physical I/O operations, as described under the
-b blocksize and -x ustar options. Each group of logical
records may be written with a sin&acirc; <br>
gle operation equivalent to the write(2) function. On
magnetic tape, the result of this write shall be a single
tape physical block. The last physical block shall always be
the <br>
full size, so logical records after the two zero logical
records may contain undefined data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The header logical record shall
be structured as shown in the following table. All lengths
and offsets are in decimal.</p>

<br>
All characters in the header logical record shall be
represented in the coded character set of the ISO/IEC
646:1991 standard. For maximum portability between
implementations, <br>
names should be selected from characters represented by the
portable filename character set as octets with the most
significant bit zero. If an implementation supports the use
of <br>
characters outside of slash and the portable filename
character set in names for files, users, and groups, one or
more implementation-defined encodings of these characters
shall <br>
be provided for interchange purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, the pax utility shall
never create filenames on the local system that cannot be
accessed via the procedures described in IEEE Std
1003.1-2001. If a filename is found on <br>
the medium that would create an invalid filename, it is
implementation-defined whether the data from the file is
stored on the file hierarchy and under what name it is
stored. <br>
The pax utility may choose to ignore these files as long as
it produces an error indicating that the file is being
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each field within the header
logical record is contiguous; that is, there is no padding
used. Each character on the archive medium shall be stored
contiguously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fields magic, uname, and
gname are character strings each terminated by a NUL
character. The fields name, linkname, and prefix are
NUL-terminated character strings except <br>
when all characters in the array contain non-NUL characters
including the last character. The version field is two
octets containing the characters &quot;00&quot; (zero-zero).
The typeflag <br>
contains a single character. All other fields are leading
zero-filled octal numbers using digits from the ISO/IEC
646:1991 standard IRV. Each numeric field is terminated by
one <br>
or more &lt;space&gt; or NUL characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name and the prefix fields
shall produce the pathname of the file. A new pathname shall
be formed, if prefix is not an empty string (its first
character is not NUL), by con&acirc; <br>
catenating prefix (up to the first NUL character), a slash
character, and name; otherwise, name is used alone. In
either case, name is terminated at the first NUL character.
If <br>
prefix begins with a NUL character, it shall be ignored. In
this manner, pathnames of at most 256 characters can be
supported. If a pathname does not fit in the space provided,
<br>
pax shall notify the user of the error, and shall not store
any part of the file-header or data-on the medium.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The linkname field, described
below, shall not use the prefix to produce a pathname. As
such, a linkname is limited to 100 characters. If the name
does not fit in the space pro&acirc; <br>
vided, pax shall notify the user of the error, and shall not
attempt to store the link on the medium.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mode field provides 12 bits
encoded in the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard octal digit
representation. The encoded bits shall represent the
following values:</p>

<br>
When appropriate privilege is required to set one of these
mode bits, and the user restoring the files from the archive
does not have the appropriate privilege, the mode bits for
<br>
which the user does not have appropriate privilege shall be
ignored. Some of the mode bits in the archive format are not
mentioned elsewhere in this volume of IEEE Std <br>
1003.1-2001. If the implementation does not support those
bits, they may be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The uid and gid fields are the
user and group ID of the owner and group of the file,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The size field is the size of
the file in octets. If the typeflag field is set to specify
a file to be of type 1 (a link) or 2 (a symbolic link), the
size field shall be speci&acirc; <br>
fied as zero. If the typeflag field is set to specify a file
of type 5 (directory), the size field shall be interpreted
as described under the definition of that record type. No
<br>
data logical records are stored for types 1, 2, or 5. If the
typeflag field is set to 3 (character special file), 4
(block special file), or 6 (FIFO), the meaning of the size
<br>
field is unspecified by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
and no data logical records shall be stored on the medium.
Additionally, for type 6, the size field shall be ignored
<br>
when reading. If the typeflag field is set to any other
value, the number of logical records written following the
header shall be (size+511)/512, ignoring any fraction in the
<br>
result of the division.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mtime field shall be the
modification time of the file at the time it was archived.
It is the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard representation of the
octal value of the modification <br>
time obtained from the stat(2) function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The chksum field shall be the
ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard IRV representation of the octal
value of the simple sum of all octets in the header logical
record. Each octet in the <br>
header shall be treated as an unsigned value. These values
shall be added to an unsigned integer, initialized to zero,
the precision of which is not less than 17 bits. When
cal&acirc; <br>
culating the checksum, the chksum field is treated as if it
were all spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The typeflag field specifies the
type of file archived. If a particular implementation does
not recognize the type, or the user does not have
appropriate privilege to create that <br>
type, the file shall be extracted as if it were a regular
file if the file type is defined to have a meaning for the
size field that could cause data logical records to be
writ&acirc; <br>
ten on the medium (see the previous description for size).
If conversion to a regular file occurs, the pax utility
shall produce an error indicating that the conversion took
<br>
place. All of the typeflag fields shall be coded in the
ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard IRV:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Represents a regular file. For
backwards-compatibility, a typeflag value of binary zero
(&rsquo; &rsquo;) should be recognized as meaning a regular
file when extracting files from <br>
the archive. Archives written with this version of the
archive file format create regular files with a typefla
value of the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard IRV
&rsquo;0&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Represents a file linked to
another file, of any type, previously archived. Such files
are identified by having the same device and file serial
numbers, and pathnames that <br>
refer to different directory entries. All such files shall
be archived as linked files. The linked-to name is specified
in the linkname field with a NUL-character termina&acirc;
<br>
tor if it is less than 100 octets in length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Represents a symbolic link.
The contents of the symbolic link shall be stored in the
linkname field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3,4 Represent character special
files and block special files respectively. In this case the
devmajor and devminor fields shall contain information
defining the device, the <br>
format of which is unspecified by this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001. Implementations may map the device
specifications to their own local specification or may
ignore <br>
the entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 Specifies a directory or
subdirectory. On systems where disk allocation is performed
on a directory basis, the size field shall contain the
maximum number of octets (which <br>
may be rounded to the nearest disk block allocation unit)
that the directory may hold. A size field of zero indicates
no such limiting. Systems that do not support limit&acirc;
<br>
ing in this manner should ignore the size field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6 Specifies a FIFO special file.
Note that the archiving of a FIFO file archives the
existence of this file and not its contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7 Reserved to represent a file
to which an implementation has associated some
high-performance attribute. Implementations without such
extensions should treat this file as a <br>
regular file (type 0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A-Z The letters &rsquo;A&rsquo;
to &rsquo;Z&rsquo;, inclusive, are reserved for custom
implementations. All other values are reserved for future
versions of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is unspecified whether files
with pathnames that refer to the same directory entry are
archived as linked files or as separate files. If they are
archived as linked files, <br>
this means that attempting to extract both pathnames from
the resulting archive will always cause an error (unless the
-u option is used) because the link cannot be created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is unspecified whether files
with the same device and file serial numbers being appended
to an archive are treated as linked files to members that
were in the archive before <br>
the append.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attempts to archive a socket
using ustar interchange format shall produce a diagnostic
message. Handling of other file types is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The magic field is the
specification that this archive was output in this archive
format. If this field contains ustar (the five characters
from the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard IRV <br>
shown followed by NUL), the uname and gname fields shall
contain the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard IRV representation of
the owner and group of the file, respectively (truncated to
<br>
fit, if necessary). When the file is restored by a
privileged, protection-preserving version of the utility,
the user and group databases shall be scanned for these
names. If <br>
found, the user and group IDs contained within these files
shall be used rather than the values contained within the
uid and gid fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpio Interchange Format <br>
The octet-oriented cpio archive format shall be a series of
entries, each comprising a header that describes the file,
the name of the file, and then the contents of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An archive may be recorded as a
series of fixed-size blocks of octets. This blocking shall
be used only to make physical I/O more efficient. The last
group of blocks shall always <br>
be at the full size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the octet-oriented cpio

cpio Header <br>
For each file in the archive, a header as defined previously
shall be written. The information in the header fields is
written as streams of the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard
charac&acirc; <br>
ters interpreted as octal numbers. The octal numbers shall
be extended to the necessary length by appending the ISO/IEC

end of the number; the result is written to the
most-significant digit of the stream of octets first. The
fields shall be interpreted as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c_magic <br>
Identify the archive as being a transportable archive by
containing the identifying value &quot;070707&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c_dev, c_ino <br>
Contains values that uniquely identify the file within the

Directories, FIFOs, symbolic links, and regular files shall
be supported on a system conforming to this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001; additional values defined previ&acirc; <br>
ously are reserved for compatibility with existing systems.
Additional file types may be supported; however, such files
should not be written to archives intended to be <br>
transported to other systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c_uid Contains the user ID of
the owner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c_gid Contains the group ID of
the group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c_nlink <br>
Contains a number greater than or equal to the number of
links in the archive referencing the file. If the -a option
is used to append to a cpio archive, then the pax <br>
utility need not account for the files in the existing part
of the archive when calculating the c_nlink values for the
appended part of the archive, and need not alter the <br>
c_nlink values in the existing part of the archive if
additional files with the same c_dev and c_ino values are
appended to the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c_rdev Contains
implementation-defined information for character or block
special files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c_mtime <br>
Contains the latest time of modification of the file at the
time the archive was created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c_namesize <br>
Contains the length of the pathname, including the
terminating NUL character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c_filesize <br>
Contains the length of the file in octets. This shall be the
length of the data section following the header
structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpio Filename <br>
The c_name field shall contain the pathname of the file. The
length of this field in octets is the value of
c_namesize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a filename is found on the
medium that would create an invalid pathname, it is
implementation-defined whether the data from the file is
stored on the file hierarchy and under <br>
what name it is stored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All characters shall be
represented in the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard IRV. For
maximum portability between implementations, names should be
selected from characters represented by <br>
the portable filename character set as octets with the most
significant bit zero. If an implementation supports the use
of characters outside the portable filename character set
<br>
in names for files, users, and groups, one or more
implementation-defined encodings of these characters shall
be provided for interchange purposes. However, the pax
utility shall <br>
never create filenames on the local system that cannot be
accessed via the procedures described previously in this
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. If a filename is found on
the <br>
medium that would create an invalid filename, it is
implementation-defined whether the data from the file is
stored on the local file system and under what name it is
stored. The <br>
pax utility may choose to ignore these files as long as it
produces an error indicating that the file is being
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpio File Data <br>
Following c_name, there shall be c_filesize octets of data.
Interpretation of such data occurs in a manner dependent on
the file. If c_filesize is zero, no data shall be con&acirc;
<br>
tained in c_filedata.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When restoring from an
archive:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the user does
not have the appropriate privilege to create a file of the
specified type, pax shall ignore the entry and write an
error message to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Only regular
files have data to be restored. Presuming a regular file
meets any selection criteria that might be imposed on the
format-reading utility by the user, such <br>
data shall be restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If a user does
not have appropriate privilege to set a particular mode
flag, the flag shall be ignored. Some of the mode flags in
the archive format are not mentioned <br>
elsewhere in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. If the
implementation does not support those flags, they may be
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpio Special Entries <br>
FIFO special files, directories, and the trailer shall be
recorded with c_filesize equal to zero. For other special
files, c_filesize is unspecified by this volume of IEEE Std
<br>
1003.1-2001. The header for the next file entry in the
archive shall be written directly after the last octet of
the file entry preceding it. A header denoting the filename
<br>
TRAILER!!! shall indicate the end of the archive; the
contents of octets in the last block of the archive
following such a header are undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 All files were processed
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
If pax cannot create a file or a link when reading an
archive or cannot find a file when writing an archive, or
cannot preserve the user ID, group ID, or file mode when the
-p <br>
option is specified, a diagnostic message shall be written
to standard error and a non-zero exit status shall be
returned, but processing shall continue. In the case where
pax <br>
cannot create a link to a file, pax shall not, by default,
create a second copy of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the extraction of a file from
an archive is prematurely terminated by a signal or error,
pax may have only partially extracted the file or (if the -n
option was not specified) <br>
may have extracted a file of the same name as that specified
by the user, but which is not the file the user wanted.
Additionally, the file modes of extracted directories may
<br>
have additional bits from the S_IRWXU mask set as well as
incorrect modification and access times.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">_________________________________________________________________
The following sections are informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
Caution is advised when using the -a option to append to a
cpio format archive. If any of the files being appended
happen to be given the same c_dev and c_ino values as a file
in <br>
the existing part of the archive, then they may be treated
as links to that file on extraction. Thus, it is risky to
use -a with cpio format except when it is done on the same
<br>
system that the original archive was created on, and with
the same pax utility, and in the knowledge that there has
been little or no file system activity since the original
ar&acirc; <br>
chive was created that could lead to any of the files
appended being given the same c_dev and c_ino values as an
unrelated file in the existing part of the archive. Also,
when <br>
(intentionally) appending additional links to a file in the
existing part of the archive, the c_nlink values in the
modified archive can be smaller than the number of links to
<br>
the file in the archive, which may mean that the links are
not preserved on extraction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -p (privileges) option was
invented to reconcile differences between historical tar and
cpio implementations. In particular, the two utilities use
-m in diametrically opposed <br>
ways. The -p option also provides a consistent means of
extending the ways in which future file attributes can be
addressed, such as for enhanced security systems or
high-perfor&acirc; <br>
mance files. Although it may seem complex, there are really
two modes that are most commonly used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p e &lsquo;&lsquo;Preserve
everything&quot;. This would be used by the historical
superuser, someone with all the appropriate privileges, to
preserve all aspects of the files as they are <br>
recorded in the archive. The e flag is the sum of o and p,
and other implementation-defined attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p p
&lsquo;&lsquo;Preserve&quot; the file mode bits. This would
be used by the user with regular privileges who wished to
preserve aspects of the file other than the ownership. The
file times <br>
are preserved by default, but two other flags are offered to
disable these and use the time of extraction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The one pathname per line format
of standard input precludes pathnames containing
&lt;newline&gt;s. Although such pathnames violate the
portable filename guidelines, they may exist and <br>
their presence may inhibit usage of pax within shell
scripts. This problem is inherited from historical archive
programs. The problem can be avoided by listing filename
arguments <br>
on the command line instead of on standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is almost certain that
appropriate privileges are required for pax to accomplish
parts of this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. Specifically,
creating files of type block spe&acirc; <br>
cial or character special, restoring file access times
unless the files are owned by the user (the -t option), or
preserving file owner, group, and mode (the -p option) all
prob&acirc; <br>
ably require appropriate privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In read mode, implementations
are permitted to overwrite files when the archive has
multiple members with the same name. This may fail if
permissions on the first version of the <br>
file do not permit it to be overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The cpio and ustar formats can
only support files up to 8589934592 bytes (8 * 2^30) in
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pax -w -f /dev/rmt/1m .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copies the contents of the
current directory to tape drive 1, medium density (assuming

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The pax utility was new for the ISO POSIX-2:1993 standard.
It represents a peaceful compromise between advocates of the
historical tar and cpio utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A fundamental difference between
cpio and tar was in the way directories were treated. The
cpio utility did not treat directories differently from
other files, and to select a <br>
directory and its contents required that each file in the
hierarchy be explicitly specified. For tar, a directory
matched every file in the file hierarchy it rooted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pax utility offers both
interfaces; by default, directories map into the file
hierarchy they root. The -d option causes pax to skip any
file not explicitly referenced, as <br>
cpio historically did. The tar - style behavior was chosen
as the default because it was believed that this was the
more common usage and because tar is the more commonly
avail&acirc; <br>
able interface, as it was historically provided on both
System V and BSD implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The data interchange format
specification in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
requires that processes with &quot;appropriate
privileges&quot; shall always restore the ownership and
per&acirc; <br>
missions of extracted files exactly as archived. If viewed
from the historic equivalence between superuser and
&quot;appropriate privileges&quot;, there are two problems
with this require&acirc; <br>
ment. First, users running as superusers may unknowingly set
dangerous permissions on extracted files. Second, it is
needlessly limiting, in that superusers cannot extract files
<br>
and own them as superuser unless the archive was created by
the superuser. (It should be noted that restoration of
ownerships and permissions for the superuser, by default, is
<br>
historical practice in cpio, but not in tar.) In order to
avoid these two problems, the pax specification has an
additional &quot;privilege&quot; mechanism, the -p option.
Only a pax <br>
invocation with the privileges needed, and which has the -p
option set using the e specification character, has the
&quot;appropriate privilege&quot; to restore full ownership
and permis&acirc; <br>
sion information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note also that this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 requires that the file ownership and
access permissions shall be set, on extraction, in the same
fashion as the creat(2) func&acirc; <br>
tion when provided with the mode stored in the archive. This
means that the file creation mask of the user is applied to
the file permissions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users should note that
directories may be created by pax while extracting files
with permissions that are different from those that existed
at the time the archive was created. <br>
When extracting sensitive information into a directory
hierarchy that no longer exists, users are encouraged to set
their file creation mask appropriately to protect these
files <br>
during extraction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The table of contents output is
written to standard output to facilitate pipeline
processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An early proposal had hard links
displaying for all pathnames. This was removed because it
complicates the output of the case where -v is not specified
and does not match his&acirc; <br>
torical cpio usage. The hard-link information is available
in the -v display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The description of the -l option
allows implementations to make hard links to symbolic links.
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not specify any way to create a
hard link to a symbolic <br>
link, but many implementations provide this capability as an
extension. If there are hard links to symbolic links when an
archive is created, the implementation is required to <br>
archive the hard link in the archive (unless -H or -L is
specified). When in read mode and in copy mode,
implementations supporting hard links to symbolic links
should use them <br>
when appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The archive formats inherited
from the POSIX.1-1990 standard have certain restrictions
that have been brought along from historical usage. For
example, there are restrictions on <br>
the length of pathnames stored in the archive. When pax is
used in copy (-rw) mode (copying directory hierarchies), the
ability to use extensions from the -x pax format overcomes
<br>
these restrictions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default blocksize value of
5120 bytes for cpio was selected because it is one of the
standard block-size values for cpio, set when the -B option
is specified. (The other <br>
default block-size value for cpio is 512 bytes, and this was
considered to be too small.) The default block value of
10240 bytes for tar was selected because that is the
standard <br>
block-size value for BSD tar. The maximum block size of
32256 bytes (2^15-512 bytes) is the largest multiple of 512
bytes that fits into a signed 16-bit tape controller
transfer <br>
register. There are known limitations in some historical
systems that would prevent larger blocks from being
accepted. Historical values were chosen to improve
compatibility with <br>
historical scripts using dd(1) or similar utilities to
manipulate archives. Also, default block sizes for any file
type other than character special file has been deleted from
<br>
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 as unimportant and not
likely to affect the structure of the resulting archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implementations are permitted to
modify the block-size value based on the archive format or
the device to which the archive is being written. This is to
provide implementations <br>
with the opportunity to take advantage of special types of
devices, and it should not be used without a great deal of
consideration as it almost certainly decreases archive <br>
portability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The intended use of the -n
option was to permit extraction of one or more files from
the archive without processing the entire archive. This was
viewed by the standard developers <br>
as offering significant performance advantages over
historical implementations. The -n option in early proposals
had three effects; the first was to cause special characters
in <br>
patterns to not be treated specially. The second was to
cause only the first file that matched a pattern to be
extracted. The third was to cause pax to write a diagnostic
message <br>
to standard error when no file was found matching a
specified pattern. Only the second behavior is retained by
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, for many reasons.
First, it is <br>
in general not acceptable for a single option to have
multiple effects. Second, the ability to make pattern
matching characters act as normal characters is useful for
parts of <br>
pax other than file extraction. Third, a finer degree of
control over the special characters is useful because users
may wish to normalize only a single special character in a
<br>
single filename. Fourth, given a more general escape
mechanism, the previous behavior of the -n option can be
easily obtained using the -s option or a sed script.
Finally, writ&acirc; <br>
ing a diagnostic message when a pattern specified by the
user is unmatched by any file is useful behavior in all
cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this version, the -n was
removed from the copy mode synopsis of pax; it is
inapplicable because there are no pattern operands specified
in this mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is another method than pax
for copying subtrees in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 described as
part of the cp(1) utility. Both methods are historical
practice: cp(1) provides a sim&acirc; <br>
pler, more intuitive interface, while pax offers a finer
granularity of control. Each provides additional
functionality to the other; in particular, pax maintains the
hard-link <br>
structure of the hierarchy while cp(1) does not. It is the
intention of the standard developers that the results be
similar (using appropriate option combinations in both
utili&acirc; <br>
ties). The results are not required to be identical; there
seemed insufficient gain to applications to balance the
difficulty of implementations having to guarantee that the
<br>
results would be exactly identical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A single archive may span more
than one file. It is suggested that implementations provide
informative messages to the user on standard error whenever
the archive file is <br>
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -d option (do not create
intermediate directories not listed in the archive) found in
early proposals was originally provided as a complement to
the historic -d option of <br>
cpio. It has been deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -s option in early proposals
specified a subset of the substitution command from the ed
utility. As there was no reason for only a subset to be
supported, the -s option is <br>
now compatible with the current ed specification. Since the
delimiter can be any non-null character, the following usage
with single spaces is valid:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pax -s &quot; foo bar &quot;
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -t description is worded so
as to note that this may cause the access time update caused
by some other activity (which occurs while the file is being
read) to be overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default behavior of pax with
regard to file modification times is the same as historical
implementations of tar. It is not the historical behavior of
cpio.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because the -i option uses
/dev/tty, utilities without a controlling terminal are not
able to use this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -y option, found in early
proposals, has been deleted because a line containing a
single period for the -i option has equivalent
functionality. The special lines for the -i <br>
option (a single period and the empty line) are historical
practice in cpio.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In early drafts, a -e charmap
option was included to increase portability of files between
systems using different coded character sets. This option
was omitted because it was <br>
apparent that consensus could not be formed for it. In this
version, the use of UTF-8 should be an adequate
substitute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -k option was added to
address international concerns about the dangers involved in
the character set transformations of -e (if the target
character set were different from <br>
the source, the filenames might be transformed into names
matching existing files) and also was made more general to
protect files transferred between file systems with
different <br>
{NAME_MAX} values (truncating a filename on a smaller system
might also inadvertently overwrite existing files). As
stated, it prevents any overwriting, even if the target file
<br>
is older than the source. This version adds more granularity
of options to solve this problem by introducing the -o
invalid=option - specifically the UTF-8 action. (Note that
an <br>
existing file that is named with a UTF-8 encoding is still
subject to overwriting in this case. The -k option closes
that loophole.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of the file characteristics
referenced in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 might not
be supported by some archive formats. For example, neither
the tar nor cpio formats <br>
contain the file access time. For this reason, the e
specification character has been provided, intended to cause
all file characteristics specified in the archive to be <br>
retained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is required that extracted
directories, by default, have their access and modification
times and permissions set to the values specified in the
archive. This has obvious prob&acirc; <br>
lems in that the directories are almost certainly modified
after being extracted and that directory permissions may not
permit file creation. One possible solution is to create
<br>
directories with the mode specified in the archive, as
modified by the umask of the user, with sufficient
permissions to allow file creation. After all files have
been extracted, <br>
pax would then reset the access and modification times and
permissions as necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list-mode formatting
description borrows heavily from the one defined by the
printf(1) utility. However, since there is no separate
operand list to get conversion arguments, <br>
the format was extended to allow specifying the name of the
conversion argument as part of the conversion
specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The T conversion specifier
allows time fields to be displayed in any of the date
formats. Unlike the ls(1) utility, pax does not adjust the
format when the date is less than six <br>
months in the past. This makes parsing the output more
predictable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The D conversion specifier
handles the ability to display the major/minor or file size,
as with ls(1), by using %-8(size)D.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The L conversion specifier
handles the ls display for symbolic links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conversion specifiers were added
to generate existing known types used for ls(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pax Interchange Format <br>
The new POSIX data interchange format was developed
primarily to satisfy international concerns that the ustar
and cpio formats did not provide for file, user, and group
names <br>
encoded in characters outside a subset of the ISO/IEC
646:1991 standard. The standard developers realized that
this new POSIX data interchange format should be very
extensible <br>
because there were other requirements they foresaw in the
near future:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Support
international character encodings and locale information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Support security
information (ACLs, and so on)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Support future
file types, such as realtime or contiguous files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Include data
areas for implementation use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Support systems
with words larger than 32 bits and timers with subsecond
granularity</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following were not goals for
this format because these are better handled by separate
utilities or are inappropriate for a portable format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Encryption</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Compression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Data translation
between locales and codesets</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; inode
storage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format chosen to support the
goals is an extension of the ustar format. Of the two
formats previously available, only the ustar format was
selected for extensions because:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It was easier to
extend in an upwards-compatible way. It offered version
flags and header block type fields with room for future
standardization. The cpio format, while <br>
possessing a more flexible file naming methodology, could
not be extended without breaking some theoretical
implementation or using a dummy filename that could be a
legit&acirc; <br>
imate filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Industry
experience since the original &quot;tar wars&quot; fought in
developing the ISO POSIX-1 standard has clearly been in
favor of the ustar format, which is generally the <br>
default output format selected for pax implementations on
new systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The new format was designed with
one additional goal in mind: reasonable behavior when an
older tar or pax utility happened to read an archive. Since
the POSIX.1-1990 standard <br>
mandated that a &quot;format-reading utility&quot; had to
treat unrecognized typeflag values as regular files, this
allowed the format to include all the extended information
in a pseudo- <br>
regular file that preceded each real file. An option is
given that allows the archive creator to set up reasonable
names for these files on the older systems. Also, the
norma&acirc; <br>
tive text suggests that reasonable file access values be
used for this ustar header block. Making these header files
inaccessible for convenient reading and deleting would not
be <br>
reasonable. File permissions of 600 or 700 are
suggested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ustar typeflag field was
used to accommodate the additional functionality of the new
format rather than magic or version because the POSIX.1-1990
standard (and, by reference, <br>
the previous version of pax), mandated the behavior of the
format-reading utility when it encountered an unknown
typeflag, but was silent about the other two fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Early proposals of the first
revision to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 contained a proposed
archive format that was based on compatibility with the
standard for tape files (ISO 1001, sim&acirc; <br>
ilar to the format used historically on many mainframes and
minicomputers). This format was overly complex and required
considerable overhead in volume and header records.
Fur&acirc; <br>
thermore, the standard developers felt that it would not be
acceptable to the community of POSIX developers, so it was
later changed to be a format more closely related to
his&acirc; <br>
torical practice on POSIX systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The prefix and name split of
pathnames in ustar was replaced by the single path extended
header record for simplicity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The concept of a global extended
header (typeflag g) was controversial. If this were applied
to an archive being recorded on magnetic tape, a few
unreadable blocks at the begin&acirc; <br>
ning of the tape could be a serious problem; a utility
attempting to extract as many files as possible from a
damaged archive could lose a large percentage of file header
infor&acirc; <br>
mation in this case. However, if the archive were on a
reliable medium, such as a CD-ROM, the global extended
header offers considerable potential size reductions by
eliminating <br>
redundant information. Thus, the text warns against using
the global method for unreliable media and provides a method
for implanting global information in the extended header
<br>
for each file, rather than in the typeflag g records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No facility for data translation
or filtering on a per-file basis is included because the
standard developers could not invent an interface that would
allow this in an efficient <br>
manner. If a filter, such as encryption or compression, is
to be applied to all the files, it is more efficient to
apply the filter to the entire archive as a single file. The
<br>
standard developers considered interfaces that would invoke
a shell script for each file going into or out of the
archive, but the system overhead in this approach was
considered <br>
to be too high.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One such approach would be to
have filter= records that give a pathname for an executable.
When the program is invoked, the file and archive would be
open for standard input/out&acirc; <br>
put and all the header fields would be available as
environment variables or command-line arguments. The
standard developers did discuss such schemes, but they were
omitted from <br>
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 due to concerns about excessive
overhead. Also, the program itself would need to be in the
archive if it were to be used portably.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is currently no portable
means of identifying the character set(s) used for a file in
the file system. Therefore, pax has not been given a
mechanism to generate charset <br>
records automatically. The only portable means of doing this
is for the user to write the archive using the -o
charset=string command line option. This assumes that all of
the <br>
files in the archive use the same encoding. The
&quot;implementation-defined&quot; text is included to allow
for a system that can identify the encodings used for each
of its files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The table of standards that
accompanies the charset record description is acknowledged
to be very limited. Only a limited number of character set
standards is reasonable for max&acirc; <br>
imal interchange. Any character set is, of course, possible
by prior agreement. It was suggested that EBCDIC be listed,
but it was omitted because it is not defined by a formal
<br>
standard. Formal standards, and then only those with
reasonably large followings, can be included here, simply as
a matter of practicality. The &lt;value&gt;s represent names
of offi&acirc; <br>
cially registered character sets in the format required by
the ISO 2375:1985 standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The normal comma or
&lt;blank&gt;-separated list rules are not followed in the
case of keyword options to allow ease of argument parsing
for getopts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Further information on character
encodings is in pax Archive Character Set
Encoding/Decoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standard developers have
reserved keyword name space for vendor extensions. It is
suggested that the format to be used is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VENDOR.keyword</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where VENDOR is the name of the
vendor or organization in all uppercase letters. It is
further suggested that the keyword following the period be
named differently than any of <br>
the standard keywords so that it could be used for future
standardization, if appropriate, by omitting the VENDOR
prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;length&gt; field in the
extended header record was included to make it simpler to
step through the records, even if a record contains an
unknown format (to a particular pax) <br>
with complex interactions of special characters. It also
provides a minor integrity checkpoint within the records to
aid a program attempting to recover files from a damaged
ar&acirc; <br>
chive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are no extended header
versions of the devmajor and devminor fields because the
unspecified format ustar header field should be sufficient.
If they are not, vendor-specific <br>
extended keywords (such as VENDOR.devmajor) should be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Device and i-number labeling of
files was not adopted from cpio; files are interchanged
strictly on a symbolic name basis, as in ustar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Just as with the ustar format
descriptions, the new format makes no special arrangements
for multi-volume archives. Each of the pax archive types is
assumed to be inside a single <br>
POSIX file and splitting that file over multiple volumes
(diskettes, tape cartridges, and so on), processing their
labels, and mounting each in the proper sequence are
considered <br>
to be implementation details that cannot be described
portably.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pax format is intended for
interchange, not only for backup on a single (family of)
systems. It is not as densely packed as might be possible
for backup:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It contains
information as coded characters that could be coded in
binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It identifies
extended records with name fields that could be omitted in
favor of a fixed-field layout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It translates
names into a portable character set and identifies
locale-related information, both of which are probably
unnecessary for backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The requirements on restoring
from an archive are slightly different from the historical
wording, allowing for non-monolithic privilege to bring
forward as much as possible. In <br>
particular, attributes such as &quot;high performance
file&quot; might be broadly but not universally granted
while set-user-ID or chown(2) might be much more restricted.
There is no <br>
implication in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 that the security
information be honored after it is restored to the file
hierarchy, in spite of what might be improperly inferred by
the <br>
silence on that topic. That is a topic for another
standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Links are recorded in the
fashion described here because a link can be to any file
type. It is desirable in general to be able to restore part
of an archive selectively and <br>
restore all of those files completely. If the data is not
associated with each link, it is not possible to do this.
However, the data associated with a file can be large, and
<br>
when selective restoration is not needed, this can be a
significant burden. The archive is structured so that files
that have no associated data can always be restored by the
<br>
name of any link name of any link, and the user may choose
whether data is recorded with each instance of a file that
contains data. The format permits mixing of both types of
<br>
links in a single archive; this can be done for special
needs, and pax is expected to interpret such archives on
input properly, despite the fact that there is no pax option
that <br>
would force this mixed case on output. (When -o linkdata is
used, the output must contain the duplicate data, but the
implementation is free to include it or omit it when -o <br>
linkdata is not used.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The time values are included as
extended header records for those implementations needing
more than the eleven octal digits allowed by the ustar
format. Portable file timestamps <br>
cannot be negative. If pax encounters a file with a negative
timestamp in copy or write mode, it can reject the file,
substitute a non-negative timestamp, or generate a
non-por&acirc; <br>
table timestamp with a leading &rsquo;-&rsquo;. Even though
some implementations can support finer file-time
granularities than seconds, the normative text requires
support only for seconds <br>
since the Epoch because the ISO POSIX-1 standard states them
that way. The ustar format includes only mtime; the new
format adds atime and ctime for symmetry. The atime access
<br>
time restored to the file system will be affected by the -p
a and -p e options. The ctime creation time (actually inode
modification time) is described with &quot;appropriate
privi&acirc; <br>
lege&quot; so that it can be ignored when writing to the
file system. POSIX does not provide a portable means to
change file creation time. Nothing is intended to prevent a
non-porta&acirc; <br>
ble implementation of pax from restoring the value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The gid, size, and uid extended
header records were included to allow expansion beyond the
sizes specified in the regular tar header. New file system
architectures are emerging <br>
that will exhaust the 12-digit size field. There are
probably not many systems requiring more than 8 digits for
user and group IDs, but the extended header values were
included <br>
for completeness, allowing overrides for all of the decimal
values in the tar header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standard developers intended
to describe the effective results of pax with regard to file
ownerships and permissions; implementations are not
restricted in timing or sequenc&acirc; <br>
ing the restoration of such, provided the results are as
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Much of the text describing the
extended headers refers to use in &quot;write or copy
modes&quot;. The copy mode references are due to the
normative text: &quot;The effect of the copy shall be <br>
as if the copied files were written to an archive file and
then subsequently extracted ...&quot;. There is certainly no
way to test whether pax is actually generating the extended
<br>
headers in copy mode, but the effects must be as if it
had.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pax Archive Character Set
Encoding/Decoding <br>
There is a need to exchange archives of files between
systems of different native codesets. Filenames, group
names, and user names must be preserved to the fullest
extent possi&acirc; <br>
ble when an archive is read on the receiving platform.
Translation of the contents of files is not within the scope
of the pax utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There will also be the need to
represent characters that are not available on the receiving
platform. These unsupported characters cannot be
automatically folded to the local set <br>
of characters due to the chance of collisions. This could
result in overwriting previous extracted files from the
archive or pre-existing files on the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For these reasons, the codeset
used to represent characters within the extended header
records of the pax archive must be sufficiently rich to
handle all commonly used character <br>
sets. The fields requiring translation include, at a
minimum, filenames, user names, group names, and link
pathnames. Implementations may wish to have localized
extended keywords <br>
that use non-portable characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standard developers
considered the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The archive
creator specifies the well-defined name of the source
codeset. The receiver must then recognize the codeset name
and perform the appropriate translations to <br>
the destination codeset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The archive
creator includes within the archive the character mapping
table for the source codeset used to encode extended header
records. The receiver must then read the <br>
character mapping table and perform the appropriate
translations to the destination codeset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The archive
creator translates the extended header records in the source
codeset into a canonical form. The receiver must then
perform the appropriate translations to the <br>
destination codeset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The approach that incorporates
the name of the source codeset poses the problem of codeset
name registration, and makes the archive useless to pax
archive decoders that do not <br>
recognize that codeset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because parts of an archive may
be corrupted, the standard developers felt that including
the character map of the source codeset was too fragile. The
loss of this one key compo&acirc; <br>
nent could result in making the entire archive useless. (The
difference between this and the global extended header
decision was that the latter has a workaround-duplicating
<br>
extended header records on unreliable media-but this would
be too burdensome for large character set maps.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both of the above approaches
also put an undue burden on the pax archive receiver to
handle the cross-product of all source and destination
codesets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To simplify the translation from
the source codeset to the canonical form and from the
canonical form to the destination codeset, the standard
developers decided that the inter&acirc; <br>
nal representation should be a stateless encoding. A
stateless encoding is one where each codepoint has the same
meaning, without regard to the decoder being in a specific
state. <br>
An example of a stateful encoding would be the Japanese
Shift-JIS; an example of a stateless encoding would be the
ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard (equivalent to 7-bit ASCII).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For these reasons, the standard
developers decided to adopt a canonical format for the
representation of file information strings. The obvious,
well-endorsed candidate is the <br>
ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 standard (based in part on Unicode),
which can be used to represent the characters of virtually
all standardized character sets. The standard developers
ini&acirc; <br>
tially agreed upon using UCS2 (16-bit Unicode) as the
internal representation. This repertoire of characters
provides a sufficiently rich set to represent all
commonly-used code&acirc; <br>
sets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, the standard developers
found that the 16-bit Unicode representation had some
problems. It forced the issue of standardizing byte
ordering. The 2-byte length of each <br>
character made the extended header records twice as long for
the case of strings coded entirely from historical 7-bit
ASCII. For these reasons, the standard developers chose the
<br>
UTF-8 defined in the ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 standard. This
multi-byte representation encodes UCS2 or UCS4 characters
reliably and deterministically, eliminating the need for a
<br>
canonical byte ordering. In addition, NUL octets and other
characters possibly confusing to POSIX file systems do not
appear, except to represent themselves. It was realized that
<br>
certain national codesets take up more space after the
encoding, due to their placement within the UCS range; it
was felt that the usefulness of the encoding of the names
out&acirc; <br>
weighs the disadvantage of size increase for file, user, and
group names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The encoding of UTF-8 is as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UCS4 Hex Encoding UTF-8 Binary
Encoding <br>
00000000-0000007F 0xxxxxxx <br>
00000080-000007FF 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx <br>
00000800-0000FFFF 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx <br>
00010000-001FFFFF 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx <br>
00200000-03FFFFFF 111110xx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
10xxxxxx <br>
04000000-7FFFFFFF 1111110x 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where each &rsquo;x&rsquo;
represents a bit value from the character being
translated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ustar Interchange Format <br>
The description of the ustar format reflects numerous
enhancements over pre-1988 versions of the historical tar
utility. The goal of these changes was not only to provide
the <br>
functional enhancements desired, but also to retain
compatibility between new and old versions. This
compatibility has been retained. Archives written using the
old archive for&acirc; <br>
mat are compatible with the new format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implementors should be aware
that the previous file format did not include a mechanism to
archive directory type files. For this reason, the
convention of using a filename ending <br>
with slash was adopted to specify a directory on the
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The total size of the name and
prefix fields have been set to meet the minimum requirements
for {PATH_MAX} If a pathname will fit within the name field,
it is recommended that <br>
the pathname be stored there without the use of the prefix
field. Although the name field is known to be too small to
contain {PATH_MAX} characters, the value was not changed in
<br>
this version of the archive file format to retain
backwards-compatibility, and instead the prefix was
introduced. Also, because of the earlier version of the
format, there is no <br>
way to remove the restriction on the linkname field being
limited in size to just that of the name field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The size field is required to be
meaningful in all implementation extensions, although it
could be zero. This is required so that the data blocks can
always be properly counted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is suggested that if device
special files need to be represented that cannot be
represented in the standard format, that one of the
extension types (A-Z) be used, and that the <br>
additional information for the special file be represented
as data and be reflected in the size field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attempting to restore a special
file type, where it is converted to ordinary data and
conflicts with an existing filename, need not be specially
detected by the utility. If run <br>
as an ordinary user, pax should not be able to overwrite the
entries in, for example, /dev in any case (whether the file
is converted to another type or not). If run as a
privi&acirc; <br>
leged user, it should be able to do so, and it would be
considered a bug if it did not. The same is true of ordinary
data files and similarly named special files; it is
impossi&acirc; <br>
ble to anticipate the needs of the user (who could really
intend to overwrite the file), so the behavior should be
predictable (and thus regular) and rely on the protection
sys&acirc; <br>
tem as required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value 7 in the typeflag
field is intended to define how contiguous files can be
stored in a ustar archive. IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not
require the contiguous file exten&acirc; <br>
sion, but does define a standard way of archiving such files
so that all conforming systems can interpret these file
types in a meaningful and consistent manner. On a system
that <br>
does not support extended file types, the pax utility should
do the best it can with the file and go on to the next.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file protection modes are
those conventionally used by the ls(1) utility. This is
extended beyond the usage in the ISO POSIX-2 standard to
support the &quot;shared text&quot; or <br>
&quot;sticky&quot; bit. It is intended that the conformance
document should not document anything beyond the existence
of and support of such a mode. Further extensions are
expected to <br>
these bits, particularly with overloading the set-user-ID
and set-group-ID flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpio Interchange Format <br>
The reference to appropriate privilege in the cpio format
refers to an error on standard output; the ustar format does
not make comparable statements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The model for this format was
the historical System V cpio -c data interchange format.
This model documents the portable version of the cpio format
and not the binary version. It <br>
has the flexibility to transfer data of any type described
within IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, yet is extensible to transfer
data types specific to extensions beyond IEEE Std <br>
1003.1-2001 (for example, contiguous files). Because it
describes existing practice, there is no question of
maintaining upwards-compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpio Header <br>
There has been some concern that the size of the c_ino field
of the header is too small to handle those systems that have
very large inode numbers. However, the c_ino field in <br>
the header is used strictly as a hard-link resolution
mechanism for archives. It is not necessarily the same value
as the inode number of the file in the location from which
that <br>
file is extracted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name c_magic is based on
historical usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpio Filename <br>
For most historical implementations of the cpio utility,
{PATH_MAX} octets can be used to describe the pathname
without the addition of any other header fields (the NUL
character <br>
would be included in this count). {PATH_MAX} is the minimum
value for pathname size, documented as 256 bytes. However,
an implementation may use c_namesize to determine the <br>
exact length of the pathname. With the current description
of the &lt;cpio.h&gt; header, this pathname size can be as
large as a number that is described in six octal digits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two values are documented under
the c_mode field values to provide for extensibility for
known file types:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0110 000 <br>
Reserved for contiguous files. The implementation may treat
the rest of the information for this archive like a regular
file. If this file type is undefined, the implemen&acirc;
<br>
tation may create the file as a regular file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This provides for extensibility
of the cpio format while allowing for the ability to read
old archives. Files of an unknown type may be read as
&quot;regular files&quot; on some implemen&acirc; <br>
tations. On a system that does not support extended file
types, the pax utility should do the best it can with the
file and go on to the next.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
