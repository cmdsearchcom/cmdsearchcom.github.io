<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
docbook-to-man &acirc; convert DocBook SGML into roff -man
macros</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
docbook-to-man [source.sgml] [&gt;] [destination.1]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The docbook-to-man tool is a batch converter that transforms
UNIX-style manpages from the DocBook SGML DTD into
nroff/troff -man macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">docbook-to-man is the shell
command that runs the low-level components to translate a
single DocBook SGML document instance (whose document
element is &lt;RefEntry&gt;) into pretty- <br>
much vanilla -man macros, with tables rendered in tbl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is not the original version
by Fred Dalrymple, but one with the ANS Modifications by
David Bolen (db3l@ans.net).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">White space and special
characters <br>
If you want to use tabs in your manpage you should use
&lt;programlisting&gt;, &lt;literal&gt; or &lt;screen&gt;
and invoke docbook-to-man with INSTANT_OPT set to a tab
character. Be aware that <br>
multiple tabs will be collapsed into one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you want to collapse white
space into one, you should invoke docbook-to-man with
INSTANT_OPT set to a space character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special characters like &rsquo;
or . will not be interpreted if you set INSTANT_OPT to a
space or tab character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
If the variable INSTANT_OPT is not set, the instant(1) is
called with the parameter -d by docbook-to-man. If you
don&rsquo;t want this, e.g. if you want to use some special
characters <br>
literally in your SGML file, you can set INSTANT_OPT to just
a space character:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTANT_OPT=&quot; &quot;
docbook-to-man src.sgml &gt; dst.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The better way to use
special characters like ^ or &gt; is to write them in the
SGML way, i.e. &amp;caret; or &amp;gt;.</p>
