The docbook-to-man tool is a batch converter that transforms UNIX-style manpages
  from the <b>DocBook</b> SGML DTD into nroff/troff -man macros.
<div class="Pp"></div>
docbook-to-man is the shell command that runs the low-level components to
  translate a single <b>DocBook</b> SGML document instance (whose document
  element is &lt;RefEntry&gt;) into pretty-much vanilla -man macros, with tables
  rendered in tbl.

  space and special characters</a></h1>
If you want to use tabs in your manpage you should use &lt;programlisting&gt;,
  &lt;literal&gt; or &lt;screen&gt; and invoke docbook-to-man with INSTANT_OPT
  set to a tab character. Be aware that multiple tabs will be collapsed into
  one.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you want to collapse white space into one, you should invoke docbook-to-man
  with INSTANT_OPT set to a space character.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Special characters like \, ' or . will not be interpreted if you set INSTANT_OPT
  to a space or tab character.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
If the variable INSTANT_OPT is not set, the <b>instant(1)</b> is called with the
  parameter <b>-d</b> by docbook-to-man. If you don't want this, e.g. if you
  want to use some special characters literally in your SGML file, you can set
  INSTANT_OPT to just a space character:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>INSTANT_OPT=&quot;</b> <b>&quot; docbook-to-man src.sgml &gt;</b>
  <b>dst.1</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note: The better way to use special characters like ^ or &gt; is to write them
  in the SGML way, i.e. &amp;caret; or &amp;gt;.
