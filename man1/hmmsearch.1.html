<p>hmmsearch(1) HMMER Manual hmmsearch(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hmmsearch - search profile(s) against a sequence
database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
hmmsearch [options] &lt;hmmfile&gt; &lt;seqdb&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
hmmsearch is used to search one or more profiles against a
sequence database. For each profile in &lt;hmmfile&gt;, use
that query profile to search the target database of
sequences in <br>
&lt;seqdb&gt;, and output ranked lists of the sequences with
the most significant matches to the profile. To build
profiles from multiple alignments, see hmmbuild.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Either the query &lt;hmmfile&gt;
or the target &lt;seqdb&gt; may be &rsquo;-&rsquo; (a dash
character), in which case the query profile or target
database input will be read from a &lt;stdin&gt; pipe
instead <br>
of from a file. Only one input source can come through
&lt;stdin&gt;, not both. An exception is that if the
&lt;hmmfile&gt; contains more than one profile query, then
&lt;seqdb&gt; cannot come <br>
from &lt;stdin&gt;, because we can&rsquo;t rewind the
streaming target database to search it with another
profile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output format is designed to
be human-readable, but is often so voluminous that reading
it is impractical, and parsing it is a pain. The --tblout
and --domtblout options save <br>
output in simple tabular formats that are concise and easier
to parse. The -o option allows redirecting the main output,
including throwing it away in /dev/null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and
all available options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS FOR CONTROLLING OUTPUT
<br>
-o &lt;f&gt; Direct the main human-readable output to a file
&lt;f&gt; instead of the default stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A &lt;f&gt; Save a multiple
alignment of all significant hits (those satisfying
inclusion thresholds) to the file &lt;f&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tblout &lt;f&gt; <br>
Save a simple tabular (space-delimited) file summarizing the
per-target output, with one data line per homologous target
sequence found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--domtblout &lt;f&gt; <br>
Save a simple tabular (space-delimited) file summarizing the
per-domain output, with one data line per homologous domain
detected in a query sequence for each homologous <br>
model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--acc Use accessions instead of
names in the main output, where available for profiles
and/or sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noali <br>
Omit the alignment section from the main output. This can
greatly reduce the output volume.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--notextw <br>
Unlimit the length of each line in the main output. The
default is a limit of 120 characters per line, which helps
in displaying the output cleanly on terminals and in <br>
editors, but can truncate target profile description
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--textw &lt;n&gt; <br>
Set the main output&rsquo;s line length limit to &lt;n&gt;
characters per line. The default is 120.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS CONTROLLING REPORTING
THRESHOLDS <br>
Reporting thresholds control which hits are reported in
output files (the main output, --tblout, and --domtblout).
Sequence hits and domain hits are ranked by statistical
sig&acirc; <br>
nificance (E-value) and output is generated in two sections
called per-target and per-domain output. In per-target
output, by default, all sequence hits with an E-value &lt;=
10 are <br>
reported. In the per-domain output, for each target that has
passed per-target reporting thresholds, all domains
satisfying per-domain reporting thresholds are reported. By
<br>
default, these are domains with conditional E-values of
&lt;= 10. The following options allow you to change the
default E-value reporting thresholds, or to use bit score
thresholds <br>
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E &lt;x&gt; In the per-target
output, report target sequences with an E-value of &lt;=
&lt;x&gt;. The default is 10.0, meaning that on average,
about 10 false positives will be reported per <br>
query, so you can see the top of the noise and decide for
yourself if it&rsquo;s really noise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T &lt;x&gt; Instead of
thresholding per-profile output on E-value, instead report
target sequences with a bit score of &gt;= &lt;x&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--domE &lt;x&gt; <br>
In the per-domain output, for target sequences that have
already satisfied the per-profile reporting threshold,
report individual domains with a conditional E-value of
&lt;= <br>
&lt;x&gt;. The default is 10.0. A conditional E-value means
the expected number of additional false positive domains in
the smaller search space of those comparisons that <br>
already satisfied the per-target reporting threshold (and
thus must have at least one homologous domain already).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--domT &lt;x&gt; <br>
Instead of thresholding per-domain output on E-value,
instead report domains with a bit score of &gt;=
&lt;x&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS FOR INCLUSION THRESHOLDS
<br>
Inclusion thresholds are stricter than reporting thresholds.
Inclusion thresholds control which hits are considered to be
reliable enough to be included in an output alignment <br>
or a subsequent search round, or marked as significant
(&quot;!&quot;) as opposed to questionable (&quot;?&quot;)
in domain output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--incE &lt;x&gt; <br>
Use an E-value of &lt;= &lt;x&gt; as the per-target
inclusion threshold. The default is 0.01, meaning that on
average, about 1 false positive would be expected in every
100 <br>
searches with different query sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--incT &lt;x&gt; <br>
Instead of using E-values for setting the inclusion
threshold, instead use a bit score of &gt;= &lt;x&gt; as the
per-target inclusion threshold. By default this option is
unset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--incdomE &lt;x&gt; <br>
Use a conditional E-value of &lt;= &lt;x&gt; as the
per-domain inclusion threshold, in targets that have already
satisfied the overall per-target inclusion threshold. The
default <br>
is 0.01.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--incdomT &lt;x&gt; <br>
Instead of using E-values, use a bit score of &gt;=
&lt;x&gt; as the per-domain inclusion threshold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS FOR MODEL-SPECIFIC SCORE
THRESHOLDING <br>
Curated profile databases may define specific bit score
thresholds for each profile, superseding any thresholding
based on statistical significance alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use these options, the
profile must contain the appropriate (GA, TC, and/or NC)
optional score threshold annotation; this is picked up by
hmmbuild from Stockholm format align&acirc; <br>
ment files. Each thresholding option has two scores: the
per-sequence threshold &lt;x1&gt; and the per-domain
threshold &lt;x2&gt; These act as if -T&lt;x1&gt;
--incT&lt;x1&gt; --domT&lt;x2&gt; --incdomT&lt;x2&gt; <br>
has been applied specifically using each model&rsquo;s
curated thresholds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cut_ga <br>
Use the GA (gathering) bit scores in the model to set
per-sequence (GA1) and per-domain (GA2) reporting and
inclusion thresholds. GA thresholds are generally considered
to <br>
be the reliable curated thresholds defining family
membership; for example, in Pfam, these thresholds define
what gets included in Pfam Full alignments based on searches
<br>
with Pfam Seed models.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cut_nc <br>
Use the NC (noise cutoff) bit score thresholds in the model
to set per-sequence (NC1) and per-domain (NC2) reporting and
inclusion thresholds. NC thresholds are generally <br>
considered to be the score of the highest-scoring known
false positive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cut_tc <br>
Use the TC (trusted cutoff) bit score thresholds in the
model to set per-sequence (TC1) and per-domain (TC2)
reporting and inclusion thresholds. TC thresholds are
gener&acirc; <br>
ally considered to be the score of the lowest-scoring known
true positive that is above all known false positives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS CONTROLLING THE
ACCELERATION PIPELINE <br>
HMMER3 searches are accelerated in a three-step filter
pipeline: the MSV filter, the Viterbi filter, and the
Forward filter. The first filter is the fastest and most
approximate; <br>
the last is the full Forward scoring algorithm. There is
also a bias filter step between MSV and Viterbi. Targets
that pass all the steps in the acceleration pipeline are
then <br>
subjected to postprocessing -- domain identification and
scoring using the Forward/Backward algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changing filter thresholds only
removes or includes targets from consideration; changing
filter thresholds does not alter bit scores, E-values, or
alignments, all of which are <br>
determined solely in postprocessing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max Turn off all filters,
including the bias filter, and run full Forward/Backward
postprocessing on every target. This increases sensitivity
somewhat, at a large cost in <br>
speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--F1 &lt;x&gt; <br>
Set the P-value threshold for the MSV filter step. The
default is 0.02, meaning that roughly 2% of the highest
scoring nonhomologous targets are expected to pass the
fil&acirc; <br>
ter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--F2 &lt;x&gt; <br>
Set the P-value threshold for the Viterbi filter step. The
default is 0.001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--F3 &lt;x&gt; <br>
Set the P-value threshold for the Forward filter step. The
default is 1e-5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nobias <br>
Turn off the bias filter. This increases sensitivity
somewhat, but can come at a high cost in speed, especially
if the query has biased residue composition (such as a <br>
repetitive sequence region, or if it is a membrane protein
with large regions of hydrophobicity). Without the bias
filter, too many sequences may pass the filter with <br>
biased queries, leading to slower than expected performance
as the computationally intensive Forward/Backward algorithms
shoulder an abnormally heavy load.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER OPTIONS <br>
--nonull2 <br>
Turn off the null2 score corrections for biased
composition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z &lt;x&gt; Assert that the
total number of targets in your searches is &lt;x&gt;, for
the purposes of per-sequence E-value calculations, rather
than the actual number of targets seen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--domZ &lt;x&gt; <br>
Assert that the total number of targets in your searches is
&lt;x&gt;, for the purposes of per-domain conditional
E-value calculations, rather than the number of targets that
<br>
passed the reporting thresholds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--seed &lt;n&gt; <br>
Set the random number seed to &lt;n&gt;. Some steps in
postprocessing require Monte Carlo simulation. The default
is to use a fixed seed (42), so that results are exactly
<br>
reproducible. Any other positive integer will give different
(but also reproducible) results. A choice of 0 uses a
randomly chosen seed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tformat &lt;s&gt; <br>
Assert that the target sequence database file is in format
&lt;s&gt;. Accepted formats include fasta, embl, genbank,
ddbj, uniprot, stockholm, pfam, a2m, and afa. The default
<br>
is to autodetect the format of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cpu &lt;n&gt; <br>
Set the number of parallel worker threads to &lt;n&gt;. By
default, HMMER sets this to the number of CPU cores it
detects in your machine - that is, it tries to maximize the
<br>
use of your available processor cores. Setting &lt;n&gt;
higher than the number of available cores is of little if
any value, but you may want to set it to something less. You
<br>
can also control this number by setting an environment
variable, HMMER_NCPU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only available if
HMMER was compiled with POSIX threads support. This is the
default, but it may have been turned off at compile-time for
your site or <br>
machine for some reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stall <br>
For debugging the MPI master/worker version: pause after
start, to enable the developer to attach debuggers to the
running master and worker(s) processes. Send SIGCONT <br>
signal to release the pause. (Under gdb: (gdb) signal
SIGCONT) (Only available if optional MPI support was enabled
at compile-time.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mpi Run in MPI master/worker
mode, using mpirun. (Only available if optional MPI support
was enabled at compile-time.)</p>
