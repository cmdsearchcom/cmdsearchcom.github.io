<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fuse &acirc; Sinclair ZX Spectrum emulator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fuse [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Fuse is a Sinclair ZX Spectrum emulator. It supports several
models (including the 128), with quite faithful emulation of
the display and sound.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The emulator can load any of the
formats supported by libspectrum(3) &acirc; this includes
Z80, SNA and SZX snapshots, and PZX, TAP and TZX
virtual-tape files. Saving to SZX, Z80 and <br>
SNA snapshots and TZX and TAP tape files is supported. The
SLT extension to the Z80 format is partly supported (enough
for multi-load games); however, loading of the old DAT-file
<br>
variant is not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DSK, UDI, FDI, TD0, MGT, IMG,
D40, D80, SAD, TRD, SCL and OPD disk images are supported
when a disk interface is being emulated, including the
integrated disk drives on +3, Pen&acirc; <br>
tagon or Scorpion machines as well as the +D, DISCiPLE, Opus
Discovery, Beta 128 and Didaktik 80 interfaces. DCK
cartridge images are supported when emulating a Timex 2068
vari&acirc; <br>
ant. Interface 2 ROM cartridges are also supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, there is also support
for reading and writing the RZX input recording format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the COMPRESSED FILES section
for details on reading files compressed with bzip2(3),
gzip(3) or zip(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--accelerate-loader <br>
Specify whether Fuse should attempt to accelerate tape
loaders by &acirc;short circuiting&acirc; the loading loop.
This will in general speed up loading, but may cause some
loaders to <br>
fail. (Enabled by default, but you can use
&lsquo;--no-accelerate-loader&rsquo; to disable). The same
as the Media Options dialog&rsquo;s Accelerate loaders
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--aspect-hint <br>
Specify whether the GTK+ and Xlib user interfaces should
&lsquo;hint&rsquo; to the window manager about the preferred
aspect ratio for the graphics window, thus preventing
resizing to <br>
non-square sizes which lead to Fuse not displaying
correctly. This option has been observed to cause problems
with some window managers when using the GTK+ UI which can
<br>
prevent the window from being resized or moved at all.
(Enabled by default, but you can use
&lsquo;--no-aspect-hint&rsquo; to disable). See also the
&lsquo;--strict-aspect-hint&rsquo; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--autosave-settings <br>
Specify whether Fuse&rsquo;s current settings should be
automatically saved on exit. The same as the General Options
dialog&rsquo;s Auto-save settings option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--auto-load <br>
Specify whether tape and disk files should be automatically
loaded when they are opened using the File, Open... menu
option. In the case of TRD/SCL disk images, inserts <br>
also a boot loader file when none is available. (Enabled by
default, but you can use &lsquo;--no-auto-load&rsquo; to
disable). Same as the Media Options dialog&rsquo;s Auto-load
media <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--beta128 <br>
Emulate a Beta 128 interface. Same as the Disk Peripherals
Options dialog&rsquo;s Beta 128 interface option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--beta128-48boot <br>
When a Beta 128 interface is used in 48K or TC2048 emulation
the option additionally controls whether the machine boots
directly into the TR-DOS system. Same as the Disk <br>
Peripherals Options dialog&rsquo;s Beta 128 auto-boot in 48K
machines option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--betadisk file <br>
Insert the specified file into the emulated Beta disk
interface&rsquo;s drive A: and select Pentagon mode on
startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bw-tv <br>
Specify whether the display should simulate a colour or
black and white television. This option is effective under
the GTK+, Win32, Xlib and SDL user interfaces: the
oth&acirc; <br>
ers will always simulate a colour TV. The same as the
General Options dialog&rsquo;s Black and white TV
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cmos-z80 <br>
This option specifies that Fuse should emulate a CMOS Z80,
as opposed to an NMOS Z80. Same as the General Options
dialog&rsquo;s Z80 is CMOS option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--competition-code code <br>
Specify the code to be written to competition mode RZX
files. The same as the RZX Options dialog&rsquo;s
Competition code option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--competition-mode <br>
Specify whether input recordings should be made in
&lsquo;competition mode&rsquo;. The same as the RZX Options
dialog&rsquo;s Competition mode option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--compress-rzx <br>
Specify whether RZX files should be written out compressed.
(Enabled by default, but you can use
&lsquo;--no-compress-rzx&rsquo; to disable). Same as the RZX
Options dialog&rsquo;s Compress <br>
RZX data option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--confirm-actions <br>
Specify whether &lsquo;dangerous&rsquo; actions (those which
could cause data loss, for example resetting the Spectrum)
require confirmation before occurring. (Enabled by default,
but <br>
you can use &lsquo;--no-confirm-actions&rsquo; to disable).
This option is the same as the General Options
dialog&rsquo;s Confirm actions option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debugger-command string <br>
Specify a debugger command to be run before emulator
startup. This can be used to set breakpoints or the like.
Currently, this is the only method to input multi-line <br>
debugger commands. (See the MONITOR/DEBUGGER section for
more information).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--detect-loader <br>
Specify whether Fuse should attempt to detect when the tape
is being accessed and start and stop the virtual tape
playing automatically. (Enabled by default, but you can <br>
use &lsquo;--no-detect-loader&rsquo; to disable). Same as
the Media Options dialog&rsquo;s Detect loaders option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disciple <br>
Emulate a DISCiPLE interface. Same as the Disk Peripherals
Options dialog&rsquo;s DISCiPLE interface option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--discipledisk file <br>
Insert the specified file into the emulated DISCiPLE&rsquo;s
drive 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--didaktik80 <br>
Emulate a Didaktik 80 (or Didaktik 40) disk interface. Same
as the Disk Peripherals Options dialog&rsquo;s Didaktik 80
interface option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--didaktik80disk file <br>
Insert the specified file into the emulated Didaktik 80 (or
Didaktik 40)&rsquo;s drive A.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disk-ask-merge <br>
Prompt the user to confirm whether Fuse should try to merge
the &lsquo;B&rsquo; side of a disk image from a separate
file when opening a new single-sided disk image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disk-try-merge mode <br>
Select whether Fuse should try to merge a separate file for
the &lsquo;B&rsquo; side of a disk image separate file when
opening a new disk image. Most double sided disk images are
<br>
dumped as two single sided disk images e.g. &lsquo;Golden
Axe - Side A.dsk&rsquo; and &lsquo;Golden Axe - Side
B.dsk&rsquo;. So, if we want to play Golden Axe, first we
have to insert the first <br>
disk image and when the game asks to insert side B, we have
to find and open the second disk image, instead of just
&lsquo;flip&rsquo;-ing the disk inside the drive. If
enabled, Fuse <br>
will try to open the second image too and create a double
sided disk image (merging the two one sided disk images) and
insert this merged virtual disk into the disk drive. <br>
The function detects whether the file is one side of a
double-sided image if the filename matches a pattern like
[Ss]ide[ _][abAB12][ _.] in the file name of a disk that
<br>
is being opened. If found, Fuse will try to open the other
side of the disk too substituting the appropriate characters
in the filename e.g. 1&acirc;2, a&acirc;b, A&acirc;B. If
successful <br>
then it will merge the two images and now we have a double
sided disk in drive. This means that if we open
&lsquo;Golden Axe - Side A.dsk&rsquo;, then Fuse will try to
open &lsquo;Golden <br>
Axe - Side B.dsk&rsquo; too. Now, we can just
&lsquo;flip&rsquo; the disk if Golden Axe asks for
&lsquo;Side B&rsquo;. The available options are Never, With
single-sided drives and Always.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--divide <br>
Emulate the DivIDE interface. The same as the Disk
Peripherals Options dialog&rsquo;s DivIDE interface
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--divide-masterfile file <br>

Specify an IDE image to be loaded into the DivIDE&rsquo;s
emulated master and slave drives respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--divide-write-protect <br>
Specify that the emulated DivIDE&rsquo;s write protect
jumper should be considered set. The same as the Disk
Peripherals Options dialog&rsquo;s DivIDE write protect
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dock file <br>
Insert the specified file into the emulated Timex 2068
variant dock; also select the TC2068 on startup if
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D mode <br>
--doublescan-mode mode <br>
Specify whether to use doublescan modes in the FB UI.
Available values for mode are 0, 1 and 2. 0 means
&lsquo;never doublescan&rsquo; (use 640&Atilde;480 at either
72 Hz or 60 Hz), whereas <br>
1 and 2 both mean &lsquo;try to use doublescan&rsquo; and
will fall back on the 640&Atilde;480 modes. 1 selects 72 Hz
modes (the same size and shape as your typical
640&Atilde;480), and 2 selects <br>
60 Hz modes (overscan).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your monitor displays a blank
screen when using 1 or 2, press F10 then try a different
option or say &lsquo;--fbmode 640&rsquo;.</p>

section of ogg123(1) for up to date information of devices
and options (except for the &lsquo;file&rsquo; option which
is provided by Fuse itself).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are using libasound or
ALSA for sound output, the device parameter allows you to
specify the device used for sound output and some parameters
to be used for that <br>
device. In general, the device parameter has the form <br>
devstr or <br>
param[=value][,param[=value][,...][,devstr].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; devstr: selects

further explanation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; param and
values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; buffer=nnnn: set
the ALSA buffer in frames, smaller value cause smaller sound
delay but may more buffer underrun (pops and clicks), larger
value cause longer <br>
delay but fewer underrun. By default Fuse determine the
buffer size based on the actual sound frequency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use some special plugin
for your pcm device (e.g.: dmix) or your card not support
some needed parameter (e.g. cannot play other only 48 kHz
stereo <br>
sound like some AC97 sound card) may cause Fuse unable to
set the needed buffer size, appropriate sound frequency,
channels and so on, therefore you cannot <br>
get optimal result or not hear the sound at all. In this
case try the plughw:#, (where # mean your card number
counted from 0) for ALSA device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; verbose : if
given, fuse report ALSA buffer underruns to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some examples of use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fuse -d verbose,buffer=2000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">causes Fuse to use the default
ALSA device with 2000 frame length buffer and report ALSA
buffer underruns on stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fuse -d
tee:plughw:0,&rsquo;/tmp/aufwm.raw&rsquo;,raw</p>

card and parallel save the raw audio samples into
/tmp/aufwm.raw file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sound-force-8bit <br>
Force the use of 8-bit sound, even if 16-bit is possible.
Same as the Sound Options dialog&rsquo;s Force 8-bit
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f frequency <br>
--sound-freq frequency <br>
Specify what frequency Fuse should use for the sound device,
the default is 32 kHz, but some devices only support a
single frequency or a limited range (e.g. 48 kHz or up <br>
to 22 kHz).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--speaker-type type <br>
Select the output speaker emulation, type can be TV speaker,
Beeper or Unfiltered. Same as the Sound Options

accessed. Same as the General Options dialog&rsquo;s Show
statusbar option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--strict-aspect-hint <br>
For the GTK+ UI, use stricter limits for the aspect ratio
limits set by the &lsquo;--aspect-hint&rsquo; option. This
can cause some window managers (for example, metacity(1)) to
not <br>
allow the window to be resized and moved, but is necessary
to prevent others (for example, fvwm(1)) from being able
resize the window away from square.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--svga-modes mode1,mode2,mode3
<br>
Specify which SVGA mode to use for the SVGAlib UI at
different screen sizes. Available values for mode1, mode2
and mode3 are listed in a table, when Fuse called with <br>
--svga-modes list command line option. When user select a
not available mode for a size, Fuse just ignore and try to
find the best mode for it. e.g. with --svga-modes <br>
0,0,12 Fuse use the specified 1024&Atilde;768&Atilde;256
SVGA mode for triple size filters, but select SVGA modes
automatically for normal or double size filters. The above
mode number <br>
is just an example, and mode numbers and their meanings may
vary graphics card by graphics card.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t file <br>
--tape file <br>
Specify a virtual tape file to use. It must be in PZX, TAP

default, but you can use &lsquo;--no-traps&rsquo; to
disable). Same as the Media Options dialog&rsquo;s Use tape
traps option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unittests <br>
This option runs a testing framework that automatically
checks portions of code, comparing actual results with
expected ones. It is meant to detect broken code before a
<br>
release. There is not graphical mode, the program just ends
with exit code 0 if all tests are good or prints error
messages to stdout and ends with exit code greater than <br>
0 if there are failed tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usource <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All long options which control
on/off settings can be disabled using &lsquo;--no-foo&rsquo;
(for an option &lsquo;--foo&rsquo;). For example, the
opposite of &lsquo;--issue2&rsquo; is
&lsquo;--no-issue2&rsquo;. These options <br>
can also be modified while the emulator is running, using
the options dialogs &acirc; see the documentation for the
Options menu in the MENUS AND KEYS section for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE VARIOUS FRONT-ENDS <br>
Fuse supports various front-ends, or UIs (user interfaces).
The usual one is GTK+-based, but there are also SDL, Win32,
Xlib, SVGAlib and framebuffer ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The important difference to note
is that GTK+ and Win32 versions uses &lsquo;native&rsquo;
dialog boxes etc. (behaving like a fairly normal GUI-based
program) while the others use an alter&acirc; <br>
native, Fuse-specific &lsquo;widget UI&rsquo;. This latter
front-end is easily spotted by the way it uses the main Fuse
window/screen for menus and dialogs, and uses the
Spectrum&rsquo;s own font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MENUS AND KEYS <br>
Since many of the keys available are devoted to emulation of
the Spectrum&rsquo;s keyboard, the primary way of
controlling Fuse itself (rather than the emulated machine)
is via the <br>
menus. There are also function key shortcuts for some menu
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the GTK+ and Win32 version,
the menu bar is always visible at the top of the Fuse
window. You can click on a menu name to pop it up.
Alternatively, you can press F1 to display <br>
a pop-up version of the menu bar, which you can then
navigate with the cursor keys or mouse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the widget UI pressing F1 is
the only way to get the main menu; and unlike the GTK+
version, the emulator pauses while the menus are being
navigated. The menus show which key <br>
to press for each menu option in brackets. Pressing Esc
exits a menu, and pressing Enter exits the menu system
entirely (as well as &lsquo;confirming&rsquo; any current
dialog).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s what the menu
options do, along with the function key mappings for those
items which have them:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F3 <br>
File, Open... <br>
Open a Spectrum file. Snapshots will be loaded into memory;
tape images will be inserted into the emulated tape deck,
and if the Auto-load media option is set will being <br>
loading. Opening a disk image or a Timex dock image will
cause the appropriate machine type (+3, Pentagon or TC2068)
to be selected with the image inserted, and disks will <br>
automatically load if the Auto-load media option is set. See
the FILE SELECTION section below for details on how to
choose the file. Note that this behaviour is different <br>
from previous versions of Fuse, when this option would open
only snapshots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F2 <br>
File, Save Snapshot... <br>
Save a snapshot (machine state, memory contents, etc.) to
file. You can select the filename to be saved to. If it has
a .szx, .z80 or .sna extension, the snapshot will be <br>
saved in that format. Otherwise, it will be saved as a .szx
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File, Recording, Record... <br>
Start recording input to an RZX file, initialised from the
current emulation state. You will be prompted for a filename
to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File, Recording, Record from
snapshot... <br>
Start recording input to an RZX file, initialised from a
snapshot. You will first be asked for the snapshot to use
and then the file to save the recording to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File, Recording, Continue
recording... <br>
Continue recording input into an existing RZX file from the
last recorded state. Finalised recordings cannot be resumed.
You will be prompted for the recording to con&acirc; <br>
tinue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Insert <br>
File, Recording, Insert snapshot <br>
Inserts a snapshot of the current state into the RZX file.
This can be used at a later point to roll back to the
inserted state by using one of the commands below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete <br>
File, Recording, Rollback <br>
Rolls back the recording to the point at which the previous
snapshot was inserted. Recording will continue from that
point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File, Recording, Rollback to...
<br>
Roll back the recording to any snapshot which has been
inserted into the recording.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File, Recording, Play... <br>
Playback recorded input from an RZX file. This lets you
replay keypresses recorded previously. RZX files generally
contain a snapshot with the Spectrum&rsquo;s state at the
<br>
start of the recording; if the selected RZX file
doesn&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll be prompted for a snapshot to
load as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File, Recording, Stop <br>
Stop any currently-recording/playing RZX file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File, Recording, Finalise...
<br>
Compact a RZX file. Any interspersed snapshot will be
removed and the recording cannot be continued. All action
replays submitted to the RZX Archive should be
finalised.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File, AY Logging, Record... <br>
Start recording the bytes output via the AY-3-8912 sound
chip to a PSG file. You will be prompted for a filename to
save the recording to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File, AY Logging, Stop <br>
Stop any current AY logging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File, Open SCR Screenshot...
<br>
Load an SCR screenshot (essentially just a binary dump of
the Spectrum&rsquo;s video memory) onto the current screen.
Fuse supports screenshots saved in the Timex hi-colour and
<br>
hi-res modes as well as &lsquo;normal&rsquo; Spectrum
screens, and will make a simple conversion if a hi-colour or
hi-res screenshot is loaded onto a non-Timex machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File, Save Screen as SCR... <br>
Save a copy of whatever&rsquo;s currently displayed on the
Spectrum&rsquo;s screen as an SCR file. You will be prompted
for a filename to save the screenshot to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File, Save Screen as PNG... <br>
Save the current screen as a PNG file. You will be prompted
for a filename to save the screenshot to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File, Scalable Vector Graphics,
Start capture in line mode... <br>
Start trapping the video output functions present in ROM to
copy the picture to SVG files, thus creating vectorized
scalable picture; it is expected to be fully opera&acirc;
<br>
tional in BASIC only, but few machine code programs could
work, if they use the ROM addresses to output text or
graphics. The initial picture size is 256&Atilde;176, but it
is <br>
increased everytime a &lsquo;scroll&rsquo; happens. On every
CLS a new file will be created, with an increasing sequence
number. CIRCLEs will be described as a sequence of lines, so
<br>
the original &lsquo;imprecisions&rsquo; will be still
visible. The text output will be fully understood and
decoded: normal ASCII characters will be converted into
COURIER scalable <br>
fonts, UDG graphics into dot matrix areas, GRAPHICS blocky
characters into small squares. A slightly transparent output
permits to show a bit of the overlapped text and <br>
graphics elements. Lower portion of the screen (normally
bound to stream #0 and #1) won&rsquo;t be captured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File, Scalable Vector Graphics,
Start capture in dot mode... <br>
As above, but line capture is disabled. A line will be
rendered as a sequence of dots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File, Scalable Vector Graphics,
Stop capture <br>
Stop the SVG capture function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File, Movie, Record... <br>
Fuse can record movie (video and audio) into a file with
special format which can be converted later to a common
video file format with the fmfconv(1) utility. You will <br>
be prompted for a filename to save video. Please see MOVIE
RECORDING section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File, Movie, Record from RZX...
<br>
Start movie recording and RZX playback at the same time. You
will be prompted for a filename to play from and a filename
to save video.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File, Movie, Pause <br>
Pause movie recording which is currently in progress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File, Movie, Continue <br>
Resume movie recording which has been previously paused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File, Movie, Stop <br>
Stop movie recording which is currently in progress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File, Load Binary Data... <br>
Load binary data from a file into the Spectrum&rsquo;s
memory. After selecting the file to load data from, you can
choose where to load the data and how much data to load.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File, Save Binary Data... <br>
Save an arbitrary chunk of the Spectrum&rsquo;s memory to a
file. Select the file you wish to save to, followed by the
location and length of data you wish to save.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F10 <br>
File, Exit <br>
Exit the emulator. A confirmation dialog will appear
checking you actually want to do this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F4 <br>
Options, General... <br>
Display the General Options dialog, letting you configure
Fuse. (With the widget UI, the keys shown in brackets toggle
the options, Enter confirms any changes, and Esc <br>
aborts). Note that any changed settings only apply to the
currently-running Fuse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options available are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Emulation speed <br>
Set how fast Fuse will attempt to emulate the Spectrum, as a
percentage of the speed at which the real machine runs. If
your machine isn&rsquo;t fast enough to keep up <br>
with the requested speed, Fuse will just run as fast as it
can. Note that if the emulation speed is not exactly 100%,
no sound output will be produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Frame rate <br>
Specify the frame rate, the ratio of spectrum frame updates
to real frame updates. This is useful if your machine is
having trouble keeping up with the spectrum <br>
screen updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Issue 2 keyboard <br>
Early versions of the Spectrum used a different value for
unused bits on the keyboard input ports, and a few games
depended on the old value of these bits. Enabling <br>
this option switches to the old value, to let you run
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recreated ZX Spectrum <br>
Enable the use of a Recreated ZX Spectrum in &lsquo;Layer
A&rsquo; (game) mode. This is a Bluetooth keyboard that can
be paired to the device where Fuse is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use shift with arrow keys <br>
Treat the keyboard arrow keys as shifted like the ZX
Spectrum+ keyboard&rsquo;s arrow keys or as unshifted like a
cursor joystick that maps to the 5, 6, 7 and 8 keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allow writes to ROM <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will happily allow programs
to overwrite what would normally be ROM. This probably
isn&rsquo;t very useful in most circumstances, espe&acirc;
<br>
cially as the 48K ROM overwrites parts of itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Late timings <br>
If selected, Fuse will cause all screen-related timings (for
example, when the screen is rendered and when memory
contention occurs) to be one tstate later than <br>
&acirc;normal&acirc;, an effect which is present on some
real hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Z80 is CMOS <br>
If selected, Fuse will emulate a CMOS Z80, as opposed to an
NMOS Z80. The undocumented &lsquo;OUT (C),0&rsquo;
instruction will be replaced with &lsquo;OUT (C),255&rsquo;
and emulation of <br>
a minor timing bug in the NMOS Z80&rsquo;s &lsquo;LD
A,I&rsquo; and &lsquo;LD A,R&rsquo; instructions will be
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RS-232 handshake <br>
If you turn this option off, Fuse assumes the RS-232 line
other end is live when you connect the communication
channels. See also the &lsquo;--rs232-rx&rsquo; and
&lsquo;--rs232-tx&rsquo; <br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Black and white TV <br>
This option allows you to choose whether to simulate a
colour or black and white television. This is effective only
under the GTK+, Win32, Xlib and SDL user inter&acirc; <br>
faces: the others will always simulate a colour TV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAL-TV use TV2x effect <br>
This option allows you to choose whether the PAL TV 2x and
higher scalers also reproduce scanlines in the same way as
the TV 2x, TV 3x and Timex TV scalers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show statusbar <br>
For the GTK+ and Win32 UI, enables the statusbar beneath the
display. For the SDL UI, enables the status icons showing
whether the disk and tape are being accessed. <br>
This option has no effect for the other user interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snap joystick prompt <br>
If set, Fuse will prompt you which physical joystick or
keyboard you want to connect to the joystick interface
enabled in the snapshot unless it already matches <br>
your current configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Confirm actions <br>
Specify whether &lsquo;dangerous&rsquo; actions (those which
could cause data loss, for example resetting the Spectrum)
require confirmation before occurring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Auto-save settings <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will automatically write
its currently selected options to its configuration file on
exit (either in xml format if libxml2 was <br>
available when Fuse was compiled or plain text). If this
option is off, you&rsquo;ll have to manually use Options,
Save afterwards to ensure that this setting gets writ&acirc;
<br>
ten to Fuse&rsquo;s configuration file. Note that if you
turn this option on, loading a snapshot could enable
peripherals that would be written permanently to the
config&acirc; <br>
uration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options, Media... <br>
Display the Media Options dialog, letting you configure
Fuse&rsquo;s tape and Microdrive options. (With the widget
UI, the keys shown in brackets toggle the options, Enter
con&acirc; <br>
firms any changes, and Esc aborts). Note that any changed
settings only apply to the currently-running Fuse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Auto-load media <br>
On many occasions when you open a tape or disk file,
it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s got a program in you want to
load and run. If this option is selected, this will
automati&acirc; <br>
cally happen for you when you open one of these files using
the File, Open... menu option &acirc; you must then use the
Media menu to use tapes or disks for saving data <br>
to, or for loading data into an already running program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Detect loaders <br>
If this option is enabled, Fuse will attempt to detect when
a loading routine is in progress, and then automatically
start the virtual tape to load the program in. <br>
This is done by using a heuristic to identify a loading
routine, so is by no means infallible, but works in most
cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fastloading <br>
If this option is enabled, then Fuse will run at the fastest
possible speed when the virtual tape is playing, thus
dramatically reducing the time it takes to load <br>
programs. You may wish to disable this option if you wish to
stop the tape at a specific point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use tape traps <br>
Ordinarily, Fuse intercepts calls to the ROM tape-loading
routine in order to load from tape files more quickly when
possible. But this can (rarely) interfere with <br>
TZX loading; disabling this option avoids the problem at the
cost of slower (i.e. always real-time) tape-loading. When
tape-loading traps are disabled, you need to <br>
start tape playback manually, by pressing F8 or choosing the
Media, Tape, Play menu item. Fuse also uses tape traps to
intercept the tape-saving routine in the ROM <br>
to save tape files quickly, tapes can also be saved using
the Media, Tape, Record Start menu item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Accelerate loaders <br>
If this option is enabled, then Fuse will attempt to
accelerate tape loaders by &acirc;short circuiting&acirc;
the loading loop. This will in general speed up loading, but
may <br>
cause some loaders to fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use .slt traps <br>
The multi-load aspect of SLT files requires a trap
instruction to be supported. This instruction is not
generally used except for this trap, but since it&rsquo;s
not <br>
inconceivable that a program could be wanting to use the
real instruction instead, you can choose whether to support
the trap or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MDR cartridge len <br>
This option controls the number of blocks in a new
Microdrive cartridge. If the value smaller than 4 or greater
than 254 Fuse assumes 4 or 254.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Random length MDR cartridge <br>
If this option is enabled, Fuse will use a random Microdrive
cartridge length instead of the length specified in the MDR
cartridge len option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options, Sound... <br>
Display the Sound Options dialog, letting you configure
Fuse&rsquo;s sound output. (With the widget UI, the keys
shown in brackets toggle the options, Enter confirms any
<br>
changes, and Esc aborts). Note that any changed settings
only apply to the currently-running Fuse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sound enabled <br>
Specify whether sound output should be enabled at all. When
this option is disabled, Fuse will not make any sound.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Loading sound <br>
Normally, Fuse emulates tape-loading noise when loading from
PZXs, TAPs or TZXs in real-time, albeit at a deliberately
lower volume than on a real Spectrum. You can <br>
disable this option to eliminate the loading noise
entirely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AY stereo separation <br>
By default, the sound output is mono, since this is all you
got from an unmodified Spectrum. But enabling this option
gives you so-called ACB stereo (for sound from <br>
the 128 and other clone&rsquo;s AY-3-8912 sound chip).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Force 8-bit <br>
Force the use of 8-bit sound even if 16-bit (the default) is
available. Note that (when the option is enabled) if 8-bit
sound isn&rsquo;t available then there will be no <br>
sound at all, so it&rsquo;s best not to use this option
unless you have a specific need for it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Speaker type <br>
This option allows the emulation of the sound output system
to be modified. Different choices of speaker limit the bass
and treble response that can be produced <br>
from the machine. Choose between a &acirc;TV&acirc; type
speaker and a small &acirc;Beeper&acirc; type speaker that
significantly limits bass and treble response. Choose
&acirc;Unfiltered&acirc; to <br>
get unmodified (but less accurate) sound output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AY volume <br>
Sets the relative volume of the AY-3-8912 chip from a range
of 0&acirc;100%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beeper volume <br>
Sets the relative volume of the beeper from a range of
0&acirc;100%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SpecDrum volume <br>
Sets the relative volume of the SpecDrum from a range of
0&acirc;100%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options, Peripherals, General...
<br>
Display the General Peripherals Options dialog, letting you
configure the peripherals which Fuse will consider to be
attached to the emulated machine. (With the widget UI, <br>
the keys shown in brackets toggle the options, Enter
confirms any changes, and Esc aborts). Note that any changed
settings only apply to the currently-running Fuse. Also <br>
note that any changes that enable and disable peripherals
may result in a hard reset of the emulated machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kempston joystick <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate a Kempston
joystick interface (probably the most widely supported type
on the Spectrum). Note that this option is <br>
basically equivalent to plugging the interface itself into a
Spectrum, not to connecting a joystick; this affects how the
Spectrum responds to a read of input <br>
port 31. To use a Kempston joystick in a game, this option
must be enabled, and you must also select a Kempston
joystick the Options, Joysticks menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kempston mouse <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate a Kempston
mouse interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re using Fuse
full-screen, your mouse is automatically used as if attached
to the Kempston interface. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll need to
click on the Spectrum display <br>
in order to tell Fuse to grab the pointer (and make it
invisible); to tell Fuse to release it, click the middle
button (or wheel) or press Escape.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the framebuffer UI, Fuse
prefers to use GPM; if this is not available, it will fall
back to built-in PS/2 mouse support. In this mode, it tries
<br>
/dev/input/mice, /dev/mouse then /dev/psaux, stopping when
it successfully opens one. The first of these is preferred
since (at least on Linux, with a 2.6-series <br>
kernel) any type of mouse can be used and any connected
mouse may be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Swap mouse buttons <br>
If this option is enabled, the left and right mouse buttons
will be swapped when emulating a Kempston mouse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fuller Box <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate a Fuller Box
AY sound and joystick interface. This emulation is only
available for the 16k, 48k and TC2048 machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Melodik <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate a Melodik AY
sound interface. These interfaces and many similar ones were
produced to make the 48K Spectrum compati&acirc; <br>
ble with the same AY music as the 128K Spectrum. This
emulation is only available for the 16k, 48k and TC2048
machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interface 1 <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the simple
Sinclair Interface 1, and allow Microdrive cartridges to be
connected and disconnected via the Media, <br>
Interface 1, Microdrive menus. It also enables support for
the Interface 1 RS-232 interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interface 2 <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate a cartridge
port as found on the Interface 2. Cartridges can then be
inserted and removed via the Media, Cartridge, <br>
Interface 2 menu. Note that the Pentagon, Scorpion,
Interface 2, ZXATASP and ZXCF all use the same hardware
mechanism for accessing some of their extended features,
<br>
so only one of these should be selected at once or
unpredictable behaviour will occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Emulate printers <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate a printer. See
the PRINTER EMULATION section for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZX Printer <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the ZX
Printer. See the PRINTER EMULATION section for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SpeccyBoot interface <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate a SpeccyBoot
interface which allows booting a ZX Spectrum over an
Ethernet network. See the SpeccyBoot web page at <br>
http://patrikpersson.github.io/speccyboot/ for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SpecDrum interface <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate a Cheetah
SpecDrum sound interface. See the World of Spectrum Infoseek
web page at http://www.worldofspec&acirc; <br>
trum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=1000062 for manuals, software and
more. This emulation is only available for the 48k, 128k and
TC2048 machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spectranet <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the Spectranet
interface, which provides an Ethernet interface for the
Spectrum. See the SPECTRANET EMULATION section <br>
for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spectranet disable <br>
This option controls the state of the Spectranet automatic
page-in jumper (J2). See the SPECTRANET EMULATION section
for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&micro;Source <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate a Currah
&Acirc;&micro;Source interface. See the World of Spectrum
Infoseek web page at
http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infos&acirc; <br>
eekid.cgi?id=1000080 for the manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options, Peripherals, Disk...
<br>
Display the Disk Peripherals Options dialog, letting you
configure the disk interface peripherals which Fuse will
consider to be attached to the emulated machine. (With <br>
the widget UI, the keys shown in brackets toggle the
options, Enter confirms any changes, and Esc aborts). Note
that any changed settings only apply to the
currently-run&acirc; <br>
ning Fuse. Also note that any changes that enable and
disable peripherals may result in a hard reset of the
emulated machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simple 8-bit IDE <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the simple
8-bit IDE interface as used by the Spectrum +3e, and allow
hard disks to be connected and disconnected via <br>
the Media, IDE, Simple 8-bit menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZXATASP interface <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the ZXATASP
interface, which provides both additional RAM and an IDE
interface. See the ZXATASP AND ZXCF section for <br>
more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZXATASP upload <br>
This option controls the state of the ZXATASP upload jumper.
See the ZXATASP AND ZXCF section for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZXATASP write protect <br>
This option controls the state of the ZXATASP write protect
jumper. See the ZXATASP AND ZXCF section for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZXCF interface <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the ZXCF
interface, which provides both additional RAM and a
CompactFlash interface. See the ZXATASP AND ZXCF section
<br>
for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZXCF upload <br>
This option controls the state of the ZXCF upload jumper.
See the ZXATASP AND ZXCF section for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DivIDE interface <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the DivIDE
interface. See the DIVIDE section for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DivIDE write protect <br>
This option controls the state of the DivIDE write
protection jumper. See the DIVIDE section for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+D interface <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the +D
interface. See the +D EMULATION section for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Didaktik 80 interface <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the Didaktik
80 (or Didaktik 40) interface. See the DIDAKTIK 80 EMULATION
section for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISCiPLE interface <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the DISCiPLE
interface. See the DISCIPLE EMULATION section for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beta 128 interface <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the Beta 128
interface. See the BETA 128 EMULATION section for more
details. Beta 128 emulation is enabled for the <br>
Pentagon and Scorpion machines regardless of this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beta 128 auto-boot in 48K
machines <br>
If this option is selected, then when a Beta 128 interface
is used in 48K or TC2048 emulation, the machine will boot
directly into the TR-DOS system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Opus Discovery interface <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the Opus
Discovery interface. See the OPUS DISCOVERY EMULATION
section for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options, RZX... <br>
Display the RZX Options dialog, letting you configure how
Fuse&rsquo;s deals with RZX input recordings. (With the
widget UI, the keys shown in brackets toggle the options,
Enter <br>
confirms any changes, and Esc aborts). Note that any changed
settings only apply to the currently-running Fuse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create autosaves <br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will add a snapshot into
the recording stream every 5 seconds while creating an RZX
file, thus enabling the rollback facilities to <br>
be used without having to explicitly add snapshots into the
stream. Older snapshots will be pruned from the stream to
keep the file size and number of snapshots <br>
down: each snapshot up to 15 seconds will be kept, then one
snapshot every 15 seconds until one minute, then one
snapshot every minute until 5 minutes, and then one <br>
snapshot every 5 minutes. Note that this
&acirc;pruning&acirc; applies only to automatically inserted
snapshots: snapshots manually inserted into the stream will
never be <br>
pruned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compress RZX data <br>
If this option is selected, and zlib was available when Fuse
was compiled, any RZX files written by Fuse will be
compressed. This is generally a good thing as it <br>
makes the files significantly smaller, and you probably want
to turn it off only if you&rsquo;re debugging the RZX files
or there&rsquo;s some other program which doesn&rsquo;t
sup&acirc; <br>
port compressed RZX files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Competition mode <br>
Any input recordings which are started when this option is
selected will be made in &lsquo;competition mode&rsquo;. In
essence, this means that Fuse will act just like a real <br>
Spectrum would: you can&rsquo;t load snapshots, pause the
emulation in any way, change the speed or anything that you
couldn&rsquo;t do on the real machine. If any of these <br>
things are attempted, or if the emulated Fuse is running
more than 5% faster or slower than normal Spectrum speed,
then the recording will immediately be stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If libgcrypt was available when
Fuse was compiled, then recordings made with competition
mode active will be digitally signed, in theory to
&lsquo;certify&rsquo; that it was <br>
made with the above restrictions in place. However, this
procedure is not secure (and cannot be made so), so the
presence of any signature on an RZX file should <br>
not be taken as providing proof that it was made with
competition mode active. This feature is included in Fuse
solely as it was one of the requirements for Fuse <br>
to be used in an on-line tournament.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Competition code <br>
The numeric code entered here will be written into any RZX
files made in competition mode. This is another feature for
on-line tournaments which can be used to <br>
&lsquo;prove&rsquo; that the recording was made after a
specific code was released. If you&rsquo;re not playing in
such a tournament, you can safely ignore this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Always embed snapshot <br>
Specify whether a snapshot should be embedded in an RZX file
when recording is started from an existing snapshot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options, Movie... <br>
Display the Movie Options dialog, letting you configure how
Fuse&rsquo;s deals with movie recordings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Movie compression <br>
This option set the compression level to None, Lossless or
High. (See the MOVIE RECORDING section for more
information).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stop recording after RZX ends
<br>
If this option is selected, Fuse will stop any movie
recording after a RZX playback is finished.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options, Joysticks <br>
Fuse can emulate many of the common types of joystick which
were available for the Spectrum. The input for these
emulated joysticks can be taken from real joysticks <br>
attached to the emulating machine (configured via the
Options, Joysticks, Joystick 1... and Options, Joysticks,
Joystick 2... options), or from the q, a, o, p, and Space
<br>
keys on the emulating machines keyboard, configured via the
Options, Joysticks, Keyboard... option. Note that when using
the keyboard to emulate a joystick, the q, a, o, <br>
p, and Space keys will not have their normal effect (to
avoid problems with games which do things like use p for
pause when using a joystick).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each of the joysticks (including
the &lsquo;fake&rsquo; keyboard joystick) can be configured
to emulate any one of the following joystick types:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">None <br>
No joystick: any input will simply be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cursor <br>
A cursor joystick, equivalent to pressing 5 (left), 6
(down), 7 (up), 8 (right), and 0 (fire).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kempston <br>
A Kempston joystick, read from input port 31. Note that the
Options, Peripherals, General, Kempston interface option
must also be set for the input to be <br>
recognised.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sinclair 1 <br>
Sinclair 2 <br>
The &lsquo;left&rsquo; and &lsquo;right&rsquo; Sinclair
joysticks, equivalent to pressing 1 (left), 2 (right), 3
(down), 4 (up), and 5 (fire), or 6 (left), 7 (right), 8
(down), 9 <br>
(up), and 0 (fire) respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Timex 1 <br>
Timex 2 <br>
The &lsquo;left&rsquo; and &lsquo;right&rsquo; joysticks as
attached to the Timex 2068 variant&rsquo;s built-in joystick
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the real joysticks, it is
also possible to configure what effect each button on the
joystick will have: this can be Joystick Fire, equivalent to
pressing the emulated <br>
joystick&rsquo;s fire button, Nothing, meaning to have no
effect, or any Spectrum key, meaning that pressing that
button will be equivalent to pressing that Spectrum key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options, Select ROMs, Machine
ROMs <br>
An individual dialog is available for each Spectrum variant
emulated by Fuse which allows selection of the ROM(s) used
by that machine. Simply select the ROM you wish to <br>
use, and then reset the Spectrum for the change to take
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options, Select ROMs, Peripheral
ROMs <br>
The same as the Machine ROMs menu, but an individual dialog
is available for peripherals that need a ROM. Simply select
the ROM you wish to use, and then reset the Spec&acirc; <br>
trum for the change to take effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options, Filter... <br>
Select the graphics filter currently in use. See the
GRAPHICS FILTERS section for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F11 <br>
Options, Full Screen <br>
Switch Fuse between full screen and windowed mode. This menu
is only available under the SDL UI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options, Disk Options... <br>
When emulating disk drives, Fuse allows the specification of
the physical drive units attached to the emulated interface.
Each drive can be set to be one of the following <br>
types:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Single-sided 40 track</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Double-sided 40 track</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Single-sided 80 track</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Double-sided 80 track</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Disabled option is not
supported for Drive 1 or Drive A of any interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The available options that can
be set are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+3 Drive A <br>
Defaults to a single-sided 40 track drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+3 Drive B <br>
Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+3 Detect Speedlock <br>
Specify whether the +3 drives try to detect Speedlock
protected disks, and emulate &lsquo;weak&rsquo; sectors. If
the disk image file (EDSK or UDI) contains weak sector data,
<br>
than Speedlock detection is automatically omitted. See also
the WEAK DISK DATA section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beta 128 Drive A <br>
Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beta 128 Drive B <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beta 128 Drive D <br>
Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+D Drive 1 <br>
Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Opus Drive 1 <br>
Defaults to a single-sided 40 track drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Opus Drive 2 <br>
Defaults to a single-sided 40 track drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Try merge &rsquo;B&rsquo; side
of disks <br>
This option prompts the user to confirm whether Fuse should
try to merge the &lsquo;B&rsquo; side of a disk image from a
separate file when opening a new single-sided disk <br>
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Confirm merge disk sides <br>
Select whether Fuse should try to merge a separate file for
the &lsquo;B&rsquo; side of a disk image separate file when
opening a new disk image. Most double sided disk images <br>
are dumped as two single sided disk images e.g.
&lsquo;Golden Axe - Side A.dsk&rsquo; and &lsquo;Golden Axe
- Side B.dsk&rsquo;. So, if we want to play Golden Axe,
first we have to insert <br>
the first disk image and when the game asks to insert side
B, we have to find and open the second disk image, instead
of just &lsquo;flip&rsquo;-ing the disk inside the drive.
<br>
If enabled, Fuse will try to open the second image too and
create a double sided disk image (merging the two one sided
disk images) and insert this merged virtual <br>
disk into the disk drive. The function detects whether the
file is one side of a double-sided image if the filename
matches a pattern like [Ss]ide[ _][abAB12][ _.] <br>
in the file name of a disk that is being opened. If found,
Fuse will try to open the other side of the disk too
substituting the appropriate characters in the file&acirc;
<br>
name e.g. 1&acirc;2, a&acirc;b, A&acirc;B. If successful
then it will merge the two images and now we have a double
sided disk in drive. This means that if we open
&lsquo;Golden Axe - <br>
Side A.dsk&rsquo;, then Fuse will try to open &lsquo;Golden
Axe - Side B.dsk&rsquo; too. Now, we can just
&lsquo;flip&rsquo; the disk if Golden Axe asks for
&lsquo;Side B&rsquo;. The available options are <br>
Never, With single-sided drives and Always.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options, Save <br>
This will cause Fuse&rsquo;s current options to be written
to .fuserc in your home directory (Unix-like systems), or
fuse.cfg in your %USERPROFILE% folder (Windows), from <br>
which they will be picked up again when Fuse is restarted.
The best way to update this file is by using this option,
but it&rsquo;s a simple XML file if libxml2 was <br>
available when Fuse was compiled (otherwise, plain text),
and shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to edit by hand if you
really want to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pause <br>
Machine, Pause <br>
Pause or unpause emulation. This option is available only
under the GTK+ and Win32 UIs; to pause the other user
interfaces, simply press F1 to bring up the main <br>
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F5 <br>
Machine, Reset <br>
Reset the emulated Spectrum.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Machine, Hard reset <br>
Reset the emulated Spectrum. A hard reset is equivalent to
turning the Spectrum&rsquo;s power off, and then turning it
back on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F9 <br>
Machine, Select... <br>
Choose a type of Spectrum to emulate. An brief overview of
the Sinclair, Amstrad and Timex can be found at

trum.org/faq/reference/tmxreference.htm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spectrum 16K <br>
Spectrum 48K <br>
The original machines as released by Sinclair in 1982 with
16 or 48K of RAM respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spectrum 48K (NTSC) <br>
The NTSC 48K machine released in limited numbers in parts of
South America.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spectrum 128K <br>
The 128K machine as released by Sinclair in 1985 (Spain) or
1986 (UK).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spectrum +2 <br>
The first machine released by Amstrad, in 1986. From an
emulation point of view, the +2 is virtually identical to
the 128K.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spectrum +2A <br>
Spectrum +3 <br>
The two machines released by Amstrad in 1988. Technically
very similar to each other, except that the +3 features a
3&acirc;&sup3; disk drive while the +2A does not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spectrum +3e <br>
A +3 with modified ROMs allowing access to IDE hard disks
via the simple 8-bit interface, as activated from the
Options, Peripherals, Disk... dialog. See <br>
http://www.worldofspectrum.org/zxplus3e/ for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Timex TC2048 <br>
Timex TC2068 <br>
The variants of the Spectrum as released by Timex in
Portugal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Timex TS2068 <br>
The variant of the Spectrum released by Timex in North
America.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pentagon 128K <br>
Russian clone of the Spectrum. There were many different
machines called Pentagon from 1989 to 2006, this machine
corresponds to a 1991 era Pentagon 128K <br>
with the optional AY sound chip and the integrated Beta 128
disk interface, and is the version of the machine most often
emulated. More technical details can <br>
be found at
http://www.worldofspectrum.org/rusfaq/index.html,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pentagon 512K <br>
Pentagon 1024K <br>
Newer versions of the Pentagon Russian Spectrum clones which
incorporate more memory and the &acirc;Mr Gluk Reset
Service&acirc; ROM offering a more powerful firmware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scorpion ZS 256 <br>
Another Russian clone of the Spectrum. Some details can be
found at http://www.worldofspectrum.org/rusfaq/index.html.
Like all the Russian clones, they have <br>
built in 3.5&acirc;&sup3; disk drives, accessed via the Beta
128 disk interface and TR-DOS (the Technology Research Disk
Operating System). The most important distinc&acirc; <br>
tion from the Pentagon 128k and similar machines is the
display timing details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spectrum SE <br>
A recent variant designed by Andrew Owen and Jarek Adamski,
which is possibly best thought of as a cross between the
128K machine and the Timex variants, <br>
allowing 272K of RAM to be accessed. Some more details are
available at
http://www.worldofspectrum.org/faq/reference/sereference.htm
and documentation of the <br>
extended BASIC is available at
https://github.com/cheveron/sebasic4/wiki. The bug tracker
for the BASIC is at https://github.com/cheveron/seba&acirc;

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Machine, Debugger... <br>
Start the monitor/debugger. See the MONITOR/DEBUGGER section
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Machine, Poke Finder... <br>
Start the &lsquo;poke finder&rsquo;. See the POKE FINDER
section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Machine, Poke Memory... <br>
Allow one to use multiface POKEs for things such as infinite
lives. See the POKE MEMORY section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Machine, Memory Browser... <br>
Start the memory browser. It should be fairly obvious what
this does; perhaps the only thing worth noting is that
emulation is paused until you close the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Machine, NMI <br>
Sends a non-maskable interrupt to the emulated Spectrum. Due
to a typo in the standard 48K ROM, this will cause a reset,
but modified ROMs are available which make <br>
use of this feature. When the +D (or DISCiPLE) is emulated,
this is used to access the +D (or DISCiPLE)&rsquo;s
screenshot and snapshot features (see the +D EMULATION and
<br>
DISCIPLE EMULATION sections below). For the DISCiPLE, Caps
Shift must be held down whilst pressing the NMI button. For
some UIs, this may be tricky, or even <br>
impossible to do. Note that GDOS on the DISCiPLE contains a
bug which causes corruption of saved snapshots, and a
failure to return from the NMI menu correctly. <br>
This bug is not present in G+DOS on the +D.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Machine, Didaktik SNAP <br>
Presses the Didaktik 80 (or Didaktik 40)&rsquo;s
&lsquo;SNAP&rsquo; button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F7 <br>
Media, Tape, Open... <br>
Choose a PZX, TAP or TZX virtual-tape file to load from. See
the FILE SELECTION section below for details on how to
choose the file. If Auto-load media is set in <br>
the Media Options dialog (as it is by default), you may use
the File, Open... menu option instead, and the tape will
begin loading automatically. Otherwise, you <br>
have to start the load in the emulated machine (with LOAD
&quot;&quot; or the 128&rsquo;s Tape Loader option, though
you may need to reset first).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To guarantee that TZX files will
load properly, you should select the file, make sure
tape-loading traps are disabled in the Media Options dialog,
then press F8 (or <br>
do Media, Tape, Play). That said, most TZXs will work with
tape-loading traps enabled (often quickly loading partway,
then loading the rest real-time), so you <br>
might want to try it that way first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F8 <br>
Media, Tape, Play <br>
Start playing the PZX, TAP or TZX file, if required.
(Choosing the option (or pressing F8) again pauses playback,
and a further press resumes). To explain &acirc; if <br>
tape-loading traps have been disabled (in the Media Options
dialog), starting the loading process in the emulated
machine isn&rsquo;t enough. You also have to &lsquo;press
<br>
play&rsquo;, so to speak :-), and this is how you do that.
You may also need to &lsquo;press play&rsquo; like this in
certain other circumstances, e.g. TZXs containing multi-load
<br>
games may have a stop-the-tape request (which Fuse
obeys).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Media, Tape, Browse <br>
Browse through the current tape. A brief display of each of
the data blocks on the current tape will appear, from which
you can select which block Fuse will play <br>
next. With the GTK+ UI, emulation will continue while the
browser is displayed; double-clicking on a block will select
it. In the other UIs, emulation is paused and <br>
you can use the cursor keys and press Enter to select it. If
you decide you don&rsquo;t want to change block, just press
Escape.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Media, Tape, Rewind <br>
Rewind the current virtual tape, so it can be read again
from the beginning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Media, Tape, Clear <br>
Clear the current virtual tape. This is particularly useful
when you want a &lsquo;clean slate&rsquo; to add newly-saved
files to, before doing Media, Tape, Write... (or F6).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F6 <br>
Media, Tape, Write... <br>
Write the current virtual-tape contents to a TZX file. You
will be prompted for a filename. The virtual-tape contents
are the contents of the previously-loaded tape <br>
(if any has been loaded since you last did a Media, Tape,
Clear), followed by anything you&rsquo;ve saved from the
emulated machine since. These newly-saved files are <br>
not written to any tape file until you choose this
option!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Media, Tape, Record Start <br>
Starts directly recording the output from the emulated
Spectrum to the current virtual-tape. This is useful when
you want to record using a non-standard ROM or from <br>
a custom save routine. Most tape operations are disabled
during recording. Stop recording with the Media, Tape,
Write... menu option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Media, Tape, Record Stop <br>
Stops the direct recording and places the new recording into
the virtual-tape.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Media, Interface 1 <br>
Virtual Microdrive images are accessible only when the
Interface 1 is active from the Options, Peripherals,
General... dialog. Note that any changes to the Micro&acirc;
<br>
drive image will not be written to the file on disk until
the appropriate save option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Media, Interface 1, Microdrive
1, Insert New <br>
Insert a new (unformatted) Microdrive cartridge into
emulated Microdrive 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Media, Interface 1, Microdrive
1, Insert... <br>
Insert an existing Microdrive cartridge image into emulated
Microdrive 1. You will be prompted for a filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Media, Interface 1, Microdrive
1, Eject <br>
Eject the Microdrive image in Microdrive 1. If the image has
been modified, you will be asked as to whether you want any
changes saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Media, Interface 1, Microdrive
1, Save <br>
Save the Microdrive image in Microdrive 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Media, Interface 1, Microdrive

Write the Microdrive image in Microdrive 1 to a file. You
will be prompted for a filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Media, Interface 1, Microdrive

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Media, Disk <br>
Virtual floppy disk images are accessible when emulating a
+3, +3e, Pentagon or Scorpion, or when the Beta 128, Opus
Discovery, +D, Didaktik or DISCiPLE interface <br>
options are enabled and a machine compatible with the chosen
interface is selected. (See THE .DSK FORMAT, BETA 128

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help, Keyboard picture... <br>
Display a diagram showing the Spectrum keyboard, and the
various keywords that can be generated with each key from
(48K) BASIC. Under the GTK+ and Win32 UIs, this <br>
will appear in a separate window and emulation continues.
With the other UIs, the picture remains onscreen (and the
emulator paused) until you press Esc or Enter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEY MAPPINGS <br>
When emulating the Spectrum, keys F1 to F10 are used as
shortcuts for various menu items, as described above. The
alphanumeric keys (along with Enter and Space) are mapped
as-is <br>
to the Spectrum keys. The other key mappings are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift emulated as Caps Shift</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control, Alt, and Meta <br>
emulated as Symbol Shift (most other modifiers are also
mapped to this)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backspace <br>
emulated as Caps&acirc;0 (Delete)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Esc emulated as Caps&acirc;1
(Edit)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caps Lock <br>
emulated as Caps&acirc;2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cursor keys <br>
emulated as Caps&acirc;5/6/7/8 (as appropriate)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tab emulated as Caps
Shift&acirc;Symbol Shift (Extended Mode)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some further punctuation keys
are supported, if they exist on your keyboard &acirc;
&lsquo;,&rsquo;, &lsquo;.&rsquo;, &lsquo;/&rsquo;,
&lsquo;;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo;, &lsquo;#&rsquo;,
&lsquo;-&rsquo;, and &lsquo;=&rsquo;. These are mapped to
the appropriate symbol-shifted keys <br>
on the Spectrum.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A list of keys applicable when
using the file selection dialogs is given in the FILE
SELECTION section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAY SIZE <br>
Some of Fuse&rsquo;s UIs allow resizing of the emulated
Spectrum&rsquo;s display. For the window-based ones (GTK+,
Win32 and Xlib), you can resize the window by, well,
resizing it. :-) <br>
Exactly how this works depends on your window manager; you
may have to make the window over twice the width and height
of the original size before it actually scales up. Fuse <br>
attempts to keep the window &lsquo;square&rsquo;, but with
some window managers this can mean the window will never
resize at all. If you experience this problem, the
&lsquo;--no-aspect-hint&rsquo; <br>
option may help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re using the SDL UI
under X11 or GTK+, the window will automatically resize to
be the correct size for the graphics filter selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRAPHICS FILTERS <br>
Fuse has the ability to apply essentially arbitrary filters
between building its image of the Spectrum&rsquo;s screen,
and displaying it on the emulating machine&rsquo;s monitor.
These fil&acirc; <br>
ters can be used to do various forms of smoothing, emulation
of TV scanlines and various other possibilities. Support for
graphics filters varies between the different user <br>
interfaces, but there are two general classes: the GTK+,
Win32, Xlib, SVGAlib and SDL user interfaces (and the saving
of .png screenshots) support &lsquo;interpolating&rsquo;
filters which <br>
use a palette larger than the Spectrum&rsquo;s 16 colours,
while the framebuffer user interface currently does not
support filters at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A further complication arises
due to the fact that the Timex machines have their
high-resolution video mode with twice the horizontal
resolution. To deal with this, Fuse treats <br>
these machines as having a &lsquo;normal&rsquo; display size
which is twice the size of a normal Spectrum&rsquo;s screen,
leading to a different set of filters being available for
these machines. <br>
Note that any of the double or triple-sizing filters are
available for Timex machines only when using the SDL, Win32
or GTK+ user interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The available filters, along
with their short name used to select them from the command
line, are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Timex half (smoothed) (half)
<br>
Timex half (skipping) (halfskip) <br>
Two Timex-machine specific filters which scale the screen
down to half normal (Timex) size; that is, the same size as
a normal Spectrum screen. The difference between <br>
these two filters is in how they handle the high-resolution
mode: the &lsquo;smoothed&rsquo; version is an interpolating
filter which averages pairs of adjacent pixels, while the
<br>
&lsquo;skipping&rsquo; version is a non-interpolating filter
which simply drops every other pixel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normal (normal) <br>
The simplest filter: just display one pixel for every pixel
on the Spectrum&rsquo;s screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Double size (2x) <br>
Scale the displayed screen up to double size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Triple size (3x) <br>
Scale the displayed screen up to triple size. Available only
with the GTK+, Win32, Xlib and SDL user interfaces or when
saving screenshots of non-Timex machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2xSaI (2xsai) <br>
Super 2xSaI (super2xsai) <br>
SuperEagle (supereagle) <br>
Three interpolating filters which apply successively more
smoothing. All three double the size of the displayed
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AdvMAME2x (advmame2x) <br>
A double-sizing, non-interpolating filter which attempts to
smooth diagonal lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AdvMAME3x (advmame3x) <br>
Very similar to AdvMAME2x, except that it triples the size
of the displayed screen. Available only with the GTK+,
Win32, Xlib and SDL user interfaces or when saving <br>
screenshots of non-Timex machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TV 2x (tv2x) <br>
TV 3x (tv3x) <br>
Timex TV (timextv) <br>
Three filters which attempt to emulate the effect of
television scanlines. The first is a double-sizing filter
for non-Timex machines, the second is a similar
triple-siz&acirc; <br>
ing filter, while the last is a single-sizing filter for
Timex machines (note that this means TV 2X and Timex TV
produce the same size output).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAL TV (paltv) <br>
PAL TV 2x (paltv2x) <br>
PAL TV 3x (paltv3x) <br>
Three filters which attempt to emulate the effect of the PAL
TV system which layers a lower-resolution colour image over
the top of a higher-resolution black-and-white <br>
image. The filters can also optionally add scanlines like
the other TV series scalers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dot matrix (dotmatrix) <br>
A double-sizing filter which emulates the effect of a
dot-matrix display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Timex 1.5x (timex15x) <br>
An interpolating Timex-specific filter which scales the
Timex screen up to 1.5&Atilde; its usual size (which is
therefore 3&Atilde; the size of a &lsquo;normal&rsquo;
Spectrum screen). Available <br>
only for the GTK+, Win32 and SDL user interfaces or when
saving screenshots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HQ 2x (hq2x) <br>
HQ 3x (hq3x) <br>
Two filters which do high quality (but slow) antialiasing.
Doubles and triples the size of the displayed screen
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE EMULATED SPECTRUM <br>
The emulated Spectrum is, by default, an unmodified 48K
Spectrum with a tape player and ZX Printer attached. Oh, and
apparently some magical snapshot load/save machine which is
<br>
probably best glossed over for the sake of the analogy.
:-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To emulate different kinds of
Spectrum, select the Machine, Select... menu option, or
press F9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Spectrum emulation is paused
when any dialogs appear. In the widget UI, it&rsquo;s also
paused when menus or the keyboard picture are displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRINTER EMULATION <br>
The various models of Spectrum supported a range of ways to
connect printers, three of which are supported by Fuse.
Different printers are made available for the different
mod&acirc; <br>
els:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">16, 48, TC2048, TC2068, TS2068
<br>
ZX Printer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">128/+2/Pentagon <br>
Serial printer (text-only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+2A, +3 <br>
Parallel printer (text-only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Opus Discovery, +D or
DISCiPLE emulation is in use and printer emulation is
enabled, text-only emulation of the disk interface&rsquo;s
parallel printer interface is provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any printout is appended to one
(or both) of two files, depending on the printer &acirc;
these default to printout.txt for text output, and
printout.pbm for graphics (PBM images are <br>
supported by most image viewers and converters). These names
can be changed with the --textfile and --graphicsfile
options from the command line or configuration file. While
the <br>
ZX Printer can only output graphically, simulated text
output is generated at the same time using a crude sort of
OCR based on the current character set (a bit like using
<br>
SCREEN$). There is currently no support for graphics when
using the serial/parallel output, though any escape codes
used will be &lsquo;printed&rsquo; faithfully. (!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By the way, it&rsquo;s not a
good idea to modify the printout.pbm file outside of Fuse if
you want to continue appending to it. The header needs to
have a certain layout for Fuse to be <br>
able to continue appending to it correctly, and the file
will be overwritten if it can&rsquo;t be appended to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZXATASP AND ZXCF <br>
The ZXATASP and ZXCF interfaces are two peripherals designed
by Sami Vehmaa which significantly extend the capabilities
of the Spectrum. More details on both are available from
<br>
Sami&rsquo;s homepage, http://user.tninet.se/~vjz762w/, but
a brief overview is given here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The real ZXATASP comes with
either 128K or 512K of RAM and the ability to connect an IDE
hard disks and a CompactFlash card, while the ZXCF comes
with 128K, 512K or 1024K of RAM <br>
and the ability to connect a CompactFlash card. From an
emulation point of view, the two interfaces are actually
very similar as a CompactFlash card is logically just an IDE
hard <br>
disk. Currently, Fuse&rsquo;s emulation is fixed at having
512K of RAM in the ZXATASP and 1024K in the ZXCF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To activate the ZXATASP, simply
select the ZXATASP interface option from the Options,
Peripherals, Disk... dialog. The state of the upload and
write protect jumpers is then con&acirc; <br>
trolled by the ZXATASP upload and ZXATASP write protect
options. Similarly, the ZXCF is controlled by the ZXCF
interface and ZXCF upload options (the ZXCF write protect is
soft&acirc; <br>
ware controlled).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re using either the
ZXATASP or ZXCF, you almost certainly want to investigate
ResiDOS, the operating system designed for use with the
ZXATASP and ZXCF. ResiDOS provides <br>
facilities for using the extra RAM, accessing the mass
storage devices and a task manager allowing virtually
instant switching between programs on the Spectrum. See <br>
http://www.worldofspectrum.org/residos/ for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIVIDE <br>
The DivIDE is another IDE interface for the Spectrum, of
which full details can be found at
http://web.archive.org/web/20150302052256/http://baze.au.com/divide/.
The interface <br>
can be activated via the DivIDE interface option from the
Options, Peripherals, Disk... dialog, and the state of its
write protect jumper controlled via the DivIDE write protect
<br>
option. If you&rsquo;re going to be using the DivIDE,
you&rsquo;ll probably want one of the firmwares available
from the DivIDE homepage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPECTRANET EMULATION <br>
The Spectranet is an Ethernet network interface for the ZX
Spectrum by Dylan Thomas. The interface can be activated via
the Spectranet option on the Peripherals preferences
dia&acirc; <br>
log, and the state of its automatic page-in (disable) jumper
controlled via the Spectranet disable option. If
you&rsquo;re going to be using the Spectranet, you&rsquo;ll
probably want one of <br>
the firmwares available from the Spectranet homepage
(http://spectrum.alioth.net/doc/index.php) which is also
where you can find more information on using the
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Installing the Spectranet
firmware on Fuse is slightly more complicated than on a real
machine, mostly because Fuse&rsquo;s emulation doesn&rsquo;t
support DHCP. These instructions are cor&acirc; <br>
rect as of 2012-01-26 &acirc; if you&rsquo;re using a later
firmware than this, things may have changed slightly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first thing you will need to
do is to obtain a copy of the Spectranet installer as a .tap
file (or similar). The installer is also available at the
Spectranet site above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you have a copy of the
installer, start Fuse and tick the Spectranet option from
the Options, Peripherals, General... dialog, and the state
of its write protect jumper con&acirc; <br>
trolled via the Spectranet disable option. Once that&rsquo;s
done, open the installer file (use the Media, Tape, Open...
command rather than File, Open... to prevent autoloading)
and <br>
enter the following commands from BASIC:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLEAR 26999 <br>
LOAD &quot;&quot; CODE <br>
RANDOMIZE USR 27000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The screen should turn blue and
you&rsquo;ll see around 20 lines of message appearing as the
firmware is installed, starting with &acirc;Erasing sector
0&acirc; and finishing with &acirc;Restoring page <br>
B&acirc;, and you&rsquo;ll get the familiar 0 OK, 0: 1 at
the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now untick the Spectranet
disable option from the Options, Peripherals, General...
dialog and reset the Spectrum. You should see a very brief
blue status screen, before the reg&acirc; <br>
ular copyright screen appears with some Spectranet
information at the top &acirc; there should be four status
lines, starting with &acirc;Alioth Spectranet&acirc; and
ending with the Spectranet&rsquo;s <br>
IP address (which will be 255.255.255.255 at this
stage).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now trigger an NMI (the Machine
/ NMI menu option) and you should get a white on blue
Spectranet NMI menu with five options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select [A] Configure network
settings &acirc; this should lead you to another menu, which
will scroll of the top of the screen; don&rsquo;t worry
about this for now.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You&rsquo;ll now need to set
various options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[A] Enable/disable DHCP &acirc;
select N <br>
[B] Change IP address &acirc; enter the IP address of the
machine you are running Fuse on. <br>
[C] Change netmask &acirc; enter the appropriate netmask for
the IP address you selected above. If that doesn&rsquo;t
mean anything to you, try 255.255.255.0 <br>
[D] Change default gateway &acirc; enter the appropriate
gateway address. If you don&rsquo;t know any better, enter
the IP address of your router. <br>
[E] Change primary DNS &acirc; enter the address of your DNS
server. If you don&rsquo;t know any better, use
Google&rsquo;s public DNS server, 8.8.8.8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no need to change
options [F] or [G], but do select:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[H] Change hostname &acirc;
enter a hostname for the Spectranet-enabled machine. It
doesn&rsquo;t really matter what you enter here &acirc;
it&rsquo;s mostly useful just to replace the junk default
name <br>
so you can see what you&rsquo;ve entered for the other
settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Your screen should now look
something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Current configuration <br>

&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;
<br>

Netmask : 255.255.255.000 <br>
Default gateway : 192.168.000.001 <br>
Primary DNS : 192.168.000.001 <br>
Secondary DNS : 255.255.255.255 <br>
Hardware address : FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF <br>
Hostname : fuse <br>
&lt;menu options&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If everything looks correct,
select [I] Save changes and exit (you&rsquo;ll see a brief
&acirc;Saving configuration...&acirc; message) followed by
[E] Exit, at which point you&rsquo;ll be returned to <br>
BASIC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now type the following
commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%cfgnew <br>
%cfgcommit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Which will show the standard 0
OK, 0:1 at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reset the Spectrum again and
you&rsquo;ll see the same four line status display, but this
time with your IP address on the last line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Congratulations! You have now
installed the Spectranet firmware. To save having to go
through all that every time you start Fuse, save a .szx
snapshot at this point, and load <br>
that in every time you want to use the Spectranet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE SELECTION <br>
The way you select a file (whether snapshot or tape file)
depends on which UI you&rsquo;re using. So firstly,
here&rsquo;s how to use the GTK+ file selector.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The selector shows the
directories and files in the current directory in two
separate subwindows. If either list is too big to fit in the
window, you can use the scrollbar to see <br>
the rest (by dragging the slider, for example), or you can
use Shift&acirc;Tab (to move the keyboard focus to a
subwindow) and use the cursor keys. To change directory,
double-click <br>
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To choose a file to load you can
either double-click it, or click it then click Ok. Or click
Cancel to abort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re using the
keyboard, probably the easiest way to use the selector is to
just ignore it and type in the name. This isn&rsquo;t as
irksome as it sounds, since the filename input <br>
box has filename completion &acirc; type part of a directory
or file name, then press Tab. It should complete it. If it
was a directory, it moves to that directory; if the
completion <br>
was ambiguous, it completes as much as possible, and narrows
the filenames shown to those which match. You should press
Enter when you&rsquo;ve finished typing the filename, or Esc
to <br>
abort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, if you&rsquo;re using the
widget UI &acirc; the one using the Spectrum font &acirc;
the selector works a bit differently. The files and
directories are all listed in a single two-column-wide <br>
window (the directories are shown at the top, ending in
&lsquo;/&rsquo;) &acirc; the names may be truncated onscreen
if they&rsquo;re too long to fit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To move the cursor, you can
either use the cursor keys, or the Spectrum equivalents
5/6/7/8, or (similarly) h/j/k/l. For faster movement, the
Page Up, Page Down, Home, and End <br>
keys are supported and do what you&rsquo;d expect. To select
a file or directory, press Enter. To abort, press Esc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With both selectors, do bear in
mind that all files are shown, whether Fuse would be able to
load them or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MONITOR/DEBUGGER <br>
Firstly, note that the vast majority of this section applies
only if you&rsquo;re using the GTK+ user interface; if
you&rsquo;re using one of the widget user interfaces,
you&rsquo;ll get a very <br>
basic monitor which shows the current values of the
registers and allows you to single step through execution or
continue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are using the GTK+ user
interface, Fuse features a moderately powerful, completely
transparent monitor/debugger, which can be activated via the
Machine, Debugger... menu <br>
option. A debugger window will appear, showing the current
state of the emulated machine: the top-left
&lsquo;pane&rsquo; shows the current state of the Z80 and
the last bytes written to any <br>
emulated peripherals. The bottom-left pane lists any active
breakpoints. Moving right, the next pane shows where the
Spectrum&rsquo;s 64K memory map (the &lsquo;W?&rsquo; and
&lsquo;C?&rsquo; indicate <br>
whether each displayed chunk is writable or contended
respectively). Fuse tracks the memory mapping of the overall
address space in 2KB chunks but will summarise the mapped
<br>
pages where they are part of the same page of the underlying
memory source (e.g. 8KB page sizes in the Spectrum 128K and
4KB pages in the Timex clones&rsquo; DOCK and EXROM
banks).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next pane to the right has a
disassembly, which by default starts at the current program
counter, although this can be modified either by the
&lsquo;disassemble&rsquo; command (see <br>
below) or by dragging the scrollbar next to it. The next
pane shows the current stack, and the final pane any
&lsquo;events&rsquo; which are due to occur and could affect
emulation. Any of <br>
these panes can be removed by use of the View menu. Below
the displays are an entry box for debugger commands, and
five buttons for controlling the debugger:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Evaluate <br>
Evaluate the command currently in the entry box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Single Step <br>
Run precisely one Z80 opcode and then stop emulation
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Continue <br>
Restart emulation, but leave the debugger window open. Note
that the debugger window will not be updated while emulation
is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Break <br>
Stop emulation and return to the debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Close <br>
Close the debugger window and restart emulation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Double-clicking on an entry in
the stack pane will cause emulation to run until the program
counter reaches the value stored at that address, while
double-clicking on an entry in <br>
the &lsquo;events&rsquo; pane will cause emulation to run
until that time is reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main power of the debugger
is via the commands entered into the entry box, which are
similar in nature (but definitely not identical to or as
powerful as) to those in gdb(1). <br>
In general, the debugger is case-insensitive, and numbers
will be interpreted as decimal, unless prefixed by either
&lsquo;0x&rsquo; or &lsquo;$&rsquo; when they will be
interpreted as hex. Each command <br>
can be abbreviated to the portion not in curly braces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ba{se} number <br>
Change the debugger window to displaying output in base
number. Available values are 10 (decimal) or 16 (hex).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">br{eakpoint} [address] [if
condition] <br>
Set a breakpoint to stop emulation and return to the
debugger whenever an opcode is executed at address and
condition evaluates true. If address is omitted, it defaults
to <br>
the current value of PC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">br{eakpoint} p{ort}
(r{ead}|w{rite}) port [if condition] <br>
Set a breakpoint to trigger whenever IO port port is read
from or written to and condition evaluates true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">br{eakpoint} (r{ead}|w{rite})
[address] [if condition] <br>
Set a breakpoint to trigger whenever memory location address
is read from (other than via an opcode fetch) or written to
and condition evaluates true. Address again <br>
defaults to the current value of PC if omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">br{eakpoint} ti{me} time [if
condition] <br>
Set a breakpoint to occur time tstates after the start of
the every frame, assuming condition evaluates true (if one
is given).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">br{eakpoint} ev{ent} area:detail
[if condition] <br>
Set a breakpoint to occur when the event specified by
area:detail occurs and condition evaluates to true. The
events which can be caught are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beta128:page <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In all cases, the event can be
specified as area:* to catch all events from that area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cl{ear} [address] <br>
Remove all breakpoints at address or the current value of PC
if address is omitted. Port read/write breakpoints are
unaffected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">com{mmands} id &lt;newline&gt;
<br>
&lt;debugger command&gt; &lt;newline&gt; <br>
&lt;debugger command&gt; &lt;newline&gt; <br>
... <br>
end <br>
Set things such that the specified debugger commands will be
automatically executed when breakpoint id is triggered.
There is currently no user interface for entering <br>
multi-line debugger commands, so the only way to specify
this command is on the command-line via the
--debugger-command option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cond{ition} id [condition] <br>
Set breakpoint id to trigger only when condition is true, or
unconditionally if condition is omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">co{ntinue} <br>
Equivalent to the Continue button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">del{ete} [id] <br>
Remove breakpoint id, or all breakpoints if id is
omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">di{sassemble} address <br>
Set the centre panel disassembly to begin at address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ex{it} <br>
Exit the emulator immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fi{nish} <br>
Exit from the current CALL or equivalent. This isn&rsquo;t
infallible: it works by setting a temporary breakpoint at
the current contents of the stack pointer, so will not
func&acirc; <br>
tion correctly if the code returns to some other point or
plays with its stack in other ways. Also, setting this
breakpoint doesn&rsquo;t disable other breakpoints, which
may <br>
trigger before this one. In that case, the temporary
breakpoint remains, and the &lsquo;continue&rsquo; command
can be used to return to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i{gnore} id count <br>
Do not trigger the next count times that breakpoint id would
have triggered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n{ext} <br>
Step to the opcode following the current one. As with the
&lsquo;finish&rsquo; command, this works by setting a
temporary breakpoint at the next opcode, so is not
infallible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o{ut} port value <br>
Write value to IO port port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pr{int} expression <br>
Print the value of expression to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">se{t} address value <br>
Poke value into memory at address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">se{t} register value <br>
Set the value of the Z80 register register to value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">se{t} [im|iff1|iff2] value <br>
Set the interrupt mode or interrupt flip flops register to
value. If the im mode is not 0, 1 or 2 it will be ignored,
while non-zero iff values will be converted to one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">se{t} $variable value <br>
Set the value of the debugger variable variable to
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">se{t} area:detail value <br>
Set the value of the system variable area:detail to value.
The available system variables are listed below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s{tep} <br>
Equivalent to the Single Step button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t{breakpoint} [options] <br>
This is the same as the &lsquo;breakpoint&rsquo; command in
its various forms, except that the breakpoint is temporary:
it will trigger once and once only, and then be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Addresses can be specified in
one of two forms: either an absolute addresses, specified by
an integer in the range 0x0000 to 0xFFFF or as a
&lsquo;source:page:offset&rsquo; combination, <br>
which refers to a location offset bytes into memory bank
page, independent of where that bank is currently paged into
memory. RAM and ROM pages are indicated, respectively, by
<br>
&lsquo;RAM&rsquo; and &lsquo;ROM&rsquo; sources (e.g. offset
0x1234 in ROM 1 is specified as &lsquo;ROM:1:0x1234&rsquo;).
Other available sources are: &lsquo;Betadisk&rsquo;,
&lsquo;Didaktik 80 RAM&rsquo;, &lsquo;Didaktik 80
ROM&rsquo;, &lsquo;DISCiPLE <br>
RAM&rsquo;, &lsquo;DISCiPLE ROM&rsquo;, &lsquo;DivIDE

&lsquo;Timex EXROM&rsquo;, <br>
&lsquo;uSource&rsquo;, &lsquo;ZXATASP&rsquo; and
&lsquo;ZXCF&rsquo;. Please, note that spaces in memory
sources should be escaped, e.g., &lsquo;break
Didaktik&nbsp;80&nbsp;ROM:0:0x1234&rsquo;. The 48K machines
are treated as having <br>
a permanent mapping of page 5 at 0x4000, page 2 at 0x8000
and page 0 at 0xC000; the 16K Spectrum is treated as having
page 5 at 0x4000 and no page at 0x8000 and 0xC000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anywhere the debugger is
expecting a numeric value, except where it expects a
breakpoint id, you can instead use a numeric expression,
which uses a restricted version of C&rsquo;s syn&acirc; <br>
tax; exactly the same syntax is used for conditional
breakpoints, with &lsquo;0&rsquo; being false and any other
value being true. In numeric expressions, you can use
integer constants (all <br>
calculations are done in integers), system variables,
debugger variables, parentheses, the standard four numeric
operations (&lsquo;+&rsquo;, &lsquo;-&rsquo;,
&lsquo;*&rsquo; and &lsquo;/&rsquo;), the (non-)equality
operators <br>
&lsquo;==&rsquo; and &lsquo;!=&rsquo;, the comparison
operators &lsquo;&gt;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&lt;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&gt;=&rsquo; and &lsquo;&lt;=&rsquo;, bitwise and
(&lsquo;&amp;&rsquo;), or (&lsquo;|&rsquo;) and exclusive or
(&lsquo;^&rsquo;) and logical and (&lsquo;&amp;&amp;&rsquo;)
and or (&lsquo;||&rsquo;). Square brackets (&lsquo;[&rsquo;
<br>
and &lsquo;]&rsquo;) can be used to dereference a value; for
example &lsquo;[0x4000]&rsquo; will give the value of the
first byte of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">System variables are specified
via an &lsquo;area:detail&rsquo; syntax. The available
system variables are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ay:current <br>
The current AY-3-8912 register. <br>
ula:last <br>
The last byte written to the ULA. Note that this variable
can only be read, not written to. <br>
ula:mem1ffd <br>
The last byte written to memory control port used by the ZX
Spectrum +2A/3; normally addressed at 0x1ffd, hence the
name. <br>
ula:mem7ffd <br>
The last byte written to primary memory control port used by
the ZX Spectrum 128 and later; normally addressed at 0x7ffd,
hence the name. <br>
ula:tstates <br>
The number of tstates since the last interrupt. <br>
z80: register name <br>
The value of the specified register. Both 8-bit registers
and 16-bit register pairs are supported. The MEMPTR / WZ
hidden register is also supported. <br>
z80:im <br>
The current interrupt mode of the Z80. <br>
z80:iff1 <br>
z80:iff2 <br>
1 if the specified interrupt flip-flop is currently set, or
0 if it is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Z80 registers, interrupt
mode and interrupt flip-flops can also be specified without
the &lsquo;z80:&rsquo; prefix, but this syntax is deprecated
and will be removed in Fuse 1.4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE POKE FINDER <br>
The &lsquo;poke finder&rsquo; is a tool which is designed to
make the task of finding (infinite lives etc.) pokes for
games a bit easier: it is similar to the
&lsquo;Lifeguard&rsquo; utility which was <br>
available for use with the Multiface. It works by
maintaining a list of locations in which the current number
of lives (etc.) may be stored, and having the ability to
remove from <br>
that list any locations which don&rsquo;t contain a
specified value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The poke finder dialog contains
an entry box for specifying the value to be searched for, a
count of the current number of possible locations and, if
there are less than 20 pos&acirc; <br>
sible locations, a list of the possible locations (in
&lsquo;page:offset&rsquo; format). The five buttons act as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incremented <br>
Remove from the list of possible locations all addresses
which have not been incremented since the last search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Decremented <br>
Remove from the list of possible locations all addresses
which have not been decremented since the last search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Search <br>
Remove from the list of possible locations all addresses
which do not contain the value specified in the
&lsquo;Search for&rsquo; field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reset <br>
Reset the poke finder so that all locations are considered
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Close <br>
Close the dialog. Note that this does not reset the current
state of the poke finder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Double-clicking on an entry in
the list of possible locations will cause a breakpoint to be
set to trigger whenever that location is written to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example of how to use this
may make things a bit clearer. We&rsquo;ll use the 128K
version of Gryzor. Load the game, define keys to suit and
start playing. Immediately pause the <br>
game and bring up the poke finder dialog. We note that we
currently have 6 lives, so enter &lsquo;6&rsquo; into the
&lsquo;Search for&rsquo; field and click
&lsquo;Search&rsquo;. This reduces the number of possible
<br>
locations to around 931 (you may get a slightly different
number depending on exactly when you paused the game). Play
along a bit and then (deliberately) lose a life. Pause the
<br>
game again. As we now have 5 lives, replace the
&lsquo;6&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Search for&rsquo; field with a
&lsquo;5&rsquo; and click &lsquo;Search&rsquo; again. This
then reduces the list of possible locations to just one:
<br>
page 2, offset 0x00BC. This is the only location in memory
which stored &lsquo;6&rsquo; when we had 6 lives and
&lsquo;5&rsquo; when we had 5 lives, so its pretty likely
that this is where the lives <br>
count is stored. Double-clicking on the
&lsquo;2:0x00BC&rsquo; entry in the dialog will set the
appropriate breakpoint (you may wish to open the debugger at
this point to confirm this). Play <br>
along a bit more. When you next lose a life, emulation is
stopped with PC at 0x91CD. Scrolling up a few addresses in
the debugger&rsquo;s disassembly pane shows a value was
loaded from <br>
0x80BC (our hypothetical lives counter), decremented and
then stored again to 0x80BC, which looks very much like the
code to reduce the number of lives. We can now use the
debug&acirc; <br>
ger to replace the decrement with a NOP (&lsquo;set 0x91c9
0&rsquo;), and playing the game some more after this reveals
that this has worked and we now have infinite lives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE POKE MEMORY <br>
Fuse supports multiface POKEs, allowing to modify specific
memory addresses in order to cheat (infinite lives, infinite
ammo, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lsquo;poke memory&rsquo;
dialog contains a list of recently loaded POKEs and some
entry boxes for adding custom POKEs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bank <br>
Sets the 128K memory bank (values &lsquo;0&rsquo; to
&lsquo;7&rsquo;) or the current memory mapping (value
&lsquo;8&rsquo; or blank).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Address <br>
Memory address to modify. Values in range 16384 to 65535 for
48K memory mode or 0 to 65535 for 128K memory banks. GTK+ UI
also accepts hex addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Value <br>
New value for the former address, in range 0 to 255. Value
256 means &acirc;Prompt to the user later&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to load POKEs
from an external file using the File, Open... menu option or
the drag-and-drop functionality in the GTK+ and Win32 UIs.
After loading a snapshot or <br>
tape, Fuse will try to automatically locate a POK file with
the same file name. This means that if we open
&lsquo;GAME.TAP&rsquo;, then Fuse will try to open
&lsquo;GAME.POK&rsquo; and &lsquo;POKES/GAME.POK&rsquo;.
<br>
See http://www.worldofspectrum.org/POKformat.txt for more
details about this file format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POKEs loaded in the list can be
activated or deactivated as the user wants and will remain
in memory until a machine reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE .DSK FORMAT <br>
In general, disk images for the +3 Spectrum are thought of
as being in DSK format. However, this is actually a slight
oversimplification; there are in fact two similar, but not
<br>
identical, DSK formats. (The difference can be seen by doing
&lsquo;head -1 dskfile&rsquo;: one format will start
&lsquo;MV - CPCEMU&rsquo; and the other will start
&lsquo;EXTENDED&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fuse supports both the
&lsquo;CPCEMU&rsquo; and &lsquo;EXTENDED&rsquo; formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BETA 128 EMULATION <br>
Fuse supports Betadisk emulation in its Pentagon and
Scorpion emulation, and also under 48K, TC2048, 128K and +2
(but not +2A) emulation if the Beta 128 interface option
from the <br>
Options, Peripherals, Disk... dialog is enabled. When that
option is used in 48K or TC2048 emulation the Beta 128
auto-boot in 48K machines option additionally controls
whether <br>
the machine boots directly into the TR-DOS system. See the
DISK FILE FORMATS section for more details on supported disk
file formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPUS DISCOVERY EMULATION <br>
By default, Fuse emulates the Opus Discovery interface with
the optional 2k RAM expansion and a second 40 track single
sided disk drive. See the DISK FILE FORMATS section for <br>
more details on supported disk file formats. The Opus
Discovery&rsquo;s printer port is also emulated for output
only. (See the PRINTER EMULATION section for more details.)
The Opus <br>
Discovery may only be used with 16K, 48K, 128K, TC2048 and
+2 (not +2A) emulation. To access disks, use the same syntax
as Interface 1 and Microdrives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+D EMULATION <br>
Fuse supports emulating the +D disk and printer interface.
See the DISK FILE FORMATS section for more details on
supported disk file formats. The +D&rsquo;s printer port is
emulated. <br>
(See the PRINTER EMULATION section for more details.) The +D
may only be used with 48K, 128K and +2 (not +2A) emulation.
To access disks, you will first need to load G+DOS, by <br>
inserting a disk containing the DOS file (+SYS) and entering
&acirc;RUN&acirc;. Once DOS is loaded, you can load to/from
+D disks by prefixing filenames with &lsquo;dn&rsquo; where
&lsquo;n&rsquo; is the number of <br>
the drive in use. For example, &lsquo;LOAD
d1&quot;myfile&quot;&rsquo; would load the file named
&lsquo;myfile&rsquo; from the emulated drive 1. Microdrive
syntax may also be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To save a snapshot, choose the
Machine, NMI menu option, and then press &lsquo;4&rsquo; to
save a 48K snapshot, or &lsquo;5&rsquo; to save a 128K
snapshot. When saving a 128K snapshot, you must then <br>
press Y or N to indicate whether the screen changed while
saving the snapshot, to finish saving. You can also choose
&lsquo;3&rsquo; to save a screenshot to disk. Holding Caps
Shift <br>
together with any of these options will cause the +D to save
to the &lsquo;other&rsquo; drive to the one used last.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options &lsquo;1&rsquo; and
&lsquo;2&rsquo; allow screenshots to be printed (in
monochrome, in normal and large formats respectively) if
printer emulation is enabled. For saving and loading of
snap&acirc; <br>
shots, and saving of screenshots to disk, G+DOS must be
loaded first, but printing of screenshots can be performed
without loading G+DOS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, &lsquo;X&rsquo; will
return from the NMI menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIDAKTIK 80 EMULATION <br>
Fuse supports Didaktik 80 (and Didaktik 40) emulation. It
emulates the original version of the Didaktik 80, running
MDOS 1 and with a WD2797 floppy controller. See the DISK
<br>
FILE FORMATS section for more details on supported disk file
formats. The Didaktik 80 may only be used with 16K, 48K and
TC2048 emulation. To press the Didaktik 80&rsquo;s
&lsquo;SNAP&rsquo; <br>
button, choose the Machine, Didaktik SNAP menu option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISCIPLE EMULATION <br>
Fuse supports emulating the DISCiPLE disk and printer
interface, although it does not currently support emulation
of the Sinclair Network, or support emulation of a DISCiPLE
<br>
attached to a 128K machine. See the DISK FILE FORMATS
section for more details on supported disk file formats,
which are the same as for +D emulation as described above.
The DIS&acirc; <br>
CiPLE&rsquo;s printer port is emulated. (See the PRINTER
EMULATION section for more details.) The DISCiPLE may only
be used with 48K emulation at present. To access disks, you
will <br>
first need to load GDOS, by inserting a disk containing the
DOS file (SYS) and entering &acirc;RUN&acirc;. Once DOS is
loaded, you can load to/from DISCiPLE disks by prefixing
filenames <br>
with &lsquo;dn&rsquo; where &lsquo;n&rsquo; is the number of
the drive in use. For example, &lsquo;LOAD
d1&quot;myfile&quot;&rsquo; would load the file named
&lsquo;myfile&rsquo; from the emulated drive 1. Microdrive
syntax may also <br>
be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snapshots can be saved in a
similar manner to that of the +D as described above, but
note that GDOS on the DISCiPLE contains a bug which causes
corruption as soon as the NMI but&acirc; <br>
ton is pressed, affecting saving of snapshots, and also
loading of snapshots that were originally saved with a +D or
SAM Coup&Atilde;&copy;. This will cause corruption even when
a screenshot <br>
is printed, or if the menu is never even entered in the
first place (due to Caps Shift not being pressed down, as is
required for the DISCiPLE), provided that GDOS is loaded.
<br>
This bug is not present in G+DOS on the +D. (Note: this was
caused by saving/restoring the AF register twice in the NMI
handler, where both AF and the AF&rsquo; shadow register
should <br>
have been saved/restored.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The NMI button works slightly
differently on the DISCiPLE than on the +D. Caps Shift must
be held down whilst pressing the NMI button, and there is no
&lsquo;X&rsquo; option to exit the <br>
menu. Also, printing of screenshots requires GDOS to be
loaded. Depending on the UI that you&rsquo;re using, holding
down Caps Shift whilst choosing the Machine, NMI menu option
may <br>
be slightly tricky, or even impossible. For the GTK+ UI,
ensure that the Shift key is held before entering on the
Machine menu. For the widget UI, it does not seem possible
to <br>
perform this action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISK FILE FORMATS <br>
Fuse supports several disk image formats in its +D,
Didaktik, DISCiPLE and Beta 128 emulation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For reading:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fuse supports most of the above
formats for writing: .UDI .FDI .MGT .IMG .SAD .D80 .D40 .TRD
.SCL .OPD .OPU .DSK (only the old CPC format).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can save disk images with
any output format, just select the appropriate extension.
(e.g. &lsquo;elite3.udi&rsquo; to save as an UDI file). If
the appropriate libraries were available <br>
when libspectrum(3) was compiled, than Fuse will try to
create UDI images with compressed tracks to save disk space.
There is a .LOG &lsquo;image&rsquo; format for debugging
purpose. This <br>
is a plain text file contains three dump of the loaded disk
image at different details. Not all image formats can store
all disk images. You cannot save a disk image with an <br>
inappropriate format that loses some information (e.g.
variable track length or sector length).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WEAK DISK DATA <br>
Some copy protections have what is described as
&lsquo;weak/random&rsquo; data. Each time the sector is read
one or more bytes will change, the value may be random
between consecutive reads <br>
of the same sector. Two disk image formats (Extended DSK and
UDI) can store this type of data. Fuse can read and use weak
sector data from EDSK and UDI files when present, and <br>
can save back weak sector data to UDI image format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MOVIE RECORDING <br>
Fuse can save movies with sound in a specific file format
(FMF). This recording is very fast, and has a moderate size,
but you need to use the fmfconv(1) program in <br>
fuse-utils(1) to convert into regular video and/or audio
files. The --movie-compr option allows you to set the
compression level to None, Lossless or High. If zlib(3) is
not <br>
available, only None is valid. The default when Zlib is
available is Lossless. Recording a movie may slow down
emulation, if you experience performance problems, you can
try to <br>
set compression to None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fuse records every displayed
frame, so by default the recorded file has about 50 video
frame per second. A standard video has about 24&acirc;30/s
framerate, so if you set Options/Gen&acirc; <br>
eral/Frame rate 1:n or the equivalent --rate command line
option to 2 than recording frame rate reduces about 25/s.
The exact frame rate depends on the Z80 clock frequency
which <br>
varies depending on the specific emulated machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: You can see all of the
&acirc;gfx&acirc; effects only if the Fuse frame rate option
is set to 1, but in most cases you can safely use 2. Also,
movie recording stops if the emulated <br>
machine is changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The recorded sound sampling rate
and the channel number is equal with the Fuse generated
sound sampling rate (32000 Hz by default) and channel number
(mono by default). The com&acirc; <br>
mon sampling frequencies in standard video files are 44100
Hz and 48000 Hz. If you use --sound-freq command line option
you can record sound on 44100 Hz or even 48000 Hz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can record stereo sound if
you use AY stereo separation or the equivalent --separation
command line switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use fmfconv(1) to
convert recorded movie file into a standard video file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fuse --movie-start output.fmf
--rate 2 --sound-freq 44100 --separation ACB</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start video recording about 25/s
video frame rate and 44100 Hz sampling frequency stereo
sound default compression level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPRESSED FILES <br>
Assuming the appropriate libraries were available when
libspectrum(3) was compiled, snapshots, tape images, dock
cartridges and input recording files (RZX) can be read from
files <br>
compressed with bzip2(3), gzip(3) or zip(3) just as if they
were uncompressed. In the zip case, only the first supported
file found inside the archive is loaded. There is cur&acirc;
<br>
rently no support for reading compressed +3, DISCiPLE/+D or
Beta disk images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Selecting a startup filter doesn&rsquo;t work properly with
user interfaces other than SDL, Win32 and GTK+.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changing virtual consoles when
using SVGAlib for joystick support causes Fuse to exit. If
this is a problem, compile Fuse with the
&lsquo;--disable-ui-joystick&rsquo; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The poke finder can&rsquo;t
search outside &lsquo;normal&rsquo; RAM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The libao file output devices
not work properly with the GTK+ UI. No error reporting, but
the created file does not contain any sound data. If you use
a &lsquo;weak&rsquo; machine alsa09 <br>
makes a lot of clicks and pops and will output &lsquo;ALSA:
underrun, at least 0ms.&rsquo; error messages.</p>
