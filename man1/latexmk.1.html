<i>Latexmk</i> completely automates the process of compiling a LaTeX document.
  Essentially, it is like a specialized relative of the general <i>make</i>
  utility, but one which determines dependencies automatically and has some
  other very useful features. In its basic mode of operation <i>latexmk</i> is
  given the name of the primary source file for a document, and it issues the
  appropriate sequence of commands to generate a .dvi, .ps, .pdf and/or hardcopy
  version of the document.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default <i>latexmk</i> will run the commands necessary to generate a .dvi
  file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Latexmk</i> can also be set to run continuously with a suitable previewer. In
  that case the <i>latex</i> program (or one of its relatives), etc, are rerun
  whenever one of the source files is modified, and the previewer automatically
  updates the on-screen view of the compiled document.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Latexmk</i> determines which are the source files by examining the log file.
  (Optionally, it also examines the list of input and output files generated by
  the <b>-recorder</b> option of modern versions of <i>latex</i> (and
  <i>pdflatex</i>, <i>xelatex</i>, <i>lualatex</i>, etc). See the documentation
  for the <b>-recorder</b> option of <i>latexmk</i> below.) When <i>latexmk</i>
  is run, it examines properties of the source files, and if any have been
  changed since the last document generation, <i>latexmk</i> will run the
  various LaTeX processing programs as necessary. In particular, it will repeat
  the run of <i>latex</i> (or a related program)) often enough to resolve all
  cross references; depending on the macro packages used. With some macro
  packages and document classes, four, or even more, runs may be needed. If
  necessary, <i>latexmk</i> will also run <i>bibtex</i>, <i>biber</i>, and/or
  <i>makeindex</i>. In addition, <i>latexmk</i> can be configured to generate
  other necessary files. For example, from an updated figure file it can
  automatically generate a file in encapsulated postscript or another suitable
  format for reading by LaTeX.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Latexmk</i> has two different previewing options. With the simple <b>-pv</b>
  option, a dvi, postscript or pdf previewer is automatically run after
  generating the dvi, postscript or pdf version of the document. The type of
  file to view is selected according to configuration settings and command line
  options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second previewing option is the powerful <b>-pvc</b> option (mnemonic:
  &quot;preview continuously&quot;). In this case, <i>latexmk</i> runs
  continuously, regularly monitoring all the source files to see if any have
  changed. Every time a change is detected, <i>latexmk</i> runs all the programs
  necessary to generate a new version of the document. A good previewer will
  then automatically update its display. Thus the user can simply edit a file
  and, when the changes are written to disk, <i>latexmk</i> completely automates
  the cycle of updating the .dvi (and/or the .ps and .pdf) file, and refreshing
  the previewer's display. It's not quite WYSIWYG, but usefully close.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For other previewers, the user may have to manually make the previewer update
  its display, which can be (e.g., with some versions of <i>xdvi</i> and
  <i>gsview</i>) as simple as forcing a redraw of its display.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Latexmk</i> has the ability to print a banner in gray diagonally across each
  page when making the postscript file. It can also, if needed, call an external
  program to do other postprocessing on generated dvi and postscript files. (See
  the options <b>-dF</b> and <b>-pF</b>, and the documentation for the
  <i>$dvi_filter</i> and <i>$ps_filter</i> configuration variables.) These
  capabilities are leftover from older versions of <i>latexmk</i>. More
  flexibility can be obtained in current versions, since the command strings for
  running <i>latex</i>, <i>pdflatex</i>, etc can now be configured to run
  multiple commands. This also extends the possibility of postprocessing
  generated files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Latexmk</i> is highly configurable, both from the command line and in
  configuration files, so that it can accommodate a wide variety of user needs
  and system configurations. Default values are set according to the operating
  system, so <i>latexmk</i> often works without special configuration on
  MS-Windows, cygwin, Linux, OS-X, and other UNIX systems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A very annoying complication handled very reliably by <i>latexmk</i>, is that
  LaTeX is a multiple pass system. On each run, LaTeX reads in information
  generated on a previous run, for things like cross referencing and indexing.
  In the simplest cases, a second run of LaTeX suffices, and often the log file
  contains a message about the need for another pass. However, there is a wide
  variety of add-on macro packages to LaTeX, with a variety of behaviors. The
  result is to break simple-minded determinations of how many runs are needed
  and of which programs. <i>Latexmk</i> has a highly general and efficient
  solution to these issues. The solution involves retaining between runs
  information on the source files, and a symptom is that <i>latexmk</i>
  generates an extra file (with extension <i>.fdb_latexmk</i>, by default) that
  contains the source file information.

  OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS ON COMMAND LINE</a></h1>
In general the command line to invoke <i>latexmk</i> has the form
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	latexmk [options] [file]
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
All options can be introduced by single or double &quot;-&quot; characters,
  e.g., &quot;latexmk -help&quot; or &quot;latexmk --help&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Note 1</b>: <b>In addition to the options in the list below,</b>
  <b></b><i>latexmk</i> recognizes almost all the options recognized by the
  <i>latex</i>, <i>pdflatex</i> programs (and their relatives) in their current
  TeXLive and MiKTeX implementations. Some of the options for these programs
  also trigger special action or behavior by <i>latexmk</i>, in which case they
  have specific explanations in this document. Otherwise, they are just passed
  through to a called <i>latex</i> or <i>pdflatex</i> program. Run
  <i>latexmk</i> with the <b>-showextraoptions</b> to get a list of the options
  that <i>latexmk</i> accepts and that are simply passed through to <i>latex</i>
  or <i>pdflatex</i> (etc). See also the explanation of the
  <b>-showextraoptions</b> option for more information.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Note 2</b>: In this documentation, the program <i>pdflatex</i> is often
  referred to. Users of programs like <i>lualatex</i> and <i>xelatex</i> should
  know that from <i>latexmk</i>'s point of view, these other programs behave
  very like <i>pdflatex</i>, i.e., they make a pdf file from a tex file, etc. So
  whenever <i>pdflatex</i> is mentioned without mention of the other programs,
  the statements apply equally to <i>lualatex</i>, <i>xelatex</i>, and any other
  similar programs. <i>Latexmk</i> can be easily configured to use whichever of
  these programs is needed. See the documentation for the following options:
  <b>-pdflua</b>, <b>-pdfxe</b>, <b>-lualatex</b>, and <b>-xelatex</b>, and also
  see the documentation for the <i>$pdflatex</i>, <i>$lualatex</i>, and
  <i>$xelatex</i> configuration variables. At present <i>latexmk</i> does not do
  automatic detection of which program is to be used.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>file</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">One or more files can be specified. If no files are
      specified, <i>latexmk</i> will, by default, run on all files in the
      current working directory with a &quot;.tex&quot; extension. This behavior
      can be changed: see the description concerning the <i>@default_files</i>
      variable in the section &quot;List of configuration variables usable in
      initialization files&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If a file is specified without an extension, then the &quot;.tex&quot;
      extension is automatically added, just as LaTeX does. Thus, if you
      specify:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    	latexmk foo
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

      version of (pdf)latex.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    See also the <b>-outdir</b>/<b>-output-directory</b> options, and the

      names are suitable.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you also use the <b>-cd</b> option, and the specified auxiliary output

    This property can also be configured by setting the <i>$bibtex_use</i>

    A common use for this option is when a document comes from an external
      source, complete with its bbl file(s), and the user does not have the
      corresponding bib files available. In this situation use of the
      <b>-bibtex-</b> option will prevent <i>latexmk</i> from trying to run
      <i>bibtex</i> or <i>biber</i>, which would result in overwriting of the
      bbl files.

      but only if the relevant bib file(s) exist. Thus when the bib files are
      not available, <i>bibtex</i> or <i>biber</i> is not run, thereby avoiding
      overwriting of the bbl file(s). This is the default setting.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    (Note that it is possible for <i>latexmk</i> to decide that the bib file
      does not exist, even though the bib file does exist and <i>bibtex</i> or
      <i>biber</i> finds it. The problem is that the bib file may not be in the
      current directory but in some search path; the places <i>latexmk</i> and
      <i>bibtex</i> or <i>biber</i> cause to be searched need not be identical.
      On modern installations of TeX and related programs this problem should
      not arise, since <i>latexmk</i> uses the <i>kpsewhich</i> program to do
      the search, and <i>kpsewhich</i> should use the same search path as
      <i>bibtex</i> and <i>biber</i>. If this problem arises, use the
      <b>-bibtex</b> option when invoking <i>latexmk</i>.)

  <dd class="It-tag">Execute the specified initialization code before
      processing. The code is <i>Perl</i> code of the same form as is used in
      <i>latexmk</i>'s initialization files. For more details, see the
      information on the <b>-r</b> option, and the section about
      &quot;Configuration/initialization (RC) files&quot;. The code is typically
      a sequence of assignment statements separated by semicolons.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The code is executed when the <b>-e</b> option is encountered during
      <i>latexmk</i>'s parsing of its command line. See the <b>-r</b> option for
      a way of executing initialization code from a file. An error results in
      <i>latexmk</i> stopping. Multiple instances of the <b>-r</b> and <b>-e</b>
      options can be used, and they are executed in the order they appear on the
      command line.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Some care is needed to deal with proper quoting of special characters in the
      code on the command line. For example, suppose you want to set the latex
      command to use its -shell-escape option, then under UNIX/Linux you could
      use the line
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    	latexmk -e '$latex=q/latex %O -shell-escape %S/' file.tex
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that the single quotes block normal UNIX/Linux command shells from
      treating the characters inside the quotes as special. (In this example,
      the q/.../ construct is a <i>Perl</i> idiom equivalent to using single
      quotes. This avoids the complications of getting a quote character inside
      an already quoted string in a way that is independent of both the shell
      and the operating-system.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The above command line will NOT work under MS-Windows with cmd.exe or
      command.com or 4nt.exe. For MS-Windows with these command shells you could
      use
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    	latexmk -e &quot;$latex=q/latex %O -shell-escape %S/&quot; file.tex
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    or
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    	latexmk -e &quot;$latex='latex %O -shell-escape %S'&quot; file.tex
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The last two examples will NOT work with UNIX/Linux command shells.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    ( <i>Note</i>: the above examples show are to show how to use the <b>-e</b>
      to specify initialization code to be executed. But the particular effect
      can be achieved also by the use of the <b>-latex</b> option with less
      problems in dealing with quoting.)

      and/or .pdf files whenever changes are made to source files (see the
      Description above). Which of these files is generated and which is viewed
      is governed by the other options, and is the same as for the <b>-pv</b>
      option. The preview-continuous option <b>-pvc</b> can only work with one
      file. So in this case you will normally only specify one filename on the
      command line. It is also incompatible with the <b>-p</b> and <b>-pv</b>
      options, so it turns these options off.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>-pvc</b> option also turns off force mode (<b>-f</b>), as is normally
      best for continuous preview mode. If you really want force mode, use the
      options in the order <b>-pvc -f</b>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    With a good previewer the display will be automatically updated. (Under
      <i>some but not all</i> versions of UNIX/Linux &quot;gv -watch&quot; does
      this for postscript files; this can be set by a configuration variable.
      This would also work for pdf files except for an apparent bug in gv that
      causes an error when the newly updated pdf file is read.) Many other
      previewers will need a manual update.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>Important note</b>: the acroread program on MS-Windows locks the pdf
      file, and prevents new versions being written, so it is a bad idea to use
      acroread to view pdf files in preview-continuous mode. It is better to use
      a different viewer: <i>SumatraPDF</i> and <i>gsview</i> are good
      possibilities.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    There are some other methods for arranging an update, notably useful for
      many versions of <i>xdvi</i> and <i>xpdf</i>. These are best set in
      <i>latexmk</i>'s configuration; see below.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that if <i>latexmk</i> dies or is stopped by the user, the
      &quot;forked&quot; previewer will continue to run. Successive invocations
      with the <b>-pvc</b> option will not fork new previewers, but
      <i>latexmk</i> will normally use the existing previewer. (At least this
      will happen when <i>latexmk</i> is running under an operating system where
      it knows how to determine whether an existing previewer is running.)

      section below on &quot;Configuration/initialization (RC) files&quot; --
      are read first. (2) Then the options on the command line are acted on in
      the order they are given. Therefore if an initialization file is specified

  WITH ERRORS, PROBLEMS, ETC</a></h1>
Some possibilities:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
a. If you get a strange error, do look carefully at the output that is on the
  screen and in log files. While there is much that is notoriously verbose in
  the output of <i>latex</i> (and that is added to by <i>latexmk</i>), the
  verbosity is there for a reason: to enable the user to diagnose problems.
  <i>Latexmk</i> does repeat some messages at the end of a run that it thinks
  would otherwise be easy to miss in the middle of other output.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
b. Generally, remember that <i>latexmk</i> does its work by running other
  programs. Your first priority in dealing with errors should be to examine what
  went wrong with the individual programs. Then you need to correct the causes
  of errors in the runs of these programs. (Often these come from errors in the
  source document, but they could also be about missing LaTeX packages, etc.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
c. If <i>latexmk</i> doesn't run the programs the way you would like, then you
  need to look in this documentation at the list of command line options and
  then at the sections on configuration/initialization files. A lot of
  <i>latexmk</i>'s behavior is configurable to deal with particular situations.
  (But there is a lot of reading!)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<i>The remainder of these notes consists of ideas for dealing with more</i>
  <i>difficult situations.</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
d. Further tricks can involve replacing the standard commands that
  <i>latexmk</i> runs by other commands or scripts.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
e. For possible examples of code for use in an RC file, see the directory
  example_rcfiles in the distribution of <i>latexmk</i> (e.g., at
  http://mirror.ctan.org/support/latexmk/example_rcfiles). Even if these
  examples don't do what you want, they may provide suitable inspiration.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
f. There's a useful trick that can be used when you use <i>lualatex</i> instead
  of <i>pdflatex</i> (and in some related situations). The problem is that
  <i>latexmk</i> won't notice a dependency on a file, bar.baz say, that is input
  by the lua code in your document instead of by the LaTeX part. (Thus if you
  change bar.baz and rerun <i>latexmk</i>, then <i>latexmk</i> will think no
  files have changed and not rerun <i>lualatex</i>, whereas if you had
  '\input{bar.baz}' in the LaTeX part of the document, <i>latexmk</i> would
  notice the change.) One solution is just to put the following somewhere in the
  LaTeX part of the document:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 \typeout{(bar.baz)}
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This puts a line in the log file that <i>latexmk</i> will treat as implying that
  the file bar.baz was read. (At present I don't know a way of doing this
  automatically.) Of course, if the file has a different name, change bar.baz to
  the name of your file.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION/INITIALIZATION_(RC)_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION/INITIALIZATION_(RC)_FILES">CONFIGURATION/INITIALIZATION
  (RC) FILES</a></h1>
<i>Latexmk</i> can be customized using initialization files, which are read at
  startup in the following order:
<div class="Pp"></div>
1) The system RC file, if it exists.
<br/>
 On a UNIX system, <i>latexmk</i> searches for following places for its system
  RC file, in the following order, and reads the first it finds:
<br/>
 &quot;/opt/local/share/latexmk/LatexMk&quot;,
<br/>
 &quot;/usr/local/share/latexmk/LatexMk&quot;,
<br/>
 &quot;/usr/local/lib/latexmk/LatexMk&quot;.
<br/>
 On a Fedora system, it only looks for &quot;/etc/latexmk.conf&quot;.
<br/>
 On a MS-Windows system it looks for &quot;C:\latexmk\LatexMk&quot;.
<br/>
 On a cygwin system (i.e., a MS-Windows system in which Perl is that of cygwin),
  <i>latexmk</i> reads the first it finds of
<br/>
 &quot;/cygdrive/c/latexmk/LatexMk&quot;,
<br/>
 &quot;/opt/local/share/latexmk/LatexMk&quot;,
<br/>
 &quot;/usr/local/share/latexmk/LatexMk&quot;,
<br/>
 &quot;/usr/local/lib/latexmk/LatexMk&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In addition, it then tries the same set of locations, but with the file name
  replaced &quot;LatexMk&quot; replaced by &quot;latexmkrc&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2) The user's RC file, if it exists. This can be in one of two places. The
  traditional one is &quot;.latexmkrc&quot; in the user's home directory. The
  other possibility is &quot;latexmk/latexmkrc&quot; in the user's XDG
  configuration home directory. The actual file read is the first of
  &quot;$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/latexmk/latexmkrc&quot; or &quot;$HOME/.latexmkrc&quot;
  which exists. (See
  https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html
  for details on the XDG Base Directory Specification.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Here $HOME is the user's home directory. [ <i>Latexmk</i> determines the user's
  home directory as follows: It is the value of the environment variable HOME,
  if this variable exists, which normally is the case on UNIX-like systems
  (including Linux and OS-X). Otherwise the environment variable USERPROFILE is
  used, if it exists, which normally is the case on MS-Windows systems.
  Otherwise a blank string is used instead of $HOME, in which case
  <i>latexmk</i> does not look for an RC file in it.]
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME is the value of the environment variable XDG_CONFIG_HOME if it
  exists. If this environment variable does not exist, but $HOME is non-blank,
  then $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set to the default value of $HOME/.config. Otherwise
  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is blank, and <i>latexmk</i> does not look for an RC file
  under it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
3) The RC file in the current working directory. This file can be named either
  &quot;latexmkrc&quot; or &quot;.latexmkrc&quot;, and the first of these to be
  found is used, if any.
<div class="Pp"></div>
4) Any RC file(s) specified on the command line with the <b>-r</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each RC file is a sequence of <i>Perl</i> commands. Naturally, a user can use
  this in creative ways. But for most purposes, one simply uses a sequence of
  assignment statements that override some of the built-in settings of
  <i>Latexmk</i>. Straightforward cases can be handled without knowledge of the
  <i>Perl</i> language by using the examples in this document as templates.
  Comment lines are introduced by the &quot;#&quot; character.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that command line options are obeyed in the order in which they are
  written; thus any RC file specified on the command line with the <b>-r</b>
  option can override previous options but can be itself overridden by later
  options on the command line. There is also the <b>-e</b> option, which allows
  initialization code to be specified in <i>latexmk</i>'s command line.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<i></i> <i>For possible examples of code for in an RC file, see the
  directory</i> <i>example_rcfiles in the distribution of </i><i>latexmk</i>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="HOW_TO_SET_VARIABLES_IN_INITIALIZATION_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#HOW_TO_SET_VARIABLES_IN_INITIALIZATION_FILES">HOW
  TO SET VARIABLES IN INITIALIZATION FILES</a></h1>
The important variables that can be configured are described in the section
  &quot;List of configuration variables usable in initialization files&quot;.
  Syntax for setting these variables is of the following forms:
<div class="Pp"></div>
	$bibtex = 'bibtex %O %B';
<div class="Pp"></div>
for the setting of a string variable,
<div class="Pp"></div>
	$preview_mode = 1;
<div class="Pp"></div>
for the setting of a numeric variable, and
<div class="Pp"></div>
	@default_files = ('paper', 'paper1');
<div class="Pp"></div>
for the setting of an array of strings. It is possible to append an item to an
  array variable as follows:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	push @default_files, 'paper2';
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that simple &quot;scalar&quot; variables have names that begin with a $
  character and array variables have names that begin with a @ character. Each
  statement ends with a semicolon.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Strings should be enclosed in single quotes. (You could use double quotes, as in
  many programming languages. But then the <i>Perl</i> programming language
  brings into play some special rules for interpolating variables into strings.
  People not fluent in <i>Perl</i> will want to avoid these complications.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can do much more complicated things, but for this you will need to consult a
  manual for the <i>Perl</i> programming language.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FORMAT_OF_COMMAND_SPECIFICATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#FORMAT_OF_COMMAND_SPECIFICATIONS">FORMAT
  OF COMMAND SPECIFICATIONS</a></h1>
Some of the variables set the commands that <i>latexmk</i> uses for carrying out
  its work, for example to generate a dvi file from a tex file or to view a
  postscript file. This section describes some important features of how the
  commands are specified. (Note&#x00A0;that some of the possibilities listed
  here do not apply to the <i>$kpsewhich</i> variable; see its documentation.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Placeholders</b>: Supposed you wanted <i>latexmk</i> to use the command
  elatex in place of the regular latex command, and suppose moreover that you
  wanted to give it the option &quot;--shell-escape&quot;. You could do this by
  the following setting:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 $latex = 'elatex --shell-escape %O %S';
<div class="Pp"></div>
The two items starting with the % character are placeholders. These are
  substituted by appropriate values before the command is run. Thus %S will be
  replaced by the source file that elatex will be applied to, and %O will be
  replaced by any options that <i>latexmk</i> has decided to use for this
  command. (E.g., if you used the <b>-silent</b> option in the invocation of
  <i>latexmk</i>, it results in the replacement of %O by
  &quot;-interaction=batchmode&quot;.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The available placeholders are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>%B</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">base of filename for current command. E.g., if a postscript
      file document.ps is being made from the dvi file document.dvi, then the
      basename is document.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>%D</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">destination file (e.g., the name of the postscript file
      when converting a dvi file to postscript).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>%O</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">options</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>%R</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">root filename. This is the base name for the main tex
    file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>%S</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">source file (e.g., the name of the dvi file when converting
      a dvi file to ps).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>%T</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The name of the primary tex file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>%Y</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Name of directory for auxiliary output files (see the
      configuration variable <i>$aux_dir</i>). A directory separation character
      ('/') is appended if <i>$aux_dir</i> is non-empty and does not end in a
      suitable character, with suitable characters being those appropriate to
      UNIX and MS-Windows, i.e., ':', '/' and '\'. Note that if after
      initialization, <i>$out_dir</i> is set, but <i>$aux_dir</i> is not set
      (i.e., it is blank), then <i>latexmk</i> sets <i>$aux_dir</i> to the same
      value <i>$out_dir</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>%Z</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Name of directory for output files (see the configuration
      variable <i>$out_dir</i>). A directory separation character ('/') is
      appended if <i>$out_dir</i> is non-empty and does not end in a suitable
      character, with suitable characters being those appropriate to UNIX and
      MS-Windows, i.e., ':', '/' and '\'.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If for some reason you need a literal % character in your string not subject to
  the above rules, use &quot;%%&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Appropriate quoting will be applied to the filename substitutions, so you
  mustn't supply them yourself even if the names of your files have spaces in
  them. (But if your TeX filenames have spaces in them, beware that many
  versions of the TeX program cannot correctly handle filenames containing
  spaces.) In case <i>latexmk</i>'s quoting does not work correctly on your
  system, you can turn it off -- see the documentation for the variable
  <i>$quote_filenames</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The distinction between %B and %R needs a bit of care, since they are often the
  same, but not always. For example on a simple document, the basename of a
  bibtex run is the same as for the texfile. But in a document with several
  bibliographies, the bibliography files will have a variety of names. Since
  bibtex is invoked with the basename of the bibliography file, the setting for
  the bibtex command should therefore be
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 $bibtex = 'bibtex %O %B';
<div class="Pp"></div>
Generally, you should use %B rather than %R. Similarly for most purposes, the
  name %T of the primary texfile is not a useful placeholder.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
See the default values in the section &quot;List of configuration variables
  usable in initialization files&quot; for what is normally the most appropriate
  usage.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you omit to supply any placeholders whatever in the specification of a
  command, <i>latexmk</i> will supply what its author thinks are appropriate
  defaults. This gives compatibility with configuration files for previous
  versions of <i>latexmk</i>, which didn't use placeholders.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>&quot;Detaching&quot; a command</b>: Normally when <i>latexmk</i> runs a
  command, it waits for the command to run to completion. This is appropriate
  for commands like latex, of course. But for previewers, the command should
  normally run detached, so that <i>latexmk</i> gets the previewer running and
  then returns to its next task (or exits if there is nothing else to do). To
  achieve this effect of detaching a command, you need to precede the command
  name with &quot;start &quot;, as in
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 $dvi_previewer = 'start xdvi %O %S';
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will be translated to whatever is appropriate for your operating system.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Notes: (1) In some circumstances, <i>latexmk</i> will always run a command
  detached. This is the case for a previewer in preview continuous mode, since
  otherwise previewing continuously makes no sense. (2) This precludes the
  possibility of running a command named start. (3) If the word start occurs
  more than once at the beginning of the command string, that is equivalent to
  having just one. (4) Under cygwin, some complications happen, since cygwin
  amounts to a complicated merging of UNIX and MS-Windows. See the source code
  for how I've handled the problem.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Command names containing spaces</b>: Under MS-Windows it is common that the
  name of a command includes spaces, since software is often installed in a
  subdirectory of &quot;C:\Program Files&quot;. Such command names should be
  enclosed in double quotes, as in
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 $lpr_pdf = '&quot;c:/Program Files/Ghostgum/gsview/gsview32.exe&quot; /p %S';
<br/>
 $pdf_previewer = 'start &quot;c:/Program Files/SumatraPDF/SumatraPDF.exe&quot;
  %O %S';
<br/>
 $pdf_previewer = 'start &quot;c:/Program Files/SumatraPDF
  (x86)/SumatraPDF.exe&quot; %O %S';
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(Note about the above example: Under MS-Windows forward slashes are equivalent
  to backslashes in a filename under almost all circumstances, provided that the
  filename is inside double quotes. It is easier to use forward slashes in
  examples like the one above, since then one does not have to worry about the
  rules for dealing with forward slashes in strings in the Perl language.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Command names under Cygwin</b>: If <i>latexmk</i> is executed by Cygwin's
  Perl, <i> be particularly certain that pathnames in commands have</i>
  <i></i><b>forward</b><i> slashes</i> not the usual backslashes for the
  separator of pathname components. See the above examples. Backslashes often
  get misinterpreted by the Unix shell used by Cygwin's Perl to execute external
  commands. Forward slashes don't suffer from this problem, and (when quoted, as
  above) are equally acceptable to MS-Windows.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Using MS-Windows file associations</b>: A useful trick under modern versions
  of MS-Windows (e.g., WinXP) is to use just the command 'start' by itself:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 $dvi_previewer = 'start %S';
<div class="Pp"></div>
Under MS-Windows, this will cause to be run whatever program the system has
  associated with dvi files. (The same applies for a postscript viewer and a pdf
  viewer.) But note that this trick is not always suitable for the pdf previwer,
  if your system has acroread for the default pdf viewer. As explained
  elsewhere, acroread under MS-Windows does not work well with <i>latex</i> and
  <i>latexmk</i>, because acroread locks the pdf file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Not using a certain command</b>: If a command is not to be run, the command
  name NONE is used, as in
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 $lpr = 'NONE lpr';
<div class="Pp"></div>
This typically is used when an appropriate command does not exist on your
  system. The string after the &quot;NONE&quot; is effectively a comment.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Options to commands</b>: Setting the name of a command can be used not only
  for changing the name of the command called, but also to add options to
  command. Suppose you want <i>latexmk</i> to use latex with source specials
  enabled. Then you might use the following line in an initialization file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 $latex = 'latex --src-specials %O %S';
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Running a subroutine instead of an external command</b>: Use a specification
  starting with &quot;internal&quot;, as in
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 $latex = 'internal mylatex %O %S';
<br/>
 sub mylatex {
<br/>
 my @args = @_;
<br/>
 # Possible preprocessing here
<br/>
 return system 'latex', @args;
<br/>
 }
<div class="Pp"></div>
For some of the more exotic possibilities that then become available, see the
  section &quot;ADVANCED CONFIGURATION: Some extra resources and advanced
  tricks&quot;. Also see some of the examples in the directory
  <i>example_rcfiles</i> in the <i>latexmk</i> distribution.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Advanced tricks</b>: Normally one specifies a single command for the commands
  invoked by <i>latexmk</i>. Naturally, if there is some complicated additional
  processing you need to do in your special situation, you can write a script
  (or batch file) to do the processing, and then configure <i>latexmk</i> to use
  your script in place of the standard program.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can also use a Perl subroutine instead of a script -- see above. This is
  generally the most flexible and portable solution.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
It is also possible to configure <i>latexmk</i> to run multiple commands. For
  example, if when running <i>pdflatex</i> to generate a pdf file from a tex
  file you need to run another program after <i>pdflatex</i> to perform some
  extra processing, you could do something like:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 $pdflatex = 'pdflatex --shell-escape %O %S; pst2pdf_for_latexmk %B';
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This definition assumes you are using a UNIX-like system (which includes Linux
  and OS-X), so that the two commands to be run are separated by the semicolon
  in the middle of the string.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you are using MS-Windows, you would replace the above line by
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 $pdflatex = 'cmd /c pdflatex --shell-escape %O %S'
<br/>
 . '&amp;&amp; pst2pdf_for_latexmk %B';
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Here, the UNIX command separator ; is replaced by &amp;&amp;. In addition, there
  is a problem that some versions of <i>Perl</i> on MS-Windows do not obey the
  command separator; this problem is overcome by explicitly invoking the
  MS-Windows command-line processor <i>cmd.exe</i>.

Default values are indicated in brackets.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>$always_view_file_via_temporary [0]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Whether ps and pdf files are initially to be made in a
      temporary directory and then moved to the final location. (This applies to
      <i>dvips</i>, <i>dvipdf</i>, and <i>ps2pdf</i> operations, and the
      filtering operators on dvi and ps files. It does not apply to
      <i>pdflatex</i>, unfortunately, since <i>pdflatex</i> provides no way of
      specifying a chosen name for the output file.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This use of a temporary file solves a problem that the making of these files
      can occupy a substantial time. If a viewer (notably <i>gv</i>) sees that
      the file has changed, it may read the new file before the program writing
      the file has not yet finished its work, which can cause havoc.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    See the <i>$pvc_view_file_via_temporary</i> variable for a setting that
      applies only if preview-continuous mode (-pvc option) is used. See
      <i>$tmpdir</i> for the setting of the directory where the temporary file

  <dd class="It-tag">Whether to automatically read the standard initialization
      (rc) files, which are the system RC file, the user's RC file, and the RC
      file in the current directory. The command line option <b>-norc</b> can be
      used to turn this setting off. Each RC file could also turn this setting
      off, i.e., it could set <i>$auto_rc_use</i> to zero to prevent automatic
      reading of the later RC files.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This variable does not affect the reading of RC files specified on the

      <i>$out_dir</i> is set, then <i>$aux_dir</i> is set to <i>$out_dir</i>,
      which is the directory to which general output files are to be written.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>Important note</b>: The effect of <i>$aux_dir</i>, if different from
      <i>$out_dir</i>, is achieved by giving <i>(pdf)latex</i> the
      <b>-aux-directory</b>. Currently (Dec. 2011 and later) this only works on
      the MiKTeX version of <i>(pdf)latex</i>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    See also the documentation of <i>$out_dir</i> for some complications on what
      directory names are suitable.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you also use the <b>-cd</b> option, and <i>$out_dir</i> (or
      <i>$aux_dir</i>) contains a relative path, then the path is interpreted
      relative to the document directory.

  <dd class="It-tag">A decimal number that specifies how large the banner

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>@BIBINPUTS</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is an array variable, now mostly obsolete, that
      specifies directories where <i>latexmk</i> should look for .bib files. By
      default it is set from the BIBINPUTS environment variable of the operating
      system. If that environment variable is not set, a single element list
      consisting of the current directory is set. The format of the directory
      names depends on your operating system, of course. Examples for setting
      this variable are:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     @BIBINPUTS = ( &quot;.&quot;, &quot;C:\\bibfiles&quot; );

    <br/>
     @BIBINPUTS = ( &quot;.&quot;, &quot;C:/bibfiles&quot; );
    <br/>
     @BIBINPUTS = ( &quot;.&quot;, &quot;//server/bibfiles&quot; );

     @BIBINPUTS = ( &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/usr/local/texmf/bibtex/bib&quot; );
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that under MS Windows, either a forward slash &quot;/&quot; or a
      backward slash &quot;\&quot; can be used to separate pathname components,
      so the first two and the second two examples are equivalent. Each backward
      slash should be doubled to avoid running afoul of <i>Perl</i>'s rules for

    These variables specify commands that are executed at certain points of
      compilations during preview-continuous mode. One motivation for their
      existance is to allow convenient visual indications of compilation status
      even when the window receiving the screen output of the compilation is
      hidden.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The commands are executed at the following points: $compiling_cmd at the
      start of compilation, $success_cmd at the end of a successful compilation,
      and $failure_cmd at the end of an unsuccessful compilation. If any of
      above variables is undefined (the default situation) or blank, then the
      corresponding command is not executed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    An example of a typical setting of these variables is as follows
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     $compiling_cmd = &quot;xdotool search --name \&quot;%D\&quot; set_window
      --name \&quot;%D compiling\&quot;&quot;;
    <br/>
     $success_cmd = &quot;xdotool search --name \&quot;%D\&quot; set_window
      --name \&quot;%D OK\&quot;&quot;;
    <br/>
     $failure_cmd = &quot;xdotool search --name \&quot;%D\&quot; set_window
      --name \&quot;%D FAILURE\&quot;&quot;;
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    These assume that the program <i>xdotool</i> is installed, that the
      previewer is using an X-Window system for display, and that the title of
      the window contains the name of the displayed file, as it normally does.
      When the commands are executed, the placeholder string %D is replaced by
      the name of the destination file, which is the previewed file. The above
      commands result in an appropriate string being appended to the filename in
      the window title: &quot; compiling&quot;, &quot; OK&quot;, or &quot;
      FAILURE&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Other placeholders that can be used are %S, %T, and %R, with %S and %T
      normally being identical. These can be useful for a command changing the
      title of the edit window. The visual indication in a window title can
      useful, since the user does not have to keep shifting attention to the
      (possibly hidden) compilation window to know the status of the
      compilation.

  <dd class="It-tag">When <i>latexmk</i> is invoked with no files specified on
      the command line, then, by default, it will process all files in the
      current directory with the extension .tex. (In general, it will process
      the files specified in the <i>@default_files</i> variable.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    But sometimes you want to exclude particular files from this default list.
      In that case you can specify the excluded files in the array
      <i>@default_excluded_files</i>. For example if you wanted to process all
      .tex files with the exception of common.tex, which is a not a standard
      alone LaTeX file but a file input by some or all of the others, you could
      do
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     @default_files = (&quot;*.tex&quot;);
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     @default_excluded_files = (&quot;common.tex&quot;);
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you have a variable or large number of files to be processed, this method
      saves you from having to list them in detail in <i>@default_files</i> and
      having to update the list every time you change the set of files to be
      processed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Notes: 1. This variable has no effect except when no files are specified on
      the <i>latexmk</i> command line. 2. Wildcards are allowed in

    If no filenames are specified on the command line, <i>latexmk</i> processes
      all tex files specified in the <i>@default_files</i> variable, which by
      default is set to all tex files (&quot;*.tex&quot;) in the current
      directory. This is a convenience: just run <i>latexmk</i> and it will
      process an appropriate set of files. But sometimes you want only some of
      these files to be processed. In this case you can list the files to be
      processed by setting <i>@default_files</i> in an initialization file
      (e.g., the file &quot;latexmkrc&quot; in the current directory). Then if
      no files are specified on the command line then the files you specify by
      setting <i>@default_files</i> are processed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

     @default_files = (&quot;paper1&quot;, &quot;paper2.tex&quot;);
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     @default_files = (&quot;*.tex&quot;, &quot;*.dtx&quot;);
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that more than file may be given, and that the default extension is
      &quot;.tex&quot;. Wild cards are allowed. The parentheses are because
      <i>@default_files</i> is an array variable, i.e., a sequence of filename

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    (Normally, a change of a source file during a run should provoke a rerun.
      This includes a file generated by LaTeX, e.g., an aux file, that is read
      in on subsequent runs. But after a run that results in an error, a new run
      should occur until the user has made a change in the files. But the user
      may have corrected an error in a source .tex file during the run. So
      <i>latexmk</i> needs to distinguish user-generated and automatically

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A convenient way to add an extra extension to the list, without losing the

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The general rule <i>latexmk</i> uses for determining when an extra run of
      some program is needed is that one of the source files has changed. But
      consider for example a latex package that causes an encapsulated
      postscript file (an &quot;eps&quot; file) to be made that is to be read in
      on the next run. The file contains a comment line giving its creation date
      and time. On the next run the time changes, <i>latex</i> sees that the eps
      file has changed, and therefore reruns latex. This causes an infinite
      loop, that is only terminated because <i>latexmk</i> has a limit on the
      number of runs to guard against pathological situations.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    But the changing line has no real effect, since it is a comment. You can
      instruct <i>latex</i> to ignore the offending line as follows:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     $hash_calc_ignore_pattern{'eps'} = '^%%CreationDate: ';
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This creates a rule for files with extension <i>.eps</i> about lines to
      ignore. The left-hand side is a <i>Perl</i> idiom for setting an item in a
      hash. Note that the file extension is specified without a period. The
      value, on the right-hand side, is a string containing a regular
      expresssion. (See documentation on <i>Perl</i> for how they are to be
      specified in general.) This particular regular expression specifies that
      lines beginning with &quot;%%CreationDate: &quot; are to be ignored in
      deciding whether a file of the given extension <i>.eps</i> has changed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    There is only one regular expression available for each extension. If you
      need more one pattern to specify lines to ignore, then you need to combine
      the patterns into a single regular expression. The simplest method is
      separate the different simple patterns by a vertical bar character
      (indicating &quot;alternation&quot; in the jargon of regular expressions).
      For example,
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     $hash_calc_ignore_pattern{'eps'} = '^%%CreationDate: |^%%Title: ';
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    causes lines starting with either &quot;^%%CreationDate: &quot; or
      &quot;^%%Title: &quot; to be ignored.

    The effect of this variable (when non-blank) is achieved by using the

      current (Dec. 2011 and later) implementations of TeX, i.e., MiKTeX and

    If you also use the <b>-cd</b> option, and <i>$out_dir</i> (or
      <i>$aux_dir</i>) contains a relative path, then the path is interpreted
      relative to the document directory.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Commonly, the directory specified for output files is a subdirectory of the
      current working directory. However, if you specify some other directory,
      e.g., &quot;/tmp/foo&quot; or &quot;../output&quot;, be aware that this
      could cause problems, e.g., with <i>makeindex</i> or <i>bibtex</i>. This
      is because modern versions of these programs, by default, will refuse to
      work when they find that they are asked to write to a file in a directory
      that appears not to be the current working directory or one of its
      subdirectories. This is part of security measures by the whole TeX system
      that try to prevent malicious or errant TeX documents from incorrectly
      messing with a user's files. If for <i>$out_dir</i> or <i>$aux_dir</i> you
      really do need to specify an absolute pathname (e.g.,
      &quot;/tmp/foo&quot;) or a path (e.g., &quot;../output&quot;) that
      includes a higher-level directory, and you need to use <i>makeindex</i> or
      <i>bibtex</i>, then you need to disable the security measures (and assume
      any risks). One way of doing this is to temporarily set an operating
      system environment variable openout_any to &quot;a&quot; (as in

     <b>Important note</b>: Normally you will want to have a previewer run
      detached, so that <i>latexmk</i> doesn't wait for the previewer to

      three variables to be set. For example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     $pdf_previewer = &quot;start xpdf -remote %R %O %S&quot;;
    <br/>
     $pdf_update_method = 4;
    <br/>
     $pdf_update_command = &quot;xpdf -remote %R -reload&quot;;
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The first setting arranges for the xpdf program to be used in its
      &quot;remote server mode&quot;, with the server name specified as the
      rootname of the TeX file. The second setting arranges for updating to be
      done in response to a command, and the third setting sets the update
      command.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    It is generally recommended to use this option (or to configure the

      However, some implementations instead produce files named for the program,
      i.e., latex.fls or pdflatex.fls. In this second case, <i>latexmk</i>
      copies the latex.fls or pdflatex.fls to a file with the basename of the

<div class="Pp"></div>
A custom dependency rule is invoked whenever <i>latexmk</i> detects that a run
  of latex/pdflatex needs to read a file, like a graphics file, whose extension
  is the to-extension of a custom dependency. Then <i>latexmk</i> examines
  whether a file exists with the same name, but with the corresponding
  from-extension, as specified in the custom-dependency rule. If it does, then
  the rule whenever the destination file (the one with the to-extension) is
  out-of-date with respect to the corresponding source file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To make the new destination file, the <i>Perl</i> subroutine specified in the
  rule is invoked, with an argument that is the base name of the files in
  question. Simple cases just involve a subroutine invoking an external program;
  this can be done by following the templates below, even by those without
  knowledge of the <i>Perl</i> programming language. Of course, experts could do
  something much more elaborate.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
One other item in each custom-dependency rule, labeled &quot;must&quot; above,
  specifies how the rule should be applied when the source file fails to exist.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A simple and typical example of code in an initialization rcfile is
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 add_cus_dep( 'fig', 'eps', 0, 'fig2eps' );
<br/>
 sub fig2eps {
<br/>
 return system( &quot;fig2dev -Leps \&quot;$_[0].fig\&quot;
  \&quot;$_[0].eps\&quot;&quot; );
<br/>
 }
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The first line adds a custom dependency that converts a file with extension
  &quot;fig&quot;, as created by the <i>xfig</i> program, to an encapsulated
  postscript file, with extension &quot;eps&quot;. The remaining lines define a
  subroutine that carries out the conversion. If a rule for converting
  &quot;fig&quot; to &quot;eps&quot; files already exists (e.g., from a
  previously read-in initialization file), the <i>latexmk</i> will delete this
  rule before making the new one.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Suppose <i>latexmk</i> is using this rule to convert a file
  &quot;figure.fig&quot; to &quot;figure.eps&quot;. Then it will invoke the
  fig2eps subroutine defined in the above code with a single argument
  &quot;figure&quot;, which is the basename of each of the files (possibly with
  a path component). This argument is referred to by <i>Perl</i> as $_[0]. In
  the example above, the subroutine uses the <i>Perl</i> command system to
  invoke the program fig2dev. The double quotes around the string are a
  <i>Perl</i> idiom that signify that each string of the form of a variable
  name, $_[0] in this case, is to be substituted by its value.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the return value of the subroutine is non-zero, then <i>latexmk</i> will
  assume an error occurred during the execution of the subroutine. In the above
  example, no explicit return value is given, and instead the return value is
  the value returned by the last (and only) statement, i.e., the invocation of
  system, which returns the value 0 on success.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you use <i>pdflatex</i> instead of latex, then you will probably prefer to
  convert your graphics files to pdf format, in which case you would replace the
  above code in an initialization file by
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 add_cus_dep( 'fig', 'pdf, 0, 'fig2pdf' );
<br/>
 sub fig2pdf {
<br/>
 return system( &quot;fig2dev -Lpdf \&quot;$_[0].fig\&quot;
  \&quot;$_[0].pdf\&quot;&quot; );
<br/>
 }
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Note 1:</b> In the command lines given in the system commands in the above
  examples, double quotes have been inserted around the file names (implemented
  by '\&quot;' in the Perl language). They immunize the running of the program
  against special characters in filenames. Very often these quotes are not
  necessary, i.e., they can be omitted. But it is normally safer to keep them
  in. Even though the rules for quoting vary between operating systems, command
  shells and individual pieces of software, the quotes in the above examples do
  not cause problems in the cases I have tested.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Note 2:</b> One case in which the quotes are important is when the files are
  in a subdirectory and your operating system is Microsoft Windows. Then the
  separator character for directory components can be either a forward slash '/'
  or Microsoft's more usual backward slash &#x00B4;\'. Forward slashes are
  generated by <i>latexmk</i>, to maintain its sanity from software like MiKTeX
  that mixes both directory separators; but their correct use normally requires
  quoted filenames. (See a log file from a run of MiKTeX (at least in v. 2.9)
  for an example of the use of both directory separators.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you have some general custom dependencies defined in the system or user
  initialization file, you may find that for a particular project they are
  undesirable. So you might want to delete the unneeded ones. For example, you
  remove any &quot;fig&quot; to &quot;eps&quot; rule by the line
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 remove_cus_dep( 'fig', 'eps' );
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you have complicated sets of custom dependencies, you may want to get a
  listing of the custom dependencies. This is done by using the line
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 show_cus_dep();
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
in an initialization file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Another example of a custom dependency overcomes a limitation of <i>latexmk</i>
  concerning index files. The only index-file conversion built-in to
  <i>latexmk</i> is from an &quot;.idx&quot; file written on one run of
  latex/pdflatex to an &quot;.ind&quot; file to be read in on a subsequent run.
  But with the index.sty package you can create extra indexes with extensions
  that you configure. <i>Latexmk</i> does not know how to deduce the extensions
  from the information it has. But you can easily write a custom dependency. For
  example if your latex file uses the command
  &quot;\newindex{special}{ndx}{nnd}{Special index}&quot; you will need to
  convert files with the extension <i>.ndx</i> to <i>.nnd</i>. The following
  lines in an initialization RC file will cause this to happen:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 add_cus_dep('ndx', 'nnd', 0, 'makendx2nnd');
<br/>
 sub makendx2nnd {
<br/>
 return system( &quot;makeindex -o \&quot;$_[0].nnd\&quot;
  \&quot;$_[0].ndx\&quot;&quot; );
<br/>
 }
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Those of you with experience with Makefiles, will undoubtedly be concerned that
  the <i>.ndx</i> file is written during a run of latex/pdflatex and is always
  later than the <i>.nnd</i> last read in. Thus the <i>.nnd</i> appears to be
  perpetually out-of-date. This situation, of circular dependencies, is endemic
  to latex, and <i>latexmk</i> in its current version works correctly with
  circular dependencies. It examines the contents of the files (by use of an md5
  checksum), and only does a remake when the file contents have actually
  changed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Of course if you choose to write random data to the <i>.nnd</i> (or the
  <i>.aux</i> file, etc) that changes on each new run, then you will have a
  problem. For real experts: See the <i>%hash_cal_ignore_pattern</i> if you have
  to deal with such problems.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Glossaries can be dealt with similarly.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OLD_METHOD_OF_DEFINING_CUSTOM_DEPENDENCIES"><a class="selflink" href="#OLD_METHOD_OF_DEFINING_CUSTOM_DEPENDENCIES">OLD
  METHOD OF DEFINING CUSTOM DEPENDENCIES</a></h1>
In previous versions of <i>latexmk</i>, the only method of defining custom
  dependencies was to directly manipulate the table of custom dependencies. This
  is contained in the <b>@cus_dep_list</b> array. It is an array of strings, and
  each string in the array has four items in it, each separated by a space, the
  from-extension, the to-extension, the &quot;must&quot; item, and the name of
  the subroutine for the custom dependency. These were all defined above.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An example of the old method of defining custom dependencies is as follows. It
  is the code in an RC file to ensure automatic conversion of <i>.fig</i> files
  to <i>.eps</i> files:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 push @cus_dep_list, &quot;fig eps 0 fig2eps&quot;;
<br/>
 sub fig2eps {
<br/>
 return system( &quot;fig2dev -Lps \&quot;$_[0].fig\&quot;
  \&quot;$_[0].eps\&quot;&quot; );
<br/>
 }
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This method still works, and is equivalent to the earlier code using the
  add_cus_dep subroutine, except that it doesn't delete any previous
  custom-dependency for the same conversion. So the new method is preferable.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

  CONFIGURATION: Some extra resources and advanced tricks</a></h1>
For most purposes, simple configuration for <i>latexmk</i> along the lines of
  the examples given is sufficient. But sometimes you need something harder. In
  this section, I indicate some extra possibilities. Generally to use these, you
  need to be fluent in the Perl language, since this is what is used in the rc
  files.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
See also the section DEALING WITH ERRORS, PROBLEMS, ETC. See also the examples
  in the directory <i>example_rcfiles</i> in the <i>latexmk</i> distributions.
  Even if none of the examples apply to your case, they may give ideas

  and subroutines for processing a rule</a></h2>
A step in the processing is called a rule. One possibility to implement the
  processing of a rule is by a Perl subroutine. This is always the case for
  custom dependencies. Also, for any other rule, you can use a subroutine by
  prefixing the command specification by the word &quot;internal&quot; -- see
  the section FORMAT OF COMMAND SPECIFICATIONS.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When you use a subroutine for processing a rule, all the possibilities of Perl
  programming are available, of course. In addition, some of <i>latexmk</i>'s
  internal variables and subroutines are available. The ones listed below are
  intended to be available to (advanced) users, and their specifications will
  generally have stability under upgrades. Generally, the variables should be
  treated as read-only: Changing their values can have bad consequences, since
  it is liable to mess up the consistency of what <i>latexmk</i> is doing.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>$rule</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This variable has the name of the rule, as known to

      methods don't find the dependency. Almost always the first argument is the

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Advanced_configuration:_Using_latexmk_with_make"><a class="selflink" href="#Advanced_configuration:_Using_latexmk_with_make">Advanced
  configuration: Using <i>latexmk</i><b></b> <b>with</b>
  <b></b><i>make</i></a></h2>
This section is targeted only at advanced users who use the <i>make</i> program
  for complex projects, as for software development, with the dependencies
  specified by a Makefile.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Now the basic task of <i>latexmk</i> is to run the appropriate programs to make
  a viewable version of a LaTeX document. However, the usual <i>make</i> program
  is not suited to this purpose for at least two reasons. First is that the use
  of LaTeX involves circular dependencies (e.g., via .aux files), and these
  cannot be handled by the standard <i>make</i> program. Second is that in a
  large document the set of source files can change quite frequently,
  particularly with included graphics files; in this situation keeping a
  Makefile manually updated is inappropriate and error-prone, especially when
  the dependencies can be determined automatically. <i>Latexmk</i> solves both
  of these problems robustly.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Thus for many standard LaTeX documents <i>latexmk</i> can be used by itself
  without the <i>make</i> program. In a complex project it simply needs to be
  suitably configured. A standard configuration would be to define custom
  dependencies to make graphics files from their source files (e.g., as created
  by the <i>xfig</i> program). Custom dependencies are <i>latexmk</i>'s
  equivalent of pattern rules in Makefiles.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Nevertheless there are projects for which a Makefile is appropriate, and it is
  useful to know how to use <i>latexmk</i> from a Makefile. A typical example
  would be to generate documentation for a software project. Potentially the
  interaction with the rest of the rules in the Makefile could be quite
  complicated, for example if some of the source files for a LaTeX document are
  generated by the project's software.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In this section, I give a couple of examples of how <i>latexmk</i> can be
  usefully invoked from a Makefile. The examples use specific features of
  current versions of GNU <i>make</i>, which is the default on both linux and
  OS-X systems. They may need modifications for other versions of <i>make</i>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The simplest method is simply to delegate all the relevant tasks to
  <i>latexmk</i>, as is suitable for a straightforward LaTeX document. For this
  a suitable Makefile is like
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 .PHONY : FORCE_MAKE
<br/>
 all : try.pdf
<br/>
 %.pdf : %.tex FORCE_MAKE
<br/>
 latexmk -pdf -dvi- -ps- $&lt;
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
(Note: the last line must be introduced by a tab for the Makefile to function
  correctly!) Naturally, if making try.pdf from its associated LaTeX file
  try.tex were the only task to be performed, a direct use of <i>latexmk</i>
  without a Makefile would normally be better. The benefit of using a Makefile
  for a LaTeX document would be in a larger project, where lines such as the
  above would be only be a small part of a larger Makefile.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The above example has a pattern rule for making a .pdf file from a .tex file,
  and it is defined to use <i>latexmk</i> in the obvious way. There is a
  conventional default target named &quot;all&quot;, with a prerequisite of
  try.pdf. So when <i>make</i> is invoked, by default it makes try.pdf. The only
  complication is that there may be many source files beyond try.tex, but these
  aren't specified in the Makefile, so changes in them will not by themselves
  cause <i>latexmk</i> to be invoked. Instead, the pattern rule is equipped with
  a &quot;phony&quot; prerequisite FORCE_MAKE; this has the effect of causing
  the rule to be always out-of-date, so that <i>latexmk</i> is always run. It is
  <i>latexmk</i> that decides whether any action is needed, e.g., a rerun of
  <i>pdflatex</i>. Effectively the Makefile delegates all decisions to
  <i>latexmk</i>, while <i>make</i> has no knowledge of the list of source files
  except for primary LaTeX file for the document. If there are, for example,
  graphics files to be made, these must be made by custom dependencies
  configured in <i>latexmk</i>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
But something better is needed in more complicated situations, for example, when
  the making of graphics files needs to be specified by rules in the Makefile.
  To do this, one can use a Makefile like the following:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 TARGETS = document1.pdf document2.pdf
<br/>
 DEPS_DIR = .deps
<br/>
 LATEXMK = latexmk -recorder -use-make -deps \
<br/>
 -e 'warn qq(In Makefile, turn off custom dependencies\n);' \
<br/>
 -e '@cus_dep_list = ();' \
<br/>
 -e 'show_cus_dep();'
<br/>
 all : $(TARGETS)
<br/>
 $(foreach file,$(TARGETS),$(eval -include $(DEPS_DIR)/$(file)P))
<br/>
 $(DEPS_DIR) :
<br/>
 mkdir $@
<br/>
 %.pdf : %.tex
<br/>
 if [ ! -e $(DEPS_DIR) ]; then mkdir $(DEPS_DIR); fi
<br/>
 $(LATEXMK) -pdf -dvi- -ps- -deps-out=$(DEPS_DIR)/$@P $&lt;
<br/>
 %.pdf : %.fig
<br/>
 fig2dev -Lpdf $&lt; $@
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
(Again, the lines containing the commands for the rules should be started with
  tabs.) This example was inspired by how GNU <i>automake</i> handles automatic
  dependency tracking of C source files.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
After each run of <i>latexmk</i>, dependency information is put in a file in the
  .deps subdirectory. The Makefile causes these dependency files to be read by
  <i>make</i>, which now has the full dependency information for each target
  .pdf file. To make things less trivial it is specificed that two files
  document1.pdf and document2.pdf are the targets. The dependency files are
  .deps/document1.pdfP and .deps/document2.pdfP.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There is now no need for the phony prerequisite for the rule to make .pdf files
  from .tex files. But I have added a rule to make .pdf files from .fig files
  produced by the <i>xfig</i> program; these are commonly used for graphics
  insertions in LaTeX documents. <i>Latexmk</i> is arranged to output a
  dependency file after each run. It is given the <b>-recorder</b> option, which
  improves its detection of files generated during a run of <i>pdflatex</i>;
  such files should not be in the dependency list. The <b>-e</b> options are
  used to turn off all custom dependencies, and to document this. Instead the
  <b>-use-make</b> is used to delegate the making of missing files to
  <i>make</i> itself.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Suppose in the LaTeX file there is a command \includegraphics{graph}, and an
  <i>xfig</i> file &quot;graph.fig&quot; exists. On a first run, <i>pdflatex</i>
  reports a missing file, named &quot;graph&quot;. <i>Latexmk</i> succeeds in
  making &quot;graph.pdf&quot; by calling &quot;make graph.pdf&quot;, and after
  completion of its work, it lists &quot;fig.pdf&quot; among the dependents of
  the file <i>latexmk</i> is making. Then let &quot;fig.fig&quot; be updated,
  and then let <i>make</i> be run. <i>Make</i> first remakes
  &quot;fig.pdf&quot;, and only then reruns <i>latexmk</i>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Thus we now have a method by which all the subsidiary processing is delegated to
  <i>make</i>.

Sometimes a viewer (gv) tries to read an updated .ps or .pdf file after its
  creation is started but before the file is complete. Work around: manually
  refresh (or reopen) display. Or use one of the other previewers and update
  methods.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
(The following isn't really a bug, but concerns features of previewers.) Preview
  continuous mode only works perfectly with certain previewers: Xdvi on
  UNIX/Linux works for dvi files. Gv on UNIX/Linux works for both postscript and
  pdf. Ghostview on UNIX/Linux needs a manual update (reopen); it views
  postscript and pdf. Gsview under MS-Windows works for both postscript and pdf,
  but only reads the updated file when its screen is refreshed. Acroread under
  UNIX/Linux views pdf, but the file needs to be closed and reopened to view an
  updated version. Under MS-Windows, acroread locks its input file and so the
  pdf file cannot be updated. (Remedy: configure <i>latexmk</i> to use
  <i>sumatrapdf</i> instead.)
