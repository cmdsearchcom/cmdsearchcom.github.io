perlos390 - building and installing Perl for OS/390 and z/OS
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
This document will help you Configure, build, test and install Perl on OS/390
  (aka z/OS) Unix System Services.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This is a fully ported Perl for OS/390 Version 2 Release 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
  It may work on other versions or releases, but those are the ones we've tested
  it on.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may need to carry out some system configuration tasks before running the
  Configure script for Perl.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Tools"><a class="selflink" href="#Tools">Tools</a></h2>
The z/OS Unix Tools and Toys list may prove helpful and contains links to ports
  of much of the software helpful for building Perl.

Gunzip/gzip for OS/390 is discussed at:

<pre>
  http://www.ibm.com/servers/eserver/zseries/zos/unix/bpxa1ty1.html
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
to extract an ASCII tar archive on OS/390, try this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   pax -o to=IBM-1047,from=ISO8859-1 -r &lt; latest.tar
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>

<pre>
   zcat latest.tar.Z | pax -o to=IBM-1047,from=ISO8859-1 -r

<div class="Pp"></div>
If you get lots of errors of the form
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  tar: FSUM7171 ...: cannot set uid/gid: EDC5139I Operation not permitted.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
you didn't read the above and tried to use tar instead of pax, you'll first have
  to remove the (now corrupt) perl directory
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   rm -rf perl-...
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and then use pax.

Be sure that your yacc installation is in place including any necessary parser
  template files. If you have not already done so then be sure to:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  cp /samples/yyparse.c /etc
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This may also be a good time to ensure that your /etc/protocol file and either
  your /etc/resolv.conf or /etc/hosts files are in place. The IBM document that
  described such USS system setup issues was SC28-1890-07 &quot;OS/390 UNIX
  System Services Planning&quot;, in particular Chapter 6 on customizing the OE
  shell.
<div class="Pp"></div>
GNU make for OS/390, which is recommended for the build of perl (as well as
  building CPAN modules and extensions), is available from the
  &quot;Tools&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some people have reported encountering &quot;Out of memory!&quot; errors while
  trying to build Perl using GNU make binaries. If you encounter such trouble
  then try to download the source code kit and build GNU make from source to
  eliminate any such trouble. You might also find GNU make (as well as Perl and
  Apache) in the red-piece/book &quot;Open Source Software for OS/390
  UNIX&quot;, SG24-5944-00 from IBM.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If instead of the recommended GNU make you would like to use the system supplied
  make program then be sure to install the default rules file properly via the
  shell command:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    cp /samples/startup.mk /etc
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and be sure to also set the environment variable _C89_CCMODE=1 (exporting
  _C89_CCMODE=1 is also a good idea for users of GNU make).
<div class="Pp"></div>
You might also want to have GNU groff for OS/390 installed before running the
  &quot;make install&quot; step for Perl.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is a syntax error in the /usr/include/sys/socket.h header file that IBM
  supplies with USS V2R7, V2R8, and possibly V2R9. The problem with the header
  file is that near the definition of the SO_REUSEPORT constant there is a
  spurious extra '/' character outside of a comment like so:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 #define SO_REUSEPORT    0x0200    /* allow local address &amp; port
                                      reuse */                    /
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You could edit that header yourself to remove that last '/', or you might note
  that Language Environment (LE) APAR PQ39997 describes the problem and PTF's
  UQ46272 and UQ46271 are the (R8 at least) fixes and apply them. If left
  unattended that syntax error will turn up as an inability for Perl to build
  its &quot;Socket&quot; extension.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For successful testing you may need to turn on the sticky bit for your world
  readable /tmp directory if you have not already done so (see man chmod).

  Perl on OS/390</a></h2>
Once you've unpacked the distribution, run &quot;sh Configure&quot; (see INSTALL
  for a full discussion of the Configure options). There is a &quot;hints&quot;
  file for os390 that specifies the correct values for most things. Some things
  to watch out for include:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A message of the form:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
 (I see you are using the Korn shell.  Some ksh's blow up on Configure,
 mainly on older exotic systems.  If yours does, try the Bourne shell instead.)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    is nothing to worry about at all.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Some of the parser default template files in /samples are
      needed in /etc. In particular be sure that you at least copy
      /samples/yyparse.c to /etc before running Perl's Configure. This step
      ensures successful extraction of EBCDIC versions of parser files such as
      perly.c, perly.h, and x2p/a2p.c. This has to be done before running
      Configure the first time. If you failed to do so then the easiest way to
      re-Configure Perl is to delete your misconfigured build root and
      re-extract the source from the tar ball. Then you must ensure that
      /etc/yyparse.c is properly in place before attempting to re-run
    Configure.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">This port will support dynamic loading, but it is not
      selected by default. If you would like to experiment with dynamic loading
      then be sure to specify -Dusedl in the arguments to the Configure script.
      See the comments in hints/os390.sh for more information on dynamic
      loading. If you build with dynamic loading then you will need to add the
      $archlibexp/CORE directory to your LIBPATH environment variable in order
      for perl to work. See the config.sh file for the value of $archlibexp. If
      in trying to use Perl you see an error message similar to:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>

      has been renamed to /etc/protocol (NOT /etc/protocols, as used by other
      Unix systems). You may have to look for things like HOSTNAME and

&quot;Out of memory!&quot; messages during the build of Perl are most often
  fixed by re building the GNU make utility for OS/390 from a source code kit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another memory limiting item to check is your MAXASSIZE parameter in your
  'SYS1.PARMLIB(BPXPRMxx)' data set (note too that as of V2R8 address space
  limits can be set on a per user ID basis in the USS segment of a RACF
  profile). People have reported successful builds of Perl with MAXASSIZE
  parameters as small as 503316480 (and it may be possible to build Perl with a
  MAXASSIZE smaller than that).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Within USS your /etc/profile or $HOME/.profile may limit your ulimit settings.
  Check that the following command returns reasonable values:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    ulimit -a
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To conserve memory you should have your compiler modules loaded into the Link
  Pack Area (LPA/ELPA) rather than in a link list or step lib.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the c89 compiler complains of syntax errors during the build of the Socket
  extension then be sure to fix the syntax error in the system header
  /usr/include/sys/socket.h.

The &quot;make test&quot; step runs a Perl Verification Procedure, usually
  before installation. You might encounter STDERR messages even during a
  successful run of &quot;make test&quot;. Here is a guide to some of the more
  commonly seen anomalies:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>

    <pre>
     chmod a+t /tmp

  <dd class="It-tag">Out of Memory!
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Recent perl test suite is quite memory hungry. In addition to the comments
      above on memory limitations it is also worth checking for _CEE_RUNOPTS in
      your environment. Perl now has (in miniperlmain.c) a C #pragma to set CEE
      run options, but the environment variable wins.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The C code asks for:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
 #pragma runopts(HEAP(2M,500K,ANYWHERE,KEEP,8K,4K) STACK(,,ANY,) ALL31(ON))
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The important parts of that are the second argument (the increment) to HEAP,
      and allowing the stack to be &quot;Above the (16M) line&quot;. If the heap
      increment is too small then when perl (for example loading
      unicode/Name.pl) tries to create a &quot;big&quot; (400K+) string it
      cannot fit in a single segment and you get &quot;Out of Memory!&quot; -
      even if there is still plenty of memory available.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A related issue is use with perl's malloc. Perl's malloc uses
      &quot;sbrk()&quot; to get memory, and &quot;sbrk()&quot; is limited to the
      first allocation so in this case something like:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  HEAP(8M,500K,ANYWHERE,KEEP,8K,4K)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    is needed to get through the test suite.</dd>

When using perl on OS/390 please keep in mind that the EBCDIC and ASCII
  character sets are different. See perlebcdic.pod for more on such character
  set issues. Perl builtin functions that may behave differently under EBCDIC
  are also mentioned in the perlport.pod document.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Open Edition (UNIX System Services) from V2R8 onward does support
  #!/path/to/perl script invocation. There is a PTF available from IBM for V2R7
  that will allow shell/kernel support for #!. USS releases prior to V2R7 did
  not support the #! means of script invocation. If you are running V2R6 or
  earlier then see:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    head `whence perldoc`

<div class="Pp"></div>
for an example of how to use the &quot;eval exec&quot; trick to ask the shell to
  have Perl run your scripts on those older releases of Unix System Services.

If you are having trouble with square brackets then consider switching your

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Floating_Point_Anomalies_with_Perl_on_OS/390"><a class="selflink" href="#Floating_Point_Anomalies_with_Perl_on_OS/390">Floating
  Point Anomalies with Perl on OS/390</a></h2>
There appears to be a bug in the floating point implementation on S/390 systems
  such that calling <i>int()</i> on the product of a number and a small
  magnitude number is not the same as calling <i>int()</i> on the quotient of
  that number and a large magnitude number. For example, in the following Perl
  code:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    my $x = 100000.0;
    my $y = int($x * 1e-5) * 1e5; # '0'
    my $z = int($x / 1e+5) * 1e5;  # '100000'
    print &quot;\$y is $y and \$z is $z\n&quot;; # $y is 0 and $z is 100000
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Although one would expect the quantities $y and $z to be the same and equal to
  100000 they will differ and instead will be 0 and 100000 respectively.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The problem can be further examined in a roughly equivalent C program:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;math.h&gt;
    main()
    {
    double r1,r2;
    double x = 100000.0;
    double y = 0.0;
    double z = 0.0;
    x = 100000.0 * 1e-5;
    r1 = modf (x,&amp;y);
    x = 100000.0 / 1e+5;
    r2 = modf (x,&amp;z);
    printf(&quot;y is %e and z is %e\n&quot;,y*1e5,z*1e5);
    /* y is 0.000000e+00 and z is 1.000000e+05 (with c89) */
    }
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Modules_and_Extensions_for_Perl_on_OS/390"><a class="selflink" href="#Modules_and_Extensions_for_Perl_on_OS/390">Modules
  and Extensions for Perl on OS/390</a></h2>
Pure pure (that is non xs) modules may be installed via the usual:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you built perl with dynamic loading capability then that would also be the
  way to build xs based extensions. However, if you built perl with the default
  static linking you can still build xs based extensions for OS/390 but you will
  need to follow the instructions in ExtUtils::MakeMaker for building statically
  linked perl binaries. In the simplest configurations building a static perl +
  xs extension boils down to:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make perl
    make test
    make install
    make -f Makefile.aperl inst_perl MAP_TARGET=perl
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In most cases people have reported better results with GNU make rather than the
  system's /bin/make program, whether for plain modules or for xs based
  extensions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the make process encounters trouble with either compilation or linking then
  try setting the _C89_CCMODE to 1. Assuming sh is your login shell then run:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    export _C89_CCMODE=1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If tcsh is your login shell then use the setenv command.
