<p>PERLOS390(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLOS390(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlos390 - building and installing Perl for OS/390 and
z/OS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
This document will help you Configure, build, test and
install Perl on OS/390 (aka z/OS) Unix System Services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This is a fully ported Perl for OS/390 Version 2 Release 3,
5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. It may work on other versions or
releases, but those are the ones we&rsquo;ve tested it
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may need to carry out some
system configuration tasks before running the Configure
script for Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tools <br>
The z/OS Unix Tools and Toys list may prove helpful and
contains links to ports of much of the software helpful for
building Perl. <br>

http://www.ibm.com/servers/eserver/zseries/zos/unix/bpxa1toy.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unpacking Perl distribution on
OS/390 <br>
If using ftp remember to transfer the distribution in binary
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gunzip/gzip for OS/390 is
discussed at:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.ibm.com/servers/eserver/zseries/zos/unix/bpxa1ty1.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to extract an ASCII tar archive
on OS/390, try this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pax -o
to=IBM-1047,from=ISO8859-1 -r &lt; latest.tar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zcat latest.tar.Z | pax -o
to=IBM-1047,from=ISO8859-1 -r</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you get lots of errors of the
form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tar: FSUM7171 ...: cannot set
uid/gid: EDC5139I Operation not permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">you didn&rsquo;t read the above
and tried to use tar instead of pax, you&rsquo;ll first have
to remove the (now corrupt) perl directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rm -rf perl-...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and then use pax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setup and utilities for Perl on
OS/390 <br>
Be sure that your yacc installation is in place including
any necessary parser template files. If you have not already
done so then be sure to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cp /samples/yyparse.c /etc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This may also be a good time to
ensure that your /etc/protocol file and either your
/etc/resolv.conf or /etc/hosts files are in place. The IBM
document that described such USS <br>
system setup issues was SC28-1890-07 &quot;OS/390 UNIX
System Services Planning&quot;, in particular Chapter 6 on
customizing the OE shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GNU make for OS/390, which is
recommended for the build of perl (as well as building CPAN
modules and extensions), is available from the
&quot;Tools&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some people have reported
encountering &quot;Out of memory!&quot; errors while trying
to build Perl using GNU make binaries. If you encounter such
trouble then try to download the source <br>
code kit and build GNU make from source to eliminate any
such trouble. You might also find GNU make (as well as Perl
and Apache) in the red-piece/book &quot;Open Source Software
for <br>
OS/390 UNIX&quot;, SG24-5944-00 from IBM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If instead of the recommended
GNU make you would like to use the system supplied make
program then be sure to install the default rules file
properly via the shell command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cp /samples/startup.mk /etc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and be sure to also set the
environment variable _C89_CCMODE=1 (exporting _C89_CCMODE=1
is also a good idea for users of GNU make).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You might also want to have GNU
groff for OS/390 installed before running the &quot;make
install&quot; step for Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a syntax error in the
/usr/include/sys/socket.h header file that IBM supplies with
USS V2R7, V2R8, and possibly V2R9. The problem with the
header file is that near the <br>
definition of the SO_REUSEPORT constant there is a spurious
extra &rsquo;/&rsquo; character outside of a comment like
so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define SO_REUSEPORT 0x0200 /*
allow local address &amp; port <br>
reuse */ /</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You could edit that header
yourself to remove that last &rsquo;/&rsquo;, or you might
note that Language Environment (LE) APAR PQ39997 describes
the problem and PTF&rsquo;s UQ46272 and UQ46271 are <br>
the (R8 at least) fixes and apply them. If left unattended
that syntax error will turn up as an inability for Perl to
build its &quot;Socket&quot; extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For successful testing you may
need to turn on the sticky bit for your world readable /tmp
directory if you have not already done so (see man
chmod).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configure Perl on OS/390 <br>
Once you&rsquo;ve unpacked the distribution, run &quot;sh
Configure&quot; (see INSTALL for a full discussion of the
Configure options). There is a &quot;hints&quot; file for
os390 that specifies the <br>
correct values for most things. Some things to watch out for
include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A message of the
form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(I see you are using the Korn
shell. Some ksh&rsquo;s blow up on Configure, <br>
mainly on older exotic systems. If yours does, try the
Bourne shell instead.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is nothing to worry about at
all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Some of the
parser default template files in /samples are needed in
/etc. In particular be sure that you at least copy
/samples/yyparse.c to /etc before running Perl&rsquo;s <br>
Configure. This step ensures successful extraction of EBCDIC
versions of parser files such as perly.c, perly.h, and
x2p/a2p.c. This has to be done before running Configure <br>
the first time. If you failed to do so then the easiest way
to re-Configure Perl is to delete your misconfigured build
root and re-extract the source from the tar ball. <br>
Then you must ensure that /etc/yyparse.c is properly in
place before attempting to re-run Configure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; This port will
support dynamic loading, but it is not selected by default.
If you would like to experiment with dynamic loading then be
sure to specify -Dusedl in the <br>
arguments to the Configure script. See the comments in
hints/os390.sh for more information on dynamic loading. If
you build with dynamic loading then you will need to add
<br>
the $archlibexp/CORE directory to your LIBPATH environment
variable in order for perl to work. See the config.sh file
for the value of $archlibexp. If in trying to use Perl <br>
you see an error message similar to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CEE3501S The module libperl.dll
was not found. <br>
From entry point __dllstaticinit at compile unit offset
+00000194 at</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then your LIBPATH does not have
the location of libperl.x and either libperl.dll or
libperl.so in it. Add that directory to your LIBPATH and
proceed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Do not turn on
the compiler optimization flag &quot;-O&quot;. There is a
bug in either the optimizer or perl that causes perl to not
work correctly when the optimizer is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Some of the
configuration files in /etc used by the networking APIs are
either missing or have the wrong names. In particular, make
sure that there&rsquo;s either an <br>
/etc/resolv.conf or an /etc/hosts, so that gethostbyname()
works, and make sure that the file /etc/proto has been
renamed to /etc/protocol (NOT /etc/protocols, as used by
<br>
other Unix systems). You may have to look for things like
HOSTNAME and DOMAINORIGIN in the
&quot;//&rsquo;SYS1.TCPPARMS(TCPDATA)&rsquo;&quot; PDS
member in order to properly set up your /etc <br>
networking files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Build, Test, Install Perl on
OS/390 <br>
Simply put:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh Configure <br>
make <br>
make test</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if everything looks ok (see the
next section for test/IVP diagnosis) then:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">make install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">this last step may or may not
require UID=0 privileges depending on how you answered the
questions that Configure asked and whether or not you have
write access to the <br>
directories you specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Build Anomalies with Perl on
OS/390 <br>
&quot;Out of memory!&quot; messages during the build of Perl
are most often fixed by re building the GNU make utility for
OS/390 from a source code kit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another memory limiting item to
check is your MAXASSIZE parameter in your
&rsquo;SYS1.PARMLIB(BPXPRMxx)&rsquo; data set (note too that
as of V2R8 address space limits can be set on a per <br>
user ID basis in the USS segment of a RACF profile). People
have reported successful builds of Perl with MAXASSIZE
parameters as small as 503316480 (and it may be possible to
<br>
build Perl with a MAXASSIZE smaller than that).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Within USS your /etc/profile or
$HOME/.profile may limit your ulimit settings. Check that
the following command returns reasonable values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ulimit -a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To conserve memory you should
have your compiler modules loaded into the Link Pack Area
(LPA/ELPA) rather than in a link list or step lib.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the c89 compiler complains of
syntax errors during the build of the Socket extension then
be sure to fix the syntax error in the system header
/usr/include/sys/socket.h.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Testing Anomalies with Perl on
OS/390 <br>
The &quot;make test&quot; step runs a Perl Verification
Procedure, usually before installation. You might encounter
STDERR messages even during a successful run of &quot;make
test&quot;. Here is a <br>
guide to some of the more commonly seen anomalies:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A message of the
form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">io/openpid...........CEE5210S
The signal SIGHUP was received. <br>
CEE5210S The signal SIGHUP was received. <br>
CEE5210S The signal SIGHUP was received. <br>
ok</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indicates that the
t/io/openpid.t test of Perl has passed but done so with
extraneous messages on stderr from CEE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A message of the
form:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">lib/ftmp-security....File::Temp::_gettemp:
Parent directory (/tmp/) is not safe <br>
(sticky bit not set when world writable?) at
lib/ftmp-security.t line 100 <br>
File::Temp::_gettemp: Parent directory (/tmp/) is not safe
(sticky bit not <br>
set when world writable?) at lib/ftmp-security.t line 100
<br>
ok</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indicates a problem with the
permissions on your /tmp directory within the HFS. To
correct that problem issue the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chmod a+t /tmp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">from an account with write
access to the directory entry for /tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Out of
Memory!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recent perl test suite is quite
memory hungry. In addition to the comments above on memory
limitations it is also worth checking for _CEE_RUNOPTS in
your environment. Perl <br>
now has (in miniperlmain.c) a C #pragma to set CEE run
options, but the environment variable wins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The C code asks for:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#pragma
runopts(HEAP(2M,500K,ANYWHERE,KEEP,8K,4K) STACK(,,ANY,)
ALL31(ON))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The important parts of that are
the second argument (the increment) to HEAP, and allowing
the stack to be &quot;Above the (16M) line&quot;. If the
heap increment is too small then when <br>
perl (for example loading unicode/Name.pl) tries to create a
&quot;big&quot; (400K+) string it cannot fit in a single
segment and you get &quot;Out of Memory!&quot; - even if
there is still <br>
plenty of memory available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A related issue is use with
perl&rsquo;s malloc. Perl&rsquo;s malloc uses
&quot;sbrk()&quot; to get memory, and &quot;sbrk()&quot; is
limited to the first allocation so in this case something
like:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">HEAP(8M,500K,ANYWHERE,KEEP,8K,4K)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is needed to get through the
test suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Installation Anomalies with Perl
on OS/390 <br>
The installman script will try to run on OS/390. There will
be fewer errors if you have a roff utility installed. You
can obtain GNU groff from the Redbook SG24-5944-00 ftp <br>
site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usage Hints for Perl on OS/390
<br>
When using perl on OS/390 please keep in mind that the
EBCDIC and ASCII character sets are different. See
perlebcdic.pod for more on such character set issues. Perl
builtin <br>
functions that may behave differently under EBCDIC are also
mentioned in the perlport.pod document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Open Edition (UNIX System
Services) from V2R8 onward does support #!/path/to/perl
script invocation. There is a PTF available from IBM for
V2R7 that will allow shell/kernel <br>
support for #!. USS releases prior to V2R7 did not support
the #! means of script invocation. If you are running V2R6
or earlier then see:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">head &lsquo;whence
perldoc&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for an example of how to use the
&quot;eval exec&quot; trick to ask the shell to have Perl
run your scripts on those older releases of Unix System
Services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are having trouble with
square brackets then consider switching your rlogin or
telnet client. Try to avoid older 3270 emulators and ISHELL
for working with Perl on USS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Floating Point Anomalies with
Perl on OS/390 <br>
There appears to be a bug in the floating point
implementation on S/390 systems such that calling int() on
the product of a number and a small magnitude number is not
the same as <br>
calling int() on the quotient of that number and a large
magnitude number. For example, in the following Perl
code:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $x = 100000.0; <br>
my $y = int($x * 1e-5) * 1e5; # &rsquo;0&rsquo; <br>
my $z = int($x / 1e+5) * 1e5; # &rsquo;100000&rsquo; <br>
print &quot; is $y and is $z0; # $y is 0 and $z is
100000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although one would expect the
quantities $y and $z to be the same and equal to 100000 they
will differ and instead will be 0 and 100000
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The problem can be further
examined in a roughly equivalent C program:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; <br>
#include &lt;math.h&gt; <br>
main() <br>
{ <br>
double r1,r2; <br>
double x = 100000.0; <br>
double y = 0.0; <br>
double z = 0.0; <br>
x = 100000.0 * 1e-5; <br>
r1 = modf (x,&amp;y); <br>
x = 100000.0 / 1e+5; <br>
r2 = modf (x,&amp;z); <br>
printf(&quot;y is %e and z is %e0,y*1e5,z*1e5); <br>
/* y is 0.000000e+00 and z is 1.000000e+05 (with c89) */
<br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Extensions for Perl
on OS/390 <br>
Pure pure (that is non xs) modules may be installed via the
usual:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl Makefile.PL <br>
make <br>
make test <br>
make install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you built perl with dynamic
loading capability then that would also be the way to build
xs based extensions. However, if you built perl with the
default static linking you <br>
can still build xs based extensions for OS/390 but you will
need to follow the instructions in ExtUtils::MakeMaker for
building statically linked perl binaries. In the simplest
<br>
configurations building a static perl + xs extension boils
down to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl Makefile.PL <br>
make <br>
make perl <br>
make test <br>
make install <br>
make -f Makefile.aperl inst_perl MAP_TARGET=perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In most cases people have
reported better results with GNU make rather than the
system&rsquo;s /bin/make program, whether for plain modules
or for xs based extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the make process encounters
trouble with either compilation or linking then try setting
the _C89_CCMODE to 1. Assuming sh is your login shell then
run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export _C89_CCMODE=1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If tcsh is your login shell then
use the setenv command.</p>
