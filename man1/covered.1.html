<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Covered is a Verilog code coverage analysis tool that can be
useful for determining how well a diagnostic test suite is
covering the design under test. Covered reads in the
Ver&acirc; <br>
ilog design files and a VCD, LXT2 or FST formatted dumpfile
from a diagnostic run and generates a database file called a
Coverage Description Database (CDD) file, using the score
<br>
command. Covered&rsquo;s score command can alternatively be
used to generate a CDD file and a Verilog module for using
Covered as a VPI module in a testbench which can obtain
coverage <br>
information in parallel with simulation (see USING COVERED
AS A VPI MODULE). The resulting CDD file can be merged with
other CDD files from the same design to create accummulated
<br>
coverage, using the merge command. Once a CDD file is
created, the user can use Covered to generate various
human-readable coverage reports in an ASCII format or use
Covered&rsquo;s <br>
GUI to interactively look at coverage results, using the
report command. If uncovered coverage points are found that
the user wants to exclude from coverage, this can be handled
<br>
with either the command-line exclude command or within the
GUI. When multiple CDD files are created from the same
design, the user may obtain a coverage ranking of those CDD
<br>
files to determine an ideal order for regression testing as
well as understand which CDD files can be excluded from
regressions due to their inability to hit new coverage
points. <br>
Additionally, as part of Covered&rsquo;s score command, race
condition possibilities are found in the design files and
can be either ignored, flagged as warnings or flagged as
errors. <br>
By specifying race conditions as errors, Covered can also be
used as a race condition checker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLOBAL OPTIONS <br>
These options are placed immediately after the keyword
covered in the command-line. They can be used for any
command (with the exception of -v and -h) and have the same
effect <br>
in each case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Obfuscate. Obfuscates all
design-sensitive names before outputting in user-readable
format. This option is useful when sharing output with the
developers of Covered for <br>
debugging purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Debug. Display information
helpful for debugging tool problems. Note: This option is
now only available when covered is built with the
--enable-debug configuration <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Help. Display this usage
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P [filename] <br>
Profiling mode. Turns on internal source code profiler that
will produce a profiling report of the run command to either
the specified filename or, if no filename is <br>
present, to a file called covered.prof. This option is only
available if the --enable-profiling configuration option was
specified when Covered was built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Quiet mode. Causes all output
to be suppressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Terse mode. Causes all output
to be suppressed with the exception of warning messages and
the Covered header information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Version. Display current
Covered version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
score Parses Verilog files and VCD/LXT2/FST dumpfiles to
create database file used for merging and reporting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge Merges two or more
database files into one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">report Generates human-readable
coverage reports from database file or starts the coverage
report GUI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rank Generates a report that
specifies an ideal order to run regressions and specifies
CDD files that do not add new coverage information (and can,
therefore, be excluded from <br>
regressions, if desired).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exclude <br>
Allows one or more coverage points (identified with
exclusion IDs in a report generated with the -x option) to
have their exclusion property toggled (include to exclude or
<br>
exclude to include) and, if the exclusion property is set to
exclude, optionally allow a reason for the exclusion to be
associated with it and stored in the specified CDD <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCORE COMMAND <br>
The following options are valid for the score command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A ovl Causes OVL assertions to
be used for assertion coverage. This flag must be given to
the score command if assertion coverage metrics are needed
in the report command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cdd database <br>
Same as the -o option. Useful when CDD file being scored is
an input to the score command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cli [filename] <br>
Causes the command-line debugger to be used during
VCD/LXT2/FST dumpfile scoring. If filename is specified,
this file contains information saved in a previous call to
<br>
savehist on the CLI and causes the history contained in this
file to be replayed prior to the CLI command prompt. If
filename is not specified, the CLI prompt will be <br>
immediately available at the start of simulation. This
option is only available when Covered is configured with the
--enable-debug option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-conservative <br>
If this option is specified, any logic blocks that contain
code that could cause coverage discrepancies leading to
potentially inaccurate coverage results are removed from
<br>
coverage consideration. See User&rsquo;s Guide for more
information on what type of code can lead to coverage
inaccuracies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dumpvars [filename] <br>
If this option is specified without the -vcd or -lxt
options, the design is parsed, a CDD file is created and a
top-level Verilog module file named filename (if this value
<br>
is specified) or &quot;covered_dump.v&quot; (if filename is
not specified) is created. This file is used in the
compilation of the simulator to create a dumpfile that is
optimized <br>
for obtaining coverage for the specified CDD file. If either
the -vcd or -lxt options are specified, this option has no
effect. See the User&rsquo;s Guide for more information <br>
on how to use this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D define_name <br>
Defines the specified name to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D define_name=value <br>
Defines the specified name to the specified value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e block_name <br>
Name of module, task, function or named begin/end block to
not score. Causes all subblocks in the Verilog tree under
this block to also not be scored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ea Excludes all always blocks
from being considered for coverage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ec Excludes all continuous
assignments from being considered for coverage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ei Excludes all initial blocks
from being considered for coverage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ef Excludes all final blocks
from being considered for coverage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ep [name] <br>
Excludes all code found between &rsquo;// coverage
off&rsquo; and &rsquo;// coverage on&rsquo; pragmas embedded
within the design. If name is specified, the keyword in the
pragma will be changed <br>
to that name instead of the default &quot;coverage&quot;,
allowing the user to change the look of the pragma if it
conflicts with any other tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F
module_name=[in_expr,]out_expr <br>
Indicates to the parser where to find the FSM located in
module module_name which has an input state expression
called in_expr and output state expression called out_expr.
<br>
If in_expr is not specified, out_expr is used as both the
input and output state expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filename <br>
Name of file containing additional arguments to parse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fst filename <br>
Name of FST dumpfile to score design with. If -vcd, -lxt or
this option is not used, Covered will only create an initial
CDD file from the design and will not attempt to <br>
score the design.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g [module_name=](1|2|3) <br>
Allows the user to limit the parser to a specific generation
of the Verilog standard for a specific module or the entire
design, where 1=Verilog-1995, 2=Verilog-2001, <br>
3=SystemVerilog. If module_name= is specified, the parser
uses the specified Verilog standard for that module only,
allowing the rest of the design to use the global <br>
standard. By default, the global standard is set to the most
recent version (3). This option can be specified more than
once for a given call to the score command; how&acirc; <br>
ever, if the -g option specifies more than global value
(i.e., without the module= prefix), only the last option
value will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Displays this help
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I directory <br>
Directory to find included Verilog files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i instance_name <br>
Verilog hierarchical reference to the module that is at the
top of the tree to be scored. This option is necessary if
module to verify coverage is not the top-level mod&acirc;
<br>
ule in the design. If not specified, -t value is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lxt filename <br>
Name of LXT2 dumpfile to score design with. If -vcd, -fst or
this option is not used, Covered will only create an initial
CDD file from the design and will not attempt to <br>
score the design.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m message <br>
Allows the user to specify information about this CDD file.
This information can be anything (messages with whitespace
should be surrounded by double-quotation marks), <br>
but may include something about the simulation arguments to
more easily link the CDD file to its simulation for purposes
of recreating the CDD file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o database <br>
Name of database to write coverage information to. If not
specified, the output database filename will be
&quot;cov.cdd&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p filename <br>
Overrides default filename used to store intermediate
preprocessor output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P parameter_scope=value <br>
Performs a defparam on the specified parameter with
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rS When race condition checks
are violated, the offending logic blocks are removed from
coverage consideration and all output is suppressed
regarding the race condition vio&acirc; <br>
lation. See user documentation for more information about
race condition checking usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rW When race condition checks
are violated, the offending logic blocks are removed from
coverage consideration and the race condition violation is
output. This is the <br>
default behavior for race condition handling. See user
documentation for more information about race condition
checking usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rE When race condition checks
are violated, the reason is output and scoring ends
immediately. See user documentation for more information
about race condition checking <br>
usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rI[=module name] <br>
If module name is not specified, race condition checking is
skipped altogether for the entire design. If module name is
specified, race condition checking is skipped for <br>
the specified module. See user documentation for more
information about race condition checking usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rP[=name]) <br>
Uses embedded pragmas for ignoring certain code from race
condition checking consideration (if name is specified it is
used as the pragma keyword). See user documentation <br>
for more information about race condition checking
usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Outputs simulation statistics
after simulation has completed. This information is
currently only useful for the developers of Covered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t top-level module <br>
Specifies the module name of the top-most module that will
be measured. Note that this module does not need to be the
top-most module in the simulator. This field is <br>
required for all calls to the score command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-top_ts timescale <br>
This option is only valid when the -vpi or -dumpvars options
have been specified. This option allows the user to specify
a timescale for the generated Verilog module cre&acirc; <br>
ated with the -vpi/-dumpvars option. If this option is not
specified, no timescale will be created for the generated
module. The value of timescale is specified as fol&acirc;
<br>
lows:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">(1|10|100)(s|ms|us|ns|ps|fs)/(1|10|100)(s|ms|us|ns|ps|fs)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If whitespace is needed between
the various values, place the entire contents of timescale
in double quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ts number <br>
When scoring occurs, this option allows the user to see how
far the simulator has progressed by outputting the current
timestep to standard output. The value of number <br>
specifies how many timesteps are allowed to be simulated
before outputting the current timestep (results in less
calls to output stream).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T (min|typ|max) <br>
Specifies which value to use when encountering a delay
expression in the form: min:typ:max. If this option is not
specified, &rsquo;typ&rsquo; select is used by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v filename <br>
Name of specific Verilog file to score.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vcd filename <br>
Name of VCD dumpfile to score design with. If -lxt, -fst or
this option is not used, Covered will only create an initial
CDD file from the design and will not attempt to <br>
score the design.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vpi [filename] <br>
If this option is specified without the -vcd, -lxt or -fst
options, the design is parsed, a CDD file is created and a
top-level Verilog module file named filename (if this <br>
value is specified) or &quot;covered_vpi.v&quot; (if
filename is not specified) is created along with a PLI table
file called filename.ta b or &quot;covered_vpi.v.ta b&quot;.
Both of these <br>
files are used in the compilation of the simulator to use
Covered as a VPI module. If either the -vcd, -lxt or -fst
options are specified, this option has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wignore <br>
Suppress the output of warnings during code parsing and
simulation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y directory <br>
Directory to find unspecified Verilog files.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">+libext+.extension[+.extension]*+
<br>
Extensions of Verilog files to allow in scoring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MERGE COMMAND <br>
The following options are valid for the merge command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d filename <br>
Directory to search for CDD files to include. This option is
used in conjunction with the -ext option which specifies the
file extension to use for determining which <br>
files in the directory are CDD files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-er (first|last|all|new|old)
<br>
Specifies how to handle exclusion reason resolution. If two
or more CDD files being merged have exclusion reasons
specified for the same coverage point, the exclusion <br>
reason needs to be resolved (unless it is the same string
value). If this option is not specified and a conflict is
found, Covered will interactively request input for <br>
each exclusion as to how to handle it. If this option is
specified, it tells Covered how to handle all exclusion
reason conflicts. The values are as follows:.br</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">first - CDD file that contained
the first exclusion reason is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">last - CDD file that contained
the last exclusion reason is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all - All exclusion reasons are
used (concatenated).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new - Use the newest exclusion
reason specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">old - Use the oldest exclusion
reason specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ext extension <br>
Used in conjunction with the -d option. If no -ext options
are specified on the command-line, the default value of
&rsquo;.cdd&rsquo; is used. Note that a period (.) should be
spec&acirc; <br>
ified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filename <br>
Name of file containing additional arguments to parse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Displays this help
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m message <br>
Allows the user to specify information about this CDD file.
This information can be anything (messages with whitespace
should be surrounded by double-quotation marks).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o filename <br>
File to output new database to. If this argument is not
specified, the existing_database is used as the output
database name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORT COMMAND <br>
The following options are valid with the report command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b If combinational logic
verbose output is reported and the expression is a vector
operation, this option outputs the coverage information on a
bitwise basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c If -v is specified, displays
covered metrics only. Default is to display uncovered
information only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d (s|d|v) <br>
Level of detail to provide in coverage report information (s
= summary, d = detailed, v = verbose). Default is
summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Outputs all excluded coverage
points to the report file along with any specified exclusion
reasons if the -d d or -d v options are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filename <br>
Name of file containing additional arguments to parse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Displays this help
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Provides coverage information
for instances instead of module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m [l][t][c][f][r][a][m] <br>
Type(s) of metrics to report. l=line, t=toggle,
c=combinational logic, f=FSM state and state transition,
r=race conditions, a=assertion, m=memory. Default is
ltcf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o filename <br>
File to output report information to. Default is standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Suppresses modules/instances
that contain no coverage information from being output to
the report. Used to help eliminate potentially meaningless
information from the <br>
report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Deprecated. Replaced by
&rsquo;-d d&rsquo; or &rsquo;-d v&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-view Starts the GUI interface
for interactive coverage reporting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w (number) <br>
Specifies the maximum line width (in characters) that can be
used to output Verilog information. If this option is not
specified, all Verilog code in the report will <br>
retain the same formatting as was specified in the original
Verilog code. If this option is specified, Verilog code will
be formatted to use as much of the current line <br>
as possible, wrapping text when the line reaches the maximum
line width. The default maximum line width is 115 characters
(this value is used if no number is specified <br>
with the -w option). If a number is specified with the -w
option, this value is used for the maximum line width.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Outputs the exclusion IDs of
all uncovered and excluded coverage points within
parenthesis before the associated verbose output of the
coverage point. The exclusion IDs <br>
can be used to exclude/include coverage points via the
exclude command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RANK COMMAND <br>
The following options are valid with the rank command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d filename <br>
Directory to search for CDD files to include. This option is
used in conjunction with the -ext option which specifies the
file extension to use for determining which <br>
files in the directory are CDD files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-depth number <br>
Specifies the minimum number of needed CDD files to hit each
coverage point. The value of number should be greater than
zero. Default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ext extension <br>
Used in conjunction with the -d option. If no -ext options
are specified on the command-line, the default value of
&rsquo;.cdd&rsquo; is used. Note that a period (.) should be
spec&acirc; <br>
ified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filename <br>
Name of file containing additional arguments to parse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Displays help information for
the rank command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-names-only <br>
If specified, outputs only the needed CDD filenames that
need to be run in the order they need to be run. If this
option is not set, a report-style output is provided <br>
with additional information. This option is meant to be
useful in scripts that only want CDD filenames to run as
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o filename <br>
Name of file to output ranking information to. Default is
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-required-cdd filename <br>

displayed when the rank command is run. It outputs
diagnostic information about each of the different phases of
the ranking algorithm includ&acirc; <br>
ing run-time, number of CDD files included/excluded and
number of coverage points hit by ranked CDDs during each
phase. This information is meant to be useful for those <br>
interested in the ranking algorithm and its performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-weight-assert number <br>
Specifies a relative weighting for assertion coverage used
to rank non-unique coverage points. The value of number is
relative to the values used in the -weight-toggle, <br>
-weight-memory, -weight-comb, -weight-fsm and -weight-line
rank command options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-weight-comb number <br>
Specifies a relative weighting for combinational logic
coverage used to rank non-unique coverage points. The value
of number is relative to the values used in the <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXCLUDE COMMAND <br>
The following options are valid with the exclude
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filename <br>
Specifies the name of a file that contains more options to
the exclude command. This option may be specified as many
times as necessary for a single call to the exclude <br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Generates usage information
for the exclude command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Allows for an exclusion
message to be associated with any coverage points going from
the included state to the excluded state. For each coverage
point that meets this <br>
requirement, the user will be prompted to input a reason.
The reason may be any length and any number of lines;
however, all formatting characters (i.e., newlines, tabs,
<br>
extra spaces, etc.) will be removed and replaced with a
single space when it is later displayed. To end the input of
a message, hit a return, enter a single period (.) <br>
character and hit return again. The final period character
will not be part of the exclusion message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Causes all specified coverage
points to print their current exclusion status and exclusion
reason (if one exists for the excluded coverage point) to
standard output. If <br>
this option is specified, the -m option will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING COVERED AS A VPI MODULE
<br>
In addition to using Covered&rsquo;s score command to parse
a VCD, LXT2 or FST file to abstract coverage information,
Covered may also be used as a VPI module within a simulator
to <br>
extract this information. The advantages to using Covered as
a VPI over a dumpfile reader include the following. First,
VCD files can be extrememly large, especially for long <br>
simulations, using up valuable disk space. Second, if you
are using a simulator that dumps files in a different format
than VCD, LXT2 or FST and you want to convert these dump
<br>
file types to one of these versions, the cost of disk space
and time can make creating dumpfiles that Covered requires
undesirable. Additionally, though using Covered as a VPI
<br>
module will slow down your simulation speed, it is most
likely that the total time spent simulating your design and
scoring the design in one step will be shorter than doing so
<br>
in two steps. As a result, Covered&rsquo;s configure utility
can generate VPI-ready libraries for the following free and
commercial simulators (Icarus Verilog, CVER and VCS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To automatically build the
VPI-ready library files when generating Covered from source,
simply specify one or more of the following when running the
&quot;configure&quot; utility in the <br>
base Covered directory: --with-iv=&lt;Icarus Verilog install
path&gt;, --with-vcs=&lt;VCS include path&gt;,
--with-cver=&lt;CVER include path&gt;. After Covered has
been configured, simply type <br>
&rsquo;make&rsquo; and &rsquo;make install&rsquo;. This will
install the VPI-ready library files in the installation
libexec directory (by default this path will be
/usr/local/libexec).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before you are ready to compile
the design, you must first create a CDD file, a top-level
Verilog file, and a PLI table file (the last file is only
needed for the VCS compiler). <br>
This is done by specifying the -vpi (filename) option to
Covered&rsquo;s score command. If no filename is specified
after -vpi, the files covered_vpi.v and covered_vpi.ta b
will be <br>
created along with the generated coverage file. Note that
this step only needs to be performed once unless the design
files change. You are now ready to compile the
simulator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are compiling an Icarus
Verilog simulation, simply add &rsquo;-m
/usr/local/libexec/covered.vpi covered_vpi.v&rsquo; to the
&rsquo;iverilog&rsquo; command-line. Once compilation is
complete, run <br>
the generated executable file as you normally would.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are compiling a CVER
simulation, simply add
&rsquo;+loadvpi=/usr/local/libexec/covered.cver.so:vpi_compat_bootstrap
covered_vpi.v&rsquo; to the &rsquo;cver&rsquo;
command-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are compiling a VCS
simulation, simply add &rsquo;+vpi -load
/usr/local/libexec/covered.vcs.so:covered_register
covered_vpi.v&rsquo; to the &rsquo;vcs&rsquo; command-line.
Once compilation is <br>
complete, run the generated executable file as you normally
would.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are compiling a
NC-Verilog simulation, switch to NC-Verilog&rsquo;s irun
command to load the covered shared object: &rsquo;-loadvpi
/usr/local/libexec/covered.ncv.so:covered_register&rsquo;
<br>
and enable all access with &rsquo;-access +rwc&rsquo;. You
can hardcode the $covered_sim call into your RTL or you can
run it dynamically using the CLI, by adding the -input
input.tcl switch <br>
to irun. Where the input.tcl file looks like the following
and tb.dut is the coverage instance: <br>
call -systf {$covered_sim} {&quot;scored.cdd&quot;} tb.dut
<br>
run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two plusargs that can
be passed to the generated executable when it is run that
Covered will parse. The
&rsquo;+covered_cdd=&lt;filename&gt;&rsquo; option will
cause Covered to output <br>
the scored design contents to the CDD file specified by
&lt;filename&gt;. This allows multiple runs of the simulator
to generate several different CDD files without needed a
recompile <br>
to occur. The &rsquo;+covered_debug&rsquo; option will cause
Covered to dump a lot of excessive output about its internal
run-time state during simulation. This output will only be
gener&acirc; <br>
ated if Covered was configured with the --enable-debug
option. This plusarg option should not be used by regular
users as it is primarily intended to aid the developers of
Cov&acirc; <br>
ered in debugging.</p>
