<b>agedu</b> scans a directory tree and produces reports about how much disk
  space is used in each directory and subdirectory, and also how that usage of
  disk space corresponds to files with last-access times a long time ago.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In other words, <b>agedu</b> is a tool you might use to help you free up disk
  space. It lets you see which directories are taking up the most space, as
  <b>du</b> does; but unlike <b>du</b>, it also distinguishes between large
  collections of data which are still in use and ones which have not been
  accessed in months or years - for instance, large archives downloaded,
  unpacked, used once, and never cleaned up. Where <b>du</b> helps you find
  what's using your disk space, <b>agedu</b> helps you find what's
  <i>wasting</i> your disk space.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>agedu</b> has several operating modes. In one mode, it scans your disk and
  builds an index file containing a data structure which allows it to
  efficiently retrieve any information it might need. Typically, you would use
  it in this mode first, and then run it in one of a number of `query' modes to
  display a report of the disk space usage of a particular directory and its
  subdirectories. Those reports can be produced as plain text (much like
  <b>du</b>) or as HTML. <b>agedu</b> can even run as a miniature web server,
  presenting each directory's HTML report with hyperlinks to let you navigate
  around the file system to similar reports for other directories.
<div class="Pp"></div>
So you would typically start using <b>agedu</b> by telling it to do a scan of a
  directory tree and build an index. This is done with a command such as
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
$&#x00A0; <b>agedu&#x00A0;-s&#x00A0;/home/fred</b>
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
which will build a large data file called <b>agedu.dat</b> in your current
  directory. (If that current directory is <i>inside</i> <b>/home/fred</b>,
  don't worry - <b>agedu</b> is smart enough to discount its own index file.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Having built the index, you would now query it for reports of disk space usage.
  If you have a graphical web browser, the simplest and nicest way to query the
  index is by running <b>agedu</b> in web server mode:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
$&#x00A0; <b>agedu&#x00A0;-w</b>
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
which will print (among other messages) a URL on its standard output along the
  lines of
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
URL:&#x00A0;http://127.0.0.1:48638/
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(That URL will always begin with ` <b>127.</b>', meaning that it's in the
  <b>localhost</b> address space. So only processes running on the same computer
  can even try to connect to that web server, and also there is access control
  to prevent other users from seeing it - see below for more detail.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now paste that URL into your web browser, and you will be shown a graphical
  representation of the disk usage in <b>/home/fred</b> and its immediate
  subdirectories, with varying colours used to show the difference between
  disused and recently-accessed data. Click on any subdirectory to descend into
  it and see a report for its subdirectories in turn; click on parts of the
  pathname at the top of any page to return to higher-level directories. When
  you've finished browsing, you can just press Ctrl-D to send an end-of-file
  indication to <b>agedu</b>, and it will shut down.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After that, you probably want to delete the data file <b>agedu.dat</b>, since
  it's pretty large. In fact, the command <b>agedu -R</b> will do this for you;
  and you can chain <b>agedu</b> commands on the same command line, so that
  instead of the above you could have done
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
$&#x00A0; <b>agedu&#x00A0;-s&#x00A0;/home/fred&#x00A0;-w&#x00A0;-R</b>
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
for a single self-contained run of <b>agedu</b> which builds its index, serves
  web pages from it, and cleans it up when finished.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you don't have a graphical web browser, you can do text-based queries as
  well. Having scanned <b>/home/fred</b> as above, you might run
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
$&#x00A0; <b>agedu&#x00A0;-t&#x00A0;/home/fred</b>
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
which again gives a summary of the disk usage in <b>/home/fred</b> and its
  immediate subdirectories; but this time <b>agedu</b> will print it on standard
  output, in much the same format as <b>du</b>. If you then want to find out how
  much <i>old</i> data is there, you can add the <b>-a</b> option to show only
  files last accessed a certain length of time ago. For example, to show only
  files which haven't been looked at in six months or more:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
$&#x00A0; <b>agedu&#x00A0;-t&#x00A0;/home/fred&#x00A0;-a&#x00A0;6m</b>
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
That's the essence of what <b>agedu</b> does. It has other modes of operation
  for more complex situations, and the usual array of configurable options. The
  following sections contain a complete reference for all its functionality.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPERATING_MODES"><a class="selflink" href="#OPERATING_MODES">OPERATING
  MODES</a></h1>
This section describes the operating modes supported by <b>agedu</b>. Each of
  these is in the form of a command-line option, sometimes with an argument.
  Multiple operating-mode options may appear on the command line, in which case
  <b>agedu</b> will perform the specified actions one after another. For
  instance, as shown in the previous section, you might want to perform a disk
  scan and immediately launch a web server giving reports from that scan.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-s</b> <i>directory</i> or <b>--scan</b>
    <i>directory</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In this mode, <b>agedu</b> scans the file system starting
      at the specified directory, and indexes the results of the scan into a
      large data file which other operating modes can query.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, the scan is restricted to a single file system (since the expected
  use of <b>agedu</b> is that you would probably use it because a particular
  disk partition was running low on space). You can remove that restriction
  using the <b>--cross-fs</b> option; other configuration options allow you to
  include or exclude files or entire subdirectories from the scan. See the next
  section for full details of the configurable options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The index file is created with restrictive permissions, in case the file system
  you are scanning contains confidential information in its structure.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Index files are dependent on the characteristics of the CPU architecture you
  created them on. You should not expect to be able to move an index file
  between different types of computer and have it continue to work. If you need
  to transfer the results of a disk scan to a different kind of computer, see
  the <b>-D</b> and <b>-L</b> options below.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-w</b> or <b>--web</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In this mode, <b>agedu</b> expects to find an index file
      already written. It allocates a network port, and starts up a web server
      on that port which serves reports generated from the index file. By
      default it invents its own URL and prints it out.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
The web server runs until <b>agedu</b> receives an end-of-file event on its
  standard input. (The expected usage is that you run it from the command line,
  immediately browse web pages until you're satisfied, and then press Ctrl-D.)
  To disable the EOF behaviour, use the <b>--no-eof</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In case the index file contains any confidential information about your file
  system, the web server protects the pages it serves from access by other
  people. On Linux, this is done transparently by means of using
  <b>/proc/net/tcp</b> to check the owner of each incoming connection; failing
  that, the web server will require a password to view the reports, and
  <b>agedu</b> will print the password it invented on standard output along with
  the URL.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Configurable options for this mode let you specify your own address and port
  number to listen on, and also specify your own choice of authentication method
  (including turning authentication off completely) and a username and password
  of your choice.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-t</b> <i>directory</i> or <b>--text</b>
    <i>directory</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In this mode, <b>agedu</b> generates a textual report on
      standard output, listing the disk usage in the specified directory and all
      its subdirectories down to a given depth. By default that depth is 1, so
      that you see a report for <i>directory</i> itself and all of its immediate
      subdirectories. You can configure a different depth (or no depth limit)
      using <b>-d</b>, described in the next section.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
Used on its own, <b>-t</b> merely lists the <i>total</i> disk usage in each
  subdirectory; <b>agedu</b>'s additional ability to distinguish unused from
  recently-used data is not activated. To activate it, use the <b>-a</b> option
  to specify a minimum age.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The directory structure stored in <b>agedu</b>'s index file is treated as a set
  of literal strings. This means that you cannot refer to directories by
  synonyms. So if you ran <b>agedu -s .</b>, then all the path names you later
  pass to the <b>-t</b> option must be either `<b>.</b>' or begin with
  `<b>./</b>'. Similarly, symbolic links within the directory you scanned will
  not be followed; you must refer to each directory by its canonical,
  symlink-free pathname.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-R</b> or <b>--remove</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In this mode, <b>agedu</b> deletes its index file. Running
      just <b>agedu -R</b> on its own is therefore equivalent to typing <b>rm
      agedu.dat</b>. However, you can also put <b>-R</b> on the end of a command
      line to indicate that <b>agedu</b> should delete its index file after it
      finishes performing other operations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-D</b> or <b>--dump</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In this mode, <b>agedu</b> reads an existing index file and
      produces a dump of its contents on standard output. This dump can later be
      loaded into a new index file, perhaps on another computer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-L</b> or <b>--load</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In this mode, <b>agedu</b> expects to read a dump produced
      by the <b>-D</b> option from its standard input. It constructs an index
      file from that dump, exactly as it would have if it had read the same data
      from a disk scan in <b>-s</b> mode.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-S</b> <i>directory</i> or <b>--scan-dump</b>
    <i>directory</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In this mode, <b>agedu</b> will scan a directory tree and
      convert the results straight into a dump on standard output, without
      generating an index file at all. So running <b>agedu -S /path</b> should
      produce equivalent output to that of <b>agedu -s /path -D</b>, except that
      the latter will produce an index file as a side effect whereas <b>-S</b>
      will not.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
(The output will not be exactly <i>identical</i>, due to a difference in
  treatment of last-access times on directories. However, it should be
  effectively equivalent for most purposes. See the documentation of the
  <b>--dir-atime</b> option in the next section for further detail.)</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-H</b> <i>directory</i> or <b>--html</b>
    <i>directory</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In this mode, <b>agedu</b> will generate an HTML report of
      the disk usage in the specified directory and its immediate
      subdirectories, in the same form that it serves from its web server in
      <b>-w</b> mode.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, a single HTML report will be generated and simply written to
  standard output, with no hyperlinks pointing to other similar pages. If you
  also specify the <b>-d</b> option (see below), <b>agedu</b> will instead write
  out a collection of HTML files with hyperlinks between them, and call the
  top-level file <b>index.html</b>.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--cgi</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In this mode, <b>agedu</b> will run as the bulk of a CGI
      script which provides the same set of web pages as the built-in web server
      would. It will read the usual CGI environment variables, and write
      CGI-style data to its standard output.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
The actual CGI program itself should be a tiny wrapper around <b>agedu</b> which
  passes it the <b>--cgi</b> option, and also (probably) <b>-f</b> to locate the
  index file. <b>agedu</b> will do everything else.
<div class="Pp"></div>
No access control is performed in this mode: restricting access to CGI scripts
  is assumed to be the job of the web server.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-h</b> or <b>--help</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Causes <b>agedu</b> to print some help text and terminate
      immediately.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-V</b> or <b>--version</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Causes <b>agedu</b> to print its version number and
      terminate immediately.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
This section describes the various configuration options that affect
  <b>agedu</b>'s operation in one mode or another.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following option affects nearly all modes (except <b>-S</b>):
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-f</b> <i>filename</i> or <b>--file</b>
    <i>filename</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies the location of the index file which <b>agedu</b>
      creates, reads or removes depending on its operating mode. By default,
      this is simply ` <b>agedu.dat</b>', in whatever is the current working
      directory when you run <b>agedu</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following options affect the disk-scanning modes, <b>-s</b> and <b>-S</b>:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--cross-fs</b> and <b>--no-cross-fs</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These configure whether or not the disk scan is permitted
      to cross between different file systems. The default is not to:
      <b>agedu</b> will normally skip over subdirectories on which a different
      file system is mounted. This makes it convenient when you want to free up
      space on a particular file system which is running low. However, in other
      circumstances you might wish to see general information about the use of
      space no matter which file system it's on (for instance, if your real
      concern is your backup media running out of space, and if your backups do
      not treat different file systems specially); in that situation, use
      <b>--cross-fs</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
(Note that this default is the opposite way round from the corresponding option
  in <b>du</b>.)</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--prune</b> <i>wildcard</i> and <b>--prune-path</b>
    <i>wildcard</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These cause particular files or directories to be omitted
      entirely from the scan. If <b>agedu</b>'s scan encounters a file or
      directory whose name matches the wildcard provided to the <b>--prune</b>
      option, it will not include that file in its index, and also if it's a
      directory it will skip over it and not scan its contents.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that in most Unix shells, wildcards will probably need to be escaped on the
  command line, to prevent the shell from expanding the wildcard before
  <b>agedu</b> sees it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--prune-path</b> is similar to <b>--prune</b>, except that the wildcard is
  matched against the entire pathname instead of just the filename at the end of
  it. So whereas <b>--prune *a*b*</b> will match any file whose actual name
  contains an <b>a</b> somewhere before a <b>b</b>, <b>--prune-path *a*b*</b>
  will also match a file whose name contains <b>b</b> and which is inside a
  directory containing an <b>a</b>, or any file inside a directory of that form,
  and so on.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--exclude</b> <i>wildcard</i> and <b>--exclude-path</b>
    <i>wildcard</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These cause particular files or directories to be omitted
      from the index, but not from the scan. If <b>agedu</b>'s scan encounters a
      file or directory whose name matches the wildcard provided to the
      <b>--exclude</b> option, it will not include that file in its index - but
      unlike <b>--prune</b>, if the file in question is a directory it will
      still scan its contents and index them if they are not ruled out
      themselves by <b>--exclude</b> options.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
As above, <b>--exclude-path</b> is similar to <b>--exclude</b>, except that the
  wildcard is matched against the entire pathname.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--include</b> <i>wildcard</i> and <b>--include-path</b>
    <i>wildcard</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These cause particular files or directories to be
      re-included in the index and the scan, if they had previously been ruled
      out by one of the above exclude or prune options. You can interleave
      include, exclude and prune options as you wish on the command line, and if
      more than one of them applies to a file then the last one takes
    priority.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, if you wanted to see only the disk space taken up by MP3 files, you
  might run
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
$&#x00A0; <b>agedu&#x00A0;-s&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;--exclude&#x00A0;'*'&#x00A0;--include&#x00A0;'*.mp3'</b>
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
which will cause everything to be omitted from the scan, but then the MP3 files
  to be put back in. If you then wanted only a subset of those MP3s, you could
  then exclude some of them again by adding, say, ` <b>--exclude-path
  './queen/*'</b>' (or, more efficiently, ` <b>--prune ./queen</b>') on the end
  of that command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As with the previous two options, <b>--include-path</b> is similar to
  <b>--include</b> except that the wildcard is matched against the entire
  pathname.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--progress</b>, <b>--no-progress</b> and
    <b>--tty-progress</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When <b>agedu</b> is scanning a directory tree, it will
      typically print a one-line progress report every second showing where it
      has reached in the scan, so you can have some idea of how much longer it
      will take. (Of course, it can't predict <i>exactly</i> how long it will
      take, since it doesn't know which of the directories it hasn't scanned yet
      will turn out to be huge.)</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, those progress reports are displayed on <b>agedu</b>'s standard
  error channel, if that channel points to a terminal device. If you need to
  manually enable or disable them, you can use the above three options to do so:
  <b>--progress</b> unconditionally enables the progress reports,
  <b>--no-progress</b> unconditionally disables them, and <b>--tty-progress</b>
  reverts to the default behaviour which is conditional on standard error being
  a terminal.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--dir-atime</b> and <b>--no-dir-atime</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In normal operation, <b>agedu</b> ignores the atimes (last
      access times) on the <i>directories</i> it scans: it only pays attention
      to the atimes of the <i>files</i> inside those directories. This is
      because directory atimes tend to be reset by a lot of system
      administrative tasks, such as <b>cron</b> jobs which scan the file system
      for one reason or another - or even other invocations of <b>agedu</b>
      itself, though it tries to avoid modifying any atimes if possible. So the
      literal atimes on directories are typically not representative of how long
      ago the data in question was last accessed with real intent to use that
      data in particular.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
Instead, <b>agedu</b> makes up a fake atime for every directory it scans, which
  is equal to the newest atime of any file in or below that directory (or the
  directory's last <i>modification</i> time, whichever is newest). This is based
  on the assumption that all <i>important</i> accesses to directories are
  actually accesses to the files inside those directories, so that when any file
  is accessed all the directories on the path leading to it should be considered
  to have been accessed as well.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In unusual cases it is possible that a directory itself might embody important
  data which is accessed by reading the directory. In that situation,
  <b>agedu</b>'s atime-faking policy will misreport the directory as disused. In
  the unlikely event that such directories form a significant part of your disk
  space usage, you might want to turn off the faking. The <b>--dir-atime</b>
  option does this: it causes the disk scan to read the original atimes of the
  directories it scans.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The faking of atimes on directories also requires a processing pass over the
  index file after the main disk scan is complete. <b>--dir-atime</b> also turns
  this pass off. Hence, this option affects the <b>-L</b> option as well as
  <b>-s</b> and <b>-S</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
(The previous section mentioned that there might be subtle differences between
  the output of <b>agedu -s /path -D</b> and <b>agedu -S /path</b>. This is why.
  Doing a scan with <b>-s</b> and then dumping it with <b>-D</b> will dump the
  fully faked atimes on the directories, whereas doing a scan-to-dump with
  <b>-S</b> will dump only <i>partially</i> faked atimes - specifically, each
  directory's last modification time - since the subsequent processing pass will
  not have had a chance to take place. However, loading either of the resulting
  dump files with <b>-L</b> will perform the atime-faking processing pass,
  leading to the same data in the index file in each case. In normal usage it
  should be safe to ignore all of this complexity.)</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--mtime</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option causes <b>agedu</b> to index files by their
      last modification time instead of their last access time. You might want
      to use this if your last access times were completely useless for some
      reason: for example, if you had recently searched every file on your
      system, the system would have lost all the information about what files
      you hadn't recently accessed before then. Using this option is liable to
      be less effective at finding genuinely wasted space than the normal mode
      (that is, it will be more likely to flag things as disused when they're
      not, so you will have more candidates to go through by hand looking for
      data you don't need), but may be better than nothing if your last-access
      times are unhelpful.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another use for this mode might be to find <i>recently created</i> large data.
  If your disk has been gradually filling up for years, the default mode of
  <b>agedu</b> will let you find unused data to delete; but if you know your
  disk had plenty of space recently and now it's suddenly full, and you suspect
  that some rogue program has left a large core dump or output file, then
  <b>agedu --mtime</b> might be a convenient way to locate the culprit.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following option affects all the modes that generate reports: the web server
  mode <b>-w</b>, the stand-alone HTML generation mode <b>-H</b> and the text
  report mode <b>-t</b>.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--files</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option causes <b>agedu</b>'s reports to list the
      individual files in each directory, instead of just giving a combined

The following option affects the text report mode <b>-t</b>.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-a</b> <i>age</i> or <b>--age</b> <i>age</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option tells <b>agedu</b> to report only files of at
      least the specified age. An age is specified as a number, followed by one
      of ` <b>y</b>' (years), `<b>m</b>' (months), `<b>w</b>' (weeks) or
      `<b>d</b>' (days). (This syntax is also used by the <b>-r</b> option.) For
      example, <b>-a 6m</b> will produce a text report which includes only files
      at least six months old.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following options affect the stand-alone HTML generation mode <b>-H</b> and
  the text report mode <b>-t</b>.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d</b> <i>depth</i> or <b>--depth</b> <i>depth</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option controls the maximum depth to which
      <b>agedu</b> recurses when generating a text or HTML report.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
In text mode, the default is 1, meaning that the report will include the
  directory given on the command line and all of its immediate subdirectories. A
  depth of two includes another level below that, and so on; a depth of zero
  means <i>only</i> the directory on the command line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In HTML mode, specifying this option switches <b>agedu</b> from writing out a
  single HTML file to writing out multiple files which link to each other. A
  depth of 1 means <b>agedu</b> will write out an HTML file for the given
  directory and also one for each of its immediate subdirectories.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want <b>agedu</b> to recurse as deeply as possible, give the special word
  ` <b>max</b>' as an argument to <b>-d</b>.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-o</b> <i>filename</i> or <b>--output</b>
    <i>filename</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option is used to specify an output file for
      <b>agedu</b> to write its report to. In text mode or single-file HTML
      mode, the argument is treated as the name of a file. In multiple-file HTML
      mode, the argument is treated as the name of a directory: the directory
      will be created if it does not already exist, and the output HTML files
      will be created inside it.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following options affect the web server mode <b>-w</b>, and in some cases
  also the stand-alone HTML generation mode <b>-H</b>:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-r</b> <i>age range</i> or <b>--age-range</b> <i>age
    range</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The HTML reports produced by <b>agedu</b> use a range of
      colours to indicate how long ago data was last accessed, running from red
      (representing the most disused data) to green (representing the newest).
      By default, the lengths of time represented by the two ends of that
      spectrum are chosen by examining the data file to see what range of ages
      appears in it. However, you might want to set your own limits, and you can
      do this using <b>-r</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
The argument to <b>-r</b> consists of a single age, or two ages separated by a
  minus sign. An age is a number, followed by one of ` <b>y</b>' (years),
  `<b>m</b>' (months), ` <b>w</b>' (weeks) or `<b>d</b>' (days). (This syntax is
  also used by the <b>-a</b> option.) The first age in the range represents the
  oldest data, and will be coloured red in the HTML; the second age represents
  the newest, coloured green. If the second age is not specified, it will
  default to zero (so that green means data which has been accessed <i>just
  now</i>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, <b>-r 2y</b> will mark data in red if it has been unused for two
  years or more, and green if it has been accessed just now. <b>-r 2y-3m</b>
  will similarly mark data red if it has been unused for two years or more, but
  will mark it green if it has been accessed three months ago or later.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--address</b> <i>addr</i>[<b>:</b><i>port</i>]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies the network address and port number on which
      <b>agedu</b> should listen when running its web server. If you want
      <b>agedu</b> to listen for connections coming in from any source, specify

      omitted, an arbitrary unused port will be chosen for you and
    displayed.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">

If you specify this option, <b>agedu</b> will not print its URL on standard

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>magic</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option only works on Linux, and only when the incoming

      which user id created them. So <b>agedu</b> will look up each incoming
      connection in that file, and allow access if it comes from the same user
      id under which <b>agedu</b> itself is running. Therefore, in
      <b>agedu</b>'s normal web server mode, you can safely run it on a

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LIMITATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#LIMITATIONS">LIMITATIONS</a></h1>
The data file is pretty large. The core of <b>agedu</b> is the tree-based data
  structure it uses in its index in order to efficiently perform the queries it
  needs; this data structure requires <b>O(N log N)</b> storage. This is larger
  than you might expect; a scan of my own home directory, containing half a
  million files and directories and about 20Gb of data, produced an index file
  over 60Mb in size. Furthermore, since the data file must be memory-mapped
  during most processing, it can never grow larger than available address space,
  so a <i>really</i> big filesystem may need to be indexed on a 64-bit computer.
  (This is one reason for the existence of the <b>-D</b> and <b>-L</b> options:
  you can do the scanning on the machine with access to the filesystem, and the
  indexing on a machine big enough to handle it.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The data structure also does not usefully permit access control within the data
  file, so it would be difficult - even given the willingness to do additional
  coding - to run a system-wide <b>agedu</b> scan on a <b>cron</b> job and serve
  the right subset of reports to each user.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In certain circumstances, <b>agedu</b> can report false positives (reporting
  files as disused which are in fact in use) as well as the more benign false
  negatives (reporting files as in use which are not). This arises when a file
  is, semantically speaking, `read' without actually being physically
  <i>read</i>. Typically this occurs when a program checks whether the file's
  mtime has changed and only bothers re-reading it if it has; programs which do
  this include <b>rsync</b>(<i>1</i>) and <b>make</b>(<i>1</i>). Such programs
  will fail to update the atime of unmodified files despite depending on their
  continued existence; a directory full of such files will be reported as
  disused by <b>agedu</b> even in situations where deleting them will cause
  trouble.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, of course, <b>agedu</b>'s normal usage mode depends critically on the
  OS providing last-access times which are at least approximately right. So a
  file system mounted with Linux's ` <b>noatime</b>' option, or the equivalent
  on any other OS, will not give useful results! (However, the Linux mount
  option ` <b>relatime</b>', which distributions now tend to use by default,
  should be fine for all but specialist purposes: it reduces the accuracy of
  last-access times so that they might be wrong by up to 24 hours, but if you're
  looking for files that have been unused for months or years, that's not a
  problem.)
