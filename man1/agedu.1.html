<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
agedu - correlate disk usage with last-access times to
identify large and disused data</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
agedu [ options ] action [action...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
agedu scans a directory tree and produces reports about how
much disk space is used in each directory and subdirectory,
and also how that usage of disk space corresponds to files
<br>
with last-access times a long time ago.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In other words, agedu is a tool
you might use to help you free up disk space. It lets you
see which directories are taking up the most space, as du
does; but unlike du, it also <br>
distinguishes between large collections of data which are
still in use and ones which have not been accessed in months
or years - for instance, large archives downloaded, <br>
unpacked, used once, and never cleaned up. Where du helps
you find what&rsquo;s using your disk space, agedu helps you
find what&rsquo;s wasting your disk space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">agedu has several operating
modes. In one mode, it scans your disk and builds an index
file containing a data structure which allows it to
efficiently retrieve any information it <br>
might need. Typically, you would use it in this mode first,
and then run it in one of a number of &lsquo;query&rsquo;
modes to display a report of the disk space usage of a
particular direc&acirc; <br>
tory and its subdirectories. Those reports can be produced
as plain text (much like du) or as HTML. agedu can even run
as a miniature web server, presenting each directory&rsquo;s
HTML <br>
report with hyperlinks to let you navigate around the file
system to similar reports for other directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So you would typically start
using agedu by telling it to do a scan of a directory tree
and build an index. This is done with a command such as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ agedu -s /home/fred</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which will build a large data
file called agedu.dat in your current directory. (If that
current directory is inside /home/fred, don&rsquo;t worry -
agedu is smart enough to discount <br>
its own index file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Having built the index, you
would now query it for reports of disk space usage. If you
have a graphical web browser, the simplest and nicest way to
query the index is by running <br>
agedu in web server mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ agedu -w</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which will print (among other
messages) a URL on its standard output along the lines
of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">URL: http://127.0.0.1:48638/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(That URL will always begin with
&lsquo;127.&rsquo;, meaning that it&rsquo;s in the localhost
address space. So only processes running on the same
computer can even try to connect to that web <br>
server, and also there is access control to prevent other
users from seeing it - see below for more detail.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now paste that URL into your web
browser, and you will be shown a graphical representation of
the disk usage in /home/fred and its immediate
subdirectories, with varying colours <br>
used to show the difference between disused and
recently-accessed data. Click on any subdirectory to descend
into it and see a report for its subdirectories in turn;
click on <br>
parts of the pathname at the top of any page to return to
higher-level directories. When you&rsquo;ve finished
browsing, you can just press Ctrl-D to send an end-of-file
indication to <br>
agedu, and it will shut down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After that, you probably want to
delete the data file agedu.dat, since it&rsquo;s pretty
large. In fact, the command agedu -R will do this for you;
and you can chain agedu commands on <br>
the same command line, so that instead of the above you
could have done</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ agedu -s /home/fred -w -R</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for a single self-contained run
of agedu which builds its index, serves web pages from it,
and cleans it up when finished.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t have a
graphical web browser, you can do text-based queries as
well. Having scanned /home/fred as above, you might run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ agedu -t /home/fred</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which again gives a summary of
the disk usage in /home/fred and its immediate
subdirectories; but this time agedu will print it on
standard output, in much the same format as du. <br>
If you then want to find out how much old data is there, you
can add the -a option to show only files last accessed a
certain length of time ago. For example, to show only files
<br>
which haven&rsquo;t been looked at in six months or
more:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ agedu -t /home/fred -a 6m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That&rsquo;s the essence of what
agedu does. It has other modes of operation for more complex
situations, and the usual array of configurable options. The
following sections contain a <br>
complete reference for all its functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATING MODES <br>
This section describes the operating modes supported by
agedu. Each of these is in the form of a command-line
option, sometimes with an argument. Multiple operating-mode
options <br>
may appear on the command line, in which case agedu will
perform the specified actions one after another. For
instance, as shown in the previous section, you might want
to per&acirc; <br>
form a disk scan and immediately launch a web server giving
reports from that scan.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s directory or --scan directory
<br>
In this mode, agedu scans the file system starting at the
specified directory, and indexes the results of the scan
into a large data file which other operating modes can <br>
query.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the scan is
restricted to a single file system (since the expected use
of agedu is that you would probably use it because a
particular disk partition was run&acirc; <br>
ning low on space). You can remove that restriction using
the --cross-fs option; other configuration options allow you
to include or exclude files or entire subdirectories <br>
from the scan. See the next section for full details of the
configurable options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The index file is created with
restrictive permissions, in case the file system you are
scanning contains confidential information in its
structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Index files are dependent on the
characteristics of the CPU architecture you created them on.
You should not expect to be able to move an index file
between different <br>
types of computer and have it continue to work. If you need
to transfer the results of a disk scan to a different kind
of computer, see the -D and -L options below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w or --web <br>
In this mode, agedu expects to find an index file already
written. It allocates a network port, and starts up a web
server on that port which serves reports generated from <br>
the index file. By default it invents its own URL and prints
it out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The web server runs until agedu
receives an end-of-file event on its standard input. (The
expected usage is that you run it from the command line,
immediately browse web <br>
pages until you&rsquo;re satisfied, and then press Ctrl-D.)
To disable the EOF behaviour, use the --no-eof option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In case the index file contains
any confidential information about your file system, the web
server protects the pages it serves from access by other
people. On Linux, <br>
this is done transparently by means of using /proc/net/tcp
to check the owner of each incoming connection; failing
that, the web server will require a password to view the
<br>
reports, and agedu will print the password it invented on
standard output along with the URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configurable options for this
mode let you specify your own address and port number to
listen on, and also specify your own choice of
authentication method (including <br>
turning authentication off completely) and a username and
password of your choice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t directory or --text directory
<br>
In this mode, agedu generates a textual report on standard
output, listing the disk usage in the specified directory
and all its subdirectories down to a given depth. By <br>
default that depth is 1, so that you see a report for
directory itself and all of its immediate subdirectories.
You can configure a different depth (or no depth limit) <br>
using -d, described in the next section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Used on its own, -t merely lists
the total disk usage in each subdirectory; agedu&rsquo;s
additional ability to distinguish unused from recently-used
data is not activated. To <br>
activate it, use the -a option to specify a minimum age.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directory structure stored
in agedu&rsquo;s index file is treated as a set of literal
strings. This means that you cannot refer to directories by
synonyms. So if you ran <br>
agedu -s ., then all the path names you later pass to the -t
option must be either &lsquo;.&rsquo; or begin with
&lsquo;./&rsquo;. Similarly, symbolic links within the
directory you scanned will <br>
not be followed; you must refer to each directory by its
canonical, symlink-free pathname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R or --remove <br>
In this mode, agedu deletes its index file. Running just
agedu -R on its own is therefore equivalent to typing rm
agedu.dat. However, you can also put -R on the end of a <br>
command line to indicate that agedu should delete its index
file after it finishes performing other operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D or --dump <br>
In this mode, agedu reads an existing index file and
produces a dump of its contents on standard output. This
dump can later be loaded into a new index file, perhaps on
<br>
another computer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L or --load <br>
In this mode, agedu expects to read a dump produced by the
-D option from its standard input. It constructs an index
file from that dump, exactly as it would have if it <br>
had read the same data from a disk scan in -s mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S directory or --scan-dump
directory <br>
In this mode, agedu will scan a directory tree and convert
the results straight into a dump on standard output, without
generating an index file at all. So running agedu <br>
-S /path should produce equivalent output to that of agedu
-s /path -D, except that the latter will produce an index
file as a side effect whereas -S will not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(The output will not be exactly
identical, due to a difference in treatment of last-access
times on directories. However, it should be effectively
equivalent for most pur&acirc; <br>
poses. See the documentation of the --dir-atime option in
the next section for further detail.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H directory or --html directory
<br>
In this mode, agedu will generate an HTML report of the disk
usage in the specified directory and its immediate
subdirectories, in the same form that it serves from its
<br>
web server in -w mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, a single HTML report
will be generated and simply written to standard output,
with no hyperlinks pointing to other similar pages. If you
also specify the -d <br>
option (see below), agedu will instead write out a
collection of HTML files with hyperlinks between them, and
call the top-level file index.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cgi In this mode, agedu will
run as the bulk of a CGI script which provides the same set
of web pages as the built-in web server would. It will read
the usual CGI environment <br>
variables, and write CGI-style data to its standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actual CGI program itself
should be a tiny wrapper around agedu which passes it the
--cgi option, and also (probably) -f to locate the index
file. agedu will do every&acirc; <br>
thing else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No access control is performed
in this mode: restricting access to CGI scripts is assumed
to be the job of the web server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h or --help <br>
Causes agedu to print some help text and terminate
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V or --version <br>
Causes agedu to print its version number and terminate
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
This section describes the various configuration options
that affect agedu&rsquo;s operation in one mode or
another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following option affects
nearly all modes (except -S):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filename or --file filename
<br>
Specifies the location of the index file which agedu
creates, reads or removes depending on its operating mode.
By default, this is simply &lsquo;agedu.dat&rsquo;, in
whatever is the <br>
current working directory when you run agedu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options affect the
disk-scanning modes, -s and -S:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cross-fs and --no-cross-fs
<br>
These configure whether or not the disk scan is permitted to
cross between different file systems. The default is not to:
agedu will normally skip over subdirectories on <br>
which a different file system is mounted. This makes it
convenient when you want to free up space on a particular
file system which is running low. However, in other
cir&acirc; <br>
cumstances you might wish to see general information about
the use of space no matter which file system it&rsquo;s on
(for instance, if your real concern is your backup media
<br>
running out of space, and if your backups do not treat
different file systems specially); in that situation, use
--cross-fs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note that this default is the
opposite way round from the corresponding option in du.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--prune wildcard and
--prune-path wildcard <br>
These cause particular files or directories to be omitted
entirely from the scan. If agedu&rsquo;s scan encounters a
file or directory whose name matches the wildcard provided
<br>
to the --prune option, it will not include that file in its
index, and also if it&rsquo;s a directory it will skip over
it and not scan its contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that in most Unix shells,
wildcards will probably need to be escaped on the command
line, to prevent the shell from expanding the wildcard
before agedu sees it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--prune-path is similar to
--prune, except that the wildcard is matched against the
entire pathname instead of just the filename at the end of
it. So whereas --prune *a*b* <br>
will match any file whose actual name contains an a
somewhere before a b, --prune-path *a*b* will also match a
file whose name contains b and which is inside a directory
<br>
containing an a, or any file inside a directory of that
form, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude wildcard and
--exclude-path wildcard <br>
These cause particular files or directories to be omitted
from the index, but not from the scan. If agedu&rsquo;s scan
encounters a file or directory whose name matches the <br>
wildcard provided to the --exclude option, it will not
include that file in its index - but unlike --prune, if the
file in question is a directory it will still scan its <br>
contents and index them if they are not ruled out themselves
by --exclude options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As above, --exclude-path is
similar to --exclude, except that the wildcard is matched
against the entire pathname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include wildcard and
--include-path wildcard <br>
These cause particular files or directories to be
re-included in the index and the scan, if they had
previously been ruled out by one of the above exclude or
prune <br>
options. You can interleave include, exclude and prune
options as you wish on the command line, and if more than
one of them applies to a file then the last one takes
pri&acirc; <br>
ority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if you wanted to
see only the disk space taken up by MP3 files, you might
run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ agedu -s . --exclude
&rsquo;*&rsquo; --include &rsquo;*.mp3&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which will cause everything to
be omitted from the scan, but then the MP3 files to be put
back in. If you then wanted only a subset of those MP3s, you
could then exclude <br>
some of them again by adding, say, &lsquo;--exclude-path
&rsquo;./queen/*&rsquo;&rsquo; (or, more efficiently,
&lsquo;--prune ./queen&rsquo;) on the end of that
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As with the previous two
options, --include-path is similar to --include except that
the wildcard is matched against the entire pathname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--progress, --no-progress and
--tty-progress <br>
When agedu is scanning a directory tree, it will typically
print a one-line progress report every second showing where
it has reached in the scan, so you can have some <br>
idea of how much longer it will take. (Of course, it
can&rsquo;t predict exactly how long it will take, since it
doesn&rsquo;t know which of the directories it hasn&rsquo;t
scanned yet will <br>
turn out to be huge.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, those progress
reports are displayed on agedu&rsquo;s standard error
channel, if that channel points to a terminal device. If you
need to manually enable or disable <br>
them, you can use the above three options to do so:
--progress unconditionally enables the progress reports,
--no-progress unconditionally disables them, and --tty- <br>
progress reverts to the default behaviour which is
conditional on standard error being a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dir-atime and --no-dir-atime
<br>
In normal operation, agedu ignores the atimes (last access
times) on the directories it scans: it only pays attention
to the atimes of the files inside those directories. <br>
This is because directory atimes tend to be reset by a lot
of system administrative tasks, such as cron jobs which scan
the file system for one reason or another - or even <br>
other invocations of agedu itself, though it tries to avoid
modifying any atimes if possible. So the literal atimes on
directories are typically not representative of how <br>
long ago the data in question was last accessed with real
intent to use that data in particular.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead, agedu makes up a fake
atime for every directory it scans, which is equal to the
newest atime of any file in or below that directory (or the
directory&rsquo;s last modi&acirc; <br>
fication time, whichever is newest). This is based on the
assumption that all important accesses to directories are
actually accesses to the files inside those directo&acirc;
<br>
ries, so that when any file is accessed all the directories
on the path leading to it should be considered to have been
accessed as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In unusual cases it is possible
that a directory itself might embody important data which is
accessed by reading the directory. In that situation,
agedu&rsquo;s atime-faking <br>
policy will misreport the directory as disused. In the
unlikely event that such directories form a significant part
of your disk space usage, you might want to turn off <br>
the faking. The --dir-atime option does this: it causes the
disk scan to read the original atimes of the directories it
scans.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The faking of atimes on
directories also requires a processing pass over the index
file after the main disk scan is complete. --dir-atime also
turns this pass off. Hence, <br>
this option affects the -L option as well as -s and -S.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(The previous section mentioned
that there might be subtle differences between the output of
agedu -s /path -D and agedu -S /path. This is why. Doing a
scan with -s and <br>
then dumping it with -D will dump the fully faked atimes on
the directories, whereas doing a scan-to-dump with -S will
dump only partially faked atimes - specifically, <br>
each directory&rsquo;s last modification time - since the
subsequent processing pass will not have had a chance to
take place. However, loading either of the resulting dump
<br>
files with -L will perform the atime-faking processing pass,
leading to the same data in the index file in each case. In
normal usage it should be safe to ignore all of <br>
this complexity.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mtime <br>
This option causes agedu to index files by their last
modification time instead of their last access time. You
might want to use this if your last access times were
com&acirc; <br>
pletely useless for some reason: for example, if you had
recently searched every file on your system, the system
would have lost all the information about what files you
<br>
hadn&rsquo;t recently accessed before then. Using this
option is liable to be less effective at finding genuinely
wasted space than the normal mode (that is, it will be more
<br>
likely to flag things as disused when they&rsquo;re not, so
you will have more candidates to go through by hand looking
for data you don&rsquo;t need), but may be better than
nothing <br>
if your last-access times are unhelpful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another use for this mode might
be to find recently created large data. If your disk has
been gradually filling up for years, the default mode of
agedu will let you find <br>
unused data to delete; but if you know your disk had plenty
of space recently and now it&rsquo;s suddenly full, and you
suspect that some rogue program has left a large core <br>
dump or output file, then agedu --mtime might be a
convenient way to locate the culprit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following option affects all
the modes that generate reports: the web server mode -w, the
stand-alone HTML generation mode -H and the text report mode
-t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--files <br>
This option causes agedu&rsquo;s reports to list the
individual files in each directory, instead of just giving a
combined report for everything that&rsquo;s not in a
subdirectory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following option affects the
text report mode -t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a age or --age age <br>
This option tells agedu to report only files of at least the
specified age. An age is specified as a number, followed by
one of &lsquo;y&rsquo; (years), &lsquo;m&rsquo; (months),
&lsquo;w&rsquo; (weeks) or <br>
&lsquo;d&rsquo; (days). (This syntax is also used by the -r
option.) For example, -a 6m will produce a text report which
includes only files at least six months old.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options affect the
stand-alone HTML generation mode -H and the text report mode
-t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d depth or --depth depth <br>
This option controls the maximum depth to which agedu
recurses when generating a text or HTML report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In text mode, the default is 1,
meaning that the report will include the directory given on
the command line and all of its immediate subdirectories. A
depth of two <br>
includes another level below that, and so on; a depth of
zero means only the directory on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In HTML mode, specifying this
option switches agedu from writing out a single HTML file to
writing out multiple files which link to each other. A depth
of 1 means agedu <br>
will write out an HTML file for the given directory and also
one for each of its immediate subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want agedu to recurse as
deeply as possible, give the special word &lsquo;max&rsquo;
as an argument to -d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o filename or --output filename
<br>
This option is used to specify an output file for agedu to
write its report to. In text mode or single-file HTML mode,
the argument is treated as the name of a file. In <br>
multiple-file HTML mode, the argument is treated as the name
of a directory: the directory will be created if it does not
already exist, and the output HTML files will be <br>
created inside it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options affect the
web server mode -w, and in some cases also the stand-alone
HTML generation mode -H:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r age range or --age-range age
range <br>
The HTML reports produced by agedu use a range of colours to
indicate how long ago data was last accessed, running from
red (representing the most disused data) to green <br>
(representing the newest). By default, the lengths of time
represented by the two ends of that spectrum are chosen by
examining the data file to see what range of ages <br>
appears in it. However, you might want to set your own
limits, and you can do this using -r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument to -r consists of a
single age, or two ages separated by a minus sign. An age is
a number, followed by one of &lsquo;y&rsquo; (years),
&lsquo;m&rsquo; (months), &lsquo;w&rsquo; (weeks) or
&lsquo;d&rsquo; <br>
(days). (This syntax is also used by the -a option.) The
first age in the range represents the oldest data, and will
be coloured red in the HTML; the second age represents <br>
the newest, coloured green. If the second age is not
specified, it will default to zero (so that green means data
which has been accessed just now).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, -r 2y will mark
data in red if it has been unused for two years or more, and
green if it has been accessed just now. -r 2y-3m will
similarly mark data red if <br>
it has been unused for two years or more, but will mark it
green if it has been accessed three months ago or later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--address addr[:port] <br>
Specifies the network address and port number on which agedu
should listen when running its web server. If you want agedu
to listen for connections coming in from any <br>
source, specify the address as the special value ANY. If the
port number is omitted, an arbitrary unused port will be
chosen for you and displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify this option,
agedu will not print its URL on standard output (since you
are expected to know what address you told it to listen
to).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--auth auth-type <br>
Specifies how agedu should control access to the web pages
it serves. The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">magic This option only works on
Linux, and only when the incoming connection is from the
same machine that agedu is running on. On Linux, the special
file /proc/net/tcp <br>
contains a list of network connections currently known to
the operating system kernel, including which user id created
them. So agedu will look up each incoming <br>
connection in that file, and allow access if it comes from
the same user id under which agedu itself is running.
Therefore, in agedu&rsquo;s normal web server mode, you <br>
can safely run it on a multi-user machine and no other user
will be able to read data out of your index file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">basic In this mode, agedu will
use HTTP Basic authentication: the user will have to provide
a username and password via their browser. agedu will
normally make up a user&acirc; <br>
name and password for the purpose, but you can specify your
own; see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none In this mode, the web
server is unauthenticated: anyone connecting to it has full
access to the reports generated by agedu. Do not do this
unless there is nothing <br>
confidential at all in your index file, or unless you are
certain that nobody but you can run processes on your
computer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default <br>
This is the default mode if you do not specify one of the
above. In this mode, agedu will attempt to use Linux magic
authentication, but if it detects at startup <br>
time that /proc/net/tcp is absent or non-functional then it
will fall back to using HTTP Basic authentication and invent
a user name and password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--auth-file filename or
--auth-fd fd <br>
When agedu is using HTTP Basic authentication, these options
allow you to specify your own user name and password. If you
specify --auth-file, these will be read from the <br>
specified file; if you specify --auth-fd they will instead
be read from a given file descriptor which you should have
arranged to pass to agedu. In either case, the <br>
authentication details should consist of the username,
followed by a colon, followed by the password, followed
immediately by end of file (no trailing newline, or else it
<br>
will be considered part of the password).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--title title <br>
Specify the string that appears at the start of the
&lt;title&gt; section of the output HTML pages. The default
is &lsquo;agedu&rsquo;. This title is followed by a colon
and then the path <br>
you&rsquo;re viewing within the index file. You might use
this option if you were serving agedu reports for several
different servers and wanted to make it clearer which one a
<br>
user was looking at.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-eof <br>
Stop agedu in web server mode from looking for end-of-file
on standard input and treating it as a signal to
terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
The data file is pretty large. The core of agedu is the
tree-based data structure it uses in its index in order to
efficiently perform the queries it needs; this data
structure <br>
requires O(N log N) storage. This is larger than you might
expect; a scan of my own home directory, containing half a
million files and directories and about 20Gb of data,
pro&acirc; <br>
duced an index file over 60Mb in size. Furthermore, since
the data file must be memory-mapped during most processing,
it can never grow larger than available address space, so a
<br>
really big filesystem may need to be indexed on a 64-bit
computer. (This is one reason for the existence of the -D
and -L options: you can do the scanning on the machine with
<br>
access to the filesystem, and the indexing on a machine big
enough to handle it.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The data structure also does not
usefully permit access control within the data file, so it
would be difficult - even given the willingness to do
additional coding - to run a <br>
system-wide agedu scan on a cron job and serve the right
subset of reports to each user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In certain circumstances, agedu
can report false positives (reporting files as disused which
are in fact in use) as well as the more benign false
negatives (reporting files as in <br>
use which are not). This arises when a file is, semantically
speaking, &lsquo;read&rsquo; without actually being
physically read. Typically this occurs when a program checks
whether the <br>
file&rsquo;s mtime has changed and only bothers re-reading
it if it has; programs which do this include rsync(1) and
make(1). Such programs will fail to update the atime of
unmodified <br>
files despite depending on their continued existence; a
directory full of such files will be reported as disused by
agedu even in situations where deleting them will cause
trou&acirc; <br>
ble.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, of course,
agedu&rsquo;s normal usage mode depends critically on the OS
providing last-access times which are at least approximately
right. So a file system mounted with <br>
Linux&rsquo;s &lsquo;noatime&rsquo; option, or the
equivalent on any other OS, will not give useful results!
(However, the Linux mount option &lsquo;relatime&rsquo;,
which distributions now tend to use by <br>
default, should be fine for all but specialist purposes: it
reduces the accuracy of last-access times so that they might
be wrong by up to 24 hours, but if you&rsquo;re looking for
<br>
files that have been unused for months or years,
that&rsquo;s not a problem.)</p>
