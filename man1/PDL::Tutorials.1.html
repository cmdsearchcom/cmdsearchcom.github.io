<p>TUTORIALS(1) User Contributed Perl Documentation
TUTORIALS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
PDL::Tutorials - A guide to PDL&rsquo;s tutorial
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIGRATION <br>
These are our migration guides for users familiar with other
types of numerical analysis software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL::MATLAB <br>
Migration guide for MATLAB users. This page explains the key
differences between MATLAB and PDL from the point of view of
a MATLAB user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL::Scilab <br>
Migration guide for Scilab users. This page explains the key
differences between Scilab and PDL from the point of view of
a Scilab user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FOUNDATION <br>
PDL::Philosophy <br>
Why did we write PDL? This document explains some of the
history and motivation behind the Perl Data Language. It is
an attempt to answer the question &quot;Why PDL?&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL::QuickStart <br>
Quick introduction to PDL features. A hands-on guide
suitable for complete beginners. This page assumes no
previous knowledge of Perl or PDL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL::Indexing <br>
After you have read the QuickStart guide, you should follow
up with this document. This guide goes more deeply into the
concepts of &quot;indexing&quot; and &quot;slicing&quot; and
how they <br>
form the core of numerical analysis with PDL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERMEDIATE <br>
PDL::Threading <br>
Threading is one of PDL&rsquo;s most powerful features. If
you know MATLAB, you&rsquo;ve heard of
&quot;vectorizing&quot;. Well, threading is like
&quot;vectorizing on steroids&quot;. It lets you make very
<br>
fast and compact code by avoiding nested loops. All
vector-based languages do this, but PDL generalizes the
technique to all sorts of applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tutorial introduces
PDL&rsquo;s threading feature, and it shows an example
implementing Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life in 10 lines and 80
times faster than a classical implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL::BadValues <br>
Sometimes it is useful to specify that a certain value is
&quot;bad&quot; or &quot;missing&quot;. Scientific
instruments some times include portions of invalid data. For
example, a CCD camera <br>
might produce an image with over-exposed pixels. PDL&rsquo;s
&quot;bad values&quot; feature gives you an easy way to deal
with this sort of imperfect data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL::Tips <br>
Tips and suggestions for using PDL. This page is an assorted
collection of programming tidbits that some PDL users have
found useful. Some of these tips might be of help <br>
when you write your programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADVANCED <br>
PDL::PP <br>
PDL&rsquo;s Pre-Processor is one of PDL&rsquo;s most
powerful features. You write a function definition in
special markup and the preprocessor generates real C code
which can be <br>
compiled. With PDL:PP you get the full speed of native C
code without having to deal with the full complexity of the
C language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL::API <br>
A simple cookbook explaining how to create piddle manually,
either from Perl or from C/XS code. This page covers the PDL
core routines that comprise the PDL API. If you need <br>
to access piddles from C/XS, this is the document for
you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL::Internals <br>
Description of the inner workings of the PDL module. Very
few people need to see this. This page is mainly for PDL
developers, or people interested in debugging PDL or <br>
changing the internals of PDL. If you can read this document
and understand all of it, and you additionally understand
PDL::PP, you will be awarded the title of &quot;PDL
Guru&quot;.</p>
