<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
phoronix-test-suite - The Phoronix Test Suite is an
extensible open-source platform for performing testing and
performance evaluation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
phoronix-test-suite [options] <br>
phoronix-test-suite benchmark [test | suite]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The **Phoronix Test Suite** is the most comprehensive
testing and benchmarking platform available for Linux,
Solaris, OS X, and BSD operating systems. The Phoronix Test
Suite <br>
allows for carrying out tests in a fully automated manner
from test installation to execution and reporting. All tests
are meant to be easily reproducible, easy-to-use, and
sup&acirc; <br>
port fully automated execution. The Phoronix Test Suite is
open-source under the GNU GPLv3 license and is developed by
Phoronix Media in cooperation with partners.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
TEST INSTALLATION <br>
install [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result]
... This option will install the selected test(s) inside the
testing environment directory. The install process <br>
from downloading of the test files to the installation is
fully automated. The install option needs to be supplied
with the test name or suite as an argument. Optionally, <br>
a OpenBenchmarking.org ID or the name of a saved results
file can be supplied as well and the test(s) to install will
automatically be extracted from that information. If <br>
the test is already installed and was run by the latest
version of the installation process, no action will be
taken. Multiple arguments can be supplied to install
addi&acirc; <br>
tional tests at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">install-dependencies [Test |
Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result] ... <br>
This option will install the external dependencies needed by
the selected test(s) using the distribution&rsquo;s package
management system. For example, some tests depend upon <br>
GCC for compiling code. If GCC is not detected on the
system, the Phoronix Test Suite will attempt to install GCC
using the distribution&rsquo;s package management system. If
<br>
you are running this command as a local user, you may be
prompted for the root password while the process is running.
For unsupported distributions, the dependency names <br>
will be displayed along with common names for the package.
The install-dependencies option needs to be supplied with
the test name or suite as an argument. When using the <br>
install option, the external dependencies are automatically
checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">make-download-cache <br>
This option will create a download cache for use by the
Phoronix Test Suite. The download cache is created of test
files already downloaded to the local system. If passing
<br>
any test/suite names to make-download-cache, the needed
files for those test profiles will first be automatically
downloaded before creating the cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove-installed-test [Test]
<br>
This option will permanently remove a installed test by the
Phoronix Test Suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TESTING <br>
auto-compare This option will autonomously determine the
most relevant test(s) to run for any selected sub-system(s).
The tests to run are determined via OpenBenchmark&acirc;
<br>
ing.org integration with the global results pool. Related
test results from OpenBenchmarking.org are also merged to
provide a straight-forward and effective means of car&acirc;
<br>
rying out a system comparison. If wishing to find comparable
results for any particular test profile(s), simply pass the
test profile names as additional arguments to this <br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">benchmark [Test | Suite |
OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result] ... <br>
This option will install the selected test(s) (if needed)
and will proceed to run the test(s). This option is
equivalent to running phoronix-test-suite with the install
<br>
option followed by the run option. Multiple arguments can be
supplied to run additional tests at the same time and save
the results into one file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">finish-run [Test Result] <br>
This option can be used if a test run had not properly
finished running all tests within a saved results file.
Using this option when specifying a saved results file where
<br>
all tests had not completed will attempt to finish testing
on the remaining tests where there are missing results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">run [Test | Suite |
OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result] ... <br>
This option will run the selected test(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">run-random-tests <br>
This option will query OpenBenchmarking.org to run random
benchmarks and result comparisons on the system. This test
can be used for simply supplying interesting results <br>
from your system onto OpenBenchmarking.org, stressing your
system with random workloads, seeding new
OpenBenchmarking.org results, etc. Basic options are
provided at <br>
start-up for tuning the randomness of the testing when
running this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">run-tests-in-suite <br>
This option can be used if you wish to run all of the tests
found in a supplied suite, but you wish to re-configure each
of the test options rather than using the defaults <br>
supplied by the suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stress-run [Test | Suite |
OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result] ... <br>
This option will run the passed tests/suites in the
multi-process stress-testing mode. The stress-run mode will
not produce a result file but is rather intended for
run&acirc; <br>
ning multiple test profiles concurrently to stress / burn-in
the system. The number of tests to run concurrently can be
toggled via the PTS_CONCURRENT_TEST_RUNS environ&acirc; <br>
ment variable and by default is set to a value of 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BATCH TESTING <br>
batch-benchmark [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking ID | Test
Result] ... This option and its arguments are equivalent to
the benchmark option, but the process will be run <br>
in the Phoronix Test Suite batch mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">batch-install [Test | Suite |
OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result] ... <br>
If you wish to run the install process in the Phoronix Test
Suite batch mode but do not wish to run any tests at this
time. Running the install process in the batch mode <br>
will use the default values and not prompt the user of any
possible options, to ensure the process is fully
automated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">batch-run [Test | Suite |
OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result] ... <br>
This option and its arguments are equivalent to the run
option, but the process will be run in the Phoronix Test
Suite batch mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">batch-setup <br>
This option is used to configure the batch mode options for
the Phoronix Test Suite, which is subsequently written to
the user configuration file. Among the options are <br>
whether to automatically upload the test results to
OpenBenchmarking.org and prompting for the saved file
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default-benchmark [Test | Suite
| OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result] ... <br>
This option will install the selected test(s) (if needed)
and will proceed to run the test(s) in the defaults mode.
This option is equivalent to running phoronix-test- <br>
suite with the install option followed by the default-run
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default-run [Test | Suite |
OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result] ... <br>
This option will run the selected test(s). The name of the
test or suite must be supplied or the OpenBenchmarking.org
ID or saved local file name. Multiple arguments can <br>
be supplied to run additional tests at the same time and
save the results in a suite-like fashion. Unlike the normal
run option, the default-run will not prompt the user <br>
to select from the available test options but will instead
use the default options as automatically set by pts-core or
the test profile. Use batch-run to automatically <br>
test all of the available options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">internal-run [Test | Suite |
OpenBenchmarking ID | Test Result] ... <br>
This option and its arguments pre-set the Phoronix Test
Suite batch run mode with sane values for carrying out
benchmarks in a semi-automated manner and without uploading
<br>
any of the result data to the public
OpenBenchmarking.org.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPENBENCHMARKING.ORG <br>
clone-result [OpenBenchmarking ID] ... This option will
download a local copy of a file that was saved to
OpenBenchmarking.org, as long as a valid public ID is
supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-recommended-tests <br>
This option will list recommended test profiles for
benchmarking sorted by hardware sub-system. The recommended
tests are determined via querying OpenBenchmarking.org and
<br>
determining the most popular tests for a given environment
based upon the number of times a test profile has been
downloaded, the number of test results available on
Open&acirc; <br>
Benchmarking.org for a given test profile, the age of the
test profile, and other weighted factors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">make-openbenchmarking-cache <br>
This option will attempt to cache the test profile/suite
meta-data from OpenBenchmarking.org for all linked
repositories. This is useful if you&rsquo;re going to be
running the <br>
Phoronix Test Suite / Phoromatic behind a firewall or
without any Internet connection. Those with unrestricted
Internet access or not utilizing a large local deployment of
<br>
the Phoronix Test Suite / Phoromatic shouldn&rsquo;t need to
run this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">openbenchmarking-changes <br>
This option will list recent changes to test profiles of
enabled OpenBenchmarking.org repositories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">openbenchmarking-launcher <br>

client options for OpenBechmarking.org and syncing the
client to your account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">openbenchmarking-refresh <br>
This option is used for refreshing the stored
OpenBenchmarking.org repostory information and other data.
The Phoronix Test Suite will automatically refresh this data
every <br>
three days or when other thresholds are exceeded, but this
command can be used to manually refresh/updates the
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">openbenchmarking-repositories
<br>
This option will list the OpenBenchmarking.org repositories
currently linked to this Phoronix Test Suite client
instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upload-result [Test Result] <br>

OpenBenchmarking.org.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upload-test-profile <br>
This option can be used for uploading a test profile to your
account on OpenBenchmarking.org. By uploading your test
profile to OpenBenchmarking.org, others are then able <br>
to browse and access this test suite for easy distribution
in a seamless manner by other Phoronix Test Suite
clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upload-test-suite <br>
This option can be used for uploading a test suite to your

identifiers in the saved file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESULT ANALYTICS <br>
analyze-all-runs [Test Result] This option will generate a
candlestick graph showing the distribution of results from
all trial runs. The candlestick graph is similar to <br>
the Japanese candlestick charts used by the financial
industry, except instead of representing stock data it is
numerical result data from all trial runs.0he tip of the
<br>
upper-wick represents the highest value of the test runs
with the tip of the lower-wick representing the lowest value
of all test runs. The upper-edge of the candle body <br>
represents the first or last run value and the lower-edge
represents the first or last run value. Lastly, if the last
run value is less than the first run value, the can&acirc;
<br>
dle body is the same color as the graph background,
otherwise the last run value is greater.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER build-suite This option
will guide the user through the process of generating their
own test suite, which they can then run. Optionally, passed
as arguments can be the <br>
test(s) or suite(s) to add to the suite to be created,
instead of being prompted through the process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug-dependency-handler <br>

commands, and other common code-paths. The produced
num&acirc; <br>
bers should only be comparable for the same version of the
Phoronix Test Suite, on the same hardware/software system,
conducted on the same day of testing. This isn&rsquo;t <br>
intended as any scientific benchmark but simply to stress
common PHP code-paths and looking for hot areas to optimize,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enterprise-setup <br>
This option can be run by enterprise users immediately after
package installation or as part of an in-house setup script.
Running this command will ensure the phoronix- <br>
test-suite program is never interrupted on new runs to
accept user agreement changes and defaults the anonymous
usage reporting to being disabled and other conservative
<br>
defaults.</p>
