A2p cannot do as good a job translating as a human would, but it usually does
  pretty well. There are some areas where you may want to examine the perl
  script produced and tweak it some. Here are some of them, in no particular
  order.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is an awk idiom of putting <i>int()</i> around a string expression to
  force numeric interpretation, even though the argument is always integer
  anyway. This is generally unneeded in perl, but a2p can't tell if the argument
  is always going to be integer, so it leaves it in. You may wish to remove it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl differentiates numeric comparison from string comparison. Awk has one
  operator for both that decides at run time which comparison to do. A2p does
  not try to do a complete job of awk emulation at this point. Instead it
  guesses which one you want. It's almost always right, but it can be spoofed.
  All such guesses are marked with the comment &quot;&quot;#???&quot;&quot;. You
  should go through and check them. You might want to run at least once with the
  <b>-w</b> switch to perl, which will warn you if you use == where you should
  have used eq.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl does not attempt to emulate the behavior of awk in which nonexistent array
  elements spring into existence simply by being referenced. If somehow you are
  relying on this mechanism to create null entries for a subsequent for...in,
  they won't be there in perl.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a2p makes a split line that assigns to a list of variables that looks like
  (Fld1, Fld2, Fld3...) you may want to rerun a2p using the <b>-n</b> option
  mentioned above. This will let you name the fields throughout the script. If
  it splits to an array instead, the script is probably referring to the number
  of fields somewhere.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The exit statement in awk doesn't necessarily exit; it goes to the END block if
  there is one. Awk scripts that do contortions within the END block to bypass
  the block under such circumstances can be simplified by removing the
  conditional in the END block and just exiting directly from the perl script.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl has two kinds of array, numerically-indexed and associative. Perl
  associative arrays are called &quot;hashes&quot;. Awk arrays are usually
  translated to hashes, but if you happen to know that the index is always going
  to be numeric you could change the {...} to [...]. Iteration over a hash is
  done using the <i>keys()</i> function, but iteration over an array is NOT. You
  might need to modify any loop that iterates over such an array.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Awk starts by assuming OFMT has the value %.6g. Perl starts by assuming its
  equivalent, $#, to have the value %.20g. You'll want to set $# explicitly if
  you use the default value of OFMT.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Near the top of the line loop will be the split operation that is implicit in
  the awk script. There are times when you can move this down past some
  conditionals that test the entire record so that the split is not done as
  often.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For aesthetic reasons you may wish to change index variables from being 1-based
  (awk style) to 0-based (Perl style). Be sure to change all operations the
  variable is involved in to match.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Cute comments that say &quot;# Here is a workaround because awk is dumb&quot;
  are passed through unmodified.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Awk scripts are often embedded in a shell script that pipes stuff into and out
  of awk. Often the shell script wrapper can be incorporated into the perl
  script, since perl can start up pipes into and out of itself, and can do other
  things that awk can't do by itself.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Scripts that refer to the special variables RSTART and RLENGTH can often be
  simplified by referring to the variables $`, $&amp; and $', as long as they
  are within the scope of the pattern match that sets them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The produced perl script may have subroutines defined to deal with awk's
  semantics regarding getline and print. Since a2p usually picks correctness
  over efficiency. it is almost always possible to rewrite such code to be more
  efficient by discarding the semantic sugar.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For efficiency, you may wish to remove the keyword from any return statement
  that is the last statement executed in a subroutine. A2p catches the most
  common case, but doesn't analyze embedded blocks for subtler cases.
<div class="Pp"></div>
ARGV[0] translates to $ARGV0, but ARGV[n] translates to $ARGV[$n-1]. A loop that
  tries to iterate over ARGV[0] won't find it.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
A2p uses no environment variables.

It would be possible to emulate awk's behavior in selecting string versus
  numeric operations at run time by inspection of the operands, but it would be
  gross and inefficient. Besides, a2p almost always guesses right.

Storage for the awk syntax tree is currently static, and can run out.</div>
