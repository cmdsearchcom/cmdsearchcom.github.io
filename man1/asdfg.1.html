<b>asdfg</b> is an interactive display text editor optimized for users of the
  QWERTY keyboard layout.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When run with no file name arguments, <b>asdfg</b> displays a short command
  introduction and summary.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>asdfg</b> can browse very large read-only files with quick start-up time,
  since the original texts are memory-mapped from files and not duplicated in
  memory unless they are about to be modified.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INTENTIONALLY_MISSING_FEATURES"><a class="selflink" href="#INTENTIONALLY_MISSING_FEATURES">INTENTIONALLY
  MISSING FEATURES</a></h1>
<b>asdfg</b> has no embedded extension language, since it is trivial to pass
  regions of text from the editor to any program or script that can read
  standard input and write standard output. The shell, <b>sed</b><i>(1),</i>
  <b>awk</b><i>(1),</i> <b>python</b><i>(1),</i> and <b>perl</b><i>(1)</i> are
  all usable for such scripting. Further, since <b>asdfg</b> ships will full
  sources and the rights to modify it, users can customize it directly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The editor has only basic syntax highlighting of C and C++ keywords with subtle
  color cues that help match up parentheses, brackets, and braces.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>asdfg</b> has no mail or news reader, IRC client, or artificial intelligence
  psychologist mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is no X window system interface; that's what <b>xterm</b><i>(1)</i> and
  <b>gnome-terminal</b><i>(1)</i> are used for.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BASICS"><a class="selflink" href="#BASICS">BASICS</a></h1>
A <i>text</i> is a sequence of characters to be viewed or edited, such as a
  file. If it is not ASCII, the editor will automatically determine whether it
  is encoded in legal UTF-8 and do the right thing. The editor can also
  automatically detect DOS-style line endings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A <i>view</i> comprises all or part of a text. A text in the editor has at least
  one view, and possibly more.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A <i>window</i> is a rectangular portion of the display, and is always
  associated with a single view, a contiguous portion of whose text is rendered
  in the window. Not every view has a window.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each view has a <i>cursor</i> and possibly a <i>selection</i>, which has the
  cursor at one end and the <i>mark</i> at the other. The view's window, if any,
  always renders part of the text containing the view's cursor.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The selection plays a critical role in <b>asdfg</b>. Besides highlighting
  regions to be cut or copied, it also serves to supply arguments to some
  commands, such as the path name of a file to open.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>clip buffer</i> is not visible in any window. It receives snippets of
  data that have been cut or copied out of texts, so that they may be moved or
  copied elsewhere. It also supplies the standard input to a background command
  launched with <b>^R</b> (below). There is one clip buffer shared by all views.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COLOR_CUES"><a class="selflink" href="#COLOR_CUES">COLOR
  CUES</a></h1>
asdfg uses colors to convey information without cluttering the display with
  status lines or borders between windows.
<div class="Pp"></div>
asdfg uses distinct background colors to distinguish tiled windows. The active
  window is always presented in the terminal's default color scheme. Color is
  also used to highlight the current selection (in cyan) and folded regions (in
  red).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Needless tabs and spaces are marked in violet. These include any tabs or spaces
  before the end of a line, as well as any spaces followed by a tab or multiple
  spaces that could be replaced by a tab.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Bracketing characters are presented in alternating colors so that matching
  parentheses, brackets, and braces are colored identically.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A red cursor signifies a read-only text, whereas a green cursor indicates a
  dirty text (meaning one that needs saving, not one unfit for young persons).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMMANDS"><a class="selflink" href="#COMMANDS">COMMANDS</a></h1>
<b>asdfg</b> understands the arrow, page up and down, and Delete keys on your
  keyboard, so you can actually just use it like a dumb notepad with no mouse if
  you don't want to read any further than the next section, which tells you how
  to leave the editor.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the following sections of the manual, commands are denoted by <b>^key</b> to
  signify the use of Control, Alt, or a preceding Escape key. They all mean the
  same thing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Variant</b> commands always begin with <b>^Space</b>, or its synonym,
  <b>^@</b>. A few commands take a numeric argument, which is specified by
  <b>^Space</b> followed by a decimal or hexadecimal number, the latter using C
  language syntax (0xdeadbeef).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many commands are sensitive to the presence or absence of a <b>selection</b>.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>^Space'</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(note that the single quote <b>'</b> is not a control

      which are sought in the same directory as the current view and then all of
      its parents, until one is found that contains the identifier. A new little
      window is opened for each of the identifier's entries in the TAGS
    file.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>TAGS</b> files should be generated with the <b>ctags</b> or
  <b>exuberant-ctags</b> utilities and their <b>-x</b> output format. If there
  is a selection, it is deleted from the view and its entire contents will
  constitute the identifier to be looked up; otherwise, the identifier that is
  immediately before or around the cursor is sought.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SELECTION"><a class="selflink" href="#SELECTION">SELECTION</a></h1>
These commands are sensitive to the presence or absence of a current selection.
<dl class="Bl-tag">

      with its mark.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that <b>^Space^U</b> with a numeric argument unconditionally unsets the
  mark, which can be handy in a macro.
<dl class="Bl-tag">

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MODIFICATION"><a class="selflink" href="#MODIFICATION">MODIFICATION</a></h1>
In the default mode, characters typed without a command indicator are inserted
  at the current cursor position. Further, if the cursor is at the beginning of
  a selection, the selection is first cut to the clip buffer, so that the new
  text replaces it.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>^^</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(that's Control-Shift-6, the caret character, on most
      keyboards, and ^6 will probably also work) inserts an otherwise untypeable
      control character into the text. The very next key to be pressed is either
      taken literally, if it is a control character, or converted to a control
      character if it is not, and inserted. (For example, you can press
      <b>^^</b> and then hit either Control-A or just a plain A, to get the
      character code 0x01 inserted.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>^Space^^</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">with a numeric argument, probably in hexadecimal, inserts
      the specified Unicode character into the text in UTF-8 format. If the text
      is not UTF-8, the character code is inserted directly as a big-endian
      literal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Tab</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(or <b>^I</b>) attempts to perform tab completion; if that
      fails, a TAB character is inserted. If there is a selection with the
      cursor at its end, the editor tries to find an unambiguous continuation
      based on path names and words in all the views. A continuation, if found,
      is appended to the selection, to facilitate opening a file with <b>^E</b>.
      With no selection, but the cursor immediately after one or more identifier
      characters, the editor searches for an unambiguous continuation using the
      words in the views. A continuation, if found, is inserted as the new
      selection with the cursor at its end. No tab completion occurs when the
      cursor is at the beginning of a selection; in that case, the selection is
      cut and replaced with a single TAB character.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>^SpaceTab</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(or <b>^Space^I</b>) will align the current line to the
      indentation of the previous one. With a numeric argument of 1, it toggles
      the text's use of tab characters for indentation. With a numeric argument
      between 2 and 20, it will set the tab stop pitch.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Enter</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(or <b>^M</b>) inserts a new line into the text without
      automatic indentation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>^J</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(or <b>^Enter</b> under some good terminal emulators)
      inserts a new line into the text with automatic indentation. If <b>^J</b>
      is executed immediately after a <b>{</b> character that does not yet have
      a closing <b>}</b>, <b>^J</b> will also add a properly-indented closing
      brace.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Backspace</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(or more properly, its synonym <b>^?</b> and sometimes, as
      in Mac OS X's Terminal application, <b>^/</b>), deletes the character
      immediately before the cursor.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>^X</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">with no selection deletes the character &quot;under&quot;
      the cursor. When a selection exists, <b>^X</b> moves it into the clip
      buffer, discarding any previously clipped text.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>^Space^X</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">with no selection will select surrounding white space, as
      described earlier. When a selection exists, <b>^Space^X</b> moves it into
      the clip buffer, putting it before any old text if the cursor was at its
      beginning and appending it to the clip buffer if the cursor was at its
      end. The intent is for multiple <b>^Space^X</b> commands to collect data
      together in the same order in which they are most likely to have been
      visited.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A numeric argument to <b>^Space^X</b> places the indicated number of copies of
  the selection into the clip buffer.
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">requires a selection, which is copied into the clip buffer

  <dd class="It-tag">is to <b>^C</b> what <b>^Space^X</b> is to <b>^X</b>. It
      copies the selection to the clip buffer, putting it at the beginning or

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>^V</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">with no selection will paste the current clip buffer's
      contents. But in the presence of a selection it performs a more general
      function: the contents of the selection and the clip buffer are exchanged.
      With a numeric argument, <b>^V</b> pastes or exchanges with a numbered
      <i>register</i>, which is an alternate clip buffer. (The main clip buffer
      is the same as register 0.) Besides being a means for preserving some text
      for longer periods of editing, the registers also serve as a means for
      extracting the text that matches a parenthesized subpattern in a regular
      expression search.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>^_</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">and its synonyms <b>^/</b>, <b>^-</b>, and <b>^A</b> enter
      search mode. The many synonyms are defined because they're often
      synonymous or reserved key sequences in the various window managers and
      the <b>screen</b>(1) utility.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(Specifically, <b>^/</b> gets mapped to <b>^_</b> by many X terminal emulators,
  while <b>^-</b> gets mapped to <b>^_</b> by the Mac OS X Terminal application.
  <b>^A</b> is the default escape sequence in <b>screen</b>(1).)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The variant version of this command (<b>^Space^_</b> and its synonyms) searches
  for occurrences of POSIX regular expressions. Each non-command character that
  is typed thereafter will be appended to the current search target string and
  the selection is moved to the next occurrence thereof.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The case of alphabetic characters is <i>not</i> significant to the search.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most command characters will automatically take the editor out of search mode
  before executing, and the most recently discovered occurrence of the search
  target string will be its selection.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A few commands have different meanings in search mode:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Backspace</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">will remove the last character from the search target and

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>^U</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">is typically used to leave search mode with the currently

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>^_</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(or its synonyms) with no characters in the search target
      string will cause the last successful search's target string to be

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>^G</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">and <b>^H</b> cause motion to the previous and next

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Enter</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(and <b>^_</b> and its synonyms) simply leaves search mode
      with the cursor at the latest hit, with the mark returned to where it was
      before the search (if anywhere). This is useful for using search to place
      the bounds of a selection.</dd>

<b>asdfg</b> supports the &quot;folding&quot; of portions of text into what
