<p>asdfg(1) General Commands Manual asdfg(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
asdfg - a lightweight visual editor optimized for the QWERTY
keyboard</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
asdfg [ -k ] [ -o ] [ -r ] [ -s ] [ -t tab stop ] [ -u | -U
] [ -w command ] [file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
asdfg is an interactive display text editor optimized for
users of the QWERTY keyboard layout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When run with no file name
arguments, asdfg displays a short command introduction and
summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">asdfg can browse very large
read-only files with quick start-up time, since the original
texts are memory-mapped from files and not duplicated in
memory unless they are about to <br>
be modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-k Disable keyword highlighting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Do not save the original
contents of a modified file in file~.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Read-only mode: do not modify
the file on disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Use spaces, not tabs, for
automatic indentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t 8 Set the tab stop to 8 or to
some unreasonable value. This setting can be overridden on a
per-text basis later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Treat files as UTF-8 even if
they contain invalid UTF-8 encodings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Don&rsquo;t treat files as
UTF-8 even if they look like it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w writability command <br>
When an attempt is made to modify a read-only file, use this
command (within which the string %s will be replaced with
the path name of the file) to attempt to put the <br>
file into a writable state. This is useful for interacting
with source code control systems (e.g., p4 edit %s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTENTIONALLY MISSING FEATURES
<br>
asdfg has no embedded extension language, since it is
trivial to pass regions of text from the editor to any
program or script that can read standard input and write
standard <br>
output. The shell, sed(1), awk(1), python(1), and perl(1)
are all usable for such scripting. Further, since asdfg
ships will full sources and the rights to modify it, users
can <br>
customize it directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The editor has only basic syntax
highlighting of C and C++ keywords with subtle color cues
that help match up parentheses, brackets, and braces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">asdfg has no mail or news
reader, IRC client, or artificial intelligence psychologist
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no X window system
interface; that&rsquo;s what xterm(1) and gnome-terminal(1)
are used for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BASICS <br>
A text is a sequence of characters to be viewed or edited,
such as a file. If it is not ASCII, the editor will
automatically determine whether it is encoded in legal UTF-8
and <br>
do the right thing. The editor can also automatically detect
DOS-style line endings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A view comprises all or part of
a text. A text in the editor has at least one view, and
possibly more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A window is a rectangular
portion of the display, and is always associated with a
single view, a contiguous portion of whose text is rendered
in the window. Not every view has a <br>
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each view has a cursor and
possibly a selection, which has the cursor at one end and
the mark at the other. The view&rsquo;s window, if any,
always renders part of the text containing <br>
the view&rsquo;s cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The selection plays a critical
role in asdfg. Besides highlighting regions to be cut or
copied, it also serves to supply arguments to some commands,
such as the path name of a <br>
file to open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The clip buffer is not visible
in any window. It receives snippets of data that have been
cut or copied out of texts, so that they may be moved or
copied elsewhere. It also <br>
supplies the standard input to a background command launched
with ^R (below). There is one clip buffer shared by all
views.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLOR CUES <br>
asdfg uses colors to convey information without cluttering
the display with status lines or borders between
windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">asdfg uses distinct background
colors to distinguish tiled windows. The active window is
always presented in the terminal&rsquo;s default color
scheme. Color is also used to high&acirc; <br>
light the current selection (in cyan) and folded regions (in
red).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Needless tabs and spaces are
marked in violet. These include any tabs or spaces before
the end of a line, as well as any spaces followed by a tab
or multiple spaces that could <br>
be replaced by a tab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bracketing characters are
presented in alternating colors so that matching
parentheses, brackets, and braces are colored
identically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A red cursor signifies a
read-only text, whereas a green cursor indicates a dirty
text (meaning one that needs saving, not one unfit for young
persons).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
asdfg understands the arrow, page up and down, and Delete
keys on your keyboard, so you can actually just use it like
a dumb notepad with no mouse if you don&rsquo;t want to read
any <br>
further than the next section, which tells you how to leave
the editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following sections of the
manual, commands are denoted by ^key to signify the use of
Control, Alt, or a preceding Escape key. They all mean the
same thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variant commands always begin
with ^Space, or its synonym, ^@. A few commands take a
numeric argument, which is specified by ^Space followed by a
decimal or hexadecimal number, <br>
the latter using C language syntax (0xdeadbeef).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many commands are sensitive to
the presence or absence of a selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LEAVING <br>
^Space^ aborts the editor, leaving no original file modified
since the last time ^W was used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Q suspends the editor and
returns the terminal to the shell that invoked it. Use the
shell&rsquo;s foreground command, probably fg, to resume
editing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space^Q <br>
saves all modified texts and terminates the editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAVIGATION <br>
The &quot;backward and forward by unit&quot; commands treat
a numeric argument, if any, as a repeat count.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^G moves the cursor backward by
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^H moves the cursor forward by
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space^G <br>
moves the cursor up a line on the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space^H <br>
moves the cursor down a line on the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^K moves the cursor backward by
words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^L moves the cursor forward by
words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space^K <br>
moves the cursor backward one sentence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space^L <br>
moves the cursor forward one sentence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^T moves the cursor back to the
beginning of the line. If already there, it moves back to
the beginning of the previous line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Y moves the cursor forward to
the end of the line. If already there, it moves forward to
the end of the next line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space^T <br>
moves the cursor back to the beginning of the paragraph. If
already there, it moves back to the beginning of the
previous paragraph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space^Y <br>
moves the cursor forward to the end of the paragraph. If
already there, it moves forward to the end of the next
paragraph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^O moves the window backward by
screenfulls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^P moves the window forward by
screenfulls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space^O <br>
moves to the very beginning of the view.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space^P <br>
moves to the very end of the view.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^] moves to the corresponding
parenthesis, bracket, or brace, respecting nesting, if the
cursor sits atop such a character. Otherwise, it moves to
the nearest enclosing <br>
bracketing character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^N recenters the window so that
the line containing the cursor lies in the middle of its
portion of the display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space^N <br>
causes the current window to occupy the entire display and
recenters the window. With a numeric argument, however, it
simply moves the cursor to the indicated line in the <br>
view, with 1 being the number of the first line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space= <br>
(note that = is not a control character) sets a bookmark on
the current selection or cursor position. A numeric argument
may be used to manage multiple bookmarks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space- <br>
(note that - is not a control character) returns to a
previously set bookmark, possibly identified with a numeric
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space&rsquo; <br>
(note that the single quote &rsquo; is not a control
character) looks an identifier up the identifier in the TAGS
files, which are sought in the same directory as the current
<br>
view and then all of its parents, until one is found that
contains the identifier. A new little window is opened for
each of the identifier&rsquo;s entries in the TAGS file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The TAGS files should be
generated with the ctags or exuberant-ctags utilities and
their -x output format. If there is a selection, it is
deleted from the view and its entire <br>
contents will constitute the identifier to be looked up;
otherwise, the identifier that is immediately before or
around the cursor is sought.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SELECTION <br>
These commands are sensitive to the presence or absence of a
current selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^U begins a new selection if non
exists, setting its mark at the current cursor, which is
then typically navigated to its intended other end. ^U in
the presence of selection <br>
simply removes the mark.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space^U <br>
without a selection causes the entire current line to be
selected by placing the mark at the end of the line and the
cursor at its beginning. It is the same as the com&acirc;
<br>
mand sequence ^Y^U^T with no selection. With a selection
present, ^Space^U exchanges its cursor with its mark.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that ^Space^U with a
numeric argument unconditionally unsets the mark, which can
be handy in a macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space^X <br>
with no selection causes all of the contiguous white space
characters surrounding the cursor to be selected, with the
cursor at the beginning so that they can be easily <br>
replaced by retyping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNDO <br>
asdfg has infinite undo capabilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Z reverses the effects of the
last command, apart from ^Z itself, that modified the
current text in any of its views.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space^Z <br>
reverses the effects of the most recent undo. After ^Z, any
other command that modifies the text will permanently commit
the undo(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODIFICATION <br>
In the default mode, characters typed without a command
indicator are inserted at the current cursor position.
Further, if the cursor is at the beginning of a selection,
the <br>
selection is first cut to the clip buffer, so that the new
text replaces it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^^ (that&rsquo;s
Control-Shift-6, the caret character, on most keyboards, and
^6 will probably also work) inserts an otherwise untypeable
control character into the text. The very <br>
next key to be pressed is either taken literally, if it is a
control character, or converted to a control character if it
is not, and inserted. (For example, you can <br>
press ^^ and then hit either Control-A or just a plain A, to
get the character code 0x01 inserted.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space^^ <br>
with a numeric argument, probably in hexadecimal, inserts
the specified Unicode character into the text in UTF-8
format. If the text is not UTF-8, the character code is <br>
inserted directly as a big-endian literal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tab (or ^I) attempts to perform
tab completion; if that fails, a TAB character is inserted.
If there is a selection with the cursor at its end, the
editor tries to find an <br>
unambiguous continuation based on path names and words in
all the views. A continuation, if found, is appended to the
selection, to facilitate opening a file with ^E. <br>
With no selection, but the cursor immediately after one or
more identifier characters, the editor searches for an
unambiguous continuation using the words in the views. A
<br>
continuation, if found, is inserted as the new selection
with the cursor at its end. No tab completion occurs when
the cursor is at the beginning of a selection; in that <br>
case, the selection is cut and replaced with a single TAB
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^SpaceTab <br>
(or ^Space^I) will align the current line to the indentation
of the previous one. With a numeric argument of 1, it
toggles the text&rsquo;s use of tab characters for
indenta&acirc; <br>
tion. With a numeric argument between 2 and 20, it will set
the tab stop pitch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enter (or ^M) inserts a new line
into the text without automatic indentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^J (or ^Enter under some good
terminal emulators) inserts a new line into the text with
automatic indentation. If ^J is executed immediately after a
{ character that does <br>
not yet have a closing }, ^J will also add a
properly-indented closing brace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backspace <br>
(or more properly, its synonym ^? and sometimes, as in Mac
OS X&rsquo;s Terminal application, ^/), deletes the
character immediately before the cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^X with no selection deletes the
character &quot;under&quot; the cursor. When a selection
exists, ^X moves it into the clip buffer, discarding any
previously clipped text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space^X <br>
with no selection will select surrounding white space, as
described earlier. When a selection exists, ^Space^X moves
it into the clip buffer, putting it before any old <br>
text if the cursor was at its beginning and appending it to
the clip buffer if the cursor was at its end. The intent is
for multiple ^Space^X commands to collect data <br>
together in the same order in which they are most likely to
have been visited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A numeric argument to ^Space^X
places the indicated number of copies of the selection into
the clip buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^C requires a selection, which
is copied into the clip buffer and then unmarked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space^C <br>
is to ^C what ^Space^X is to ^X. It copies the selection to
the clip buffer, putting it at the beginning or the end in
the same way as ^Space^X (above). A numeric argu&acirc; <br>
ment to ^Space^C places the indicated number of copies of
the selection into the clip buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^V with no selection will paste
the current clip buffer&rsquo;s contents. But in the
presence of a selection it performs a more general function:
the contents of the selection and <br>
the clip buffer are exchanged. With a numeric argument, ^V
pastes or exchanges with a numbered register, which is an
alternate clip buffer. (The main clip buffer is the <br>
same as register 0.) Besides being a means for preserving
some text for longer periods of editing, the registers also
serve as a means for extracting the text that <br>
matches a parenthesized subpattern in a regular expression
search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEARCHING <br>
^_ and its synonyms ^/, ^-, and ^A enter search mode. The
many synonyms are defined because they&rsquo;re often
synonymous or reserved key sequences in the various window
managers <br>
and the screen(1) utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Specifically, ^/ gets mapped to
^_ by many X terminal emulators, while ^- gets mapped to ^_
by the Mac OS X Terminal application. ^A is the default
escape sequence in <br>
screen(1).)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The variant version of this
command (^Space^_ and its synonyms) searches for occurrences
of POSIX regular expressions. Each non-command character
that is typed thereafter will <br>
be appended to the current search target string and the
selection is moved to the next occurrence thereof.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The case of alphabetic
characters is not significant to the search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most command characters will
automatically take the editor out of search mode before
executing, and the most recently discovered occurrence of
the search target string will be <br>
its selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A few commands have different
meanings in search mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backspace <br>
will remove the last character from the search target and
move the selection back to its previous position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^U is typically used to leave
search mode with the currently highlighted search target as
the selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^_ (or its synonyms) with no
characters in the search target string will cause the last
successful search&rsquo;s target string to be reused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^G and ^H cause motion to the
previous and next occurrences of the search target string,
not single-character motion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enter (and ^_ and its synonyms)
simply leaves search mode with the cursor at the latest hit,
with the mark returned to where it was before the search (if
anywhere). This is <br>
useful for using search to place the bounds of a
selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEXTS, VIEWS, and WINDOWS <br>
^W saves all modified texts back to their files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space^W <br>
saves just the current text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^E with no selection inserts, as
the new selection, the path name of the current text. With a
selection containing a path name, possibly constructed with
the assistance of <br>
tab completion (above), ^E will raise up a window containing
a view into the indicated file, creating a new text to hold
it if one does not already exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space^E <br>
with a selection will rename the current text, so that it
will be saved in another file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^F finds an invisible view and
associates it with the current window, making its current
view invisible. Hitting ^F repeatedly will cycle through all
of the views. If there <br>
was no invisible view, ^F creates a new scratch text, as
does ^Space; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space^F <br>
does the same thing. but will close the window&rsquo;s
current view, and also its text if it was the last view
thereof.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^D splits the current window
horizontally, raising up an invisible or new view in the
lower half of the original window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space^D <br>
splits the current window vertically, raising up an
invisible or new view in the right half of the original
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^S moves to another window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^S with a numeric argument moves
to a specific window; number 1 is in the upper left-hand
corner of the display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space^S <br>
moves to another window, closing the old one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space; <br>
(note that ; is not a control character) creates a new
anonymous text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space # <br>
(note that the number sign is not a contral character)
displays the current positions path name and line
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space ? <br>
(note that the question mark ? is not a control character)
displays a new window with the built-in help summary of
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MACROS <br>
^Space^B <br>
commences the recording of your keystrokes as the macro,
which continues until the next ^B or another macro
recording.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^SpaceF1-F12 <br>
commences the recording of your keystrokes as a new macro
for a function key. Note that F1 and F11 are typically
hijacked by window managers for their own purposes and <br>
probably will not be usable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^B ends the recording of a
macro, if one is in progress. Afterwards, ^B replays the
macro, possibly with a repeat count as the argument. Note
that a failed search in a <br>
macro will terminate its execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FOLDING <br>
asdfg supports the &quot;folding&quot; of portions of text
into what appear to be single characters, and the reverse
&quot;unfolding&quot; operation. Further, to provide outline
views of texts such <br>
as source code that are heavily indented, asdfg has an
automatic nested folding capability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space, <br>
with a selection will fold the selection. Otherwise, it will
repeatedly fold indented regions of the text to provide an
outline view. A numeric value, if any, specifies <br>
the number of leading spaces or equivalent tabs at which
code lines will be folded. The default is 1, causing the
folding of any line that isn&rsquo;t left-justified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space. <br>
with a selection, or immediately atop a folded section, will
unfold the topmost foldings within it. Otherwise, and if
there is a numeric value, it will completely unfold <br>
the entire view.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHELLS <br>
^R with no selection will launch an interactive shell in a
new scratch text. With a selection, however, ^R will execute
the shell command in the selection with the contents <br>
of the clip buffer, if any, as its standard input, and
collect its output asynchronously in the background to
replace the selection. This allows many helpful UNIX text
<br>
processing commands to be used directly. Some handy commands
to know:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat(1) to include another entire
file, or to receive writes to a named pipe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mkfifo(1) <br>
to create a named pipe so that commands in other windows may
direct their output into a text running cat in the
background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd path <br>
to change the editor&rsquo;s current working directory (a
special case command that is not actually passed to a
shell)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grep(1) <br>
to search for lines containing a pattern</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort(1) <br>
to rearrange lines alphabetically or numerically, possibly
reversed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uniq(1) <br>
to discard duplicated lines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sed(1) as in sed
&rsquo;s/FROM/TO/g&rsquo; to perform unconditional
search-and-replace with regular expressions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tr(1) to convert lower to upper
case with a-z A-Z and to]&rsquo; remove DOS carriage returns
with -d &rsquo;[</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fmt(1) to reformat paragraphs of
natural language text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indent -st -kr -i8 -nbbo <br>
to reformat C language source code sensibly</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">column -t <br>
to realign data nicely into columns</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">man | colcrt <br>
to read a man page</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tailf(1) <br>
to monitor additions to a file such as a log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">make(1) <br>
to compile your code</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aspell list | sort | uniq |
column <br>
to get a list of words that may be misspelled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Space^R with no selection will
terminate the output of any asynchronous child process
that&rsquo;s still running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIPS <br>
* To select the rest of the line after the cursor, use
^U^Y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* It is often faster to retype a
bungled word than to fix it, using ^U^K and then
retyping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Transposing multiple blocks of
text is easy with ^V, which generalized the usual paste
operation into an exchange of the clip buffer with the
selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Incremental search and
replacement can be done with a macro or by clipping the
replacement text, and on search hits that are to be
replaced, using ^U^V^C^/^/ to exchange <br>
the hit with the replacement text, copy it back to the clip
buffer, and proceed to the next occurrence of the search
pattern. But when the replacement text is short, it&rsquo;s
<br>
sometimes easiest to just overwrite the selection by hitting
^U^X and immediately retyping the new text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Reconfigure your keyboards so
that the key to the left of A, which is probably labeled
Caps Lock, is interpreted as a Control modifier instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* To move backward or forward by
half a screenfull, use ^O or ^P and then ^N. (Or set the

modified. Unless the file is large, it also displays the
line number of the cursor.</p>
