<p>cssdiff(1) CRM114 cssdiff(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cssdiff - generate a difference summary of two .css
files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cssdiff [cssfile 1] [cssfile 2]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
This man page is taken from an older CRM114 version. It is
provided as a convenience to Debian users and may not be
up-to-date. If you would like to update it, please send <br>
appropriate patches to the Debian bug tracking system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cssdiff is a special-purpose utility to measure the distance
between the classes represented by cssfile1 and cssfile2.
The summary result output tells how many features were in
<br>
each of the .css files, how many features appeared in both
(balanced overlap), how many features appeared only in one
(or unbalanced overlaps), and how often the feature set of
<br>
one .css file strictly dominated the feature set of another
.css file. This set of metrics provides an intuitive way to
determine the similarity (or dissimilarity) of two classes
<br>
represented as .css files. When using the CRM114 spamfilter,
it can be used to find out how easy it will be for CRM114 to
differentiate spam from nonspam with your .css files. <br>
cssdiff prints a report like e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sparse spectra file spam.css has
1048577 bins total <br>
Sparse spectra file nonspam.css has 1048577 bins total</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File 1 total features : 1605968
<br>
File 2 total features : 1045152</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarities between files :
142039 <br>
Differences between files : 1279964</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File 1 dominates file 2 :
1463929 <br>
File 2 dominates file 1 : 903113</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that in this case
there&rsquo;s a big difference between the two files; in
this case there are about 10 times as many differences
between the two files as there are similarities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
There are no options to cssdiff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHORTCOMINGS <br>
Note that cssdiff as of version 20040816 is NOT capable of
dealing with the CRM114 Winnow classifier&rsquo;s
floating-point .cow files. Worse, cssdiff is unaware of
it&rsquo;s shortcomings, <br>
and will try anyway. The only recourse is to be aware of
this issue and not use cssdiff on Winnow classifier floating
point .cow format files.</p>
