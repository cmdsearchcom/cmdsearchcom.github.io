<p>RRDCACHED(1) rrdtool RRDCACHED(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rrdcached - Data caching daemon for rrdtool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rrdcached [-P permissions] [-l address] [-s group] [-w
timeout] [-z delay] [-f timeout] [-p pid_file] [-t
write_threads] [-j journal_dir] [-F] [-g] [-b base_dir
[-B]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
rrdcached is a daemon that receives updates to existing RRD
files, accumulates them and, if enough have been received or
a defined time has passed, writes the updates to the RRD
<br>
file. A flush command may be used to force writing of values
to disk, so that graphing facilities and similar can work
with up-to-date data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The daemon was written with big
setups in mind. Those setups usually run into IO related
problems sooner or later for reasons that are beyond the
scope of this document. Check <br>
the wiki at the RRDtool homepage for details. Also check
&quot;SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS&quot; below before using this
daemon! A detailed description of how the daemon operates
can be found <br>
in the &quot;HOW IT WORKS&quot; section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-l address <br>
Tells the daemon to bind to address and accept incoming
connections on that socket. If address begins with
&quot;unix:&quot;, everything following that prefix is
interpreted as the <br>
path to a UNIX domain socket. Otherwise the address or node
name are resolved using &quot;getaddrinfo()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For network sockets, a port may
be specified by using the form &quot;[address]:port&quot;.
If the address is an IPv4 address or a fully qualified
domain name (i. e. the address <br>
contains at least one dot (&quot;.&quot;)), the square
brackets can be omitted, resulting in the (simpler)
&quot;address:port&quot; pattern. The default port is
42217/tcp. If you specify a <br>
network socket, it is mandatory to read the &quot;SECURITY
CONSIDERATIONS&quot; section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following formats are
accepted. Please note that the address of the UNIX domain
socket must start with a slash in the second case!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unix:&lt;/path/to/unix.sock&gt;
<br>
/&lt;path/to/unix.sock&gt; <br>
&lt;hostname-or-ip&gt; <br>
[&lt;hostname-or-ip&gt;]:&lt;port&gt; <br>
&lt;hostname-or-ipv4&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -l option is not
specified the default address,
&quot;unix:/tmp/rrdcached.sock&quot;, will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s group_name|gid <br>
Set the group permissions of a UNIX domain socket. The
option accepts either a numeric group id or group name. That
group will then have both read and write permissions (the
<br>
socket will have file permissions 0750) for the socket and,
therefore, is able to send commands to the daemon. This may
be useful in cases where you cannot easily run all RRD <br>
processes with the same user privileges (e.g. graph
generating CGI scripts that typically run in the permission
context of the web server).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option affects the
following UNIX socket addresses (the following -l options)
or the default socket (if no -l options have been
specified), i.e., you may specify <br>
different settings for different sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is not to change
ownership or permissions of the socket and, thus, use the
system default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m mode <br>
Set the file permissions of a UNIX domain socket. The option
accepts an octal number representing the bit pattern for the
mode (see chmod(1) for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that not all systems
honor this setting. On Linux, read/write permissions are
required to connect to a UNIX socket. However, many
BSD-derived systems ignore <br>
permissions for UNIX sockets. See unix(7) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option affects the
following UNIX socket addresses (the following -l options)
or the default socket (if no -l options have been
specified), i.e., you may specify <br>
different settings for different sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is not to change
ownership or permissions of the socket and, thus, use the
system default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P command[,command[,...]] <br>
Specifies the commands accepted via a network socket. This
allows administrators of RRDCacheD to control the actions
accepted from various sources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The arguments given to the -P
option is a comma separated list of commands. For example,
to allow the &quot;FLUSH&quot; and &quot;PENDING&quot;
commands one could specify:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rrdcached -P FLUSH,PENDING
$MORE_ARGUMENTS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -P option affects the
following socket addresses (the following -l options) or the
default socket (if no -l options have been specified). In
the following example, only <br>
the IPv4 network socket (address 10.0.0.1) will be
restricted to the &quot;FLUSH&quot; and &quot;PENDING&quot;
commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rrdcached -l unix:/some/path -P
FLUSH,PENDING -l 10.0.0.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A complete list of available
commands can be found in the section &quot;Valid
Commands&quot; below. There are two minor special
exceptions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;HELP&quot; and &quot;QUIT&quot; commands are always
allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the
&quot;BATCH&quot; command is accepted, the . command will
automatically be accepted, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please also read &quot;SECURITY
CONSIDERATIONS&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w timeout <br>
Data is written to disk every timeout seconds. If this
option is not specified the default interval of 300 seconds
will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z delay <br>
If specified, rrdcached will delay writing of each RRD for a
random number of seconds in the range [0,delay). This will
avoid too many writes being queued simultaneously. <br>
This value should be no greater than the value specified in
-w. By default, there is no delay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f timeout <br>
Every timeout seconds the entire cache is searched for old
values which are written to disk. This only concerns files
to which updates have stopped, so setting this to a high
<br>
value, such as 3600 seconds, is acceptable in most cases.
This timeout defaults to 3600 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p file <br>
Sets the name and location of the PID-file. If not
specified, the default,
&quot;$localststedir/run/rrdcached.pid&quot; will be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t write_threads <br>
Specifies the number of threads used for writing RRD files.
The default is 4. Increasing this number will allow
rrdcached to have more simultaneous I/O requests into the
<br>
kernel. This may allow the kernel to re-order disk writes,
resulting in better disk throughput.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j dir <br>
Write updates to a journal in dir. In the event of a program
or system crash, this will allow the daemon to write any
updates that were pending at the time of the crash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On startup, the daemon will
check for journal files in this directory. If found, all
updates therein will be read into memory before the daemon
starts accepting new <br>
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The journal will be rotated with
the same frequency as the flush timer given by -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When journaling is enabled, the
daemon will use a fast shutdown procedure. Rather than
flushing all files to disk, it will make sure the journal is
properly written and exit <br>
immediately. Although the RRD data files are not fully
up-to-date, no information is lost; all pending updates will
be replayed from the journal next time the daemon starts
<br>
up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To disable fast shutdown, use
the -F option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F ALWAYS flush all updates to
the RRD data files when the daemon is shut down, regardless
of journal setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Run in the foreground. The
daemon will not fork().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b dir <br>
The daemon will change into a specific directory at startup.
All files passed to the daemon, that are specified by a
relative path, will be interpreted to be relative to this
<br>
directory. If not given the default, &quot;/tmp&quot;, will
be used.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">+------------------------+------------------------+
<br>
! Command line ! File updated ! <br>
+------------------------+------------------------+ <br>
! foo.rrd ! /tmp/foo.rrd ! <br>
! foo/bar.rrd ! /tmp/foo/bar.rrd ! <br>
! /var/lib/rrd/foo.rrd ! /var/lib/rrd/foo.rrd ! <br>
+------------------------+------------------------+ <br>
Paths given on the command line and paths actually <br>
updated by the daemon, assuming the base directory <br>
&quot;/tmp&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: The paths up to and
including the base directory MUST NOT BE symbolic links. In
other words, if the base directory is specified as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b /base/dir/somewhere</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">... then NONE of the following
should be symbolic links:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/base <br>
/base/dir <br>
/base/dir/somewhere</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Only permit writes into the
base directory specified in -b (and any sub-directories).
This does NOT detect symbolic links. Paths containing
&quot;../&quot; will also be blocked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AFFECTED RRDTOOL COMMANDS <br>
The following commands may be made aware of the rrdcached
using the command line argument --daemon or the environment
variable RRDCACHED_ADDRESS:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; dump</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; fetch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; flush</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; graph</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; graphv</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; info</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; last</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; lastupdate</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; update</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; xport</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The update command can send
values to the daemon instead of writing them to the disk
itself. All other commands can send a FLUSH command (see
below) to the daemon before <br>
accessing the files, so they work with up-to-date data even
if the cache timeout is large.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERROR REPORTING <br>
The daemon reports errors in one of two ways: During
startup, error messages are printed to &quot;STDERR&quot;.
One of the steps when starting up is to fork to the
background and closing <br>
&quot;STDERR&quot; - after this writing directly to the user
is no longer possible. Once this has happened, the daemon
will send log messages to the system logging daemon using
syslog(3). <br>
The facility used is &quot;LOG_DAEMON&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW IT WORKS <br>
When receiving an update, rrdcached does not write to disk
but looks for an entry for that file in its internal tree.
If not found, an entry is created including the current time
<br>
(called &quot;First&quot; in the diagram below). This time
is not the time specified on the command line but the time
the operating system considers to be &quot;now&quot;. The
value and time of the <br>
value (called &quot;Time&quot; in the diagram below) are
appended to the tree node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When appending a value to a tree
node, it is checked whether it&rsquo;s time to write the
values to disk. Values are written to disk if &quot;now() -
First &gt;= timeout&quot;, where &quot;timeout&quot; is <br>
the timeout specified using the -w option, see
&quot;OPTIONS&quot;. If the values are &quot;old
enough&quot; they will be enqueued in the &quot;update
queue&quot;, i. e. they will be appended to the linked <br>
list shown below. Because the tree nodes and the elements of
the linked list are the same data structures in memory, any
update to a file that has already been enqueued will be <br>
written with the next write to the RRD file, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A separate &quot;update
thread&quot; constantly dequeues the first element in the
update queue and writes all its values to the appropriate
file. So as long as the update queue is not <br>
empty files are written at the highest possible rate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the timeout of files is
checked only when new values are added to the file,
&quot;dead&quot; files, i. e. files that are not updated
anymore, would never be written to disk. <br>
Therefore, every now and then, controlled by the -f option,
the entire tree is walked and all &quot;old&quot; values are
enqueued. Since this only affects &quot;dead&quot; files and
walking the tree <br>
is relatively expensive, you should set the &quot;flush
interval&quot; to a reasonably high value. The default is
3600 seconds (one hour).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The downside of caching values
is that they won&rsquo;t show up in graphs generated from
the RRD files. To get around this, the daemon provides the
&quot;flush command&quot; to flush specific <br>
files. This means that the file is inserted at the head of
the update queue or moved there if it is already enqueued.
The flush command will return only after the file&rsquo;s
pending <br>
updates have been written to disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS <br>
Authentication <br>
If your rrdtool installation was built without libwrap there
is no form of authentication for clients connecting to the
rrdcache daemon!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your rrdtool installation was
built with libwrap then you can use hosts_access to restrict
client access to the rrdcache daemon (rrdcached). For more
information on how to <br>
use hosts_access to restrict access to the rrdcache daemon
you should read the hosts_access(5) man pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is still highly recommended
to install a packet filter or similar mechanism to prevent
unauthorized connections. Unless you have a dedicated VLAN
or VPN for this, using <br>
network sockets is probably a bad idea!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Authorization <br>
There is minimal per-socket authorization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Authorization is currently done
on a per-socket basis. That means each socket has a list of
commands it will accept and it will accept. It will accept
only those commands <br>
explicitly listed but it will (currently) accept these
commands from anyone reaching the socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the networking sockets are to
be used, it is necessary to restrict the accepted commands
to those needed by external clients. If, for example,
external clients want to draw <br>
graphs of the cached data, they should only be allowed to
use the &quot;FLUSH&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encryption <br>
There is no encryption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Again, this may be added in the
future, but for the time being it is your job to keep your
private data private. Install a VPN or an encrypted tunnel
if you statistics are <br>
confidential!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sanity checking <br>
There is no sanity checking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The daemon will blindly write to
any file it gets told, so you really should create a
separate user just for this daemon. Also it does not do any
sanity checks, so if it gets <br>
told to write values for a time far in the future, your
files will be messed up good!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conclusion <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Security is the job of the
administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; We recommend to
allow write access via UNIX domain sockets only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You have been
warned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROTOCOL <br>
The daemon communicates with clients using a line based
ASCII protocol which is easy to read and easy to type. This
makes it easy for scripts to implement the protocol and <br>
possible for users to use telnet to connect to the daemon
and test stuff &quot;by hand&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The protocol is line based, this
means that each record consists of one or more lines. A line
is terminated by the line feed character 0x0A, commonly
written as &quot;0. In the <br>
examples below, this character will be written as
&quot;&lt;LF&gt;&quot; (&quot;line feed&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the connection has been
established, the client is expected to send a
&quot;command&quot;. A command consists of the command
keyword, possibly some arguments, and a terminating <br>
newline character. For a list of commands, see &quot;Valid
Commands&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FLUSH /tmp/foo.rrd&lt;LF&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The daemon answers with a line
consisting of a status code and a short status message,
separated by one or more space characters. A negative status
code signals an error, a <br>
positive status code or zero signal success. If the status
code is greater than zero, it indicates the number of lines
that follow the status line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Success&lt;LF&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Two lines follow&lt;LF&gt;
<br>
This is the first line&lt;LF&gt; <br>
And this is the second line&lt;LF&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Valid Commands <br>
The following commands are understood by the daemon:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FLUSH filename <br>
Causes the daemon to put filename to the head of the update
queue (possibly moving it there if the node is already
enqueued). The answer will be sent after the node has been
<br>
dequeued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FLUSHALL <br>
Causes the daemon to start flushing ALL pending values to
disk. This returns immediately, even though the writes may
take a long time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PENDING filename <br>
Shows any &quot;pending&quot; updates for a file, in order.
The updates shown have not yet been written to the
underlying RRD file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FORGET filename <br>
Removes filename from the cache. Any pending updates WILL BE
LOST.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUEUE <br>
Shows the files that are on the output queue. Returns zero
or more lines in the following format, where
&lt;num_vals&gt; is the number of values to be written for
the &lt;file&gt;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;num_vals&gt;
&lt;file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HELP [command] <br>
Returns a short usage message. If no command is given, or
command is HELP, a list of commands supported by the daemon
is returned. Otherwise a short description, possibly <br>
containing a pointer to a manual page, is returned.
Obviously, this is meant for interactive usage and the
format in which the commands and usage summaries are
returned is <br>
not well defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATS <br>
Returns a list of metrics which can be used to measure the
daemons performance and check its status. For a description
of the values returned, see &quot;Performance Values&quot;
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format in which the values
are returned is similar to many other line based protocols:
Each value is printed on a separate line, each consisting of
the name of the value, <br>
a colon, one or more spaces and the actual value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9 Statistics follow <br>
QueueLength: 0 <br>
UpdatesReceived: 30 <br>
FlushesReceived: 2 <br>
UpdatesWritten: 13 <br>
DataSetsWritten: 390 <br>
TreeNodesNumber: 13 <br>
TreeDepth: 4 <br>
JournalBytes: 190 <br>
JournalRotate: 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UPDATE filename values [values
...] <br>
Adds more data to a filename. This is the operation the
daemon was designed for, so describing the mechanism again
is unnecessary. Read &quot;HOW IT WORKS&quot; above for a
detailed <br>
explanation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that rrdcached only accepts
absolute timestamps in the update values. Updates strings
like &quot;N:1:2:3&quot; are automatically converted to
absolute time by the RRD client <br>
library before sending to rrdcached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WROTE filename <br>
This command is written to the journal after a file is
successfully written out to disk. It is used during journal
replay to determine which updates have already been <br>
applied. It is only valid in the journal; it is not accepted
from the other command channels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BATCH <br>
This command initiates the bulk load of multiple commands.
This is designed for installations with extremely high
update rates, since it permits more than one command to be
<br>
issued per read() and write().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All commands are executed just
as they would be if given individually, except for output to
the user. Messages indicating success are suppressed, and
error messages are <br>
delayed until the client is finished.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command processing is finished
when the client sends a dot (&quot;.&quot;) on its own line.
After the client has finished, the server responds with an
error count and the list of <br>
error messages (if any). Each error messages indicates the
number of the command to which it corresponds, and the error
message itself. The first user command after BATCH <br>
is command number one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">client: BATCH <br>
server: 0 Go ahead. End with dot &rsquo;.&rsquo; on its own
line. <br>
client: UPDATE x.rrd 1223661439:1:2:3 &lt;--- command #1

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUIT <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Performance Values <br>
The following counters are returned by the STATS
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QueueLength (unsigned 64bit
integer) <br>
Number of nodes currently enqueued in the update queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UpdatesReceived (unsigned 64bit
integer) <br>
Number of UPDATE commands received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FlushesReceived (unsigned 64bit
integer) <br>
Number of FLUSH commands received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UpdatesWritten (unsigned 64bit
integer) <br>
Total number of updates, i. e. calls to
&quot;rrd_update_r&quot;, since the daemon was started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DataSetsWritten (unsigned 64bit
integer) <br>
Total number of &quot;data sets&quot; written to disk since
the daemon was started. A data set is one or more values
passed to the UPDATE command. For example:
&quot;1223661439:123:456&quot; is <br>
one data set with two values. The term &quot;data set&quot;
is used to prevent confusion whether individual values or
groups of values are counted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TreeNodesNumber (unsigned 64bit
integer) <br>
Number of nodes in the cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TreeDepth (unsigned 64bit
integer) <br>
Depth of the tree used for fast key lookup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JournalBytes (unsigned 64bit
integer) <br>
Total number of bytes written to the journal since
startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JournalRotate (unsigned 64bit
integer) <br>
Number of times the journal has been rotated since
startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
SIGINT and SIGTERM <br>
The daemon exits normally on receipt of either of these
signals. Pending updates are handled in accordance with the
-j and -F options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 <br>
The daemon exits AFTER flushing all updates out to disk.
This may take a while.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR2 <br>
The daemon exits immediately, without flushing updates out
to disk. Pending updates will be replayed from the journal
when the daemon starts up again. WARNING: if <br>
journaling (-j) is NOT enabled, any pending updates WILL BE
LOST.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
No known bugs at the moment.</p>
