<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ncdu - NCurses Disk Usage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ncdu [options] dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ncdu (NCurses Disk Usage) is a curses-based version of the
well-known &rsquo;du&rsquo;, and provides a fast way to see
what directories are using your disk space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Mode Selection <br>
-h Print a short help message and quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print ncdu version and
quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f FILE <br>
Load the given file, which has earlier been created with the
&quot;-o&quot; option. If FILE is equivalent to
&quot;-&quot;, the file is read from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the sake of preventing a
screw-up, the current version of ncdu will assume that the
directory information in the imported file does not
represent the filesystem on which <br>
the file is being imported. That is, the refresh and file
deletion options in the browser will be disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dir Scan the given
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o FILE <br>
Export all necessary information to FILE instead of opening
the browser interface. If FILE is &quot;-&quot;, the data is
written to standard output. See the examples section below
for <br>
some handy use cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be warned that the exported data
may grow quite large when exporting a directory with many
files. 10.000 files will get you an export in the order of
600 to 700 KiB <br>
uncompressed, or a little over 100 KiB when compressed with
gzip. This scales linearly, so be prepared to handle a few
tens of megabytes when dealing with millions of files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interface options <br>
-0 Don&rsquo;t give any feedback while scanning a directory
or importing a file, other than when a fatal error occurs.
Ncurses will not be initialized until the scan is complete.
When <br>
exporting the data with &quot;-o&quot;, ncurses will not be
initialized at all. This option is the default when
exporting to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 Similar to &quot;-0&quot;,
but does give feedback on the scanning progress with a
single line of output. This option is the default when
exporting to a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some cases, the ncurses
browser interface which you&rsquo;ll see after the
scan/import is complete may look garbled when using this
option. If you&rsquo;re not exporting to a file, <br>
&quot;-2&quot; is probably a better choice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2 Provide a full-screen ncurses
interface while scanning a directory or importing a file.
This is the only interface that provides feedback on any
non-fatal errors while <br>
scanning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet mode. While scanning or
importing the directory, ncdu will update the screen 10
times a second by default, this will be decreased to once
every 2 seconds in quiet mode. <br>
Use this feature to save bandwidth over remote connections.
This option has no effect when &quot;-0&quot; is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Read-only mode. This will
disable the built-in file deletion feature. This option has
no effect when &quot;-o&quot; is used, because there will
not be a browser interface in that case. <br>
It has no effect when &quot;-f&quot; is used, either,
because the deletion feature is disabled in that case
anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--si <br>
List sizes using base 10 prefixes, that is, powers of 1000
(KB, MB, etc), as defined in the International System of
Units (SI), instead of the usual base 2 prefixes, that is,
<br>
powers of 1024 (KiB, MiB, etc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--confirm-quit <br>
Requires a confirmation before quitting ncdu. Very helpful
when you accidentally press &rsquo;q&rsquo; during or after
a very long scan.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scan Options <br>
These options affect the scanning progress, and have no
effect when importing directory information from a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Do not cross filesystem
boundaries, i.e. only count files and directories on the
same filesystem as the directory being scanned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude PATTERN <br>
Exclude files that match PATTERN. The files will still be
displayed by default, but are not counted towards the disk
usage statistics. This argument can be added multiple <br>
times to add more patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X FILE, --exclude-from FILE
<br>
Exclude files that match any pattern in FILE. Patterns
should be separated by a newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-caches <br>
Exclude directories containing CACHEDIR.TAG. The directories
will still be displayed, but not their content, and they are
not counted towards the disk usage statistics. See <br>
http://www.brynosaurus.com/cachedir/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEYS <br>
? Show help + keys + about screen</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">up, down j, k <br>
Cycle through the items</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">right, enter, l <br>
Open selected directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">left, &lt;, h <br>
Go to parent directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Order by filename (press again
for descending order)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s Order by filesize (press again
for descending order)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C Order by number of items
(press again for descending order)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a Toggle between showing disk
usage and showing apparent size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Delete the selected file or
directory. An error message will be shown when the contents
of the directory do not match or do not exist anymore on the
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t Toggle dirs before files when
sorting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g Toggle between showing
percentage, graph, both, or none. Percentage is relative to
the size of the current directory, graph is relative to the
largest item in the current <br>
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Toggle display of child item
counts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e Show/hide &rsquo;hidden&rsquo;
or &rsquo;excluded&rsquo; files and directories. Please note
that even though you can&rsquo;t see the hidden files and
directories, they are still there and they are still <br>
included in the directory sizes. If you suspect that the
totals shown at the bottom of the screen are not correct,
make sure you haven&rsquo;t enabled this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i Show information about the
current selected item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Refresh/recalculate the
current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b Spawn shell in current
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ncdu will determine your
preferred shell from the &quot;NCDU_SHELL&quot; or
&quot;SHELL&quot; variable (in that order), or will call
&quot;/bin/sh&quot; if neither are set. This allows you to
also <br>
configure another command to be run when he &rsquo;b&rsquo;
key is pressed. For example, to spawn the vifm(1) file
manager instead of a shell, run ncdu as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export NCDU_SHELL=vifm <br>
ncdu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q Quit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To scan and browse the directory you&rsquo;re currently in,
all you need is a simple:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncdu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to scan a full
filesystem, your root filesystem, for example, then
you&rsquo;ll want to use &quot;-x&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncdu -x /</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since scanning a large directory
may take a while, you can scan a directory and export the
results for later viewing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncdu -1xo- / | gzip
&gt;export.gz <br>
# ...some time later: <br>
zcat export.gz | ncdu -f-</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To export from a cron job, make
sure to replace &quot;-1&quot; with &quot;-0&quot; to
suppress any unnecessary output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also export a directory
and browse it once scanning is done:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncdu -o- | tee export.file |
./ncdu -f-</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same is possible with gzip
compression, but is a bit kludgey:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncdu -o- | gzip | tee export.gz
| gunzip | ./ncdu -f-</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To scan a system remotely, but
browse through the files locally:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssh -C user@system ncdu -o- / |
./ncdu -f-</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;-C&quot; option to ssh
enables compression, which will be very useful over slow
links. Remote scanning and local viewing has two major
advantages when compared to running ncdu <br>
directly on the remote system: You can browse through the
scanned directory on the local system without any network
latency, and ncdu does not keep the entire directory
structure <br>
in memory when exporting, so you won&rsquo;t consume much
memory on the remote system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HARD LINKS <br>
Every disk usage analysis utility has its own way of (not)
counting hard links. There does not seem to be any
universally agreed method of handling hard links, and it is
even <br>
inconsistent among different versions of ncdu. This section
explains what each version of ncdu does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncdu 1.5 and below does not
support any hard link detection at all: each link is
considered a separate inode and its size is counted for
every link. This means that the displayed <br>
directory sizes are incorrect when analyzing directories
which contain hard links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncdu 1.6 has basic hard link
detection: When a link to a previously encountered inode is
detected, the link is considered to have a file size of zero
bytes. Its size is not <br>
counted again, and the link is indicated in the browser
interface with a &rsquo;H&rsquo; mark. The displayed
directory sizes are only correct when all links to an inode
reside within that <br>
directory. When this is not the case, the sizes may or may
not be correct, depending on which links were considered as
&quot;duplicate&quot; and which as &quot;original&quot;. The
indicated size of <br>
the topmost directory (that is, the one specified on the
command line upon starting ncdu) is always correct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncdu 1.7 and later has improved
hard link detection. Each file that has more than two links
has the &quot;H&quot; mark visible in the browser interface.
Each hard link is counted exactly <br>
once for every directory it appears in. The indicated size
of each directory is therefore, correctly, the sum of the
sizes of all unique inodes that can be found in that <br>
directory. Note, however, that this may not always be same
as the space that will be reclaimed after deleting the
directory, as some inodes may still be accessible from hard
<br>
links outside it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Directory hard links are not supported. They will not be
detected as being hard links, and will thus be scanned and
counted multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some minor glitches may appear
when displaying filenames that contain multibyte or
multicolumn characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All sizes are internally
represented as a signed 64bit integer. If you have a
directory larger than 8 EiB minus one byte, ncdu will clip
its size to 8 EiB minus one byte. When <br>
deleting items in a directory with a clipped size, the
resulting sizes will be incorrect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Item counts are stored in a
signed 32-bit integer without overflow detection. If you
have a directory with more than 2 billion files, quite
literally anything can happen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please report any other bugs you
may find at the bug tracker, which can be found on the web
site at https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu</p>
