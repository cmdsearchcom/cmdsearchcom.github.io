ncdu (NCurses Disk Usage) is a curses-based version of the well-known 'du', and
  provides a fast way to see what directories are using your disk space.

    For the sake of preventing a screw-up, the current version of ncdu will
      assume that the directory information in the imported file does not

    Be warned that the exported data may grow quite large when exporting a

      order of 600 to 700 KiB uncompressed, or a little over 100 KiB when
      compressed with gzip. This scales linearly, so be prepared to handle a few
      tens of megabytes when dealing with millions of files.</dd>

    Ncdu will determine your preferred shell from the &quot;NCDU_SHELL&quot; or
      &quot;SHELL&quot; variable (in that order), or will call
      &quot;/bin/sh&quot; if neither are set. This allows you to also configure
      another command to be run when he 'b' key is pressed. For example, to
      spawn the <i>vifm</i>(1) file manager instead of a shell, run ncdu as
      follows:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

  export NCDU_SHELL=vifm

To scan and browse the directory you're currently in, all you need is a simple:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  ncdu
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to scan a full filesystem, your root filesystem, for example, then
  you'll want to use &quot;-x&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  ncdu -x /
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since scanning a large directory may take a while, you can scan a directory and
  export the results for later viewing:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  ncdu -1xo- / | gzip &gt;export.gz
  # ...some time later:
  zcat export.gz | ncdu -f-
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To export from a cron job, make sure to replace &quot;-1&quot; with
  &quot;-0&quot; to suppress any unnecessary output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also export a directory and browse it once scanning is done:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  ncdu -o- | tee export.file | ./ncdu -f-
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The same is possible with gzip compression, but is a bit kludgey:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  ncdu -o- | gzip | tee export.gz | gunzip | ./ncdu -f-
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To scan a system remotely, but browse through the files locally:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  ssh -C user@system ncdu -o- / | ./ncdu -f-
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;-C&quot; option to ssh enables compression, which will be very useful
  over slow links. Remote scanning and local viewing has two major advantages
  when compared to running ncdu directly on the remote system: You can browse
  through the scanned directory on the local system without any network latency,
  and ncdu does not keep the entire directory structure in memory when
  exporting, so you won't consume much memory on the remote system.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="HARD_LINKS"><a class="selflink" href="#HARD_LINKS">HARD
  LINKS</a></h1>
Every disk usage analysis utility has its own way of (not) counting hard links.
  There does not seem to be any universally agreed method of handling hard
  links, and it is even inconsistent among different versions of ncdu. This
  section explains what each version of ncdu does.
<div class="Pp"></div>
ncdu 1.5 and below does not support any hard link detection at all: each link is
  considered a separate inode and its size is counted for every link. This means
  that the displayed directory sizes are incorrect when analyzing directories
  which contain hard links.
<div class="Pp"></div>
ncdu 1.6 has basic hard link detection: When a link to a previously encountered
  inode is detected, the link is considered to have a file size of zero bytes.
  Its size is not counted again, and the link is indicated in the browser
  interface with a 'H' mark. The displayed directory sizes are only correct when
  all links to an inode reside within that directory. When this is not the case,
  the sizes may or may not be correct, depending on which links were considered
  as &quot;duplicate&quot; and which as &quot;original&quot;. The indicated size
  of the topmost directory (that is, the one specified on the command line upon
  starting ncdu) is always correct.
<div class="Pp"></div>
ncdu 1.7 and later has improved hard link detection. Each file that has more
  than two links has the &quot;H&quot; mark visible in the browser interface.
  Each hard link is counted exactly once for every directory it appears in. The
  indicated size of each directory is therefore, correctly, the sum of the sizes
  of all unique inodes that can be found in that directory. Note, however, that
  this may not always be same as the space that will be reclaimed after deleting
  the directory, as some inodes may still be accessible from hard links outside
  it.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Directory hard links are not supported. They will not be detected as being hard
  links, and will thus be scanned and counted multiple times.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some minor glitches may appear when displaying filenames that contain multibyte
  or multicolumn characters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All sizes are internally represented as a signed 64bit integer. If you have a
  directory larger than 8 EiB minus one byte, ncdu will clip its size to 8 EiB
  minus one byte. When deleting items in a directory with a clipped size, the
  resulting sizes will be incorrect.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Item counts are stored in a signed 32-bit integer without overflow detection. If
  you have a directory with more than 2 billion files, quite literally anything
  can happen.
<div class="Pp"></div>
