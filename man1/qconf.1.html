<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
qconf - Grid Engine Queue Configuration</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX <br>
qconf options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Qconf allows the system administrator to add, delete, and
modify the current Grid Engine configuration, including
queue management, host management, complex management and
user <br>
management. Qconf also allows you to examine the current
queue configuration for existing queues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qconf allows the use of the
backslash, &rsquo;&acute;, character at the end of a line to
indicate that the next line is a continuation of the current
line. When displaying settings, such <br>
as the output of one of the -s* options, qconf will break up
long lines (lines greater than 80 characters) into smaller
lines using backslash line continuation where possible. <br>
Lines will only be broken up at commas or whitespace. This
feature can be disabled by setting the SGE_SINGLE_LINE
environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Unless denoted otherwise, the following options and the
corresponding operations are available to all users with a

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Rattr obj_spec fname
obj_instance,... <br>
&lt;replace object attribs&gt; <br>
Similar to -rattr (see below) but the definition of the list
attributes whose content is to be replaced is contained in
the file named fname. As opposed to -rattr, multi&acirc;
<br>
ple attributes can be modified. Their specification has to
be listed in fname following the file format of the
corresponding object (see queue_conf(5) for the queue, for
<br>
example). <br>
Requires root/manager privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-aattr obj_spec attr_name val
obj_instance,... <br>
&lt;add to object attributes&gt; <br>
Allows adding specifications to a single configuration list
attribute in multiple instances of an object with a single
command. Currently supported object types are <br>
queues, hosts, host groups, parallel environments, resource
quota sets, users, projects, calendars, and checkpointing
interface configurations, specified respectively as <br>
queue, exechost, hostgroup, pe, resource_quota, user,
project, calender, userset, or ckpt in obj_spec. For the
obj_spec queue the obj_instance can be a cluster queue <br>
name, a queue domain name or a queue instance name. Find
more information concerning different queue names in
sge_types(5). Depending on the type of the obj_instance,
<br>
this adds to the cluster queues attribute sublist the
cluster queue&rsquo;s implicit default configuration value
or the queue domain configuration value or queue instance
con&acirc; <br>
figuration value. The queue load_thresholds parameter is an
example of a list attribute. With the -aattr option, entries
can be added to such lists, while they can be <br>
deleted with -dattr, modified with -mattr, and replaced with
-rattr. <br>
For the obj_spec rqs the obj_instance is a unique identifier
for a specific rule. The identifier consists of a rule-set
name and either the number of the rule in the list, <br>
or the name of the rule, separated by a &quot;/&quot;. <br>
The name of the configuration attribute to be enhanced is
specified with attr_name followed by val as a name=value
pair. The space-separated list of object instances <br>
(e.g., the list of queues) to which the changes have to be
applied are specified at the end of the command. <br>
The following restriction applies: For the exechost object
the load_values attribute cannot be modified (see
host_conf(5)). <br>
Requires root or manager privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-acal calendar_name &lt;add
calendar&gt; <br>
Adds a new calendar definition to the Grid Engine
environment. Calendars are used in Grid Engine for defining
availability and unavailability schedules of queues. The
<br>
format of a calendar definition is described in
calendar_conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the calendar name given in
the option argument, qconf will open a temporary file and
start up the text editor indicated by the environment
variable EDITOR (default <br>
vi(1) if EDITOR is not set). After entering the calendar
definition and closing the editor the new calendar is
checked and registered with sge_qmaster(8). Requires <br>
root/manager privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ackpt ckpt_name &lt;add
checkpointing environment&gt; <br>
Adds a checkpointing environment under the name ckpt_name to
the list of checkpointing environments maintained by Grid
Engine and to be usable to submit checkpointing jobs <br>
(see checkpoint(5) for details on the format of a
checkpointing environment definition). Qconf retrieves a
default checkpointing environment configuration and executes
<br>
vi(1) (or $EDITOR if the EDITOR environment variable is set)
to allow you to customize the checkpointing environment
configuration. Upon exit from the editor, the check&acirc;
<br>
pointing environment is registered with sge_qmaster(8).
Requires root/manager privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-aconf host,... &lt;add
configuration&gt; <br>
Successively adds configurations (see sge_conf(5)) For the
hosts in the comma-separated host list. For each host, an
editor ($EDITOR, if defined, or vi(1)) is invoked and <br>
the configuration for the host can be entered. The
configuration is registered with sge_qmaster(8) after saving
the file and quitting the editor. <br>
Requires root or manager privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ae [host_template] &lt;add
execution host&gt; <br>
Adds a host to the list of Grid Engine execution hosts. If a
queue is configured on a host this host is automatically
added to the Grid Engine execution host list. Adding <br>
execution hosts explicitly offers the advantage to be able
to specify parameters like load scale values with the
registration of the execution host. However, these
parame&acirc; <br>
ters can be modified (from their defaults) at any later time
via the -me option described below. <br>
If the host_template argument is present, qconf retrieves
the configuration of the specified execution host from
sge_qmaster(8) or a generic template otherwise. The
tem&acirc; <br>
plate is then stored in a file and qconf executes vi(1) (or
the editor indicated by $EDITOR if the EDITOR environment
variable is set) to change the entries in the file. <br>
The format of the execution host specification is described
in host_conf(5). When the changes are saved in the editor
and the editor is quit the new execution host is <br>
registered with sge_qmaster(8). Requires root/manager
privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ah hostname,... &lt;add
administrative host&gt; <br>
Adds hosts hostname to the Grid Engine trusted host list (a
host must be in this list to execute administrative Grid
Engine commands, the sole exception to this being the <br>
execution of qconf on the sge_qmaster(8) node). The default
Grid Engine installation procedures usually add all
designated execution hosts (see the -ae option above) to
<br>
the Grid Engine trusted host list automatically. Requires
root or manager privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ahgrp group &lt;add host group
configuration&gt; <br>
Adds a new host group with the name specified in group. This
command invokes an editor (either vi(1) or the editor
indicated by the EDITOR environment variable). The new <br>
host group entry is registered after changing the entry and
exiting the editor. Requires root or manager privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-arqs [rqs_name] &lt;add new
RQS&gt; <br>
Adds one or more Resource Quota Set (RQS) description under
the names rqs_name to the list of RQSs maintained by Grid
Engine. (See sge_resource_quota(5) for details on the <br>
format of an RQS definition.) Qconf retrieves a default RQS
configuration and executes vi(1) (or $EDITOR if the EDITOR
environment variable is set) to allow you to cus&acirc; <br>
tomize the RQS configuration. Upon exit from the editor, the
RQS is registered with sge_qmaster(8). Requires root or
manager privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-am user,... &lt;add
managers&gt; <br>
Adds the indicated users to the Grid Engine manager list.
Requires root or manager privileges. <br>
Managers have full access to the Grid Engine configuration
and operational features. Superusers on administration hosts
have manager privileges by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ao user,... &lt;add
operators&gt; <br>
Adds the indicated users to the Grid Engine operator list.
Requires root or manager privileges. <br>
Operators have the same privileges as managers except that
they cannot make configuration changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ap pe_name &lt;add new PE&gt;
<br>
Adds a Parallel Environment (PE) description under the name
pe_name to the list of PEs maintained by Grid Engine and to
be usable to submit parallel jobs (see sge_pe(5) <br>
for details on the format of a PE definition). Qconf
retrieves a default PE configuration and executes vi(1) (or
$EDITOR if the EDITOR environment variable is set) to <br>
allow you to customize the PE configuration. Upon exit from
the editor, the PE is registered with sge_qmaster(8).
Requires root/manager privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-at thread_name &lt;activates
thread in master&gt; <br>
Activates an additional thread in the master process.
thread_name can be either &quot;scheduler&quot; or
&quot;jvm&quot;. The corresponding thread is only started
when it is not already run&acirc; <br>
ning. There may be only one scheduler and only one JVM
thread in the master process at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-aprj &lt;add new project&gt;
<br>
Adds a project description to the list of registered
projects (see project(5)). Qconf retrieves a template
project configuration and executes vi(1) (or $EDITOR if the
<br>
EDITOR environment variable is set) to allow you to
customize the new project. Upon exit from the editor, the
template is registered with sge_qmaster(8). Requires root or
<br>
manager privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-aq [queue_name] &lt;add new
queue&gt; <br>
Qconf retrieves the default queue configuration (see
queue_conf(5)) and executes vi(1) (or $EDITOR if the EDITOR
environment variable is set) to allow you to customize the
<br>
queue configuration. Upon exit from the editor, the queue is
registered with sge_qmaster(8). A minimal configuration
requires only that the queue name and queue hostlist <br>
be set. Requires root or manager privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-as hostname,... &lt;add submit
hosts&gt; <br>
Add hosts hostname to the list of hosts allowed to submit
Grid Engine jobs and control their behavior only. Requires
root or manager privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-astnode node_path=shares,...
&lt;add share tree node&gt; <br>
Adds the specified share tree node(s) to the share tree (see
share_tree(5)). The node_path is a hierarchical path
([/]node_name[[/.]node_name...]) specifying the loca&acirc;
<br>
tion of the new node in the share tree. The base name of the
node_path is the name of the new node. The node is
initialized to the number of specified shares. Requires <br>
root or manager privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-astree &lt;add share tree&gt;
<br>
Adds the definition of a share tree to the system (see
share_tree(5)). A template share tree is retrieved and an
editor (either vi(1) or the editor indicated by $EDITOR)
<br>
is invoked for modifying the share tree definition. Upon
exiting the editor, the modification is registered with
sge_qmaster(8). Requires root or manager privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Astree fname &lt;add share
tree&gt; <br>
Adds the definition of a share tree to the system (see

Adds users to Grid Engine user access lists (ACLs). User
lists are used for queue usage authentication. Requires
root/manager/operator privileges. <br>
Users can submit jobs and run them if they have access to a
submit host and and execution host, but cannot affect the
Grid Engine configuration or operation (other than <br>
altering or deleting their own jobs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Auser fname &lt;add user&gt;
<br>
Add the user defined in fname to the Grid Engine cluster.

termination of the scheduler thread. Shutdown of running
sge_execd(8) processes currently registered is initiated by
the -ke option. If -kej is specified instead, all <br>
jobs running on the execution hosts are aborted prior to
termination of the corresponding sge_execd(8). The
comma-separated host list specifies the execution hosts to
be <br>
addressed by the -ke and -kej option. If the keyword all is
specified instead of a host list, all running sge_execd(8)
processes are shutdown. Job abortion, initiated by <br>
the -kej option will result in dr state for all running jobs
until sge_execd(8) is running again. <br>
Requires root or manager privileges.</p>

This operation only works on a single queue instance or
domain. It cannot be used on a cluster queue. In the case
where the obj_spec is &quot;queue@@hostgroup&quot;, the
attribute <br>
values defined in attr_nm which are set for the indicated
hostgroup are deleted, but not those which are set for the
hosts contained by that hostgroup. If the attr_nm is <br>
&rsquo;*&rsquo;, all attribute values set for the given
queue instance or domain are deleted. <br>
