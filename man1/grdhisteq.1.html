<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
grdhisteq - Perform histogram equalization for a grid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
grdhisteq in_grdfile [ -Gout_grdfile ] [ -Cn_cells ] [
-D[file] ] [ -N[norm] ] [ -Q ] <br>
-Rregion <br>
-V[level]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: No space is allowed
between the option flag and the associated arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
grdhisteq allows the user to find the data values which
divide a given grid file into patches of equal area. One
common use of grdhisteq is in a kind of histogram
equalization of <br>
an image. In this application, the user might have a grid of
flat topography with a mountain in the middle. Ordinary gray
shading of this file (using grdimage or grdview) with a <br>
linear mapping from topography to graytone will result in
most of the image being very dark gray, with the mountain
being almost white. One could use grdhisteq to write to
stdout <br>
or file an ASCII list of those data values which divide the
range of the data into n_cells segments, each of which has
an equal area in the image. Using awk or makecpt one can
<br>
take this output and build a CPT; using the CPT with
grdimage will result in an image with all levels of gray
occurring equally. Alternatively, see grd2cpt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second common use of
grdhisteq is in writing a grid with statistics based on some
kind of cumulative distribution function. In this
application, the output has relative highs <br>
and lows in the same (x,y) locations as the input file, but
the values are changed to reflect their place in some
cumulative distribution. One example would be to find the
lowest <br>
10% of the data: Take a grid, run grdhisteq and make a grid
using n_cells = 10, and then contour the result to trace the
1 contour. This will enclose the lowest 10% of the data,
<br>
regardless of their original values. Another example is in
equalizing the output of grdgradient. For shading purposes
it is desired that the data have a smooth distribution, such
<br>
as a Gaussian. If you run grdhisteq on output from
grdgradient and make a grid file output with the Gaussian
option, you will have a grid whose values are distributed
according <br>
to a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance.
The locations of these values will correspond to the
locations of the input; that is, the most negative output
value <br>
will be in the (x,y) location of the most negative input
value, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIRED ARGUMENTS <br>
in_grdfile <br>
2-D grid file to be equalized. (See GRID FILE FORMATS
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS <br>
-Cn_cells <br>
Sets how many cells (or divisions) of data range to make
[16].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Dump level information to
file, or standard output if no file is provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Gout_grdfile <br>
Name of output 2-D grid file. Used with -N only. (See GRID
FILE FORMATS below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N[norm] <br>
Gaussian output. Use with -G to make an output grid with
standard normal scores. Append norm to force the scores to
fall in the &lt;-1,+1&gt; range [Default is standard normal
<br>
scores].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Quadratic output. Selects
quadratic histogram equalization. [Default is linear].</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Rxmin/xmax/ymin/ymax[+r][+uunit]
(more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Specify the region of interest. Using the -R option will
select a subsection of in_grdfile grid. If this subsection
exceeds the boundaries of the grid, only the common <br>
region will be extracted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V[level] (more &acirc;&brvbar;)
<br>
Select verbosity level [c].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-^ or just - <br>
Print a short message about the syntax of the command, then
exits (NOTE: on Windows just use -).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+ or just + <br>
Print an extensive usage (help) message, including the
explanation of any module-specific option (but not the GMT
common options), then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? or no arguments <br>
Print a complete usage (help) message, including the
explanation of all options, then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRID FILE FORMATS <br>
By default GMT writes out grid as single precision floats in
a COARDS-complaint netCDF file format. However, GMT is able
to produce grid files in many other commonly used grid <br>
file formats and also facilitates so called
&acirc;packing&acirc; of grids, writing out floating point
data as 1- or 2-byte integers. (more &acirc;&brvbar;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To find the height intervals that divide the file heights.nc
into 16 divisions of equal area:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt grdhisteq heights.nc -C16 -D
&gt; levels.d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make the poorly distributed
intensities in the file raw_intens.nc suitable for use with
grdimage or grdview, run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt grdhisteq raw_intens.nc
-Gsmooth_intens.nc -N -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
1. For geographical grids we do a weighted histogram
equalization since the area of each node varies with
latitude.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If you use grdhisteq to make
a Gaussian output for gradient shading in grdimage or
grdview, you should be aware of the following: the output
will be in the range [-x, x], <br>
where x is based on the number of data in the input grid (nx
* ny) and the cumulative Gaussian distribution function
F(x). That is, let N = nx * ny. Then x will be adjusted so
<br>
that F(x) = (N - 1 + 0.5)/N. Since about 68% of the values
from a standard normal distribution fall within +/- 1, this
will be true of the output grid. But if N is very large,
<br>
it is possible for x to be greater than 4. Therefore, with
the grdview program clipping gradients to the range [-1, 1],
you will get correct shading of 68% of your data, while <br>
16% of them will be clipped to -1 and 16% of them clipped to
+1. If this makes too much of the image too light or too
dark, you should take the output of grdhisteq and rescale
<br>
it using grdmath and multiplying by something less than 1.0,
to shrink the range of the values, thus bringing more than
68% of the image into the range [-1, 1]. Alternatively, <br>
supply a normalization factor with -N.</p>
