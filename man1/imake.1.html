<p>IMAKE(1) General Commands Manual IMAKE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
imake - C preprocessor interface to the make utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
imake [ -Ddefine ] [ -Idir ] [ -Udefine ] [ -Ttemplate ] [
-f filename ] [ -C filename ] [ -s filename ] [ -e ] [ -v
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Imake is used to generate Makefiles from a template, a set
of cpp macro functions, and a per-directory input file
called an Imakefile. This allows machine dependencies (such
as <br>
compiler options, alternate command names, and special make
rules) to be kept separate from the descriptions of the
various items to be built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following command line options may be passed to
imake:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ddefine <br>
This option is passed directly to cpp. It is typically used
to set directory-specific variables. For example, the X
Window System used this flag to set TOPDIR to the <br>
name of the directory containing the top of the core
distribution and CURDIR to the name of the current
directory, relative to the top.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Idirectory <br>
This option is passed directly to cpp. It is typically used
to indicate the directory in which the imake template and
configuration files may be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Udefine <br>
This option is passed directly to cpp. It is typically used
to unset variables when debugging imake configuration
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ttemplate <br>
This option specifies the name of the master template file
(which is usually located in the directory specified with
-I) used by cpp. The default is Imake.tmpl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filename <br>
This option specifies the name of the per-directory input
file. The default is Imakefile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C filename <br>
This option specifies the name of the .c file that is
constructed in the current directory. The default is
Imakefile.c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s filename <br>
This option specifies the name of the make description file
to be generated but make should not be invoked. If the
filename is a dash (-), the output is written to std&acirc;
<br>
out. The default is to generate, but not execute, a
Makefile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e This option indicates the
imake should execute the generated Makefile. The default is
to leave this to the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v This option indicates that
imake should print the cpp command line that it is using to
generate the Makefile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW IT WORKS <br>
Imake invokes cpp with any -I or -D flags passed on the
command line and passes the name of a file containing the
following 3 lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define IMAKE_TEMPLATE
&quot;Imake.tmpl&quot; <br>
#define INCLUDE_IMAKEFILE &lt;Imakefile&gt; <br>
#include IMAKE_TEMPLATE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where Imake.tmpl and Imakefile
may be overridden by the -T and -f command options,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The IMAKE_TEMPLATE typically
reads in a file containing machine-dependent parameters
(specified as cpp symbols), a site-specific parameters file,
a file defining variables, a <br>
file containing cpp macro functions for generating make
rules, and finally the Imakefile (specified by
INCLUDE_IMAKEFILE) in the current directory. The Imakefile
uses the macro <br>
functions to indicate what targets should be built; imake
takes care of generating the appropriate rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Imake configuration files
contain two types of variables, imake variables and make
variables. The imake variables are interpreted by cpp when
imake is run. By convention they <br>
are mixed case. The make variables are written into the
Makefile for later interpretation by make. By convention
make variables are upper case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rules file (usually named
Imake.rules in the configuration directory) contains a
variety of cpp macro functions that are configured according
to the current platform. Imake <br>
replaces any occurrences of the string
&lsquo;&lsquo;@@&rsquo;&rsquo; with a newline to allow
macros that generate more than one line of make rules. For
example, the macro</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define program_target(program,
objlist) @@ program: objlist @@ $(CC) -o $@ objlist
$(LDFLAGS)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">when called with
program_target(foo, foo1.o foo2.o) will expand to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foo: foo1.o foo2.o <br>
$(CC) -o $@ foo1.o foo2.o $(LDFLAGS)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Imake also replaces any
occurrences of the word &lsquo;&lsquo;XCOMM&rsquo;&rsquo;
with the character &lsquo;&lsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo; to permit
placing comments in the Makefile without causing
&lsquo;&lsquo;invalid directive&rsquo;&rsquo; errors from
<br>
the preprocessor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some complex imake macros
require generated make variables local to each invocation of
the macro, often because their value depends on parameters
passed to the macro. Such vari&acirc; <br>
ables can be created by using an imake variable of the form
XVARdefn, where n is a single digit. A unique make variable
will be substituted. Later occurrences of the variable <br>
XVARusen will be replaced by the variable created by the
corresponding XVARdefn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems whose cpp reduces
multiple tabs and spaces to a single space, imake attempts
to put back any necessary tabs (make is very picky about the
difference between tabs and <br>
spaces). For this reason, colons (:) in command lines must
be preceded by a backslash (.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USE WITH THE X WINDOW SYSTEM
<br>
The X Window System used imake extensively up through the
X11R6.9 release, for both full builds within the source tree
and external software. X has since moved to GNU autoconf
<br>
and automake for its build system in X11R7.0 and later
releases, but still maintains imake for building existing
external software programs that have not yet converted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As mentioned above, two special
variables, TOPDIR and CURDIR, are set to make referencing
files using relative path names easier. For example, the
following command is generated <br>
automatically to build the Makefile in the directory lib/X/
(relative to the top of the sources):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% ../.././config/imake
-I../.././config -DTOPDIR=../../. -DCURDIR=./lib/X</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When building X programs outside
the source tree, a special symbol UseInstalled is defined
and TOPDIR and CURDIR are omitted. If the configuration
files have been properly <br>
installed, the script xmkmf(1) may be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
Here is a summary of the files read by imake as used by X.
The indentation shows what files include what other
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Imake.tmpl generic variables
<br>
site.def site-specific, BeforeVendorCF defined <br>
*.cf machine-specific <br>
*Lib.rules shared library rules <br>
site.def site-specific, AfterVendorCF defined <br>
Imake.rules rules <br>
Project.tmpl X-specific variables <br>
*Lib.tmpl shared library variables <br>
Imakefile <br>
Library.tmpl library rules <br>
Server.tmpl server rules <br>
Threads.tmpl multi-threaded rules</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that site.def gets included
twice, once before the *.cf file and once after. Although
most site customizations should be specified after the *.cf
file, some, such as the <br>
choice of compiler, need to be specified before, because
other variable settings may depend on them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first time site.def is
included, the variable BeforeVendorCF is defined, and the
second time, the variable AfterVendorCF is defined. All code
in site.def should be inside an <br>
#ifdef for one of these symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Imakefile.c temporary input file for cpp <br>
/tmp/Imf.XXXXXX temporary Makefile for -s <br>
/tmp/IIf.XXXXXX temporary Imakefile if specified Imakefile
uses # comments <br>
/usr/bin/cpp default C preprocessor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables may be set, however
their use is not recommended as they introduce dependencies
that are not readily apparent when imake is run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMAKEINCLUDE <br>
If defined, this specifies a &lsquo;&lsquo;-I&rsquo;&rsquo;
include argument to pass to the C preprocessor. E.g.,
&lsquo;&lsquo;-I/usr/X11/config&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMAKECPP <br>
If defined, this should be a valid path to a preprocessor
program. E.g., &lsquo;&lsquo;/usr/local/cpp&rsquo;&rsquo;.
By default, imake will use cc -E or /usr/bin/cpp, depending
on the OS specific <br>
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMAKEMAKE <br>
If defined, this should be a valid path to a make program,
such as &lsquo;&lsquo;/usr/local/make&rsquo;&rsquo;. By
default, imake will use whatever make program is found using
execvp(3). This <br>
variable is only used if the &lsquo;&lsquo;-e&rsquo;&rsquo;
option is specified.</p>
