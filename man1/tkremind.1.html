<p>TKREMIND(1) General Commands Manual TKREMIND(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tkremind - graphical front-end to Remind calendar
program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tkremind [options] [read_file] [write_file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
TkRemind is a graphical front-end to the Remind program. It
provides a friendly graphical interface which allows you to
view your calendar and add reminders without learning the
<br>
syntax of Remind. Although not all of Remind&rsquo;s
features are available with TkRemind, TkRemind gives you an
opportunity to edit the reminder commands which it creates.
This <br>
allows you to learn Remind&rsquo;s syntax and then add extra
features as you become a more sophisticated Remind
programmer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TkRemind is written in Tcl, and
requires version 8.0 (or higher). It also requires a wish
binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
TkRemind itself has no options. However, it passes certain
options on to Remind. The options it passes are -b, -g, -x,
-i and -m. See the Remind man page for details about the
<br>
options. Note that TkRemind will respect the -m and -b1
options and adjust its appearance accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Read_file is the file from which
TkRemind reads reminders. It is in standard Remind format.
Write_file is the file to which TkRemind writes reminders
which you add using the <br>
GUI. If Read_file is omitted, it defaults to
$HOME/.reminders. If Write_file is omitted, it defaults to
Read_file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may wish to have a different
Write_file from Read_file if you want to collect all of
TkRemind&rsquo;s reminders in one place. Suppose your main
file is $HOME/.reminders and you <br>
want TkRemind to put its reminders in $HOME/.tkreminders. In
$HOME/.reminders, include the line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INCLUDE
[getenv(&quot;HOME&quot;)]/.tkreminders</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE CALENDAR WINDOW <br>
When you start TkRemind, it displays a calendar for the
current month, with today&rsquo;s date highlighted.
Reminders are filled into each box on the calendar. If a box
contains many <br>
reminders, you can scroll it up and down by dragging mouse
button 2 in the box. Note that there is no specific
indication of an over-full box; you&rsquo;ll just have to
notice that <br>
the box appears completely full.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAVIGATING <br>
To change to the previous or next month, click the &lt;- or
-&gt; button, respectively. To change back to the current
month, click Today. To go to a specific month, click Go To
<br>
Date.... This pops up a dialog box which allows you to
select a month and enter a year. Once you&rsquo;ve done
this, click Go to go to the date, or Cancel to cancel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To exit TkRemind, click
Quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADDING REMINDERS <br>
To add a reminder, click button 1 in any day number in the
calendar. The Add Reminder... dialog will pop up, with
values preselected for the day you clicked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dialog has six basic groups
of controls. The first three lines select one of three types
of reminders. Choose the type of reminder with the radio
buttons, and choose the <br>
values of the days, months, and years by selecting values
from pull-down menus. The pull-down menus appear when you
click the raised value buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next control specifies an
expiry date for the reminder. Select the check button to
enable an expiry date, and fill in the values using
pull-down menus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third control specifies how
much advance notice you want (if any), and whether or not
weekends and holidays are counted when computing advance
notice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fourth control specifies
which days Remind considers as part of the weekend. This can
affect the interpretation of &quot;weekday&quot; in the
second and third types of reminders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fifth control associates a
time with the reminder. You can also specify advance notice,
possibly repeating.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sixth control specifies what
Remind should do if a reminder falls on a holiday or
weekend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enter the body of the reminder
into the Body: text entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To add the reminder to the
reminder file, click Add to reminder file. To close the
dialog without adding the reminder to the file, click
Cancel. To preview the reminder, click <br>
Preview reminder. This pops up the Preview reminder dialog
box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREVIEWING REMINDERS <br>
The Preview reminder dialog box is an excellent way to learn
Remind. It displays the Remind command which realizes the
reminder you entered using the Add Reminder... dialog. <br>
You can edit the reminder, thereby gaining access to
advanced features of Remind. You can also use it simply to
play around and discover Remind&rsquo;s idioms for
expressing different <br>
types of reminders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRINTING <br>
To print the current month&rsquo;s calender, click Print...
on the main calendar window. This brings up the print
dialog. Printing either produces a PostScript file or sends
Post&acirc; <br>
Script to a UNIX command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select the print destination by
choosing either To file: or To command: in the print dialog.
Press Browse... to bring up a file browser. In the file
browser, you can enter a <br>
filename in the text entry, double-click on a filename in
the listbox, or double-click on a directory to navigate the
file system. You can also type the first few characters of
<br>
a file name in the text entry box and press space to
complete the name to the first matching entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Match: box contains a
filename wildcard which filters files in the listbox. You
can change the filter and press enter to rescan the
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select the appropriate paper
size and orientation. Activate Fill page if you want the
calendar to fill the page. This should be the normal case
unless you have many reminders <br>
in a particular day. (See the Rem2PS documentation.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, click Print to print or
Cancel to cancel. Note that during printing, Remind is not
called with the -itkremind=1 option, because it is operated
in normal PostScript-pro&acirc; <br>
ducing mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EDITING REMINDERS <br>
If you created a reminder with TkRemind, it will turn red as
the mouse cursor passes over it in the calendar window.
Click button-1 over the reminder and you will be presented
<br>
with a dialog window whose state is identical to the one
used to create the reminder. At this point, you can change
the reminder by editing the dialog entries and selecting
<br>
Replace reminder. You can delete the reminder entirely by
selecting Delete reminder. The remaining buttons, Preview
reminder and Cancel operate identically to the dialog in
<br>
&quot;ADDING REMINDERS.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if you edit a reminder
(using Preview reminder), any edits you made are not
retained in the dialog box. You should not attempt to edit
such reminders; you have to <br>
retype them in the Preview reminder dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the reminder was not created
with TkRemind, you can&rsquo;t edit it with TkRemind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING A TEXT EDITOR <br>
If you have set the &quot;text editor&quot; option
correctly, right-clicking on a reminder will bring up a text
editor on the file containing the reminder. The cursor will
be positioned <br>
on the line that generated the reminder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BACKGROUND REMINDERS <br>
If you create &quot;timed&quot; reminders, TkRemind will
queue them in the background and pop up boxes as they are
triggered. Additionally, if you created the reminder using
TkRemind, you <br>
will be given the option of &quot;turning off&quot; the
reminder for the rest of the day. TkRemind achieves queueing
of background reminders by running Remind in server mode,
described <br>
later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The final button on the calendar window, Options, lets you
configure certain aspects of TkRemind. The configuration
options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Start up Iconified <br>
If this is selected, TkRemind starts up iconified.
Otherwise, it starts up in a normal window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show Today&rsquo;s Reminders on
Startup <br>
If this is selected, TkRemind shows a text window containing
reminders which would be issued by &quot;remind -q -a
-r&quot; on startup, and when the date changes at
midnight.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Confirm Quit <br>
If this is selected, you will be asked to confirm when you
press Quit. If not, TkRemind quits without prompting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatically close pop-up
reminders after a minute <br>
If this is selected, pop-up reminder boxes will be closed
after one minute has elapsed. Otherwise, they remain on your
screen forever until you explicitly dismiss them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beep terminal when popping up a
reminder <br>
If selected, TkRemind beeps the terminal bell when a queued
reminder pops up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deiconify calendar window when
popping up a reminder <br>
If selected, does what it says.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run command when popping up a
reminder <br>
If this entry is not blank, the specified command is run
whenever a background reminder pops up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Feed popped-up reminder to
command&rsquo;s standard input <br>
If selected, feeds the text of the reminder to the command
described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E-mail reminders here if popup
not dismissed <br>
If you enter a non-blank e-mail address in this field, then
TkRemind will e-mail you a reminder if you don&rsquo;t
dismiss the popup box within one minute. This is useful if
<br>
you need to leave your terminal but want your reminders to
&quot;follow&quot; you via e-mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name or IP address of SMTP
server <br>
TkRemind uses a direct SMTP connection to send mail. Enter
the IP address of your SMTP server here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text Editor <br>
This specifies a text editor to invoke when a reminder is
right-clicked. The characters &quot;%d&quot; are replaced
with the lined number of the file containing the reminder,
and <br>
&quot;%s&quot; are replaced with the file name. Useful
strings might be &quot;emacs +%d %s&quot; or &quot;gvim +%d
%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you&rsquo;ve configured the
options the way you like them, press Apply Options to put
them into effect, Save Options to put them into effect and
save them in $HOME/.tkremindrc, or <br>
Cancel to cancel any changes you made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS <br>
TkRemind&rsquo;s main window includes the following keyboard
shortcuts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-Q Quit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Left Arrow <br>
Previous Month</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Right Arrow <br>
Next Month</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Home Today</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ODDS AND ENDS <br>
TkRemind performs some basic consistency checks when you add
or preview a reminder. However, if you edit a reminder in
the previewer, TkRemind does not check the edited <br>
reminder. You can produce illegal reminders which may cause
problems. (This is one good reason to isolate
TkRemind&rsquo;s reminders in a separate file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TkRemind does not check the body
of the reminder in any way. You can use the normal Remind
substitution sequences in the body. Furthermore, if you use
expression-pasting in the <br>
body, TkRemind does not validate the expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When TkRemind invokes Remind, it
supplies the option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-itkremind=1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">on the command line. So, in your
Remind file, you can include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IF defined(&quot;tkremind&quot;)
<br>
# Then I&rsquo;m probably being invoked by TkRemind <br>
ENDIF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use this to activate
certain reminders in different ways for TkRemind (for
example).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TkRemind uses tags to keep track
of reminders in the script file. It also places special
comments in the reminder file to store additional state. You
can certainly mix &quot;hand- <br>
crafted&quot; reminders with reminders created by TkRemind
if you are aware of the following rules and limitations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o TkRemind uses TAGs of the form
TKTAGnnn where nnn is a number. You should not use such TAGs
in hand-crafted reminders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Do not edit lines starting
with &quot;# TKTAGnnn&quot;, &quot;# TKEND&quot;, or any
lines in between. You can move such lines, but be careful to
move them as a single block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Hand-crafted reminders cannot
be edited with TkRemind, and for hand-crafted timed
reminders, you will not be presented with the
&quot;Don&rsquo;t remind me again&quot; option when they
<br>
pop up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SERVER MODE <br>
Remind has a special mode for interacting with programs like
TkRemind. This mode is called server mode and is selected by
supplying the -z0 option to Remind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In server mode, Remind operates
similar to daemon mode, except it reads commands (one per
line) from standard input and writes status lines to
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The commands accepted in server
mode are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT Terminate the Remind
process. EOF on standard input does the same thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATUS Return the number of
queued reminders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REREAD Re-read the reminder
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The status lines written are as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE reminder time tag <br>
Signifies the beginning of a timed reminder whose trigger
time is time with tag tag. If the reminder has no tag, an
asterisk is supplied for tag. All lines following <br>
this line are the body of the reminder, until the line NOTE
endreminder is transmitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE newdate <br>
This line is emitted whenever Remind has detected a rollover
of the system date. The front-end program should redraw its
calendar or take whatever other action is needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE reread <br>
This line is emitted whenever the number of reminders in
Remind&rsquo;s queue changes because of a date rollover or a
REREAD command. The front-end should issue a STATUS
com&acirc; <br>
mand in response to this message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE queued n <br>
This line is emitted in response to a STATUS command. The
number n is the number of reminders in the queue.</p>
