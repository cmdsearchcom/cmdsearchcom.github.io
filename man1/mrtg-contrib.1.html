mrtg-contrib - Contribution Guidelines for MRTG
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
If you have written an extension to mrtg or created a bug fix, please consider
  contributing it to the project. As I get quite a number of contributions every
  week, here are a few guidelines which explain how to contribute so that I can
  use the contribution without too much additional work.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Translations"><a class="selflink" href="#Translations">Translations</a></h2>
MRTG messages have been translated to a number of languages but there are still
  many which have not been covered yet. If you want to add yours, go into the
  <i>mrtg-2.17.4/translate</i> directory and follow the instructions given in
  the <i>README</i> file.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Patches"><a class="selflink" href="#Patches">Patches</a></h2>
When you have created your modification or extension to mrtg and want to submit
  it to me, please crate a patch for the files which you have modified. Do not
  send entire files unless they are new.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To create a patch, get hold of a copy of GNU diff (Many Unix systems will have
  this installed already. In the NT world you might want to get
  http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/ to get all the nice GNU tools available.)
  and type
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 diff --unified --ignore-space-change old-file new-file &gt; simple.patch
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or if you have modified several files do
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 diff --recursive --unified --ignore-space-change old-dir/ new-dir/ &gt;long.patch
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Documentation"><a class="selflink" href="#Documentation">Documentation</a></h2>
All documentation of mrtg is done with the perl <b>POD</b> system. If you want
  to learn about it, type
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 perldoc perlpod
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and read the instructions. If you have bugfixes or additions to the existing
  documents, make sure you modify the <b>POD</b> files and not the html or txt
  versions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
I take documentation very seriously. Whenever you create a new feature for mrtg
  which you want to get included in the official release, your patch must also
  contain modifications for the relevant <b>pod</b> file in the <i>doc</i> tree
  or for the documentation sections of <i>cfgmaker</i> and <i>indexmaker</i>.
