<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <b>tack</b> program has three purposes: (1) to help you build a new terminfo
  entry describing an unknown terminal, (2) to test the correctness of an
  existing entry, and (3) to develop the correct pad timings needed to ensure
  that screen updates don't fall behind the incoming data stream.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Tack</b> presents a series of screen-painting and interactive tests in ways
  which are intended to make any mismatches between the terminfo entry and
  reality visually obvious. <b>Tack</b> also provides tools that can help in
  understanding how the terminal operates.

Since <b>tack</b> is designed to test terminfo's it is not possible to rely on
  the correctness of the terminfo data base. Because of this the menuing system
  used with <b>tack</b> is vary primitive. When a menu is printed it will scroll
  the entire screen. To compensate for this verbose menu system <b>tack</b>
  permits menu selection type ahead. If you already know what action you would
  like <b>tack</b> to perform then you can enter that value immediately and
  avoid the menu display. When in doubt the question mark (?) is a good
  character to type. A carriage return will execute the default action. These
  default actions are designed to run all the standard tests.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When <b>tack</b> first comes up it will display some basic information about the
  terminal. Take some time to verify this information. If it is wrong many of
  the subsequent tests will fail. The most important item is the screen size. If
  the screen size is wrong there is no point in proceeding. (home) and (clear)
  are also critical to the success of subsequent tests. The values of (cr) (ind)
  (cub1) and (ht) may effect the tests if they are defined incorrectly. If they
  are undefined <b>tack</b> will set them to reasonable defaults. The last two
  entries on the display are the enquire and acknowledge strings. These strings
  are taken from the user strings (u9) and (u8).
<div class="Pp"></div>
By now you must be wondering why the terminfo names are enclosed in parenthesis.
  This has no profound meaning other than it makes them stand out. The
  <b>tack</b> program uses this convention any time it displays a terminfo name.
  Remember <b>tack</b> is designed to rely on as little of the terminfo entry as
  possible.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CREATING_NEW_ENTRIES"><a class="selflink" href="#CREATING_NEW_ENTRIES">CREATING
  NEW ENTRIES</a></h1>
<b>Tack</b> has a number of tools that are designed to help gather information
  about the terminal. Although these functions are not dependent on terminal
  type, you may wish to execute <b>tack</b> with options <i>-it</i>. This will
  turn off initialization and default the standard entries.
<div class="Pp"></div>
These tools may be reached from the main menu by selecting the 'tools' entry.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Echo tool</b>: All data typed from the keyboard will be echoed back to the
  terminal. Control characters are not translated to the up arrow format but are
  sent as control characters. This allows you to test an escape sequence and see
  what it actually does. You may also elect to <b>enable hex output on echo
  tool</b> this will echo the characters in hexadecimal. Once the test is
  running you may enter the 'lines' or 'columns' keywords which will display a
  pattern that will help you determine your screen size. A complete list of
  keywords will be displayed when the test starts. Type 'help' to redisplay the
  list of available commands.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Reply tool</b>: This tool acts much like the echo tool, but control
  characters that are sent from the terminal more than one character after a
  carriage return will be expanded to the up arrow format. For example on a
  standard ANSI terminal you may type:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
		CR ESC [ c
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
and the response will be echoed as something like:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
		^[ [ ? 6 c
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ANSI sgr display</b>: This test assumes you have an ANSI terminal. It goes
  through attribute numbers 0 to 79, displaying each in turn and using that SGR
  number to write the text. This shows you which of the SGR modes are actually
  implemented by the terminal. Note: some terminals (such as Tektronix color)
  use the private use characters to augment the functionality of the SGR
  command. These private use characters may be interjected into the escape
  sequence by typing the character ( &lt;, =, &gt;, ? ) after the original
  display has been shown.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ANSI status reports</b>: This test queries the terminal in standard
  ANSI/VT-100 fashion. The results of this test may help determine what options
  are supported by your terminal.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ANSI character sets</b>: This test displays the character sets available on a
  ANSI/VT-100 style terminal. Character sets on a real VT-100 terminal are
  usually defined with smacs=\E(0 and rmacs=\E(B. The first character after the
  escape defines the font bank. The second character defines the character set.
  This test allows you to view any of the possible combinations. Private use
  character sets are defined by the digits. Standard character sets are located
  in the alphabetic range.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="VERIFYING_AN_EXISTING_ENTRY"><a class="selflink" href="#VERIFYING_AN_EXISTING_ENTRY">VERIFYING
  AN EXISTING ENTRY</a></h1>
You can verify the correctness of an entry with the `begin testing' function.
  This entry is the default action and will be chosen if you hit carriage return
  (or enter). This will bring up a secondary menu that allows you to select more
  specific tests.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The general philosophy of the program is, for each capability, to send an
  appropriate test pattern to the terminal then send a description of what the
  user should expect. Occasionally (as when checking function-key capabilities)
  the program will ask you to enter input for it to check.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the test fails then you have the option of dynamically changing the terminfo
  entry and re-running the test. This is done with the 'edit terminfo' menu
  item. The edit submenu allows you to change the offending terminfo entry and
  immediately retest the capability. The edit menu lets you do other things with
  the terminfo, such as; display the entire terminfo entry, display which caps
  have been tested and display which caps cannot be tested. This menu also
  allows you to write the newly modified terminfo to disc. If you have made any
  modifications to the terminfo <b>tack</b> will ask you if you want to save the
  file to disc before it exits. The filename will be the same as the terminal
  name. After the program exits you can run the tic(1M) compiler on the new
  terminfo to install it in the terminfo data base.

  PAD TIMINGS</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Theory_of_Overruns_and_Padding"><a class="selflink" href="#Theory_of_Overruns_and_Padding">Theory
  of Overruns and Padding</a></h2>
Some terminals require significant amounts of time (that is, more than one
  transmitted-character interval) to do screen updates that change large
  portions of the screen, such as screen clears, line insertions, line
  deletions, and scrolls (including scrolls triggered by line feeds or a write
  to the lowest, right-hand-most cell of the screen).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the computer continues to send characters to the terminal while one of these
  time-consuming operations is going on, the screen may be garbled. Since the
  length of a character transmission time varies inversely with transmission
  speed in cps, entries which function at lower speeds may break at higher
  speeds.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Similar problems result if the host machine is simply sending characters at a
  sustained rate faster than the terminal can buffer and process them. In either
  case, when the terminal cannot process them and can't tell the host to stop
  soon enough, it will just drop them. The dropped characters could be text,
  escape sequences or the escape character itself, causing some really
  strange-looking displays. This kind of glitch is called an <i>overrun</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In terminfo entries, you can attach a <b>pad time</b> to each string capability
  that is a number of milliseconds to delay after sending it. This will give the
  terminal time to catch up and avoid overruns.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are running a software terminal emulator, or you are on an X pseudo-tty,
  or your terminal is on an RS-232C line which correctly handles RTS/CTS
  hardware flow control, then pads are not strictly necessary. However, some
  display packages (such as ncurses(3X)) use the pad counts to calculate the
  fastest way to implement certain functions. For example: scrolling the screen
  may be faster than deleting the top line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One common way to avoid overruns is with XON/XOFF handshaking. But even this
  handshake may have problems at high baud rates. This is a result of the way
  XON/XOFF works. The terminal tells the host to stop with an XOFF. When the
  host gets this character, it stops sending. However, there is a small amount
  of time between the stop request and the actual stop. During this window, the
  terminal must continue to accept characters even though it has told the host
  to stop. If the terminal sends the stop request too late, then its internal
  buffer will overflow. If it sends the stop character too early, then the
  terminal is not getting the most efficient use out of its internal buffers. In
  a real application at high baud rates, a terminal could get a dozen or more
  characters before the host gets around to suspending transmission. Connecting
  the terminal over a network will make the problem much worse.
<div class="Pp"></div>
(RTS/CTS handshaking does not have this problem because the UARTs are
  signal-connected and the &quot;stop flow&quot; is done at the lowest level,
  without software intervention).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Timing_your_terminal"><a class="selflink" href="#Timing_your_terminal">Timing
  your terminal</a></h2>
In order to get accurate timings from your terminal <b>tack</b> needs to know
  when the terminal has finished processing all the characters that were sent.
  This requires a different type of handshaking than the XON/XOFF that is
  supported by most terminals. <b>Tack</b> needs to send a request to the
  terminal and wait for its reply. Many terminals will respond with an ACK when
  they receive an ENQ. This is the preferred method since the sequence is short.
  ANSI/VT-100 style terminals can mimic this handshake with the escape sequence
  that requests 'primary device attributes'.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 ESC [ c
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The terminal will respond with a sequence like:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 ESC [ ? 1 ; 0 c
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Tack</b> assumes that (u9) is the enquire sequence and that (u8) is the
  acknowledge string. A VT-100 style terminal could set u9=\E[c and u8=\E[?1;0c.
  Acknowledge strings fall into two categories. 1) Strings with a unique
  terminating character and, 2) strings of fixed length. The acknowledge string
  for the VT-100 is of the first type since it always ends with the letter 'c'.
  Some Tektronics terminals have fixed length acknowledge strings. <b>Tack</b>
  supports both types of strings by scanning for the terminating character until
  the length of the expected acknowledge string has arrived. (u8) should be set
  to some typical acknowledge that will be returned when (u9) is sent.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Tack</b> will test this sequence before running any of the pad tests or the
  function key tests. <b>Tack</b> will ask you the following:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 Hit lower case g to start testing...
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
After it sends this message it will send the enquire string. It will then read
  characters from the terminal until it sees the letter g.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Testing_and_Repairing_Pad_Timings"><a class="selflink" href="#Testing_and_Repairing_Pad_Timings">Testing
  and Repairing Pad Timings</a></h2>
The pad timings in distributed terminfo entries are often incorrect. One major
  motivation for this program is to make it relatively easy to tune these
  timings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can verify and edit the pad timings for a terminal with the `test string
  capabilities' function (this is also part of the `normal test sequence'
  function).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The key to determining pad times is to find out the effective baud rate of the
  terminal. The effective baud rate determines the number of characters per
  second that the terminal can accept without either handshaking or losing data.
  This rate is frequently less than the nominal cps rate on the RS-232 line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Tack</b> uses the effective baud rate to judge the duration of the test and
  how much a particular escape sequence will perturb the terminal.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each pad test has two associated variables that can be tweaked to help verify
  the correctness of the pad timings. One is the pad test length. The other is
  the pad multiplier, which is used if the pad prefix includes `*'. In curses
  use, it is often the first parameter of the capability (if there is one). For
  a capability like (dch) or (il) this will be the number of character positions
  or lines affected, respectively.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Tack</b> will run the pad tests and display the results to the terminal. On
  capabilities that have multipliers <b>tack</b> will not tell you if the pad
  needs the multiplier or not. You must make this decision yourself by rerunning
  the test with a different multiplier. If the padding changes in proportion to
  the multiplier than the multiplier is required. If the multiplier has little
  or no effect on the suggested padding then the multiplier is not needed. Some
  capabilities will take several runs to get a good feel for the correct values.
  You may wish to make the test longer to get more accurate results. System load
  will also effect the results (a heavily loaded system will not stress the
  terminal as much, possibly leading to pad timings that are too short).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTE"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTE">NOTE</a></h1>
The tests done at the beginning of the program are assumed to be correct later
  in the code. In particular, <b>tack</b> displays the number of lines and
  columns indicated in the terminfo entry as part of its initial output. If
  these values are wrong a large number of tests will fail or give incorrect
  results.
