<p>PR(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
PR(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pr &acirc; print files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pr [+page] [&acirc;column] [&acirc;adFmrt]
[&acirc;e[char][gap]] [&acirc;h header]
[&acirc;i[char][gap]] <br>
[&acirc;l lines] [&acirc;n[char][width]] [&acirc;o offset]
[&acirc;s[char]] [&acirc;w width] [&acirc;fp] <br>
[file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The pr utility is a printing and pagination filter. If
multiple input files are specified, each shall be read,
formatted, and written to standard output. By default, the
input <br>
shall be separated into 66-line pages, each with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A 5-line header that includes
the page number, date, time, and the pathname of the
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A 5-line trailer consisting of
blank lines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If standard output is associated
with a terminal, diagnostic messages shall be deferred until
the pr utility has completed processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When options specifying
multi-column output are specified, output text columns shall
be of equal width; input lines that do not fit into a text
column shall be truncated. By <br>
default, text columns shall be separated with at least one
&lt;blank&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The pr utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines, except that: the page option has a
&rsquo;+&rsquo; delimiter; page and <br>
column can be multi-digit numbers; some of the
option-arguments are optional; and some of the
option-arguments cannot be specified as separate arguments
from the preceding option <br>
letter. In particular, the &acirc;s option does not allow
the option letter to be separated from its argument, and the
options &acirc;e, &acirc;i, and &acirc;n require that both
arguments, if present, <br>
not be separated from the option letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported. In the following option descriptions, column,
lines, offset, page, and width are positive decimal
integers; gap is a non-negative deci&acirc; <br>
mal integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+page Begin output at page
number page of the formatted input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;column Produce
multi-column output that is arranged in column columns (the
default shall be 1) and is written down each column in the
order in which the text is received from <br>
the input file. This option should not be used with
&acirc;m. The options &acirc;e and &acirc;i shall be assumed
for multiple text-column output. Whether or not text columns
are pro&acirc; <br>
duced with identical vertical lengths is unspecified, but a
text column shall never exceed the length of the page (see
the &acirc;l option). When used with &acirc;t, use the
mini&acirc; <br>
mum number of lines to write the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;a Modify the effect of
the &acirc;column option so that the columns are filled
across the page in a round-robin order (for example, when
column is 2, the first input line heads <br>
column 1, the second heads column 2, the third is the second
line in column 1, and so on).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;d Produce output that is
double-spaced; append an extra &lt;newline&gt; following
every &lt;newline&gt; found in the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;e[char][gap] <br>
Expand each input &lt;tab&gt; to the next greater column
position specified by the formula n*gap+1, where n is an
integer &gt; 0. If gap is zero or is omitted, it shall
default <br>
to 8. All &lt;tab&gt; characters in the input shall be
expanded into the appropriate number of &lt;space&gt;
characters. If any non-digit character, char, is specified,
it shall be <br>
used as the input &lt;tab&gt;. If the first character of the
&acirc;e option-argument is a digit, the entire
option-argument shall be assumed to be gap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;f Use a &lt;form-feed&gt;
for new pages, instead of the default behavior that uses a
sequence of &lt;newline&gt; characters. Pause before
beginning the first page if the standard <br>
output is associated with a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;F Use a &lt;form-feed&gt;
for new pages, instead of the default behavior that uses a
sequence of &lt;newline&gt; characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;h header Use the string
header to replace the contents of the file operand in the
page header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;i[char][gap] <br>
In output, replace &lt;space&gt; characters with &lt;tab&gt;
characters wherever one or more adjacent &lt;space&gt;
characters reach column positions gap+1, 2* gap+1, 3* gap+1,
and so <br>
on. If gap is zero or is omitted, default tab settings at
every eighth column position shall be assumed. If any
non-digit character, char, is specified, it shall be <br>
used as the output &lt;tab&gt;. If the first character of
the &acirc;i option-argument is a digit, the entire
option-argument shall be assumed to be gap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;l lines Override the
66-line default and reset the page length to lines. If lines
is not greater than the sum of both the header and trailer
depths (in lines), the pr utility <br>
shall suppress both the header and trailer, as if the
&acirc;t option were in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;m Merge files. Standard
output shall be formatted so the pr utility writes one line
from each file specified by a file operand, side by side
into text columns of equal <br>
fixed widths, in terms of the number of column positions.
Implementations shall support merging of at least nine file
operands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;n[char][width] <br>
Provide width-digit line numbering (default for width shall
be 5). The number shall occupy the first width column
positions of each text column of default output or <br>
each line of &acirc;m output. If char (any non-digit
character) is given, it shall be appended to the line number
to separate it from whatever follows (default for char is a
<br>
&lt;tab&gt;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;o offset Each line of
output shall be preceded by offset &lt;space&gt; characters.
If the &acirc;o option is not specified, the default offset
shall be zero. The space taken is in addition <br>
to the output line width (see the &acirc;w option
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;p Pause before beginning
each page if the standard output is directed to a terminal
(pr shall write an &lt;alert&gt; to standard error and wait
for a &lt;carriage-return&gt; to be <br>
read on /dev/tty).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;r Write no diagnostic
reports on failure to open files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;s[char] Separate text
columns by the single character char instead of by the
appropriate number of &lt;space&gt; characters (default for
char shall be &lt;tab&gt;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;t Write neither the
five-line identifying header nor the five-line trailer
usually supplied for each page. Quit writing after the last
line of each file without spacing <br>
to the end of the page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;w width Set the width of
the line to width column positions for multiple text-column
output only. If the &acirc;w option is not specified and the
&acirc;s option is not specified, the <br>
default width shall be 72. If the &acirc;w option is not
specified and the &acirc;s option is specified, the default
width shall be 512.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For single column output, input
lines shall not be truncated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of a file to be
written. If no file operands are specified, or if a file
operand is &rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;, the standard input shall
be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be used only if no file operands
are specified, or if a file operand is
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;. See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The input files shall be text files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file /dev/tty shall be used
to read responses required by the &acirc;p option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of pr:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments <br>
and input files) and which characters are defined as
printable (character class print). Non-printable characters
are still written to standard output, but are not <br>
counted for the purpose for column-width and line-length
calculations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_TIME Determine the format of
the date and time for use in writing header lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TZ Determine the timezone used
to calculate date and time strings written in header lines.
If TZ is unset or null, an unspecified default timezone
shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
If pr receives an interrupt while writing to a terminal, it
shall flush all accumulated error messages to the screen
before terminating.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The pr utility output shall be a paginated version of the
original file (or files). This pagination shall be
accomplished using either &lt;form-feed&gt; characters or a
sequence of <br>
&lt;newline&gt; characters, as controlled by the &acirc;F or
&acirc;f option. Page headers shall be generated unless the
&acirc;t option is specified. The page headers shall be of
the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;0s %s Page %d0, &lt;output
of date&gt;, &lt;file&gt;, &lt;page number&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the POSIX locale, the
&lt;output of date&gt; field, representing the date and time
of last modification of the input file (or the current date
and time if the input file is standard <br>
input), shall be equivalent to the output of the following
command as it would appear if executed at the given
time:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">date &quot;+%b %e %H:%M
%Y&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">without the trailing
&lt;newline&gt;, if the page being written is from standard
input. If the page being written is not from standard input,
in the POSIX locale, the same format shall <br>
be used, but the time used shall be the modification time of
the file corresponding to file instead of the current time.
When the LC_TIME locale category is not set to the POSIX
<br>
locale, a different format and order of presentation of this
field may be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the standard input is used
instead of a file operand, the &lt;file&gt; field shall be
replaced by a null string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;h option is
specified, the &lt;file&gt; field shall be replaced by the
header argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used for diagnostic messages and
for alerting the terminal when &acirc;p is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
A conforming application must protect its first operand, if
it starts with a &lt;plus-sign&gt;, by preceding it with the
&quot;&acirc;&acirc;&quot; argument that denotes the end of
the options. For example, <br>
pr+x could be interpreted as an invalid page number or a
file operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. Print a numbered list of all files in the current
directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ls &acirc;a | pr &acirc;n
&acirc;h &quot;Files in $(pwd).&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Print file1 and file2 as a
double-spaced, three-column listing headed by
&lsquo;&lsquo;file list&rsquo;&rsquo;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pr &acirc;3d &acirc;h &quot;file
list&quot; file1 file2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Write file1 on file2,
expanding tabs to columns 10, 19, 28, ...:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pr &acirc;e9 &acirc;t &lt;file1
&gt;file2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
This utility is one of those that does not follow the
Utility Syntax Guidelines because of its historical origins.
The standard developers could have added new options that
<br>
obeyed the guidelines (and marked the old options
obsolescent) or devised an entirely new utility; there are
examples of both actions in this volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008. Because of <br>
its widespread use by historical applications, the standard
developers decided to exempt this version of pr from many of
the guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implementations are required to
accept option-arguments to the &acirc;h, &acirc;l, &acirc;o,
and &acirc;w options whether presented as part of the same
argument or as a separate argument to pr, as sug&acirc; <br>
gested by the Utility Syntax Guidelines. The &acirc;n and
&acirc;s options, however, are specified as in historical
practice because they are frequently specified without their
optional <br>
arguments. If a &lt;blank&gt; were allowed before the
option-argument in these cases, a file operand could
mistakenly be interpreted as an option-argument in
historical applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The text about the minimum
number of lines in multi-column output was included to
ensure that a best effort is made in balancing the length of
the columns. There are known his&acirc; <br>
torical implementations in which, for example, 60-line files
are listed by pr &acirc;2 as one column of 56 lines and a
second of 4. Although this is not a problem when a full page
with <br>
headers and trailers is produced, it would be relatively
useless when used with &acirc;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical implementations of
the pr utility have differed in the action taken for the
&acirc;f option. BSD uses it as described here for the
&acirc;F option; System V uses it to change <br>
trailing &lt;newline&gt; characters on each page to a
&lt;form-feed&gt; and, if standard output is a TTY device,
sends an &lt;alert&gt; to standard error and reads a line
from /dev/tty before the <br>
first page. There were strong arguments from both sides of
this issue concerning historical practice and as a result
the &acirc;F option was added. XSI-conformant systems
support the <br>
System V historical actions for the &acirc;f option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;output of date&gt; field
in the &acirc;l format is specified only for the POSIX
locale. As noted, the format can be different in other
locales. No mechanism for defining this is <br>
present in this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, as the
appropriate vehicle is a message catalog; that is, the
format should be specified as a
&lsquo;&lsquo;message&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>
