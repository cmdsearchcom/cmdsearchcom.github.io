<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hpftodit - create font description files for use with groff
-Tlj4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
hpftodit [ -adqsv ] [ -in ] tfm_file map_file font</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to have
whitespace between the -i option and its parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
hpftodit creates a font file for use with a Hewlett-Packard
LaserJet 4&acirc;series (or newer) printer with groff -Tlj4,
using data from an HP tagged font metric (TFM) file.
tfm_file <br>
is the name of the TFM file for the font; Intellifont and
TrueType TFM files are supported, but symbol set TFM files
are not. map_file is a file giving the groff names for
char&acirc; <br>
acters in the font; this file should consist of a sequence
of lines of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m u c1 c2 ... [ # comment ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where m is a decimal integer
giving the MSL number of the character, u is a hexadecimal
integer giving the Unicode value of the character, and c1,
c2, ... are the groff names of <br>
the character. The values can be separated by any
whitespace; the Unicode value must use uppercase digits
A&acirc;F, and must be without a leading &lsquo;0x&rsquo;,
&lsquo;u&rsquo;, or &lsquo;U+&rsquo;. Unicode values <br>
corresponding to composite glyphs are decomposed; e.g.,
&lsquo;u00C0&rsquo; becomes &lsquo;u0041_0300&rsquo;. The
name for a glyph without a groff name may be given as uXXXX
if the glyph corresponds to <br>
a Unicode value, or as an unnamed glyph &lsquo;---&rsquo;.
If the given Unicode value is in the Private Use Area
(0xE000&acirc;0xF8FF), the glyph is included as an unnamed
glyph. Refer to <br>
groff_diff(1) for additional information about unnamed
glyphs and how to access them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blank lines and lines beginning
with &lsquo;#&rsquo; are ignored. A &lsquo;#&rsquo;
following one or more groff names begins a comment. Because
&lsquo;#&rsquo; is a valid groff name, it must appear first
in a <br>
list of groff names if a comment is included, e.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 0023 # # number sign</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 0023 # sh # number sign</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rather than</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 0023 sh # # number sign</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which will treat the first
&lsquo;#&rsquo; as the beginning of the comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">font is the name of the groff
font file. The groff font file is written to font; if font
is specified as &lsquo;-&rsquo;, the output is written to
the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -s option should be given if
the font is special (a font is special if troff should
search it whenever a character is not found in the current
font). If the font is special, <br>
it should be listed in the fonts command in the DESC file;
if it is not special, there is no need to list it, since
troff can automatically mount it when it&rsquo;s first
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -i option is used,
hpftodit automatically will generate an italic correction, a
left italic correction and a subscript correction for each
character (the significance of <br>
these parameters is explained in groff_font(5)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a Include characters in the TFM file that are not included
in the map file. A glyph with corresponding Unicode value is
given the name uXXXX; a glyph without a Unicode <br>
value is included as an unnamed glyph &lsquo;---&rsquo;. A
glyph with a Unicode value in the Private Use Area
(0xE000&acirc;0xF8FF) also is included as an unnamed
glyph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option provides a simple
means of adding Unicode-named and unnamed glyphs to a font
without including them in the map file, but it affords
little control over which <br>
glyphs are placed in a regular font and which are placed in
a special font. The presence or absence of the -s option has
some effect on which glyphs are included: without <br>
the -s option, only the &acirc;text&acirc; symbol sets are
searched for matching glyphs; with the -s option, only the
&acirc;mathematical&acirc; symbol sets are searched.
Nonetheless, restrict&acirc; <br>
ing the symbol sets searched isn&rsquo;t very
selective&acirc;many glyphs are placed in both regular and
special fonts. Normally, the -a option should be used only
as a last resort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Dump information about the
TFM file to the standard output; this option can be useful
for ensuring that a TFM file is a proper match for a font,
and that the contents of <br>
the TFM file are suitable. The information includes the
values of important TFM tags, and a listing (by MSL number
for Intellifont TFM files or by Unicode value for
True&acirc; <br>
Type TFM files) of the glyphs included in the TFM file. The
unit of measure &lsquo;DU&rsquo; for some tags indicates
design units; there are 8782 design units per em for
Intellifont <br>
fonts, and 2048 design units per em for TrueType fonts. Note
that the accessibility of a glyph depends on its inclusion
in a symbol set; some TFM files list many glyphs <br>
but only a few symbol sets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The glyph listing includes the
glyph index within the TFM file, the MSL or Unicode value,
and the symbol set and character code that will be used to
print the glyph. If <br>
map_file is given, groff names are given for matching
glyphs. If only the glyph index and MSL or Unicode value are
given, the glyph does not appear in any supported sym&acirc;
<br>
bol set and cannot be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the -d option, map_file is
optional, and font is ignored if given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Suppress warnings about
characters in the map file that were not found in the TFM
file. Warnings never are given for unnamed glyphs or by
glyphs named by their Unicode <br>
values. This option is useful when sending the output of
hpftodit to the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print the hpftodit version
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s The font is special. This
option adds the special command to the font file, and
affects the order in which HP symbol sets are searched for
each glyph. Without the -s <br>
option, the &acirc;text&acirc; sets are searched before the
&acirc;mathematical&acirc; symbol sets. With the -s option,
the search order is reversed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-in Generate an italic
correction for each character so that the character&rsquo;s
width plus the character&rsquo;s italic correction is equal
to n thousandths of an em plus the amount by <br>
which the right edge of the character&rsquo;s bounding is to
the right of the character&rsquo;s origin. If this would
result in a negative italic correction, use a zero italic
cor&acirc; <br>
rection instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also generate a subscript
correction equal to the product of the tangent of the slant
of the font and four fifths of the x-height of the font. If
this would result in a <br>
subscript correction greater than the italic correction, use
a subscript correction equal to the italic correction
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also generate a left italic
correction for each character equal to n thousandths of an
em plus the amount by which the left edge of the
character&rsquo;s bounding box is to the <br>
left of the character&rsquo;s origin. The left italic
correction may be negative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option normally is needed
only with italic or oblique fonts; a value of 50 (0.05 em)
usually is a reasonable choice.</p>
