<p>SQUEAK(1) Squeak Smalltalk System SQUEAK(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
squeak, inisqueak - Unix Squeak virtual machine and
installer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
inisqueak <br>
squeak [ option... ] [ image ] [ script [ argument... ]
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
squeak is the virtual machine for the Squeak Smalltalk
system. It requires three files to operate correctly: an
image file containing a &lsquo;snapshot&rsquo; of a live
Squeak session, a <br>
changes file containing the source code for modified methods
in the image, and a copy of (or a link to) a shared system
sources file containing the source code for methods that
<br>
have not been modified since the last major version
increment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The image and changes files
contain the state of a user&rsquo;s Squeak session, which is
persistent between consecutive sessions. Private copies of
these files are therefore normally <br>
required. The inisqueak script checks that the local Squeak
installation appears sane, and then copies the required
files to the current working directory. If inisqueak
encoun&acirc; <br>
ters no problems, it will finish by running squeak to start
a Squeak session using the newly copied image and changes
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inisqueak should be run once,
when using Squeak for the first time, to create a new
&rsquo;personal&rsquo; Squeak session. Afterwards, squeak
should be run each time that session is to be <br>
resumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INVOCATION <br>
inisqueak has no options or arguments. Simply
&rsquo;cd&rsquo; to the directory that is to contain the
working copies of the image and changes files, then run
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">squeak accepts various options
(described below), and then an optional image name (which
must not begin with a minus sign &rsquo;-&rsquo;). If an
image name is given on the command line <br>
then squeak tries to run that image. Otherwise squeak checks
the environment variable SQUEAK_IMAGE and, if it is set,
uses its value as the name of the image to run. Otherwise
<br>
squeak looks for an image called &rsquo;squeak.image&rsquo;
in the current directory. If the image file does not exist
then squeak prints a message indicating which image file it
failed to <br>
find and then exits. If the extension &rsquo;.image&rsquo;
is missing in the image argument or in the value of the
SQUEAK_IMAGE variable, it will be appended
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The image argument can be
followed by a script name. This is the name of a
&rsquo;document&rsquo; that should contain Smalltalk code to
be executed on startup. The document can be either <br>
the name of a file or a URL starting with
&rsquo;http:&rsquo;. Any arguments that appear after the
script name are ignored, but are made available to the
script from within Squeak via the <br>
method getSystemAttribute:. (See the section SCRIPTS
below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If image is given as
&rsquo;--&rsquo; then squeak immediately stops argument
processing (and behaves as if image was not specified). This
is useful to specify a script (possibly with script <br>
arguments) without specifying an explicit image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Command line options fall into two categories:
&rsquo;common&rsquo; options that are recognised by the base
VM and &rsquo;specific&rsquo; options that are tied to a
particular display or sound driver. <br>
Common options will always be recognised by squeak, whereas
a given specific option will be recognised only after squeak
has loaded the driver to which it relates. Refer to the <br>
&rsquo;-vm&rsquo; option below for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The common options recognised by
squeak are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-encoding enc <br>
specifies the internal character encoding to be used by
Squeak. This affects the translation that the VM performs
when importing text (from the keyboard or via
&rsquo;paste&rsquo; <br>
from an external selection) or exporting text (pasting text
from Squeak to another application, or when generating
filenames containing special characters). In other <br>
words, it affects the correspondence between what Squeak
displays on the screen and what it sends to (or receives
from) external applications. The correct value depends <br>
on the way Squeak&rsquo;s internal fonts are encoded.
Current images are delivered with traditional Macintosh
&rsquo;New York&rsquo; fonts that use Mac Roman encoding,
and so this is the <br>
default internal encoding. If other fonts (from X11 or
elsewhere) are imported into the image and used as system
fonts then the this default translation will give
incor&acirc; <br>
rect results for diacritical marks and special characters.
In such cases the -encoding option can be used to change the
internal encoding, for example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-encoding ISO-8859-15</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(aka Latin9) which would be
appropriate for many of the fonts designed for European
languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help prints a short summary of
the command-line syntax, options and available drivers, then
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-memory size[mk] <br>
requests that a fixed heap of size bytes be allocated for
the Squeak image. If the suffix &lsquo;k&rsquo; is given
then the argument is expressed in kilobytes. If the suffux
&lsquo;m&rsquo; is <br>
given then the argument is expressed in megabytes. This
option SHOULD NOT be used, unless there is a good reason to
do so, since it places an arbitrary limit on Squeak&rsquo;s
<br>
object memory size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmap size[mk] <br>
requests that a variable heap of at most size bytes be
allocated. (The suffixes are as described for the
&rsquo;-memory&rsquo; option.) squeak will initially
allocate a heap that is <br>
large enough to hold the image, with a small amount of
headroom. If at any time Squeak requires more memory for its
image then additional space will be allocated dynami&acirc;
<br>
cally. Likewise, when memory is no longer needed it will
deallocated and returned to the system. The size argument
places an upper limit on how big the heap can grow in <br>
this fashion. squeak uses a dynamic heap by default with the
maximum size set to 75% of the available virtual memory or 1
gigabyte, whichever is smaller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noevents <br>
disables the new (image 2.8 and later) event-driven input
mechanism. This option is only useful for testing backwards
compatibility with older images and should not be <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-notimer <br>
disables the use of the interval timer for keeping track of
low-resolution time. (If you are having problems with file,
sound or socket i/o reporting &lsquo;interrupted system <br>
call&rsquo; then setting this flag might help.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pathenc enc <br>
specifies the external character encoding to be used by
Squeak when accessing the filesystem (file and directory
pathnames). The correct value depends on the local
plat&acirc; <br>
form&rsquo;s characteristics. If no encoding conversion
should be performed then this should be set to the same
encoding as Squeak uses internally (see the -encoding
option). <br>
Otherwise ISO-8859-15 (aka Latin9) might make sense on a
filesystem supporting 8-bit characters, and UTF-8 for
filesystems that use Unicode-based pathnames. The default
<br>
is UTF-8 which is correct for Mac OS X and very recent
GNU/Linux distributions, and which (in an ideal world) will
eventually be adopted by all Unix variants.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-plugins path <br>
specifies an alternative location for external plugins
(collections of named primitives) and drivers (for display
and sound). The path argument contains a pattern in <br>
which any occurrences of &lsquo;%n&rsquo; will be replaced
by the name of the plugin or driver being loaded. The path
can name either a directory or the plugin itself and can be
<br>
absolute or relative (to the directory in which squeak was
run). If a plugin or driver cannot be found in the location
specified by path then the search continues in the <br>
default locations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-textenc enc <br>
specifies the external character encoding to be used by
Squeak when exchanging clipboard text with other
applications. The default is UTF-8 on Mac OS X and
ISO-8859-15 <br>
(aka Latin9) on other Unix systems. Note that X11
applications requesting the selection converted to
UTF8_STRING data will (correctly) receive the clipboard text
encoded <br>
as UTF-8, regardless of this setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Squeak recognises a subset of
the encoding names defined by the IANA. (If you prefer to
use the international currency symbol rather than the Euro
symbol in external text <br>
then you might want to set this to ISO-8859-1, aka
Latin1.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
prints three or more lines of version information, as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the architecture
configured for the virtual machine at compile time, the
compilation &lsquo;sequence number&rsquo;, the time and date
of compilation, and the name (and version, <br>
if known) of the compiler that was used to compile
squeak;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the complete
uname(1) information for the host on which the virtual
machine was compiled;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the default
installed location for plugins and drivers;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After printing the above, the
virtual machine exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vm driver <br>
asks squeak to load a sound/display driver. For each
supported device there is a corresponding driver that squeak
loads during initialisation. Unless told otherwise, <br>
squeak will figure out sensible default drivers to load.
This choice can be overridden using this option. The driver
argument is a list of one or more &rsquo;assignments&rsquo;
of <br>
the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">class=device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">separated by spaces or commas.
The supported combinations are currently:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">display=X11 <br>
to display the Squeak window on a local or remote X Window
System server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">display=Quartz <br>
to display on the local Mac OS X desktop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">display=none <br>
to disable the display (and keyboard/mouse) entirely. (This
driver is useful primarily for running &rsquo;server&rsquo;
applications in Squeak.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sound=OSS <br>
provides sound input and output via the Open Sound System.
(If you have a device called &rsquo;/dev/dsp&rsquo; then
this is likely the one you want.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sound=MacOSX <br>
provides sound input/output via Core Audio on Mac OS X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sound=NAS <br>
provides sound i/o via the Network Audio System.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sound=Sun <br>
provides sound on Sun Microsystems hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sound=none <br>
disables sound entirely. squeak will not attempt to play or
record sounds when this driver is loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that only those drivers
relevant to the local platform will be available. Attempting
to load an unsupported driver will cause squeak to exit with
an error message. <br>
A list of available drivers is printed by the
&rsquo;-help&rsquo; option. If a particular driver cannot
load system libraries on which it depends then it will
neither be listed nor <br>
be available to load at runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note also that on Mac OS X both
the X11 and Quartz display drivers are supported, although
the former will refuse to load if the X11 client libraries
are not installed on <br>
the local machine. The Quartz driver will happily load (and
Squeak will run as a fully-fledged application) even when
squeak is invoked from the command line. Exercise <br>
caution when logged into Mac OS X from another machine:
forgetting to set DISPLAY before trying to run squeak on the
remote display could cause embarrassement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options specific to the X11
display driver are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-browserWindow id <br>
specifies the id of the window that squeak should use for
its display. This option is intended for use when Squeak is
running as a web browser plugin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display server <br>
specifies that Squeak should connect to the given display
server instead of looking in the environment variable
DISPLAY (the default behaviour) to find the name of the <br>
server to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cmdmod N <br>
tells the VM to map modifier key N on the keyboard to the
modifier code that the image expects for the Command
key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-optmod N <br>
tells the VM to map modifier key N on the keyboard to the
modifier code that the image expects for the Option key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-compositioninput <br>
enables support for an overlay window in which individual
characters (e.g., Japanese hiragana) are composed before
being interpreted as a single character (e.g., Japanese <br>
kanji) by the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xicfont font <br>
tells the VM to use the named font within the composition
overlay window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fullscreen <br>
causes the Squeak window to occupy as much of the screen
area as possible. Implies &rsquo;-notitle&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-headless <br>
disables the graphical display and mouse/keyboard input.
This mode of operation is useful primarily for servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iconic <br>
asks the window manager to iconify the Squeak window at
startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lazy causes Squeak to
&lsquo;snooze&rsquo; whenever the main winodw is unmapped.
This can be used if Squeak appears to be using consuming CPU
time while idling (which should not normally <br>
be the case). Note that if this option is in effect, when
the Squeak window is unmapped squeak will not respond to any
external stimuli (other than to provide the X <br>
selection to requestors, when Squeak is the owner).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mapdelbs <br>
maps the Delete key onto Backspace. Backspace deletes the
character to the left of the cursor and Delete normally
deletes the character to the right of the cursor. With <br>
this option, Deletes will behave like Backspace. The
behaviour of Backspace is not changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noxdnd <br>
disables support for the X drag-and-drop protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nointl <br>
disables the handling of dead keys on international
keyboards. Without this option, dead key handling is enabled
if either LC_ALL or LC_CTYPE is set in the environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-notitle <br>
disables the title bar on the Squeak window (if the window
manager supports it). This option is implied by
&rsquo;-fullscreen&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-swapbtn <br>
swaps the yellow and blue buttons. (Traditionally, the red
button is on the left, yellow in the middle and blue on the
right. The colourful names come from the Xerox <br>
Alto on which Smalltalk was first implemented.) Squeak
normally maps X buttons 1, 2 and 3 to the red, yellow and
blue buttons, in that order. With this option, it maps X
<br>
buttons 1, 2 and 3 to the red, blue and yellow buttons.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xasync <br>
causes Squeak to use asynchronous display updates. The
virtual machine normally flushes and synchronises the
display connection at regular intervals. Using this option
<br>
disables synchronisation, which will be performed only when
the image explicitly requests it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xshm enables the use of the X
Shared Memory extension on servers that support it. This can
dramatically improve display performance, but works only
when Squeak is running on <br>
the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options specific to the FBDev
display driver are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fbdev device <br>
Use the given framebuffer device instead of the default
&rsquo;/dev/fb0&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kbmap mapfile <br>
Load the keyboard map from the given mapfile instead of
reading it from the running kernel. Note that squeak cannot
(currently) read compressed or &rsquo;shorthand&rsquo; map
files <br>
(as found in /usr/share/keymaps or /lib/kbd/keymaps). To
generate a keymap file usable by squeak, execute the
following program from the console:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dumpkeys -f -n --keys-only &gt;
key.map</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If squeak encounters a problem
while trying to load mapfile, it will print an error message
and exit. See keymaps(5) for more information about the
keymap file format. <br>
The programs dumpkeys(1), loadkeys(1), and showkey(1) can be
used to modify the keyboard map before creating a keymap
file for squeak.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msdev device <br>
Use the given mouse device instead of the default. The
default is to try &rsquo;/dev/psaux&rsquo;,
&rsquo;/dev/input/mice&rsquo; and
&rsquo;/dev/adbmouse&rsquo;, in that order, and to use the
first one that <br>
has a physical device attached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msproto protocol <br>
Use the given mouse protocol instead of the default. The
supported protocols are &rsquo;ps2&rsquo; and
&rsquo;adb&rsquo;. The default is &rsquo;ps2&rsquo; for mice
attached to &rsquo;/dev/psaux&rsquo; or <br>
&rsquo;/dev/input/mice&rsquo;, and &rsquo;adb&rsquo; for
mice attached to &rsquo;/dev/adbmouse&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vtlock <br>
Disallows VT switching, regardless of whether the request
comes from the keyboard or from another program such as
chvt(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vtswitch <br>
Enables keyboard VT switching. Note that this option is
effectively disabled if the &rsquo;-vtlock&rsquo; option is
also enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options specific to the OSS and
MacOSX sound drivers are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nomixer <br>
disables the primitives that change mixer (sound) settings.
If you prefer that Squeak leave these alone (they are, after
all, really the reponsibility of whichever mixer <br>
program or sound control panel you use) then this option is
for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options specific to the ALSA
sound driver are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-capture device <br>
Uses the named input device for sound capture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-playback device <br>
Uses the named output device for sound playback.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several common options are
deprecated and are provided only for backward compatibility.
These options should not be used and will be removed in a
future release:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display dpy <br>
is equivalent to &rsquo;-vm display=X11 -display
dpy&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-headless <br>
is equivalent to &rsquo;-vm display=X11
-headless&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nodisplay <br>
is equivalent to &rsquo;-vm display=none&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nosound <br>
is equivalent to &rsquo;-vm sound=none&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quartz <br>
is equivalent to &rsquo;-vm display=Quartz&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Many of the options that can be set on the command line can
also be set from environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_ASYNC <br>
if set in the environment then equivalent to the
&rsquo;-xasync&rsquo; flag. (The value is ignored.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_CAPTURE <br>
see &rsquo;-capture&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_COMPOSITIONINPUT <br>
if set in the environment then equivalent to the
&rsquo;-compositioninput&rsquo; flag. (The value is
ignored.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_ENCODING <br>
the name of the internal character encoding used by Squeak.
Equivalent to giving the &rsquo;-encoding&rsquo;
command-line option if set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_FBDEV <br>
the name of the framebuffer device to use when running on
the console. See the &rsquo;-fbdev&rsquo; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_FULLSCREEN <br>
equivalent to &rsquo;-fullscreen&rsquo; if set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_ICONIC <br>
equivalent to the &rsquo;-iconic&rsquo; flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_IMAGE <br>
the name of the image file to execute if no image argument
is given on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_KBMAP <br>
the name of the keymap file to use when running on the
console. See the &rsquo;-kbmap&rsquo; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_LAZY <br>
equivalent to the &rsquo;-lazy&rsquo; flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_MAPDELBS <br>
equivalent to the &rsquo;-mapdelbs&rsquo; flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_MEMORY <br>
the initial size of the heap, with optional &rsquo;k&rsquo;
or &rsquo;m&rsquo; suffix. Equivalent to the &rsquo;-memory
size[km]&rsquo; flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_MSDEV <br>
the name of the mouse device to use when running on the
console. See the &rsquo;-msdev&rsquo; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_MSPROTO <br>
the name of the mouse protocl to use when running on the
console. See the &rsquo;-msproto&rsquo; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_VTLOCK <br>
if set then equivalent to specifying the
&rsquo;-vtlock&rsquo; option on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_VTSWITCH <br>
if set then equivalent to specifying the
&rsquo;-vtswitch&rsquo; option on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_NOEVENTS <br>
if set, equivalent to &rsquo;-noevents&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_NOINTL <br>
equivalent to &rsquo;-nointl&rsquo; if set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_NOMIXER <br>
equivalent to &rsquo;-nomixer&rsquo; if set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_NOTIMER <br>
equivalent to &rsquo;-notimer&rsquo; if set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_NOTITLE <br>
if set, equivalent to &rsquo;-notitle&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_PATHENC <br>
the name of the character encoding used to construct file
and directory names. Equivalent to giving the
&rsquo;-pathenc&rsquo; command-line option if set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_PLAYBACK <br>
see &rsquo;-playback&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_PLUGINS <br>
see &rsquo;-plugins&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_SWAPBTN <br>
equivalent to &rsquo;-swapbtn&rsquo; if set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_TEXTENC <br>
the name of the character encoding used to copy/paste text
from/to external applications. Equivalent to giving the
&rsquo;-textenc&rsquo; command-line option if set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_VM <br>
contains the names of one or more drivers to be loaded
during initialisation. See the &rsquo;-vm&rsquo; option for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_XICFONT <br>
if set in the environment then it provides a default name
for the composition overlay font; see the
&rsquo;-xicfont&rsquo; flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_XSHM <br>
equivalent to &rsquo;-xshm&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an environment variable and a
command-line option conflict over a particular value then
normally the value in the command line takes precedence. The
exception to this rule is <br>
the &rsquo;-vm&rsquo; option. Environment variables are
processed before command-line arguments and
&rsquo;-vm&rsquo; cannnot be used to unload a driver that
was loaded while processing the contents of <br>
&rsquo;SQUEAK_VM&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">squeak also checks the
environment for LC_ALL and LC_CTYPE. If either of these
variables is set then support for international keyboards
(including dead keys for diacritical <br>
marks) is enabled. To prevent this support being enabled
even when one or both of these variables is set, use the
&rsquo;-nointl&rsquo; option (or set SQUEAK_NOINTL in the
environment). <br>
For example, to start squeak with support for dead keys on
Spanish keyboards, with Latin-1 encoding of external
characters and the default MacRoman internal font encoding,
run <br>
squeak like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export LC_CTYPE=es_ES <br>
export SQUEAK_TEXTENC=latin1 <br>
squeak</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCRIPTS <br>
Squeak can load and execute a &rsquo;script&rsquo; file
containing Smalltalk code at startup. The name of the file
should be given as the script argument to squeak. For
example, assuming <br>
that the image &rsquo;foo.image&rsquo; contains an open
Transcript window, then the following represents the
&rsquo;hello world&rsquo; program for Squeak:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transcript cr; show:
&rsquo;Hello, world&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this script is in a file
called &rsquo;hello.sq&rsquo;, then it could be run like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">squeak foo.image hello.sq</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also possible to make
&rsquo;self interpreting&rsquo; scripts by adding an
&rsquo;interpreter line&rsquo; to the start of the script.
The &rsquo;hello.sq&rsquo; file could be changed to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/squeak -- <br>
Transcript cr; show: &rsquo;Hello, world&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and then made executable
with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chmod +x hello.sq</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and then invoked by running the
script file directly:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQUEAK_IMAGE=&quot;foo.image&quot;
<br>
export SQUEAK_IMAGE <br>
./hello.sq</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any arguments are present
after the script name then they can be retrieved from within
the script using the method</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Smalltalk getSystemAttribute:
n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where n is the index of the
argument, starting at 3 for the first argument. (See the
method comment for</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">SystemDictionary&gt;&gt;getSystemAttribute:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in the image for an explanation
of the meanings of the indices.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example of this, here is
the &rsquo;echo&rsquo; program written as a Squeak
script:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/squeak -- <br>
&quot;Echo arguments to the Transcript.&quot; <br>
| i a | <br>
i := 2. <br>
[(a := Smalltalk getSystemAttribute: (i := i + 1)) <br>
notNil] <br>
whileTrue: [Transcript space; show: a].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When run as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./echo.sq one two three</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">this would print &rsquo;one two
three&rsquo; in the Transcript window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
inisqueak <br>
prints several informational messages while doing its stuff.
If it encounters a problem it prints an appropriate message
before bailing out. The messages should be self- <br>
explanatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">squeak normally does not print
anything at all. If it prints something then there is a
problem. The messages should be self-explanatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/lib64/squeak/SqueakV4.sources <br>
Shared system sources file for the Squeak image. There must
be a copy of (or link to) this file in the working directory
when running squeak.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/lib64/squeak/Squeak*.image
/usr/lib64/squeak/Squeak*.changes <br>
Distributed image and changes files holding a
&lsquo;shapshot&rsquo; of a live Squeak session. (The
contents of these files change during a session, and so
private copies should <br>
always be made before running squeak for the first time. See
inisqueak(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./SqueakV4.sources <br>
A link to the system sources file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./name.image <br>
./name.changes <br>
Private copies of image and changes files.</p>

Miscellaneous documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
This manual page documents version 4.10.2-2614 of Unix
Squeak. It may not be appropriate for any other version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The image and changes files
containing a saved Squeak session are intimately related.
They should always be used together, never be separated, and
under no circumstances should <br>
an image be run with a changes file that has been used with
a different image. Failure to adhere to the above could
cause the source code for the methods in the image to become
<br>
garbled and impossible to retrieve.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Unix Squeak virtual machine
fully supports OpenGL in both the X11 and Quartz display
drivers. Open Croquet will run just fine with either of
these drivers (and many Mac OS X <br>
users will even have the choice of which driver to use
:).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If a &rsquo;binary&rsquo; option is enabled by an
environment variable, there is no way to disable it on the
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, drivers specified in
the SQUEAK_VM environment variable cannot be overridden by
passing options on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">squeak should never crash. In
the unlikely event that it does crash, or prints any kind of
message that does not appear to be caused by incorrect
arguments or illegal operations <br>
from within a Squeak program, please send a bug report to:
&lt;ian.piumarta@squeakland.org&gt;. (Do not send bug
reports to the general-purpose &rsquo;squeak-dev&rsquo;
mailing list. They will <br>
not be read. If you feel you must post a bug report to a
mailing list, send it to the Squeak &rsquo;vm-dev&rsquo;
mailing list in addition to the above email address.)</p>
