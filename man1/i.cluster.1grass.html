<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
i.cluster performs the first pass in the two-pass
unsupervised classification of imagery, while the GRASS
module i.maxlik executes the second pass. Both commands must
be run to <br>
complete the unsupervised classification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i.cluster is a clustering
algorithm (a modification of the k-means clustering
algorithm) that reads through the (raster) imagery data and
builds pixel clusters based on the spec&acirc; <br>
tral reflectances of the pixels (see Figure). The pixel
clusters are imagery categories that can be related to land
cover types on the ground. The spectral distributions of the
<br>
clusters (e.g., land cover spectral signatures) are
influenced by six parameters set by the user. A relevant
parameter set by the user is the initial number of clusters
to be <br>
discriminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fig.: Land use/land cover
clustering of LANDSAT scene (sim&acirc; <br>
plified)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i.cluster starts by generating
spectral signatures for this number of clusters and
&quot;attempts&quot; to end up with this number of clusters
during the clustering process. The resulting <br>
number of clusters and their spectral distributions,
however, are also influenced by the range of the spectral
values (category values) in the image files and the other
parame&acirc; <br>
ters set by the user. These parameters are: the minimum
cluster size, minimum cluster separation, the percent
convergence, the maximum number of iterations, and the row
and <br>
column sampling intervals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The cluster spectral signatures
that result are composed of cluster means and covariance
matrices. These cluster means and covariance matrices are
used in the second pass <br>
(i.maxlik) to classify the image. The clusters or spectral
classes result can be related to land cover types on the
ground. The user has to specify the name of group file, the
<br>
name of subgroup file, the name of a file to contain result
signatures, the initial number of clusters to be
discriminated, and optionally other parameters (see below)
where the <br>
group should contain the imagery files that the user wishes
to classify. The subgroup is a subset of this group. The
user must create a group and subgroup by running the GRASS
<br>
program i.group before running i.cluster. The subgroup
should contain only the imagery band files that the user
wishes to classify. Note that this subgroup must contain
more <br>
than one band file. The purpose of the group and subgroup is
to collect map layers for classification or analysis. The
signaturefile is the file to contain result signatures <br>
which can be used as input for i.maxlik. The classes value
is the initial number of clusters to be discriminated; any
parameter values left unspecified are set to their default
<br>
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parameters: <br>
group=name <br>
The name of the group file which contains the imagery files
that the user wishes to classify.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subgroup=name <br>
The name of the subset of the group specified in group
option, which must contain only imagery band files and more
than one band file. The user must create a group and a
sub&acirc; <br>
group by running the GRASS program i.group before running
i.cluster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">signaturefile=name <br>
The name assigned to output signature file which contains
signatures of classes and can be used as the input file for
the GRASS program i.maxlik for an unsupervised
classifi&acirc; <br>
cation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">classes=value <br>
The number of clusters that will initially be identified in
the clustering process before the iterations begin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">seed=name <br>
The name of a seed signature file is optional. The seed
signatures are signatures that contain cluster means and
covariance matrices which were calculated prior to the
cur&acirc; <br>
rent run of i.cluster. They may be acquired from a
previously run of i.cluster or from a supervised
classification signature training site section (e.g., using
the signature <br>
file output by g.gui.iclass). The purpose of seed signatures
is to optimize the cluster decision boundaries (means) for
the number of clusters specified.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">sample=row_interval,col_interval
<br>
These numbers are optional with default values based on the
size of the data set such that the total pixels to be
processed is approximately 10,000 (consider round up).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iterations=value <br>
This parameter determines the maximum number of iterations
which is greater than the number of iterations predicted to
achieve the optimum percent convergence. The default <br>
value is 30. If the number of iterations reaches the maximum
designated by the user; the user may want to rerun i.cluster
with a higher number of iterations (see reportfile). <br>
Default: 30</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">convergence=value <br>
A high percent convergence is the point at which cluster
means become stable during the iteration process. The
default value is 98.0 percent. When clusters are being
cre&acirc; <br>
ated, their means constantly change as pixels are assigned
to them and the means are recalculated to include the new
pixel. After all clusters have been created, i.cluster <br>
begins iterations that change cluster means by maximizing
the distances between them. As these means shift, a higher
and higher convergence is approached. Because means <br>
will never become totally static, a percent convergence and
a maximum number of iterations are supplied to stop the
iterative process. The percent convergence should be <br>
reached before the maximum number of iterations. If the
maximum number of iterations is reached, it is probable that
the desired percent convergence was not reached. The
num&acirc; <br>
ber of iterations is reported in the cluster statistics in
the report file (see reportfile). <br>
Default: 98.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">separation=value <br>
This is the minimum separation below which clusters will be
merged in the iteration process. The default value is 0.0.
This is an image-specific number (a &quot;magic&quot;
number) <br>
that depends on the image data being classified and the
number of final clusters that are acceptable. Its
determination requires experimentation. Note that as the
minimum <br>
class (or cluster) separation is increased, the maximum
number of iterations should also be increased to achieve
this separation with a high percentage of convergence (see
<br>
convergence). <br>
Default: 0.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">min_size=value <br>
This is the minimum number of pixels that will be used to
define a cluster, and is therefore the minimum number of
pixels for which means and covariance matrices will be
cal&acirc; <br>
culated. <br>
Default: 17</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reportfile=name <br>
The reportfile is an optional parameter which contains the
result, i.e., the statistics for each cluster. Also included
are the resulting percent convergence for the clus&acirc;
<br>
ters, the number of iterations that was required to achieve
the convergence, and the separability matrix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Sampling method <br>
i.cluster does not cluster all pixels, but only a sample
(see parameter sample). The result of that clustering is not
that all pixels are assigned to a given cluster;
essen&acirc; <br>
tially, only signatures which are representative of a given
cluster are generated. When running i.cluster on the same
data asking for the same number of classes, but with
differ&acirc; <br>
ent sample sizes, likely slightly different signatures for
each cluster are obtained at each run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Algorithm used for i.cluster
<br>
The algorithm uses input parameters set by the user on the
initial number of clusters, the minimum distance between
clusters, and the correspondence between iterations which is
<br>
desired, and minimum size for each cluster. It also asks if
all pixels to be clustered, or every &quot;x&quot;th row and
&quot;y&quot;th column (sampling), the correspondence
between iterations <br>
desired, and the maximum number of iterations to be carried
out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the 1st pass, initial cluster
means for each band are defined by giving the first cluster
a value equal to the band mean minus its standard deviation,
and the last cluster a <br>
value equal to the band mean plus its standard deviation,
with all other cluster means distributed equally spaced in
between these. Each pixel is then assigned to the class
which <br>
it is closest to, distance being measured as Euclidean
distance. All clusters less than the user-specified minimum
distance are then merged. If a cluster has less than the
<br>
user-specified minimum number of pixels, all those pixels
are again reassigned to the next nearest cluster. New
cluster means are calculated for each band as the average of
<br>
raster pixel values in that band for all pixels present in
that cluster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the 2nd pass, pixels are then
again reassigned to clusters based on new cluster means. The
cluster means are then again recalculated. This process is
repeated until the cor&acirc; <br>
respondence between iterations reaches a user-specified
level, or till the maximum number of iterations specified is
over, whichever comes first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Preparing the statistics for unsupervised classification of
a LANDSAT subscene in North Carolina: <br>
g.region raster=lsat7_2002_10 -p <br>
# store VIZ, NIR, MIR into group/subgroup (leaving out TIR)
<br>
i.group group=lsat7_2002 subgroup=lsat7_2002
input=lsat7_2002_10,lsat7_2002_20,lsat7_2002_30,lsat7_2002_40,lsat7_2002_50,lsat7_2002_70
<br>
# generate signature file and report <br>
i.cluster group=lsat7_2002 subgroup=lsat7_2002
signaturefile=sig_cluster_lsat2002 classes=10
reportfile=rep_clust_lsat2002.txt <br>
To complete the unsupervised classification, i.maxlik is
subsequently used. See example in its manual page.</p>
