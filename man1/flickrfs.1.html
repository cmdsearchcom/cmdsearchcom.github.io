<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
flickrfs - virtual filesystem for flickr online photosharing
service</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ABOUT <br>
Flickrfs is a virtual filesystem which mounts on your linux
machine like any other partition. Once mounted, it retrieves
information about your photos hosted on your flickr <br>
account, and shows them as files. You can now easily copy
photos from your local machine to this mount, and it will
automatically upload them to your flickr account. Similary,
<br>
you can copy the files from your mount to your local
machine, and it will download your images from flickr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the files in the mount have
a meta file attached to them, which provides access to
title, description, tags, and license information. Modifying
any of these fields and saving <br>
the meta file, will update them on the server as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can easily specify what is
the default resolution of photos that you wish to upload,
and the fs will automatically resize (read downsize) the
photo, and upload it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That&rsquo;s not all, the latest
verion of flickrfs, provides a syncing mechanism. This
mechanism automatically syncs any changes done online
directly to flickr account (using flickr&rsquo;s <br>
web interface or any other third party apps), to your mount.
Thus, any addition/deletion/changes of sets/images is
reflected back to your mount. No stale information! You just
<br>
to mount it once, and it can be used forever!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
Configuration <br>
The first time you run flickrfs a directory .flickrfs is
created in your $HOME directory. The directory contains a
file named config.txt. Edit the file, to set the following
<br>
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[configuration] <br>
browser:/usr/bin/x-www-browser <br>
image.size:1024x768 <br>
sets.sync.int:300 <br>
stream.sync.int:300 <br>
add.default.tag:yes <br>
APIKey:f8aa9917a9ae5e44a87cae657924f42d <br>
Secret:3fbf7144be7eca28</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sync intervals are in
seconds. The default interval set is 5 mins. The sync of
/sets and /stream is irrespective of each other, so you can
change the interval values as you <br>
like.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">image.size field specifies the
default size that the photos will be resized to before
uploading. If you wish to upload the original size of
photos, leave the value blank as fol&acirc; <br>
lows. Note that, only a copy of photo is resized, your
original photo will not be resized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flickrfs will by default add the
tag &rsquo;flickrfs&rsquo; to all pictures the user uploads.
Set add.default.tag to &rsquo;no&rsquo; to disable this
feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default values of API key
and Secret used for authentication are specified in the
config file. You may change them if required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create a screen terminal
(Optional) <br>
What is screen? See screen(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Why? This will keep the fs
mounted even when you log out. Next time you log in, you can
directly access the fs, without having to mount it again.
Saves effort!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ screen -S flickrfs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mount the filesystem <br>
Check if fuse module has already been loaded in kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ lsmod | grep -i fuse</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sudo modprobe fuse #If not
loaded</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First time you are mounting the
fs, you need to close all the browser windows. Secondly, if
you are behind a proxy server, set you http_proxy
environment variable in the command <br>
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ export
http_proxy=&quot;http://proxy.address:port&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ flickrfs /mountpoint</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default web browser used is
the system one. If you use something else, you can set it in
config.txt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Your browser window will open
up, and require you to login, and allow authentication to
flickrfs. Once you do that, close your window. Flickrfs will
now start downloading infor&acirc; <br>
mation. Wait a few minutes for your sets to populate. If you
wish to view your whole stream, create a directory stream in
your mountpoint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ mkdir /mntpoint/stream</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You are ready to GO!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See flickrfs in action
(Optional) <br>
If you wish, you can view exactly what is flickrfs doing, by
checking out the log file present in $HOME/.flickrfs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tail -f ~/.flickrfs/log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unmount the fs <br>
To unmount the filesystem, execute the following command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ fusermount -u /mntpoint/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Structure <br>
Flickrfs Home Directory $HOME/.flickrfs: <br>
config.txt: <br>
Allows you to set the default image size, and the time
interval for the syncing of /sets and /stream to flickr
online server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log: log file which keeps record
of activity going on in flickrfs. Useful for debugging
purposes. In case you find a bug, post it along with this
file on the mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filesystem mount point
contains these following folders by default: <br>
/sets <br>
/sets folder contains your sets, including your private
photos. You can easily add/delete sets using standard linux
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/tags (contains /tags/personal
and /tags/public) <br>
/tags/personal folder allows search based upon tags in your
photostream. Just create a folder (use mkdir) whose name is
a colon delimited tags like &rsquo;tag1:tag2:tag3&rsquo;,
and the fs <br>
will search your photostream to match all the photos which
contain ALL these tags, and show them as files inside the
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/tags/public does the same
thing, but searches for public photos even outside your
photostream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/stream (not created by default)
<br>
/stream folder will contain ALL the photos that are present
and accessible in your photostream. Obviously these wd also
include photos from your sets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This folder is not created by
default. You need to create directory named
&rsquo;stream&rsquo; in the root of mount point for the fs
to populate the photos. Once the folder is created, it <br>
can&rsquo;t be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Feature List and Usage <br>
Integration with Berkeley DB - Minimal hardware resource
consumption by flickrfs <br>
flickrfs has been integrated with Berkeley DB using
python&rsquo;s bsddb module. Which means flickrfs would now
store the image information in Berkeley db database, instead
of storing <br>
it in memory. Let come millions of images, flickrfs would
still consume only negligible amounts of RAM. Regarding hard
disk space, it would be in order of 10s of Megabytes; not
<br>
an issue for today&rsquo;s computers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Performance increase <br>
flickrfs retrieves the sets information in parallel,
background threads. Hence, the directory structure is
created quickly, allowing users to start working. If some
sets couldn&rsquo;t <br>
be retrieved the first time, they&rsquo;d be taken care of
when *syncing* kicks in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Secondly, full metadata
information of images would only be retrieved when asked
for; though they&rsquo;ll always be listed in the directory.
Its just like the way flickrfs handles <br>
images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Robust execution of flickr
operations on small bandwidth <br>
Flickr operations, as in, interactions with flickr server
are now fail-safe. flickrfs handles the URLError exceptions
thrown by the operation, checks its result, and retries the
<br>
operation multiple times in case of failure. Thus, even if
connection is lost temporarily, flickrfs would continue its
operations unaffected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">config file would be
automatically created <br>
config.txt file, present in ~/.flickrfs would be created
automatically, if not present. Normally the default values
would be fine, but feel free to change it according to your
<br>
needs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bandwidth information of flickr
account <br>
statfs system call is now tied to the bandwidth usage
information of your flickr account. You can view it by
running a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ df -h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatic periodic syncing of fs
with online server. <br>
flickrfs will automatically sync any changes done directly
through flickr web interface/organizer or any other third
party apps, to its local mount dynamically. This include
<br>
changes to your /sets and /stream. The photos present in
/tags are not synced, simply because /tags is meant just for
searching/downloading purposes. The time interval can be
<br>
specified through config.txt file. The default interval
specified is 10 mins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Directly link photos from your
stream or tags to sets, without downloading. <br>
Use your ln command to directly add a photo present in your
/stream to a set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ ln /mntpt/stream/image.jpg
/mntpt/sets/yourset/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ ln
/mntpt/tags/personal/../image.jpg /mntpt/sets/yourset/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OR, if you wish to add a new set
altogether, just create a new dir before executing link
(ln). When you execute a mkdir, link your first photo
quickly, so that the set is created <br>
online. Otherwise, the sync thread will delete the new
directory, seeing it as incoherent with online server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ mkdir
/mntpoint/sets/newset</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatic resizing of photos
while uploading. <br>
NOTE: This does not affect the original photo. Only a copy
is resized, and uploaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your photo resolution is
high, fs will automatically downsize (a copy of it, not
original photo) to the resolution specified in config.txt
file, before uploading. This also <br>
reduces the image&rsquo;s size, thus useful to people with
limited 20MB upload limit. Note that if the image is smaller
than the specified size, it would not be resized, and the
origi&acirc; <br>
nal size will be uploaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unicode Support <br>
More robust unicode support. This feature is still in
testing mode, so if you find any bug, feel free to contact
us.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change photo meta data <br>
Title, Description, Tags, License: Use meta data file
associated to photo. For photo named img1_ID.jpg, the meta
data file will be updated to the servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ vim .image1_ID.meta</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may also use
&rsquo;sed&rsquo; to do batch operations. For e.g., To
change the licenses of all photos from license:0 &rsquo;All
rights reserved&rsquo; to license:1
&rsquo;Attribution-NonCommercial-Share&acirc; <br>
Alike License&rsquo;, execute this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sed -i -e
&rsquo;s@license:0@license:1@&rsquo; .*.meta</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Permissions: On the image that
you wish to change permissions, execute these
statements:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$chmod 755 image_ID.jpg #to make
photo public</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$chmod 774 image_ID.jpg #to make
it available to only friends and family. Not to public.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$chmod 764 image_ID.jpg #to make
it available to family only</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$chmod 754 image_ID.jpg #to make
it available to friends only</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$chmod 744 image_ID.jpg #to make
it private</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Time: Modification time of the
image is set to its last update time on flickr, while
creation time is set to the time when the image was uploaded
to flickr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ ls -l #Sort photos in asc.
order according to &rsquo;last update&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ ls -cl #Sort photos in asc.
order according to &rsquo;date uploaded&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Uploading <br>
Copy the image to either /sets/yourset or /stream, with the
directoy name as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ cp /mycamera/myimage.jpg
/mntpoint/stream:tag1:tag2:tag3/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and the photo will be uploaded
with the three tags, and an additional tag
&rsquo;flickrfs&rsquo;. Spaces in tags are allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create a new set, just create
a directory in /sets/. The first photo that you copy or link
to that directory will become the primary photo of that set.
When you execute a <br>
mkdir, copy your first photo quickly, so that the set is
created online. Otherwise, the sync thread will delete the
new directory, seeing it as incoherent with online
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ cp /mycamera/myimage.jpg
/sets/newset:tag1:tag2:tag3/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note the &rsquo;/&rsquo; at the
end of the destination paths. This is required to
differentiate b/w a filename and directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: /tags/personal can no
longer be used for uploading photos. Use /stream for
that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deleting <br>
Flickrfs doesn&rsquo;t allow/do deletion of photos. It is to
prevent a &rsquo;rm *&rsquo; accident!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can easily remove photos
from your sets though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ rm
/mntpoint/sets/myset/image1_ID.jpg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the photo is the last photo
in the set, the set will be deleted automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Searching <br>
To search your personal photos for tags: tag1, tag2 and
tag3; create a directory in /tags/personal:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ mkdir
/mntpoint/tags/personal/tags1:tags2:tags3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To search public photos, do so
in /tags/public.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directory will store the
results as files, with a maximum of 500 files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Downloading <br>
Copy the image from the mount to your local harddisk, and
the original size of the image will be downloaded. If
original size if not present, the accessible largest size of
the <br>
photo will be downloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ cp /mntpoint/../image1_ID.jpg
~/myphotos/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switch Account <br>
If you wish to switch account, just delete the folder
$HOMEDIR/.flickr. This will remove your cache, and ask for
authentication next time you mount the fs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ rm -R ~/.flickr/*</p>
