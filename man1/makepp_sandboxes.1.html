There are a couple of reasons that you might want to partition the file tree for
  a makepp build:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If you know that the majority of the tree is not affected
      by any changes made to source files since the previous build, then you can
      tell makepp to assume that files in those parts of the tree are already
      up-to-date, which means not even implicitly loading their makefiles, let
      alone computing and checking their dependencies. (Note that explicitly
      loaded makefiles are still loaded, however.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If you have multiple makepp processes accessing the same
      tree, then you want to raise an error if you detect that two concurrent
      processes are writing the same part of the tree, or that one process is
      reading a part of the tree that a concurrent process is writing. Either
      way, you have a race condition in which the relative order of events in
      two concurrent processes (which cannot be guaranteed) may affect the
      result.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Makepp has sandboxing facilities that address both concerns.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Sandboxing_Options"><a class="selflink" href="#Sandboxing_Options">Sandboxing
  Options</a></h2>
The following makepp options may be used to set the sandboxing properties of the
  subtree given by <i>path</i> and all of its files and potential files:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--dont-build <i>path</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--do-build <i>path</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set or reset the &quot;dont-build&quot; property. Any file
      with this property set is assumed to be up-to-date already, and no build
      checks will be performed. The default is reset (i.e.
      &quot;do-build&quot;), except if you have a &quot;RootMakeppfile&quot;, in
      which case everything outside of its subtree id
    &quot;dont-build&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--sandbox <i>path</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--in-sandbox <i>path</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--inside-sandbox <i>path</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--out-of-sandbox <i>path</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set or reset the &quot;in-sandbox&quot; property. An error
      is raised if makepp would otherwise write a file with this property reset.
      Build checks are still performed, unless the &quot;dont-build&quot;
      property is also set. The default is set (i.e. &quot;in-sandbox&quot;),
      unless there are any <b>--sandbox</b> options, in which case the default
      for all other files is reset (i.e. &quot;out-of-sandbox&quot;).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--sandbox-warn</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--sandbox-warning</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Downgrade violations of &quot;in-sandbox&quot; and
      &quot;dont-read&quot; to warnings instead of errors. This is useful when
      there are hundreds of violations, so that you can collect all of them in a
      single run and take appropriate corrective action. Otherwise, you see only
      one violation per makepp invocation, and you don't know how many are left
      until they're all fixed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--dont-read <i>path</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--do-read <i>path</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set or reset the &quot;dont-read&quot; property. An error
      is raised if makepp would otherwise read a file with this property set.
      The default is reset (i.e. &quot;do-read&quot;).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--virtual-sandbox</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Don't rewrite build infos of files that were not created by
      this makepp process. This is useful when running concurrent makepp
      processes with overlapping sandboxes, and you are certain that no two
      processes will attempt to build the same target. Makepp will then refrain
      from caching additional information about files that it reads, because
      there might be other concurrent readers.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each of these 3 properties applies to the entire subtree, including to files
  that do not yet exist. More specific paths override less specific paths. A
  specified path may be an individual file, even if the file does not yet exist.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a property is both set and reset on the exact same path, then the option that
  appears furthest to the right on the command line takes precedence.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Sandboxing_for_Acceleration"><a class="selflink" href="#Sandboxing_for_Acceleration">Sandboxing
  for Acceleration</a></h2>
If you want to prevent makepp from wasting time processing files that you know
  are already up-to-date (in particular, files that are generated by a build
  tool other than makepp), then <b>--dont-build</b> is the option for you.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By far the most common case for such an optimization is that you know that
  everything not at or below the starting directory is already up-to-date. This
  can be communicated to makepp using &quot; <b>--dont-build /. --do-build
  .</b>&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Sandboxing_for_Concurrent_Processes"><a class="selflink" href="#Sandboxing_for_Concurrent_Processes">Sandboxing
  for Concurrent Processes</a></h2>
One technique that can reduce build latency is to have multiple makepp processes
  working on the same tree. This is quite a bit more difficult to manage than
  using the <b>-j</b> option, but it can also be substantially more effective
  because:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">With sandboxing, the processes may be running on multiple
      hosts, for example, via a job queuing system. Increasing the <b>-j</b>
      limit eventually exhausts the CPU resources of a single host, and can even
      slow the build due to excessive process forking.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>-j</b> does not currently parallelize some of makepp's
      time-consuming tasks such as loading makefiles, scanning, building
      implicit dependencies while scanning, and checking dependencies.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The biggest risk with this approach is that the build can become
  nondeterministic if processes that might be concurrent interact with one
  another. This leads to build systems that produce incorrect results
  sporadically, and with no simple mechanism to determine why it happens.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To address this risk, it is advisable to partition the tree among concurrent
  processes such that if any process accesses the filesystem improperly, then an
  error is deterministically raised immediately. Normally, this is accomplished
  by assigning to each concurrent process a &quot;sandbox&quot; in which it is
  allowed to write, where the sandboxes of no two concurrent processes may
  overlap.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition, each process marks the sandboxes of any other possibly concurrent
  processes as &quot;dont-read.&quot; If a process reads a file that another
  concurrent process is responsible for writing (and which therefore might not
  yet be written), then an error is raised immediately.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Sandboxing_for_Sequential_Processes"><a class="selflink" href="#Sandboxing_for_Sequential_Processes">Sandboxing
  for Sequential Processes</a></h2>
When the build is partitioned for concurrent makepp processes, there is also
  usually a sequential relationship between various pairs of processes. For
  example, there may be a dozen concurrent compile processes, followed by a
  single link process that cannot begin until all of the compile processes have
  completed. Such sequential relationships must be enforced by whatever
  mechanism is orchestrating the various makepp processes (for example, the job
  queuing system).
<div class="Pp"></div>
When processes have a known sequential relationship, there is normally no need
  to raise an error when they access the same part of the tree, because the
  result is nonetheless deterministic.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, it is generally beneficial to specify <b>--dont-build</b> options to
  the dependent process (the link process in our example) that notify it of the
  areas that have already been updated by the prerequisite processes (the
  compile jobs in our example). In this manner, we avoid most of the unnecessary
  work of null-building targets that were just updated.
