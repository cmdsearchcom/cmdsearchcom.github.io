makepp_sandboxes -- How to partition a makepp build</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
D: --do-build, <br>
--dont-build, <br>
--dont-read, <br>
--do-read, I: --in-sandbox, <br>
--inside-sandbox, O: --out-of-sandbox, S: --sandbox, <br>
--sandbox-warn, <br>
--sandbox-warning, V: --virtual-sandbox</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a couple of reasons
that you might want to partition the file tree for a makepp
build:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If you know that the majority
of the tree is not affected by any changes made to source
files since the previous build, then you can tell makepp to
assume that files in those <br>
parts of the tree are already up-to-date, which means not
even implicitly loading their makefiles, let alone computing
and checking their dependencies. (Note that explicitly <br>
loaded makefiles are still loaded, however.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If you have multiple makepp
processes accessing the same tree, then you want to raise an
error if you detect that two concurrent processes are
writing the same part of the <br>
tree, or that one process is reading a part of the tree that
a concurrent process is writing. Either way, you have a race
condition in which the relative order of events in <br>
two concurrent processes (which cannot be guaranteed) may
affect the result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makepp has sandboxing facilities
that address both concerns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sandboxing Options <br>
The following makepp options may be used to set the
sandboxing properties of the subtree given by path and all
of its files and potential files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dont-build path <br>
--do-build path <br>
Set or reset the &quot;dont-build&quot; property. Any file
with this property set is assumed to be up-to-date already,
and no build checks will be performed. The default is reset
<br>
(i.e. &quot;do-build&quot;), except if you have a
&quot;RootMakeppfile&quot;, in which case everything outside
of its subtree id &quot;dont-build&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sandbox path <br>
--in-sandbox path <br>
--inside-sandbox path <br>
--out-of-sandbox path <br>
Set or reset the &quot;in-sandbox&quot; property. An error
is raised if makepp would otherwise write a file with this
property reset. Build checks are still performed, unless the
<br>
&quot;dont-build&quot; property is also set. The default is
set (i.e. &quot;in-sandbox&quot;), unless there are any
--sandbox options, in which case the default for all other
files is reset <br>
(i.e. &quot;out-of-sandbox&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sandbox-warn <br>
--sandbox-warning <br>
Downgrade violations of &quot;in-sandbox&quot; and
&quot;dont-read&quot; to warnings instead of errors. This is
useful when there are hundreds of violations, so that you
can collect all of them <br>
in a single run and take appropriate corrective action.
Otherwise, you see only one violation per makepp invocation,
and you don&rsquo;t know how many are left until
they&rsquo;re all <br>
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dont-read path <br>
--do-read path <br>
Set or reset the &quot;dont-read&quot; property. An error is
raised if makepp would otherwise read a file with this
property set. The default is reset (i.e.
&quot;do-read&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--virtual-sandbox <br>
Don&rsquo;t rewrite build infos of files that were not
created by this makepp process. This is useful when running
concurrent makepp processes with overlapping sandboxes, and
you <br>
are certain that no two processes will attempt to build the
same target. Makepp will then refrain from caching
additional information about files that it reads, because
<br>
there might be other concurrent readers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each of these 3 properties
applies to the entire subtree, including to files that do
not yet exist. More specific paths override less specific
paths. A specified path may be an <br>
individual file, even if the file does not yet exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a property is both set and
reset on the exact same path, then the option that appears
furthest to the right on the command line takes
precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sandboxing for Acceleration <br>
If you want to prevent makepp from wasting time processing
files that you know are already up-to-date (in particular,
files that are generated by a build tool other than makepp),
<br>
then --dont-build is the option for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By far the most common case for
such an optimization is that you know that everything not at
or below the starting directory is already up-to-date. This
can be communicated to <br>
makepp using &quot;--dont-build /. --do-build .&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sandboxing for Concurrent
Processes <br>
One technique that can reduce build latency is to have
multiple makepp processes working on the same tree. This is
quite a bit more difficult to manage than using the -j
option, <br>
but it can also be substantially more effective because:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; With sandboxing,
the processes may be running on multiple hosts, for example,
via a job queuing system. Increasing the -j limit eventually
exhausts the CPU resources of a <br>
single host, and can even slow the build due to excessive
process forking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; -j does not
currently parallelize some of makepp&rsquo;s time-consuming
tasks such as loading makefiles, scanning, building implicit
dependencies while scanning, and checking <br>
dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The biggest risk with this
approach is that the build can become nondeterministic if
processes that might be concurrent interact with one
another. This leads to build systems <br>
that produce incorrect results sporadically, and with no
simple mechanism to determine why it happens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To address this risk, it is
advisable to partition the tree among concurrent processes
such that if any process accesses the filesystem improperly,
then an error is <br>
deterministically raised immediately. Normally, this is
accomplished by assigning to each concurrent process a
&quot;sandbox&quot; in which it is allowed to write, where
the sandboxes of <br>
no two concurrent processes may overlap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, each process marks
the sandboxes of any other possibly concurrent processes as
&quot;dont-read.&quot; If a process reads a file that
another concurrent process is responsible <br>
for writing (and which therefore might not yet be written),
then an error is raised immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sandboxing for Sequential
Processes <br>
When the build is partitioned for concurrent makepp
processes, there is also usually a sequential relationship
between various pairs of processes. For example, there may
be a <br>
dozen concurrent compile processes, followed by a single
link process that cannot begin until all of the compile
processes have completed. Such sequential relationships must
be <br>
enforced by whatever mechanism is orchestrating the various
makepp processes (for example, the job queuing system).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When processes have a known
sequential relationship, there is normally no need to raise
an error when they access the same part of the tree, because
the result is nonetheless <br>
deterministic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, it is generally
beneficial to specify --dont-build options to the dependent
process (the link process in our example) that notify it of
the areas that have already been <br>
updated by the prerequisite processes (the compile jobs in
our example). In this manner, we avoid most of the
unnecessary work of null-building targets that were just
updated.</p>
