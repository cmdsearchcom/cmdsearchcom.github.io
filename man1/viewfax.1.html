<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
viewfax - display fax files in an X11 window</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
viewfax [-fnluirvW24] [-hheight] [-wwidth] [-zzoom]
[-ddisplay] [-gwxh+x+y] [-bbell] [-mmemory] filename...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
viewfax displays one or more fax files in an X11 window. The
input files may be either raw, single-page faxes received by
a fax modem with a program such as mgetty(1), or tiff <br>
files such as those used by hylafax. The first (or only)
page of &quot;PC-Research&quot;-style (DigiFAX) files
produced by the ghostscript dfaxhigh or dfaxlow drivers can
also be dis&acirc; <br>
played.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input files using any common fax
encoding such as group 3 (1 and 2 dimensional) and group 4
can be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fax images are rendered at
full resolution and then successively scaled down by a
linear factor of 2 prior to display, until they fit on the
screen. The display can be con&acirc; <br>
trolled interactively using mouse and keyboard commands. The
left mouse button expands the image by a factor of two and
the right button reduces it by the same factor. If the <br>
image is bigger than the available window size, the middle
mouse button can be used to reposition it within the window.
Hold down the middle button while dragging the image to <br>
its new position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the mouse has a scroll-wheel
it can be used to move an oversized image vertically. With
the shift key depressed, the wheel scrolls through the
pages. The shift sense is <br>
inverted if viewfax is started with -W on the
command-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Further interaction is
controlled by single-key commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h or Help <br>
displays a page of help information. Type &rsquo;q&rsquo; to
return to the original document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p or Prior or PgUP or - or
BackSpace <br>
displays the previous page from the command-line list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n or Next or PgDn or + or space
<br>
displays the next page from the command-line list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift HOME <br>
displays the first page from the command-line list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift END <br>
displays the last page from the command-line list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">z zoom in (same as right mouse
button).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift Z <br>
zoom out (same as left mouse button).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u turns the image upside down,
which is useful if the fax was originally fed the wrong way
into the machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift U <br>
turns this and all following pages upside down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l turns the image through 90
degrees, to view landscape text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift L <br>
turns this and all following pages sideways.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m produce a left/right mirror
image of the page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift M <br>
mirror this and all following pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cursor arrows <br>
reposition the displayed image if it exceeds the window
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME repositions so that the top
left corner is visible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">END makes the bottom right
corner visible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print if the environment
variable VIEWFAX_PRINT is defined, the current page is
printed. All pages are printed with Shift Print.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e if the environment variable
VIEWFAX_EDIT is defined, the current page is passed to the
editor. All input files can be edited with Shift e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q terminates the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift Q <br>
terminates the program with non-zero exit status. Can be
used to abort a shell script, e.g. when the user is
previewing an outbound fax and decides not to send it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
viewfax is designed to &quot;do the right thing&quot; when
given just a filename. Special cases can be handled with the
following options. (Note that tiff-files contain a header
which <br>
overrides the -f, -n, -h, -w, -l, -m, and -u flags.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f indicates that raw input
files are fine resolution (7.7 lines/mm) faxes. This is the
default unless the filename begins with &quot;fn&quot;. Tiff
and &quot;PC-Research&quot; (DigiFAX) files <br>
are self-specifying.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n indicates that raw input
files are normal resolution (3.85 lines/mm) faxes. Each fax
line is duplicated in the displayed image to give
approximately equal vertical and <br>
horizontal scales.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hheight <br>
specifies the number of fax lines. If this option is
missing, viewfax counts the number of lines in the input
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wwidth <br>
specifies the number of pixels in each scan-line. The
default value is 1728.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l display in landscape
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u turn the image upside
down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i invert pixels
(black/white).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b preferred warning style:
&rsquo;a&rsquo; for audible bell (console beep),
&rsquo;v&rsquo; for visible bell (flash the window),
&rsquo;n&rsquo; for neither. &rsquo;v&rsquo; is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d or -display <br>
use specified X server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g or -geometry <br>
the preferred size and position of the window, specified as
widthxheight+x+y. If a position is given (x and y values),
viewfax asks the window manager to place the window <br>
there. The initial size of the window is constrained to be
at most widthxheight.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the window is subsequently
resized due to the user zooming in or out, the geometry is
taken as a constraint on the screen area which may be used
by viewfax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not supply a geometry
value, everything works fine with ICCCM-compliant window
managers like olwm, mwm, twm, and tvtwm. When fully zoomed
out the viewfax window <br>
will occupy the entire screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users of fvwm will notice that
the title bar and left border are moved off screen when
viewfax repositions the window to (0,0). A workaround is to
use -geometry +5+23 <br>
when using fvwm. The proper fix would be for someone to
update the routine HandleConfigureRequest() in fvwm/events.c
to correspond to the code in twm/events.c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmemory limit <br>
each page is kept in memory after being fetched and
expanded, which saves time if the user returns to it in the
same session. To prevent viewfax from using all the
avail&acirc; <br>
able swap space, a limit is placed on the total size of
cached images. This defaults to 4 MBytes, enough for about 6
typical pages. If the memory limit is exceeded, old <br>
images are discarded and must be reloaded from disk if the
user returns to them. The operation of this mechanism is
transparent apart from the occasional delays due to <br>
reloading. The value specified on the command line can be
suffixed k or m for kilo- or megabytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r the bit order of the bytes in
the input file is reversed. The fax specification deals only
with serial data transmission. Modem manufacturers have to
decide whether the <br>
first bit received should be placed in the most significant
or the least significant position in a byte. The consensus
is to pack most significant first, but the -r flag <br>
is available to deal with the opposite order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v produce some informative
messages (verbose mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-zzoom specifies an initial zoom
factor. A full-scale fax will usually not fit on the screen.
If the -z option is not specified, viewfax scales the image
by a power of 2 such <br>
that it is fully visible at a reduced size. The user can
then use the mouse buttons (see above) to view expanded
portions of the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2 Assume that raw input files
use group 3 two dimensional coding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 Assume that raw input files
use group 4 coding. The number of fax lines (-h option) is
required in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
VIEWFAX_PRINT <br>
Defines a command that will print one or more fax pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VIEWFAX_EDIT <br>
Defines a command that will calls an editor on one or more
fax pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These two variables are
optional. If a variable is undefined, the corresponding
keyboard command is ignored. If the variable is defined, it
should contain the name of a command <br>
or executable script that performs the desired function. The
command should process a single page if called with a -p
page-number argument. Alternatively, if can be called with
<br>
just a list of filenames, meaning that all pages should be
processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an oversimplified
example of a print command. Note that it assumes that the
format is tiff and will fail when handed a raw fax file.
<br>
VIEWFAX_PRINT=printfax</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g3topbm(1) and xv(1) can be used

than using viewfax, but xv has many capabilities for
manipulating the image and saving <br>
it in other formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The user interface does not comply with any known style
guide. <br>
The help text looks moth-eaten because it is encoded as a
fax. This avoids dealing with X11 fonts. <br>
The program does not refer to the X resources database.</p>
