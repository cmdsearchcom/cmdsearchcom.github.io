<p>COURIERMLM(1) Double Precision, Inc. COURIERMLM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
couriermlm - The Courier mailing list manager</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
couriermlm {command} {directory} [arg...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
couriermlm is the Courier mail server&rsquo;s mailing list
manager. This command sets up, maintains, and manages
mailing lists. couriermlm automatically handles requests to
subscribe <br>
and unsubscribe list members, detects undeliverable
addresses and removes them from the subscription rolls.
Mailing lists managed by couriermlm require zero human
administrative <br>
oversight. couriermlm supports digests, write-only posting
aliases, and moderated mailing lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CREATING A MAILING LIST <br>
Anyone can use couriermlm, not just the system
administrator. The Courier mail server mail server
translates an address list-name@domain as a local address
with a corresponding <br>
dot-courier(5)[1] file. Anyone that can install a
dot-courier(5)[1] file, and can schedule cron(8) jobs, can
run a couriermlm mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the system
administrator can optionally remove the dot-courier(5)[1]
support from the the Courier mail server. couriermlm will
not work in that case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting up a mailing list
consists of the following steps:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run couriermlm create <br>
Use this command to create a directory where couriermlm
keeps all mailing list related files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configure the mailing list <br>
The couriermlm create command initializes the mailing list
subdirectory with some default template responses. It is
necessary to customize them for your mailing list, and it
<br>
may be necessary to issue some additional commands in order
to configure appropriate mailing list options -- such as
enabling unrestricted posting privileges, and enabling <br>
moderation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create dot-courier(5)[1] files
<br>
Set up to run couriermlm to distribute mailing list
messages, and process requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set up cron(8) <br>
You need to set up cron(8) jobs to run the couriermlm hourly
and couriermlm daily commands, which perform regular mailing
list maintenance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Back up subscription lists <br>
As part of your daily job you should also run the export
command, in order to back up the mailing list subscriber
information. In the event that the mailing list database
<br>
gets corrupted or lost, you can restore it from this backup
file. See the export command for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
Setting up a digest for the mailing list requires additional
steps. See &quot;Setting up a mailing list digest[2]&quot;
below for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first step is to run the
following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriermlm create directory
ADDRESS=list@domain</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">directory is the mailing list
directory that will be managed by couriermlm. This directory
should not be created in advance, this command creates this
directory, and initializes <br>
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list@domain is the mailing
list&rsquo;s address, the address that sends messages to the
mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An additional setting, URL may
also be specified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriermlm create directory
ADDRESS=list@domain URL=url</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;url&acirc; would be the
URL of the WebMLM web page for this mailing list. See
webmlmd(1)[3] for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directory created by
couriermlm create is initialized to contain a number of text
files that couriermlm sends back as replies to
administrative commands. It is necessary to <br>
edit these template files and adjust the text in those files
for this mailing list. All template filenames end with
.tmpl, and their contents are self explanatory. Some
important <br>
template files are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help.tmpl <br>
This text is returned in response to the help command. This
text must be modified depending upon whether this mailing
list is a moderated mailing list, has a digest version, <br>
or if any other non-default configuration options are set
for the mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub.tmpl <br>
This is the reply that&rsquo;s sent back in response to a
subscription request. Less important is unsub.tmpl, which is
the response to a request to unsubscribe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub2.tmpl <br>
This is the successful subscription confirmation. A brief
overview of the mailing list might be appropriate here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriermlm has rudimentary
support for non-English templates. The couriermlm create
command has a single, optional parameter, --lang=suffix The
option must be specified after the <br>
mailing list directory&rsquo;s name:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriermlm create directory
--lang=es ADDRESS=list@domain URL=url</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The templates for the stock text
files come from /usr/lib/courier/couriermlm. This directory
contains all the *.tmpl and *.html template files that
couriermlm create installs in <br>
the new mailing list directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Translated versions of template
files are installed in the same directory,
/usr/lib/courier/couriermlm. The translated version of file
must be installed as file.suffix, for <br>
example: help.tmpl.es is the translated version of
help.tmpl, with the &acirc;es&acirc; suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --lang=suffix option
installs the the .suffix version of each text template file,
if available. If not, the stock English template file gets
copied, as usual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
Do not remove the English template files, even if you never
use them. They must be left in place, in
/usr/lib/courier/couriermlm, for couriermlm create to work
correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriermlm create
/home/lists/users-list --lang=es ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example installs the *.es
versions of mailing list template files. Only the stock,
English template files come with the Courier mail server.
This mechanism only provides an <br>
easy integration ability with template files from other
sources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are some additional
configuration files that can be modified to suit your
taste:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">headeradd <br>
This file can be initialized to contain any mail headers
that will be automatically added to every mailing list
message. The contents of this file are simply prepended to
<br>
every message that goes out. Blank lines are not
allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">headerdel <br>
This file lists any headers that will be automatically
removed from every mailing list message before it&rsquo;s
sent. List each header one per line, including the :
character. For <br>
example, to remove all Received: and Date: headers from
every message, initialize this file to contain the following
two lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Received: <br>
Date:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both the headeradd and headerdel
files can be used to implement a popular feature of setting
the replies to every message to go to the mailing list.
Having &quot;Reply-To:&quot; in <br>
headerdel, removes any existing Reply-To: header, and then
having &quot;Reply-To: list@domain&quot; in headeradd
appends a fixed Reply-To: header to every message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The create command also creates
the following subdirectories in the mailing list
directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sublist <br>
This subdirectory has the database files that contain the
mailing list&rsquo;s subscription list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unsublist <br>
This subdirectory stores files that contain information
about addresses that have been unsubscribed from the mailing
list. This information might be of some use when tracking
<br>
down an old subscription. The contents of this directory are
not automatically purged, you must set up your own purging
mechanism for this directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">commands, commands.dat <br>
These directories store temporary files that contain pending
(unconfirmed) commands for the mailing list manager. The
couriermlm commands hourly and daily must be executed <br>
regularly in order to periodically purge stale entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modqueue <br>
Messages awaiting moderator approval (for moderated
lists).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archive <br>
Messages received by this mailing list will be stored here,
in addition to being forwarded to subscribers. couriermlm
does not automatically do any purging on this <br>
subdirectory, you must set up your own archiving mechanism
that cleans out this subdirectory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last step involves
installing a couple of dot-courier(5)[1] files that run
couriermlm to receive mailing list messages and
administrative commands. The mailing list address, <br>
list@domain, corresponds to some dot-courier(5)[1] file. For
example, if your system account is john, and your mail
domain is example.com, then the dot-courier(5)[1] file for
the <br>
mailing list &lt;john-list@example.com&gt; is
$HOME/.courier-list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Let&rsquo;s say that the
dot-courier(5)[1] file is $HOME/.courier-list. To properly
support the mailing list, the following dot-courier(5)[1]
files will have to be initialized as <br>
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.courier-list <br>
This file should be initialized to contain the following
delivery instruction:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">| /usr/bin/couriermlm msg
directory <br>
directory is the created mailing list directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.courier-list-owner <br>
This file should contain the appropriate delivery
instructions for forwarding all mail addressed to
&lt;list-owner@domain&gt; to the address of the owner of the
mailing list. This <br>
can be another E-mail address, or a mailbox
specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.courier-list-default <br>
This file should be initialized to contain the following
delivery instruction:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">| /usr/bin/couriermlm ctlmsg
directory <br>
directory is the created mailing list directory. This
dot-courier(5)[1] file provides support for all other
addresses of the form &lt;list-command@domain&gt;, where
command is a <br>
mailing list administrative command. Commands are sent to
this mailing list manager by sending a message to one of
several special addresses, described more fully in
&quot;Mailing <br>
list commands[4]&quot;, below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MANUAL COMMANDS <br>
couriermlm may also be run manually from the command line as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/bin/couriermlm command
directory [ options... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command is a command from the
following list. directory is the mailing list directory. The
commands are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">create <br>
Create a mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update <br>
Update/restore mailing list templates. The original,
default, mailing list message template files (*.tmpl and
*.tmpl.html) are reinstalled into the mailing list
directory. <br>
This command must be processed for every mailing list
directory after upgrading to the Courier server version
0.55, or later, from earlier versions (but see below). <br>
couriermlm in version 0.55 of the Courier mail server uses
updated templates files, which must be installed in every
mailing list directory. Although the names of many <br>
template files have not changed, the embedded markup codes
in the template files work differently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Begin by making a backup copy
of all *.tmpl files in the existing couriermlm mailing list
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Run the &acirc;update&acirc;
command on the list directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Review the backed up template
files, identify your customized changes, then retype them
into new template files installed by the
&acirc;update&acirc; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Proceed to the next mailing
list directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Yes, this is going to be a pain.
This is the first overhaul of couriermlm&rsquo;s
infrastructure in many years. Once a decade, some elbow
grease must be sacrificed in the name of <br>
progress. It&rsquo;s not the end of the world.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In an extreme emergency,
preserve the couriermlm from the previous version of the
Courier mail server. Mass-update all existing lists&rsquo;
.courier-list and .courier-list-default <br>
files to run the old couriermlm. Then, migrate each mailing
list on a predetermined schedule. After migrating each list,
put the default path back into the list&rsquo;s .courier
<br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keep in mind the following
issues, while migrating the lists:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The help.tmpl
template file is usually the one that gets customized the
most. In most cases, large bits and pieces of this file,
that document certain list options that <br>
do not apply to this list, must be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; There are
several new template files, including a number of *.html
files that refer to new HTML-formatted responses from
couriermlm, and the WebMLM interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Be aware of
updated mail headers declared in several template files. The
MIME character set is now given as utf-8. Some templates no
longer contain the Mime-Version and <br>
Subject headers. The Subject headers are moved to separate
template files. Many existing template files now contain
both a plain text and an HTML-formatted version of the <br>
couriermlm response. Always scroll to the end of each
template file, to reveal any appended HTML portion of
template&rsquo;s text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set <br>
Set mailing list options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub <br>
Manually subscribe an address to the mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unsub <br>
Manually unsubscribe an address from the mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lsub <br>
List all the subscribers to this mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">laliases <br>
List write-only aliases for this mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export <br>
Export mailing list subscriber information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">import <br>
Import mailing list subscriber information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ctlmsg <br>
Receive and interpret a control message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info <br>
Display a subscription record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msg <br>
Post a message to the mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hourly <br>
Perform hourly maintenance. It is necessary to set up a
cron(8) job to execute the hourly command once an hour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">daily <br>
Perform daily maintenance. It is necessary to set up a
cron(8) job to execute the daily command once a day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">digest <br>
Create a digest. See &quot;Setting up a mailing list
digest[2]&quot; below for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MANUAL SUBSCRIPTION MANAGEMENT
<br>
The sub, unsub, lsub, laliases, export, and import commands
allow manual subscription list management. Normally,
subscription-related commands are done by sending an
appropriate <br>
mailing list command, see &quot;Mailing List
Commands[4]&quot;, below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriermlm sub directory
user@domain</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command adds the address
&lt;user@domain&gt; to the subscription list. couriermlm
will now read a free-form comment or a note from standard
input, terminated by an end-of-file <br>
(usually CTRL-D). The free-form comment is stored in the
subscription database, together with the address, and is
shown by the &quot;info&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriermlm unsub directory
user@domain</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command remove the address
&lt;user@domain&gt; from the subscription rolls. couriermlm
will also read a free-form comment, which is added to the
subscription record. After <br>
removing this address from the subscription rolls, its
subscription record is archived in the directory/unsublist
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriermlm lsub directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command lists all the
addresses subscribed to the list, on standard output, one
per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriermlm laliases
directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command lists all
write-only aliases that have been subscribed to the list,
together with the subscriber address that added each alias.
See &quot;Write-Only Aliases[5]&quot; for more <br>
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriermlm export directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The export command lists the
contents of the subscription database on standard output.
The export command produces the following output format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">address <br>
subscription information <br>
... <br>
address <br>
subscription information <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;address&quot;, is an
address subscribed to the mailing list. This is followed by
its corresponding subscription information, usually a copy
of the subscription request that was used <br>
to add the address to the mailing list. The subscription
information is terminated by a line containing a single
period. Any lines in the subscription information that begin
with <br>
a period have an extra period prepended to them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriermlm import directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The import command reads on
standard input a previously exported mailing list
subscription database, and adds those addresses to the
indicated mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is highly recommended to make
a regular backup of subscriber information using the export
command, in the event that the subscription database gets
corrupted. In which case <br>
the import command can be used to rebuild the subscription
database, in absence of any direct backups of the database
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETTING MAILING LIST OPTIONS
<br>
The set command sets various list options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriermlm set directory
option=value option=value...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
Setting the ADDRESS or the URL options, described below,
automatically updates the contents of the headeradd
configuration file. Its existing &acirc;List-&acirc; headers
are removed and <br>
replaced by updated &acirc;List-&acirc; headers that reflect
the revised list address or URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One or more options can be set
with the same command. The available options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADDRESS=address <br>
The base E-mail address for this mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">URL=address <br>
The URL of WebMLM web page for this mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
WebMLM determines its own URL automatically, by reading its
HTTP headers. This setting is used by couriermlm, which has
no knowledge of the web server&rsquo;s configuration, <br>
and needs to know the correct URL to insert into generated
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CASESENSITIVE=flag <br>
If flag is &quot;1&quot;, the userid portion of E-mail
addresses are case-sensitive. The domain address portion is
always case-insensitive. The default setting is
&quot;0&quot; making both <br>
userid and domain address portions of E-mail addresses
case-insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
Be careful when changing this setting on an active list.
Changing this option to &acirc;CASESENSITIVE=1&acirc;,
forces all existing subscribers to make sure their addresses
are <br>
lowercase-only, otherwise they will no longer be recognized
as subscribers. Changing this option to
&acirc;CASESENSITIVE=0&acirc; blocks all subscribed
addresses that have uppercase <br>
characters in the userid portion of their E-mail address.
They will continue to receive mailing list traffic, but
unable to post messages to the list, or unsubscribe from
<br>
it. It will not be possible to unsubscribe those addresses
even by running the couriermlm command manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIGEST=directory <br>
Enable digests. directory is the pathname to the
previously-createddigest list directory. See &quot;Setting
up a mailing list digest[2]&quot; below for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEYWORD=keyword <br>
Set the subject line keyword for mailing list messages. If
set, couriermlm inserts &quot;[keyword]&quot; into the
subject of every mailing list message, to aid sorting by the
<br>
recipients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAXBOUNCES=n <br>
Maximum number of bounce notifications sent by the hourly
command, in order to prevent the mail system from being
overloaded. The default is 20 bounce notifications. Any <br>
unsent notifications will be carried over to the next hourly
job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAXMODNOTICES=n <br>
Maximum number of moderation reminders sent by the hourly
command, in order to prevent the mail system from being
overloaded. The default is 20 moderation reminders. Any <br>
unsent reminders will be carried over to the next hourly
job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAXFETCHSIZE=K <br>
Maximum size, in kilobytes, of a response to the fetch
command. The default is 100Kb. This option is used to
minimize the impact of abusive requests for the entire
archive, <br>
with a forged return address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME=name <br>
The name that&rsquo;s listed on the return address of
administrative messages. Note that if name contains spaces,
you should quote this argument in the shell. The default
value is <br>
&quot;Courier Mailing List Manager&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOBOZOS=flag <br>
If flag is &quot;0&quot; couriermlm will not attempt to
block misdirected subscribes and unsubscribes that are sent
to the mailing list&rsquo;s posting address. If flag is
&quot;1&quot; (the default), <br>
those kinds of messages will be bounced appropriately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NODSN=flag <br>
If flag is &quot;1&quot; couriermlm will use a Delivery
Status Notification setting of &quot;never&quot; when it
sends confirmation requests and help messages: this should
reduce the amount of <br>
useless failure notifications generated when couriermlm
dutifully replies to spam received by the mailing list
administrative addresses, i.e. -(un)subscribe and -help. If
<br>
flag is &quot;0&quot; (the default), a DSN setting of
&quot;fail&quot; will be used. Please see
sendmail(1)&rsquo;s -n option for more details on the DSN
setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POST=option <br>
Set posting options. option is one of three values:
&quot;subscribers&quot; - only subscribers may post messages
to this mailing list (this is the default); &quot;all&quot;
- anyone can post <br>
messages to this mailing list; &quot;mod&quot; - only
subscribers may post, and messages are sent to the list
owner for approval (moderation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSTARCHIVE=option <br>
Set access to archived messages. option is either:
&quot;all&quot; - Anyone can access the mailing list
archive; or &quot;subscribers&quot; - only subscribers can
access the archive. The <br>
default is &quot;all&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PURGEARCHIVE=d <br>
Purge archived mailing list messages after d days. The
default is 0 days - messages are never removed from the
archive subdirectory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PURGEBOUNCE=d <br>
Wait d days for the probe message, that automatically
unsubscribes undeliverable addresses, to bounce (default: 14
days). Probe messages are sent three days (default) after
<br>
the first message to an address bounces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PURGECMD=h <br>
Purge unconfirmed subscribe/unsubscribe requests after h
hours (default: 48 hours).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMODERATE=h <br>
Resend a moderation reminder after h hours (default: 12
hours).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORTADDR=address <br>
Mail daily reports of new and removed subscribers to this
address. Must be set in order to receive reports. Provide an
empty address to stop reporting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIMPLECONFIRM=n <br>
If n is 1, confirmation requests may be acknowledged without
adding &acirc;yes&acirc; to the subject line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
The text in sub.tmpl, unsub.tmpl, and help.tmpl may need
adjusting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUBSCRIBE=option <br>
Set subscription options. option is either &quot;all&quot;,
meaning that anyone can subscribe, or &quot;mod&quot;,
meaning moderated subscription requests, where all
subscription requests are <br>
sent to the mailing list owner for approval. The default is
&quot;all&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STARTPROBE=n <br>
Send a probe to a bouncing address n days after receiving
the first bounce. Basically this means that an address must
bounce for at least n days before it gets a probe <br>
message. The default is 3 days.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option names and settings are
case sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
If you set up a digest list, you MUST set identical
POSTARCHIVE option for both the main list and the digest
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAYING A SUBSCRIPTION RECORD
<br>
The info command displays the subscription record for the
requested address:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriermlm info directory
user@domain</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This displays the subscription
record for &quot;user@domain&quot;, which typically consists
of a copy of the initial subscription request, and
confirmation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SENDING MESSAGES TO THE MAILING
LIST <br>
The msg commands reads an E-mail message on standard input,
and mails the contents of the message to the mailing
list&rsquo;s subscribers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the POST option is set to
&quot;subscribers&quot;, the message is rejected unless the
address in its From: header is a subscriber to this mailing
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control files headeradd and
headerdel are read, and are applied to the message, as
described previously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAILING LIST COMMANDS <br>
Mailing list commands can be sent via E-mail to couriermlm
by sending a message to &lt;list-command@domain&gt;. The
&quot;default&quot; dot-courier(5)[1] file runs couriermlm
to receive mail for <br>
all addresses of this form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriermlm reads the DEFAULT
environment variable, which is set by the Courier mail
server, that indicates the specific command. The available
commands are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help <br>
A simple autoresponder. couriermlm mails the sender the
contents of the help.tmpl file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subscribe <br>
A request to subscribe to this mailing list. couriermlm
reads the sender&rsquo;s address in order to determine what
address to subscribe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subscribe-name=domain <br>
Explicitly specify the address to subscribe to the mailing
list, instead of using a return address. In the previous
example, sending a message addressed to <br>
&lt;my-widgets-subscribe-john=domain.com@example.com&gt;
would result in a subscription request for
&lt;john=domain.com&gt;. Any unusual punctuation characters
in the address must be <br>
replaced by a plus sign, followed by two hexadecimal digits
that represent the punctuation character&rsquo;s ASCII
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unsubscribe <br>
A request to unsubscribe to this mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unsubscribe-name=domain <br>
Explicitly specify the address to unsubscribe from the
mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias-subscribe <br>
Set up a write-only alias (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias-subscribe-name=domain <br>
Explicitly specify the subscriber address for which a
write-only alias needs to be set up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are other commands that
are used internally for maintaining the mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WRITE-ONLY ALIASES <br>
Write-only E-mail aliases can send messages to the mailing
list, but they do not receive any mailing list messages
themselves. A write-only alias can be set up by any
subscriber. <br>
Only one write-only alias is allowed per subscribed E-mail
address. Write-only aliases are not needed for mailing list
that has the POST=all option set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To set up a write-only alias,
the subscriber sends a couriermlmalias-subscribe command.
The subscriber&rsquo;s E-mail address can be explicitly
specified in a similar manner as the <br>
subscribe command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The subject line of the E-mail
message must contain the E-mail write-only alias to be set
up, and nothing else. couriermlm responds with a
confirmation request, just like when <br>
subscribing to the list. This request must be acknowledged
in the same way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A subscriber&rsquo;s write-only
alias can be changed at any time by repeating this
procedure. The new alias replaces the previous one. To
prevent abuse, there&rsquo;s a limit of at most one <br>
alias-subscribe command every 30 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Leave the subject of the E-mail
message blank in order to remove an existing write-only
alias,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETTING UP A MAILING LIST DIGEST
<br>
couriermlm supports mailing list digests. Mailing list
digests are created as a second, separate, mailing list. The
create command initializes a second mailing list directory,
<br>
and then additional configuration takes place which links
the main mailing list to the digest list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the mailing list address is
list-address@example.com, the address of the digest version
of the mailing list is usually
list-address-digest@example.com, but it doesn&rsquo;t have
to <br>
be this address. The only requirement is that the directory
for the digest version of the mailing list must reside on
the same file system as the directory for the mailing list
<br>
itself, and both must be owned by the same userid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To set up a mailing list digest,
first proceed with the steps to create the mailing list
itself. After the mailing list is created and configured,
proceed as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create the digest list directory
<br>
Execute the create command to create the digest version of
the list:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/bin/couriermlm create
/path/to/digest/list/directory
ADDRESS=list-address-digest@example.com <br>
Use the full pathname to the mailing list directory, and the
address of the digest version of the mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configure the digest list <br>
Execute the set command to set any appropriate options for
the digest list. There one important differences to note:
messages are not posted to the digest list directly, so <br>
there is no moderation option, however the digest version of
the list can have moderated subscription requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Link the two lists <br>
Set the DIGEST option for the main mailing list, specifying
the directory of the digest list. This keyword lets
couriermlm know that a digest version is available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
You MUST set identical POSTARCHIVE option for both the main
list, and the digest list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create dot-courier(5)[1] files
<br>
It is necessary to create dot-courier(5)[1] files for the
digest list just like the main list, except for some
important differences, which are noted below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create cron(8) jobs <br>
It is also necessary to create cron jobs for the digest list
exactly like the main list, to run the hourly and daily
cleanup. It&rsquo;s possible to set up one set of cron jobs
to <br>
run hourly and daily cleanups consecutively for both
lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create a digest cron(8) job <br>
The digest creates and distributes the digest version of the
list. It can be executed by a cron(8) job, or the command
can be executed manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main mailing list is
supported by three dot-courier(5)[1] files, as previously
described: the posting address, the owner forwarding
address, and the default address that <br>
handles administrative control messages. In the following
example, the names $HOME/.courier-list,
$HOME/.courier-list-owner, and $HOME/.courier-list-default
are used to represent <br>
each one of these files, and the following names are used to
represent the dot-courier(5)[1] files that correspond to the
digest version of the mailing list: <br>
$HOME/.courier-list-digest,
$HOME/.courier-list-digest-owner, and
$HOME/.courier-list-digest-default. Note, however, that the
digest version of the mailing list can have any <br>
name, not necessary the name of the list, followed by
&quot;digest&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The contents of both
$HOME/.courier-list$HOME/.courier-list-digest must be the
same. Sending a message to the digest address should really
end up sending a message to the main <br>
mailing list. Do not put the address of the digest mailing
list directory in $HOME/.courier-list-digest, instead
specify the address of the main mailing list directory. Just
copy <br>
$HOME/.courier-list to $HOME/.courier-list-digest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, the contents of
$HOME/.courier-list-digest-default must specify the
directory of the digest version of the mailing list. The
digest list is managed separately from the <br>
main list, it has its own subscriber list that is separate
from the list of subscribers to the main list.
$HOME/.courier-list-default can simply be copied to <br>
$HOME/.courier-list-digest-default, then the directory can
be changed in the latter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.courier-list-owner may
use the same mailing list owner address as
$HOME/.courier-list-digest-owner, or it can specify a
different address. The both the digest and the main <br>
mailing list can have the same mailing list owner/moderator,
or have a different owner/moderator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following command must be
executed in order to link the two lists together:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/bin/couriermlm set
/path/to/main/list/directory
DIGEST=/path/to/digest/list/directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting the DIGEST option on the
main list lets couriermlm know that a digest version is
available. The DIGEST option must either use an absolute
pathname, or a pathname that&rsquo;s <br>
relative to the main list directory (NOT the current
directory).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the DIGEST option is set,
messages are simultaneously distributed to the mailing
list&rsquo;s subscribers, saved in the archive subdirectory
of the main list, then placed in the <br>
modqueue subdirectory of the digest list. Digest list do not
employ moderation -- any moderation must take place on the
main list -- so the modqueue subdirectory is recycled to
<br>
compile individual messages for the digest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, something needs to be
done in order to actually distribute the digest to the
digest list&rsquo;s subscribers. This is done by running the
following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/bin/couriermlm digest
/path/to/digest/directory N H</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command creates a digest,
and sends it out. The N and H arguments are optional. The
digest is created only if there&rsquo;s at least N messages
that are waiting to be sent in the <br>
digest list, or if the oldest message is at least H hours
old. Both options default to 0, so the default behavior is
to send a digest with all unsent messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that when the digest is
created, ALL unsent messages are packaged into the digest,
even if some messages are more recent than the time interval
specified by the H option. A <br>
cron(8) job can be set up to run the digest command, or run
it manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couriermlm automatically
provides the From:, To: headers on a message digest.
Additional headers may be specified by the headeradd file in
the digest list directory. The <br>
headerdel file has no effect. Note that the individual
messages in the digest are copies of the messages from the
main mailing list, and thus have the headeradd and headerdel
<br>
headers processed from the main mailing list directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
couriermlm will not work if the Courier mail server&rsquo;s
support for dot-courier(5)[1] extensions is disabled.</p>
