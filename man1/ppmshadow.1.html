<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ppmshadow - add simulated shadows to a PPM image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ppmshadow [-b blur_size] [-k] [-t] [-x xoffset] [-y yoffset]
[ppmfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppmshadow adds a simulated
shadow to an image, giving the appearance that the contents
of the image float above the page, casting a diffuse shadow
on the background. Shadows can <br>
either be black, as cast by opaque objects, or translucent,
where the shadow takes on the color of the object which
casts it. You can specify the crispness of the shadow and
its <br>
displacement from the image with command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppmshadow sees your image as a
foreground on a background. The background color is whatever
color the top left pixel of your image is. The background is
all the pixels that are <br>
that color and the foreground is everything else. The shadow
that ppmshadow generates is a shadow of the foreground, cast
on the background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shadow is the same size as
the foreground, plus some fringes as determined by the -b
option. It is truncated to fit in your image. The output
image is the same dimensions <br>
as the input image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use pamcomp to place a
foreground image over a background before running ppmshadow
on it. You can use ppmmake to make the background image
(just an image of a solid <br>
color).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b blur_size <br>
Sets the distance of the light source from the image. Larger
values move the light source closer, casting a more diffuse
shadow, while smaller settings move the light <br>
further away, yielding a sharper shadow. blur_size is the
number of pixels of fringe there is on the shadow, beyond
where the shadow would be if there were no blurring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is 11 pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this option controls
only the fringing effect of moving the light source closer
to the object. It does not make the shadow grow or shrink as
would happpen in <br>
the real world if you moved a point light source closer to
and further from an object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Keep the intermediate
temporary image files. When debugging, these intermediate
files provide many clues as to the source of an error. See
below &acirc;&uml;#files&acirc;&copy; for a list of <br>
the contents of each file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Consider the non-background
material in the image translucent -- it casts shadows of its
own color rather than a black shadow, which is default. This
often results in <br>
fuzzy, difficult-to-read images but in some circumstances
may look better.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x xoffset <br>
Specifies the displacement of the light source to the left
of the image. Larger settings of xoffset displace the shadow
to the right, as would be cast by a light further <br>
to the left. If not specified, the horizontal offset is half
of blur_size (above), to the left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y yoffset <br>
Specifies the displacement of the light source above the top
of the image. Larger settings displace the shadow downward,
corresponding to moving the light further above <br>
the top of the image. If you don&rsquo;t specify -y, the
vertical offset defaults to the same as the horizontal
offset (above), upward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Input is a PPM file named by the ppmfile command line
argument; if you don&rsquo;t specify ppmfile, the input is
Standard Input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output is a PPM file,
written to Standard Output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppmshadow creates a number of
temporary files as it executes. It creates a new directory
for them, /tmp/ppmshadowpid, where pid is the process ID of
the ppmshadow process. If <br>
the TMPDIR environment variable is set, ppmshadow creates
the directory there instead of /tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In normal operation, ppmshadow
deletes each temporary file as soon as it is done with it
and leaves no debris around after it completes. To preserve
the intermediate files for <br>
debugging, use the -k command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The temporary files are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">infile.ppm <br>
A copy of the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bgmask.ppm <br>
Positive binary mask</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">convkernel.ppm <br>
Convolution kernel for blurring shadow</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blurred.ppm <br>
Blurred, colored shadow image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blurred2.ppm <br>
Blurred shadow image before coloring</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shadow.ppm <br>
Clipped shadow image, offset as requested</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">background.ppm <br>
Blank image with background of source image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shadow.ppm <br>
Offset shadow</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fgmask.ppm <br>
Inverse mask file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">justfg.ppm <br>
Just the foreground. Rest is black. Original image times
inverse mask.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shadback.ppm <br>
Generated shadow times positive mask</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allbutfg.ppm <br>
Everything but the foreground (foreground area is
black).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
The source image must contain sufficient space on the edges
in the direction in which the shadow is cast to contain the
shadow -- if it doesn&rsquo;t some of the internal steps may
<br>
fail. You can usually expand the border of a
too-tightly-cropped image with pnmmargin before processing
it with ppmshadow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Black pixels and pixels with the
same color as the image background don&rsquo;t cast a
shadow. If this causes unintentional &rsquo;holes&rsquo; in
the shadow, fill the offending areas with a <br>
color which differs from black or the background by RGB
values of 1, which will be imperceptible to the viewer.
Since the comparison is exact, the modified areas will now
cast <br>
shadows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The background color of the
source image (which is preserved in the output) is deemed to
be the color of the pixel at the top left of the input
image. If that pixel isn&rsquo;t part <br>
of the background, simply add a one-pixel border at the top
of the image, generate the shadow image, then delete the
border from it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If something goes wrong along
the way, the error messages from the various Netpbm programs
ppmshadow calls will, in general, provide little or no clue
as to where ppmshadow went <br>
astray. In this case, Specify the -k option and examine the
intermediate results in the temporary files (which this
option causes to be preserved). If you manually run the
com&acirc; <br>
mands that ppmshadow runs on these files, you can figure out
where the problem is. In problem cases where you want to
manually tweak the image generation process along the way,
<br>
you can keep the intermediate files with the -k option,
modify them appropriately with an image editor, then
recombine them with the steps used by the code in
ppmshadow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the ppmshadow.doc file in
the Netpbm source tree for additional details and examples
of the intermediate files and debugging ppmshadow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shadows are by default black, as
cast by opaque material in the image occluding white light.
Use the -t option to simulate translucent material, where
the shadow takes on the <br>
color of the object that casts it. If the contrast between
the image and background is insufficient, the -t option may
yield unattractive results which resemble simple blurring
<br>
of the original image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because Netpbm used to have a
maximum maxval of 255, which meant that the largest
convolution kernel pnmconvol could use was 11 by 11,
ppmshadow includes a horrid, CPU-time-burn&acirc; <br>
ing kludge which, if a blur of greater than 11 is requested,
performs an initial convolution with an 11 x 11 kernel, then
calls pnmsmooth (which is itself a program that calls <br>
pnmconvol with a 3 x 3 kernel) as many times as the
requested blur exceeds 11. It&rsquo;s ugly, but it gets the
job done on those rare occasions where you need a blur
greater than 11.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish to generate an image
at high resolution, then scale it to publication size with
pamscale in order to eliminate jagged edges by resampling,
it&rsquo;s best to generate the <br>
shadow in the original high resolution image, prior to
scaling it down in size. If you scale first and then add the
shadow, you&rsquo;ll get an unsightly jagged stripe between
the <br>
edge of material and its shadow, due to resampled pixels
intermediate between the image and background obscuring the
shadow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
ppmshadow returns status 0 if processing was completed
without errors, and a nonzero Unix error code if an error
prevented generation of output. Some errors may result in
the <br>
script aborting, usually displaying error messages from
various Netpbm components it uses, without returning a
nonzero error code. When this happens, the output file will
be <br>
empty, so be sure to test this if you need to know if the
program succeeded.</p>
