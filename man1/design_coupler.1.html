This man page is not a complete set of documentation - the complexity of the
  atlc project makes man pages not an ideal way to document it, although out of
  completeness, man pages are produced. The best documentation that was current
  at the time this version was produced should be found on your hard drive,
  usually at
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
/usr/local/share/atlc/docs/html-docs/index.html
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
although it might be elsewhere if your system administrator chose to install the
  package elsewhere. Sometimes, errors are corrected in the documentation and
  placed at http://atlc.sourceforge.net/ before a new release of atlc is
  released. Please, if you notice a problem with the documentation - even
  spelling errors and typos, please let me know.

<b>design_coupler</b> is used to design directional couplers. It it <b>not</b>
  used to analyse couplers for which you know the dimensions. Instead, it is
  used but when you require a coupler to have specific properties, but don't
  know the required odd and even mode impedances or the required physical
  dimensions that will achieve those required properties.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a minimum the user must specify the coupling factor CF in dB, the minimum
  frequency fmin in MHz and the maximum frequency fmax in MHz. With this
  information, the <b>design_coupler</b> will
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
a) Tell you the required odd and even mode impedances Zodd and Zeven assuming
  the coupler is for 50 Ohms and assuming the coupler is is a quarter wave long,
  which might be an impractical length. There a numerous ways of making a
  coupler having those impedances and <b>design_coupler</b> does not (without
  the addition of options mentioned later), tell you how to make such a coupler.
  b) Given you the frequency response of the coupler, making the assumptions
  about the 50 Ohm impedance and quarter-wave length. The frequency response is
  calculated at 5 points in the range specified by fmin and fmax.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By use of the -Z 'Zo' and -L 'length' and -f 'fstep' options it it posible to
  specify different a different characteristic impedance, length and different
  frequency steps to display the frequency response.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The computed values of Zodd and Zeven required are valid no matter how the
  coupler is design physically. So no matter whether it's implemented on a PCB,
  air spaced or whatever, the above impedances are correct and the frequency
  response is correct.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The -d option causes <b>design_coupler</b> to not only report the required odd
  and even modem impedances but also the physical dimensions of a coupler that
  achieves these properties! <b>Currently</b>, the only stucture for which it is
  possible to compute the physical dimentions is two wide edge-coupled
  striplines between two wide plates like this:

The width W must be much greater than the height of the coupler and generally it
  is assumed that this width will at least 2*w+s*5*H, otherwise the calculations
  will be incorrect. In order to calculate these dimenisions an analytical
  method is used, which is only valid if the width W is infinity, but should be
  resonably good assuming W is at least 2*w+s+5*H.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is later intended to enable design coupler to use other structures, which
  migth be more suitable for construction, such as microstrip couplers on PCBs,
  but for now at least, it is only possible to compute the physical dimensions
  of the coupler using the above stucture. For strong coupling (less than 20 dB
  or so), the dimenions calculated might be impractical, as the spacing s will
  be so small. However, for weak coupling, the physcical dimensions are
  practical.

<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-d</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Design a coupler, using two edgle-coupled stiplines inside a wide 4-sided
  rectangular enclosure.

Priont an example of how to use <b>design_coupler</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-H height</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Specify the height of the enclosure in some convenient unit. By default, a
  height of 1 unit is assumed, but by use of this option it is possible to
  specify any height you want. Since its the ratio of dimensions that is
  important, not the absolute values, this just scales all the other dimensions
  by the specified height. It is just a conveneince for the user.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-L length</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Specifies the coupler length in metres. By default the coupler is assumed to be
  a quarter-wave, but this allow any length you want. Don't chose a length that
  is a multiple of a half-wave though, as this will make it impossible to couple
  any power out. <b>-q</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
This is the 'quite' switch and causes <b>design_coupler</b> to print out less
  information. One can use -qq to cause the even less output.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-s fstep</b> Causes <b>design_couler</b> to print out the frequency response
  at different steps from the default 5 values. fstep must be in MHz. The
  default value of fstep is obviously (fmax-fman)/5.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Z Zo</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Causes <b>design_coupler</b> to compute properties of an impedance Zo (shecified
  in Ohms). The default value for Zo is 50 Ohms.

Run <b>design_coupler</b> gives examples of its use. However, here are those
  same examples.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here are a examples of how to use <b>design_coupler</b> In the examples, the %
  sign is used in front of anything you must type which is what you will
  probably see when using the csh or tcsh as a shell. It would probably be a $
  sign if using the sh or bash shell.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To find the odd and even mode impedances and frequency response of a 50 Ohm
  coupler, covering 130 to 170 MHz, with a coupling coefficient of 30 dB:
<div class="Pp"></div>
% design_coupler 30 130 170
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note the frequency response is symmetrical about the centre frequency at 0.192
  dB below that wanted. You may wish to redesign this for a coupling coefficient
  of about 29.9 dB, so the maximum deviation from the ideal 30.0 dB never
  exceeds 0.1 dB Note the length suggested is 0.5 m (nearly 20&quot;) is a
  quarter wave at the centre frequency of 150 MHz. You might find this a bit too
  long, so let's specify a length of 0.25 m.
<div class="Pp"></div>
% design_coupler -L 0.25 30 130 170
<div class="Pp"></div>
What you may notice is that while the coupling to the coupled port is exactly 30
  dB below the input power at the centre frequency (150 MHz) it is no longer
  symmetrical about the centre frequency. Also, deviations from the ideal 30 dB
  are now much larger, with a maximum error of 1.012 dB Unlike the case when the
  length is the default quarter wave, there is not much you can do about this,
  since the deviations occur in both directions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now assume you are reasonably happy with the response when the length is 250 mm
  but would like to see the response at every 2.5 MHz. This can be done using
  the -s option to design_coupler.
<div class="Pp"></div>
% design_coupler -L 0.25 -s 2.5 30 130 170
<div class="Pp"></div>
Assuming the performance is acceptable, the dimensions of the coupler can be
  determined by adding the -d option. This will design a coupler that must look
  like the structure below. The two inner conductors, which are spaced equally
  between the top and bottom edges of the outer conductor, must be very thin.
  These are placed along the length of a box of width W, height H and of a
  length L determined by the user, which in this case is 250 mm.

The program reports: H = 1.0, ; w = 1.44 ; s = 0.44 The height of the box H must
  be small compared to the length L, (perhaps no more than 7% of the length), or
  17.5 mm in this case, with a length of 250 mm, otherwise fringing effects will
  be significant. The width of the structure W should be as large as possible.
  The program suggests making this 5*H+2*w+s. The 7% and 5*H+2*w+s are educated
  guesses, rather than exact figures. There is no problem in making the width
  larger than 5*H+2*w+s. The length L must be kept at 250 mm. The RATIO of the
  dimensions H, w and s (but not L or W must be kept constant. W just needs to
  be sufficiently large - it is uncritical.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you happened to have some 15 mm square brass available, then using that for
  the side-walls would require that H becomes 15*1.0 = 15 mm, w = 15*1.44 = 21.6
  mm and s = 15*0.44 = 6.6 mm
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is no need to compute the above scaling with a calculator, as using The -H
  option allows one to specify the height H. The program then reports the exact
  dimensions for the length L, height H, w, s and suggests a minimum width for
  W.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In summary we have:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 30 dB coupler +1.02 dB / -0.78 dB for 130 to 170 MHz
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 Length L = 250 mm, height H = 15 mm, stripline spacing s = 6.3 mm
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 stripline width w = 21.6 mm enclosure width W &gt;= 124 mm
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, design_coupler prints a lot of information to the screen. This can
  be reduced by the -q option or reduced to only one line with -qq Other options
  include -Z to change the impedance from the default 50 Ohms and -C to see the
