<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
design_coupler - for designing directional couplers (part of
the atlc package)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
design_coupler [-C][-d][-e][-H height][-L length][-q] <br>
[s fstep][-Z Zo] CF fmin fmax</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
This man page is not a complete set of documentation - the
complexity of the atlc project makes man pages not an ideal
way to document it, although out of completeness, man pages
<br>
are produced. The best documentation that was current at the
time this version was produced should be found on your hard
drive, usually at <br>
/usr/local/share/atlc/docs/html-docs/index.html <br>
although it might be elsewhere if your system administrator
chose to install the package elsewhere. Sometimes, errors
are corrected in the documentation and placed at <br>
http://atlc.sourceforge.net/ before a new release of atlc is
released. Please, if you notice a problem with the
documentation - even spelling errors and typos, please let
me <br>
know.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
design_coupler is used to design directional couplers. It it
not used to analyse couplers for which you know the
dimensions. Instead, it is used but when you require a
coupler to <br>
have specific properties, but don&rsquo;t know the required
odd and even mode impedances or the required physical
dimensions that will achieve those required properties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a minimum the user must
specify the coupling factor CF in dB, the minimum frequency
fmin in MHz and the maximum frequency fmax in MHz. With this
information, the design_cou&acirc; <br>
pler will <br>
a) Tell you the required odd and even mode impedances Zodd
and Zeven assuming the coupler is for 50 Ohms and assuming
the coupler is is a quarter wave long, which might be an
<br>
impractical length. There a numerous ways of making a
coupler having those impedances and design_coupler does not
(without the addition of options mentioned later), tell you
how <br>
to make such a coupler. b) Given you the frequency response
of the coupler, making the assumptions about the 50 Ohm
impedance and quarter-wave length. The frequency response is
<br>
calculated at 5 points in the range specified by fmin and
fmax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By use of the -Z
&rsquo;Zo&rsquo; and -L &rsquo;length&rsquo; and -f
&rsquo;fstep&rsquo; options it it posible to specify
different a different characteristic impedance, length and
different frequency steps to dis&acirc; <br>
play the frequency response.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The computed values of Zodd and
Zeven required are valid no matter how the coupler is design
physically. So no matter whether it&rsquo;s implemented on a
PCB, air spaced or whatever, <br>
the above impedances are correct and the frequency response
is correct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -d option causes
design_coupler to not only report the required odd and even
modem impedances but also the physical dimensions of a
coupler that achieves these properties! <br>
Currently, the only stucture for which it is possible to
compute the physical dimentions is two wide edge-coupled
striplines between two wide plates like this:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-----------------------------------------------------

| | | <br>
| | | <br>

----------------------------------------------------- v <br>

&lt;-------------------------W-------------------------&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The width W must be much greater
than the height of the coupler and generally it is assumed
that this width will at least 2*w+s*5*H, otherwise the
calculations will be incorrect. <br>
In order to calculate these dimenisions an analytical method
is used, which is only valid if the width W is infinity, but
should be resonably good assuming W is at least <br>
2*w+s+5*H.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is later intended to enable
design coupler to use other structures, which migth be more
suitable for construction, such as microstrip couplers on
PCBs, but for now at least, <br>
it is only possible to compute the physical dimensions of
the coupler using the above stucture. For strong coupling
(less than 20 dB or so), the dimenions calculated might be
<br>
impractical, as the spacing s will be so small. However, for
weak coupling, the physcical dimensions are practical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-C <br>
print copyright, licensing and copying information. <br>
-d <br>
Design a coupler, using two edgle-coupled stiplines inside a
wide 4-sided rectangular enclosure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e <br>
Priont an example of how to use design_coupler <br>
-H height <br>
Specify the height of the enclosure in some convenient unit.
By default, a height of 1 unit is assumed, but by use of
this option it is possible to specify any height you want.
<br>
Since its the ratio of dimensions that is important, not the
absolute values, this just scales all the other dimensions
by the specified height. It is just a conveneince for the
<br>
user. <br>
-L length <br>
Specifies the coupler length in metres. By default the
coupler is assumed to be a quarter-wave, but this allow any
length you want. Don&rsquo;t chose a length that is a
multiple of a <br>
half-wave though, as this will make it impossible to couple
any power out. -q <br>
This is the &rsquo;quite&rsquo; switch and causes
design_coupler to print out less information. One can use
-qq to cause the even less output. <br>
-s fstep Causes design_couler to print out the frequency
response at different steps from the default 5 values. fstep
must be in MHz. The default value of fstep is obviously <br>
(fmax-fman)/5. <br>
Z Zo <br>
Causes design_coupler to compute properties of an impedance
Zo (shecified in Ohms). The default value for Zo is 50
Ohms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Run design_coupler gives examples of its use. However, here
are those same examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are a examples of how to
use design_coupler In the examples, the % sign is used in
front of anything you must type which is what you will
probably see when using the csh or <br>
tcsh as a shell. It would probably be a $ sign if using the
sh or bash shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To find the odd and even mode
impedances and frequency response of a 50 Ohm coupler,
covering 130 to 170 MHz, with a coupling coefficient of 30
dB:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% design_coupler 30 130 170</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note the frequency response is
symmetrical about the centre frequency at 0.192 dB below
that wanted. You may wish to redesign this for a coupling
coefficient of about 29.9 dB, so <br>
the maximum deviation from the ideal 30.0 dB never exceeds
0.1 dB Note the length suggested is 0.5 m (nearly 20&quot;)
is a quarter wave at the centre frequency of 150 MHz. You
might <br>
find this a bit too long, so let&rsquo;s specify a length of
0.25 m.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% design_coupler -L 0.25 30 130
170</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What you may notice is that
while the coupling to the coupled port is exactly 30 dB
below the input power at the centre frequency (150 MHz) it
is no longer symmetrical about the <br>
centre frequency. Also, deviations from the ideal 30 dB are
now much larger, with a maximum error of 1.012 dB Unlike the
case when the length is the default quarter wave, there <br>
is not much you can do about this, since the deviations
occur in both directions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now assume you are reasonably
happy with the response when the length is 250 mm but would
like to see the response at every 2.5 MHz. This can be done
using the -s option to <br>
design_coupler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% design_coupler -L 0.25 -s 2.5
30 130 170</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assuming the performance is
acceptable, the dimensions of the coupler can be determined
by adding the -d option. This will design a coupler that
must look like the structure <br>
below. The two inner conductors, which are spaced equally
between the top and bottom edges of the outer conductor,
must be very thin. These are placed along the length of a
box <br>
of width W, height H and of a length L determined by the
user, which in this case is 250 mm.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-----------------------------------------------------
^ <br>
| | | <br>
| Er | | <br>
| | | <br>
| ----------- ----------- | H <br>
| &lt;----w----&gt;&lt;--s--&gt;&lt;----w----&gt; | | <br>
| | | <br>
| | | <br>
| | | <br>
----------------------------------------------------- v <br>

&lt;-------------------------W-------------------------&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program reports: H = 1.0, ;
w = 1.44 ; s = 0.44 The height of the box H must be small
compared to the length L, (perhaps no more than 7% of the
length), or 17.5 mm in this <br>
case, with a length of 250 mm, otherwise fringing effects
will be significant. The width of the structure W should be
as large as possible. The program suggests making this <br>
5*H+2*w+s. The 7% and 5*H+2*w+s are educated guesses, rather
than exact figures. There is no problem in making the width
larger than 5*H+2*w+s. The length L must be kept at 250 <br>
mm. The RATIO of the dimensions H, w and s (but not L or W
must be kept constant. W just needs to be sufficiently large
- it is uncritical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you happened to have some 15
mm square brass available, then using that for the
side-walls would require that H becomes 15*1.0 = 15 mm, w =
15*1.44 = 21.6 mm and s = 15*0.44 <br>
= 6.6 mm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no need to compute the
above scaling with a calculator, as using The -H option
allows one to specify the height H. The program then reports
the exact dimensions for the <br>
length L, height H, w, s and suggests a minimum width for
W.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In summary we have: <br>
30 dB coupler +1.02 dB / -0.78 dB for 130 to 170 MHz <br>
Length L = 250 mm, height H = 15 mm, stripline spacing s =
6.3 mm <br>
stripline width w = 21.6 mm enclosure width W &gt;= 124
mm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, design_coupler
prints a lot of information to the screen. This can be
reduced by the -q option or reduced to only one line with
-qq Other options include -Z to <br>
change the impedance from the default 50 Ohms and -C to see
