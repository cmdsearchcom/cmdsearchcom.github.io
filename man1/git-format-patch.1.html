[ &lt;since&gt; | &lt;revision range&gt; ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Prepare each commit with its patch in one file per commit,
formatted to resemble UNIX mailbox format. The output of
this command is convenient for e-mail submission or for use
<br>
with git am.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two ways to specify
which commits to operate on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. A single commit,
&lt;since&gt;, specifies that the commits leading to the tip
of the current branch that are not in the history that leads
to the &lt;since&gt; to be output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Generic &lt;revision
range&gt; expression (see &quot;SPECIFYING REVISIONS&quot;
section in gitrevisions(7)) means the commits in the
specified range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first rule takes precedence
in the case of a single &lt;commit&gt;. To apply the second
rule, i.e., format everything since the beginning of history
up until &lt;commit&gt;, use the <br>
--root option: git format-patch --root &lt;commit&gt;. If
you want to format only &lt;commit&gt; itself, you can do
this with git format-patch -1 &lt;commit&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, each output file is
numbered sequentially from 1, and uses the first line of the
commit message (massaged for pathname safety) as the
filename. With the <br>
--numbered-files option, the output file names will only be
numbers, without the first line of the commit appended. The
names of the output files are printed to standard output,
<br>
unless the --stdout option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -o is specified, output files
are created in &lt;dir&gt;. Otherwise they are created in
the current working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the subject of a
single patch is &quot;[PATCH] &quot; followed by the
concatenation of lines from the commit message up to the
first blank line (see the DISCUSSION section of <br>
git-commit(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When multiple patches are
output, the subject prefix will instead be &quot;[PATCH n/m]
&quot;. To force 1/1 to be added for a single patch, use -n.
To omit patch numbers from the subject, <br>
use -N.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If given --thread,
git-format-patch will generate In-Reply-To and References
headers to make the second and subsequent patch mails appear
as replies to the first mail; this also <br>
generates a Message-Id header to reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-p, --no-stat <br>
Generate plain patches without any diffstats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U&lt;n&gt;, --unified=&lt;n&gt;
<br>
Generate diffs with &lt;n&gt; lines of context instead of
the usual three.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--minimal <br>
Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is
produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--patience <br>
Generate a diff using the &quot;patience diff&quot;
algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--histogram <br>
Generate a diff using the &quot;histogram diff&quot;
algorithm.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--diff-algorithm={patience|minimal|histogram|myers}
<br>
Choose a diff algorithm. The variants are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default, myers <br>
The basic greedy diff algorithm. Currently, this is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minimal <br>
Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is
produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">patience <br>
Use &quot;patience diff&quot; algorithm when generating
patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">histogram <br>
This algorithm extends the patience algorithm to
&quot;support low-occurrence common elements&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, if you configured
diff.algorithm variable to a non-default value and want to
use the default one, then you have to use
--diff-algorithm=default option.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stat[=&lt;width&gt;[,&lt;name-width&gt;[,&lt;count&gt;]]]
<br>
Generate a diffstat. By default, as much space as necessary
will be used for the filename part, and the rest for the
graph part. Maximum width defaults to terminal width, or
<br>
80 columns if not connected to a terminal, and can be
overridden by &lt;width&gt;. The width of the filename part
can be limited by giving another width &lt;name-width&gt;
after a comma. <br>
The width of the graph part can be limited by using
--stat-graph-width=&lt;width&gt; (affects all commands
generating a stat graph) or by setting
diff.statGraphWidth=&lt;width&gt; (does <br>
not affect git format-patch). By giving a third parameter
&lt;count&gt;, you can limit the output to the first
&lt;count&gt; lines, followed by ... if there are more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These parameters can also be set
individually with --stat-width=&lt;width&gt;,
--stat-name-width=&lt;name-width&gt; and
--stat-count=&lt;count&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--numstat <br>
Similar to --stat, but shows number of added and deleted
lines in decimal notation and pathname without abbreviation,
to make it more machine friendly. For binary files, <br>
outputs two - instead of saying 0 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--shortstat <br>
Output only the last line of the --stat format containing
total number of modified files, as well as number of added
and deleted lines.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dirstat[=&lt;param1,param2,...&gt;]
<br>
Output the distribution of relative amount of changes for
each sub-directory. The behavior of --dirstat can be
customized by passing it a comma separated list of
parameters. <br>
The defaults are controlled by the diff.dirstat
configuration variable (see git-config(1)). The following
parameters are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">changes <br>
Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that have
been removed from the source, or added to the destination.
This ignores the amount of pure code movements <br>
within a file. In other words, rearranging lines in a file
is not counted as much as other changes. This is the default
behavior when no parameter is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lines <br>
Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular line-based
diff analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts.
(For binary files, count 64-byte chunks instead, <br>
since binary files have no natural concept of lines). This
is a more expensive --dirstat behavior than the changes
behavior, but it does count rearranged lines within a <br>
file as much as other changes. The resulting output is
consistent with what you get from the other --*stat
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">files <br>
Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of files
changed. Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat
analysis. This is the computationally cheapest <br>
--dirstat behavior, since it does not have to look at the
file contents at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cumulative <br>
Count changes in a child directory for the parent directory
as well. Note that when using cumulative, the sum of the
percentages reported may exceed 100%. The default <br>
(non-cumulative) behavior can be specified with the
noncumulative parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;limit&gt; <br>
An integer parameter specifies a cut-off percent (3% by
default). Directories contributing less than this percentage
of the changes are not shown in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: The following will
count changed files, while ignoring directories with less
than 10% of the total amount of changed files, and
accumulating child directory counts <br>
in the parent directories:
--dirstat=files,10,cumulative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--summary <br>
Output a condensed summary of extended header information
such as creations, renames and mode changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-renames <br>
Turn off rename detection, even when the configuration file
gives the default to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--full-index <br>
Instead of the first handful of characters, show the full
pre- and post-image blob object names on the
&quot;index&quot; line when generating patch format
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--binary <br>
In addition to --full-index, output a binary diff that can
be applied with git-apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;] <br>
Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal object name
in diff-raw format output and diff-tree header lines, show
only a partial prefix. This is independent of the <br>
--full-index option above, which controls the diff-patch
output format. Non default number of digits can be specified
with --abbrev=&lt;n&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;],
--break-rewrites[=[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;]] <br>
Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and
create. This serves two purposes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It affects the way a change that
amounts to a total rewrite of a file not as a series of
deletion and insertion mixed together with a very few lines
that happen to match <br>
textually as the context, but as a single deletion of
everything old followed by a single insertion of everything
new, and the number m controls this aspect of the -B option
<br>
(defaults to 60%). -B/70% specifies that less than 30% of
the original should remain in the result for Git to consider
it a total rewrite (i.e. otherwise the resulting patch <br>
will be a series of deletion and insertion mixed together
with context lines).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used with -M, a
totally-rewritten file is also considered as the source of a
rename (usually -M only considers a file that disappeared as
the source of a rename), and <br>
the number n controls this aspect of the -B option (defaults
to 50%). -B20% specifies that a change with addition and
deletion compared to 20% or more of the file&acirc;s size
are <br>
eligible for being picked up as a possible source of a
rename to another file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M[&lt;n&gt;],
--find-renames[=&lt;n&gt;] <br>
Detect renames. If n is specified, it is a threshold on the
similarity index (i.e. amount of addition/deletions compared
to the file&acirc;s size). For example, -M90% means Git <br>
should consider a delete/add pair to be a rename if more
than 90% of the file hasn&acirc;t changed. Without a % sign,
the number is to be read as a fraction, with a decimal point
<br>
before it. I.e., -M5 becomes 0.5, and is thus the same as
-M50%. Similarly, -M05 is the same as -M5%. To limit
detection to exact renames, use -M100%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C[&lt;n&gt;],
--find-copies[=&lt;n&gt;] <br>
Detect copies as well as renames. See also
--find-copies-harder. If n is specified, it has the same
meaning as for -M&lt;n&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--find-copies-harder <br>
For performance reasons, by default, -C option finds copies
only if the original file of the copy was modified in the
same changeset. This flag makes the command inspect <br>
unmodified files as candidates for the source of copy. This
is a very expensive operation for large projects, so use it
with caution. Giving more than one -C option has the <br>
same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --irreversible-delete <br>
Omit the preimage for deletes, i.e. print only the header
but not the diff between the preimage and /dev/null. The
resulting patch is not meant to be applied with patch nor
<br>
git apply; this is solely for people who want to just
concentrate on reviewing the text after the change. In
addition, the output obviously lack enough information to
apply <br>
such a patch in reverse, even manually, hence the name of
the option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used together with -B, omit
also the preimage in the deletion part of a delete/create
pair.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l&lt;num&gt; <br>
The -M and -C options require O(n^2) processing time where n
is the number of potential rename/copy targets. This option
prevents rename/copy detection from running if the <br>
number of rename/copy targets exceeds the specified
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O&lt;orderfile&gt; <br>
Output the patch in the order specified in the
&lt;orderfile&gt;, which has one shell glob pattern per
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --text <br>
Treat all files as text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-space-at-eol <br>
Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --ignore-space-change <br>
Ignore changes in amount of whitespace. This ignores
whitespace at line end, and considers all other sequences of
one or more whitespace characters to be equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --ignore-all-space <br>
Ignore whitespace when comparing lines. This ignores
differences even if one line has whitespace where the other
line has none.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--inter-hunk-context=&lt;lines&gt;
<br>
Show the context between diff hunks, up to the specified
number of lines, thereby fusing hunks that are close to each
other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W, --function-context <br>
Show whole surrounding functions of changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ext-diff <br>
Allow an external diff helper to be executed. If you set an
external diff driver with gitattributes(5), you need to use
this option with git-log(1) and friends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-ext-diff <br>
Disallow external diff drivers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--textconv, --no-textconv <br>
Allow (or disallow) external text conversion filters to be
run when comparing binary files. See gitattributes(5) for
details. Because textconv filters are typically a one-way
<br>
conversion, the resulting diff is suitable for human
consumption, but cannot be applied. For this reason,
textconv filters are enabled by default only for git-diff(1)
and <br>
git-log(1), but not for git-format-patch(1) or diff plumbing
commands.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-submodules[=&lt;when&gt;]
<br>
Ignore changes to submodules in the diff generation.
&lt;when&gt; can be either &quot;none&quot;,
&quot;untracked&quot;, &quot;dirty&quot; or &quot;all&quot;,
which is the default. Using &quot;none&quot; will consider
the <br>
submodule modified when it either contains untracked or
modified files or its HEAD differs from the commit recorded
in the superproject and can be used to override any <br>
settings of the ignore option in git-config(1) or
gitmodules(5). When &quot;untracked&quot; is used submodules
are not considered dirty when they only contain untracked
content (but <br>
they are still scanned for modified content). Using
&quot;dirty&quot; ignores all changes to the work tree of
submodules, only changes to the commits stored in the
superproject are <br>
shown (this was the behavior until 1.7.0). Using
&quot;all&quot; hides all changes to submodules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--src-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt; <br>
Show the given source prefix instead of &quot;a/&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dst-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt; <br>
Show the given destination prefix instead of
&quot;b/&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-prefix <br>
Do not show any source or destination prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more detailed explanation on
these common options, see also gitdiffcore(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-&lt;n&gt; <br>
Prepare patches from the topmost &lt;n&gt; commits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o &lt;dir&gt;,
--output-directory &lt;dir&gt; <br>
Use &lt;dir&gt; to store the resulting files, instead of the
current working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --numbered <br>
Name output in [PATCH n/m] format, even with a single
patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --no-numbered <br>
Name output in [PATCH] format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--start-number &lt;n&gt; <br>
Start numbering the patches at &lt;n&gt; instead of 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--numbered-files <br>
Output file names will be a simple number sequence without
the default first line of the commit appended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --keep-subject <br>
Do not strip/add [PATCH] from the first line of the commit
log message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --signoff <br>
Add Signed-off-by: line to the commit message, using the
committer identity of yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stdout <br>
Print all commits to the standard output in mbox format,
instead of creating a file for each one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--attach[=&lt;boundary&gt;] <br>
Create multipart/mixed attachment, the first part of which
is the commit message and the patch itself in the second
part, with Content-Disposition: attachment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-attach <br>
Disable the creation of an attachment, overriding the
configuration setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--inline[=&lt;boundary&gt;] <br>
Create multipart/mixed attachment, the first part of which
is the commit message and the patch itself in the second
part, with Content-Disposition: inline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--thread[=&lt;style&gt;],
--no-thread <br>
Controls addition of In-Reply-To and References headers to
make the second and subsequent mails appear as replies to
the first. Also controls generation of the Message-Id <br>
header to reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional &lt;style&gt;
argument can be either shallow or deep. shallow threading
makes every mail a reply to the head of the series, where
the head is chosen from the cover <br>
letter, the --in-reply-to, and the first patch mail, in this
order. deep threading makes every mail a reply to the
previous one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is --no-thread,
unless the format.thread configuration is set. If --thread
is specified without a style, it defaults to the style
specified by format.thread if <br>
any, or else shallow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beware that the default for git
send-email is to thread emails itself. If you want git
format-patch to take care of threading, you will want to
ensure that threading is <br>
disabled for git send-email.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--in-reply-to=Message-Id <br>
Make the first mail (or all the mails with --no-thread)
appear as a reply to the given Message-Id, which avoids
breaking threads to provide a new patch series.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-if-in-upstream <br>
Do not include a patch that matches a commit in
&lt;until&gt;..&lt;since&gt;. This will examine all patches
reachable from &lt;since&gt; but not from &lt;until&gt; and
compare them with the patches <br>
being generated, and any patch that matches is ignored.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--subject-prefix=&lt;Subject-Prefix&gt;
<br>
Instead of the standard [PATCH] prefix in the subject line,
instead use [&lt;Subject-Prefix&gt;]. This allows for useful
naming of a patch series, and can be combined with the <br>
--numbered option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v &lt;n&gt;,
--reroll-count=&lt;n&gt; <br>
Mark the series as the &lt;n&gt;-th iteration of the topic.
The output filenames have v&lt;n&gt; pretended to them, and
the subject prefix (&quot;PATCH&quot; by default, but
configurable via the <br>
--subject-prefix option) has &lsquo; v&lt;n&gt;&lsquo;
appended to it. E.g. --reroll-count=4 may produce
v4-0001-add-makefile.patch file that has &quot;Subject:
[PATCH v4 1/20] Add makefile&quot; in <br>
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--to=&lt;email&gt; <br>
Add a To: header to the email headers. This is in addition
to any configured headers, and may be used multiple times.
The negated form --no-to discards all To: headers added <br>
so far (from config or command line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cc=&lt;email&gt; <br>
Add a Cc: header to the email headers. This is in addition
to any configured headers, and may be used multiple times.
The negated form --no-cc discards all Cc: headers added <br>
so far (from config or command line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--add-header=&lt;header&gt; <br>
Add an arbitrary header to the email headers. This is in
addition to any configured headers, and may be used multiple
times. For example, --add-header=&quot;Organization: <br>
git-foo&quot;. The negated form --no-add-header discards all
(To:, Cc:, and custom) headers added so far from config or
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no-]cover-letter <br>
In addition to the patches, generate a cover letter file
containing the shortlog and the overall diffstat. You can
fill in a description in the file before sending it out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--notes[=&lt;ref&gt;] <br>
Append the notes (see git-notes(1)) for the commit after the
three-dash line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The expected use case of this is
to write supporting explanation for the commit that does not
belong to the commit log message proper, and include it with
the patch <br>
submission. While one can simply write these explanations
after format-patch has run but before sending, keeping them
as Git notes allows them to be maintained between <br>
versions of the patch series (but see the discussion of the
notes.rewrite configuration options in git-notes(1) to use
this workflow).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no]-signature=&lt;signature&gt;
<br>
Add a signature to each message produced. Per RFC 3676 the
signature is separated from the body by a line with
&rsquo;-- &rsquo; on it. If the signature option is omitted
the signature <br>
defaults to the Git version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--suffix=.&lt;sfx&gt; <br>
Instead of using .patch as the suffix for generated
filenames, use specified suffix. A common alternative is
--suffix=.txt. Leaving this empty will remove the .patch
suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the leading character
does not have to be a dot; for example, you can use
--suffix=-patch to get
0001-description-of-my-change-patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quiet <br>
Do not print the names of the generated files to standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-binary <br>
Do not output contents of changes in binary files, instead
display a notice that those files changed. Patches generated
using this option cannot be applied properly, but they <br>
are still useful for code review.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--root <br>
Treat the revision argument as a &lt;revision range&gt;,
even if it is just a single commit (that would normally be
treated as a &lt;since&gt;). Note that root commits included
in the <br>
specified range are always formatted as creation patches,
independently of this flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
You can specify extra mail header lines to be added to each
message, defaults for the subject prefix and file suffix,
number patches when outputting more than one patch, add
&quot;To&quot; <br>
or &quot;Cc:&quot; headers, configure attachments, and sign
off patches with configuration variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[format] <br>
headers = &quot;Organization: git-foo0 <br>
subjectprefix = CHANGE <br>
suffix = .txt <br>
numbered = auto <br>
to = &lt;email&gt; <br>
cc = &lt;email&gt; <br>
attach [ = mime-boundary-string ] <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISCUSSION <br>
The patch produced by git format-patch is in UNIX mailbox
format, with a fixed &quot;magic&quot; time stamp to
indicate that the file is output from format-patch rather
than a real <br>
mailbox, like so:</p>

(See commit c2330e286f68f1c408b4aa6515ba49d57f05beae
comment)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do the same for ia64 so we can
have sleek &amp; trim looking <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typically it will be placed in a
MUA&acirc;s drafts folder, edited to add timely commentary
that should not go in the changelog after the three dashes,
and then sent as a message whose <br>
body, in our example, starts with &quot;arch/arm config
files were...&quot;. On the receiving end, readers can save
interesting patches in a UNIX mailbox and apply them with
git-am(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a patch is part of an
ongoing discussion, the patch generated by git format-patch
can be tweaked to take advantage of the git am --scissors
feature. After your response to <br>
the discussion comes a line that consists solely of &quot;--
&gt;8 --&quot; (scissors and perforation), followed by the
patch with unnecessary header fields removed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">... <br>
&gt; So we should do such-and-such.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makes sense to me. How about
this patch?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- &gt;8 -- <br>
Subject: [IA64] Put ia64 config files on the Uwe
Kleine-K&Atilde;&para;nig diet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arch/arm config files were
slimmed down using a python script <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When sending a patch this way,
most often you are sending your own patch, so in addition to
the &quot;From $SHA1 $magic_timestamp&quot; marker you
should omit From: and Date: lines from <br>
the patch file. The patch title is likely to be different
from the subject of the discussion the patch is in response
to, so it is likely that you would want to keep the Subject:
<br>
line, like the example above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Checking for patch corruption
<br>
Many mailers if not set up properly will corrupt whitespace.
Here are two common types of corruption:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Empty context
lines that do not have any whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Non-empty
context lines that have one extra whitespace at the
beginning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One way to test if your MUA is
set up correctly is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Send the patch
to yourself, exactly the way you would, except with To: and
Cc: lines that do not contain the list and maintainer
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Save that patch
to a file in UNIX mailbox format. Call it a.patch, say.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Apply it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git fetch &lt;project&gt;
master:test-apply <br>
$ git checkout test-apply <br>
$ git reset --hard <br>
$ git am a.patch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If it does not apply correctly,
there can be various reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The patch itself
does not apply cleanly. That is bad but does not have much
to do with your MUA. You might want to rebase the patch with
git-rebase(1) before regenerating it <br>
in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The MUA
corrupted your patch; &quot;am&quot; would complain that the
patch does not apply. Look in the .git/rebase-apply/
subdirectory and see what patch file contains and check for
<br>
the common corruption patterns mentioned above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; While at it,
check the info and final-commit files as well. If what is in
final-commit is not exactly what you would want to see in
the commit log message, it is very likely <br>
that the receiver would end up hand editing the log message
when applying your patch. Things like &quot;Hi, this is my
first patch.0 in the patch e-mail should come after the <br>
three-dash line that signals the end of the commit
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MUA-SPECIFIC HINTS <br>
Here are some hints on how to successfully submit patches
inline using various mailers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GMail <br>
GMail does not have any way to turn off line wrapping in the
web interface, so it will mangle any emails that you send.
You can however use &quot;git send-email&quot; and send your
patches <br>
through the GMail SMTP server, or use any IMAP email client
to connect to the google IMAP server and forward the emails
through that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For hints on using git
send-email to send your patches through the GMail SMTP
server, see the EXAMPLE section of git-send-email(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For hints on submission using
the IMAP interface, see the EXAMPLE section of
git-imap-send(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thunderbird <br>
By default, Thunderbird will both wrap emails as well as
flag them as being format=flowed, both of which will make
the resulting email unusable by Git.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are three different
approaches: use an add-on to turn off line wraps, configure
Thunderbird to not mangle patches, or use an external editor
to keep Thunderbird from <br>
mangling the patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Approach #1 (add-on) <br>
Install the Toggle Word Wrap add-on that is available from
https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/addon/toggle-word-wrap/
It adds a menu entry &quot;Enable Word Wrap&quot; in the
<br>
composer&acirc;s &quot;Options&quot; menu that you can tick
off. Now you can compose the message as you otherwise do
(cut + paste, git format-patch | git imap-send, etc), but
you have to <br>
insert line breaks manually in any text that you type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Approach #2 (configuration) <br>
Three steps:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Configure your mail server
composition as plain text: Edit...Account
Settings...Composition &amp; Addressing, uncheck
&quot;Compose Messages in HTML&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Configure your general
composition window to not wrap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Thunderbird 2:
Edit..Preferences..Composition, wrap plain text messages at
0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Thunderbird 3:
Edit..Preferences..Advanced..Config Editor. Search for
&quot;mail.wrap_long_lines&quot;. Toggle it to make sure it
is set to false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Disable the use of
format=flowed: Edit..Preferences..Advanced..Config Editor.
Search for &quot;mailnews.send_plaintext_flowed&quot;.
Toggle it to make sure it is set to false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After that is done, you should
be able to compose email as you otherwise would (cut +
paste, git format-patch | git imap-send, etc), and the
patches will not be mangled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Approach #3 (external editor)
<br>
The following Thunderbird extensions are needed: AboutConfig
from http://aboutconfig.mozdev.org/ and External Editor from
http://globs.org/articles.php?lng=en&amp;pg=8</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Prepare the patch as a text
file using your method of choice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Before opening a compose
window, use Edit&acirc;Account Settings to uncheck the
&quot;Compose messages in HTML format&quot; setting in the
&quot;Composition &amp; Addressing&quot; panel of the
account <br>
to be used to send the patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. In the main Thunderbird
window, before you open the compose window for the patch,
use Tools&acirc;about:config to set the following to the
indicated values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mailnews.send_plaintext_flowed
=&gt; false <br>
mailnews.wraplength =&gt; 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Open a compose window and
click the external editor icon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. In the external editor
window, read in the patch file and exit the editor
normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Side note: it may be possible to
do step 2 with about:config and the following settings but
no one&acirc;s tried yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mail.html_compose =&gt; false
<br>
mail.identity.default.compose_html =&gt; false <br>
mail.identity.id?.compose_html =&gt; false</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a script in
contrib/thunderbird-patch-inline which can help you include
patches with Thunderbird in an easy way. To use it, do the
steps above and then use the <br>
script as the external editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KMail <br>
This should help you to submit patches inline using
KMail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Prepare the patch as a text
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Click on New Mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Go under &quot;Options&quot;
in the Composer window and be sure that &quot;Word
wrap&quot; is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Use Message &acirc; Insert
file... and insert the patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Back in the compose window:
add whatever other text you wish to the message, complete
the addressing and subject fields, and press send.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Extract commits between revisions R1 and R2,
and apply them on top of the current branch using git am to
cherry-pick them:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git format-patch -k --stdout
R1..R2 | git am -3 -k</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Extract all
commits which are in the current branch but not in the
origin branch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git format-patch origin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each commit a separate file
is created in the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Extract all
commits that lead to origin since the inception of the
project:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git format-patch --root
origin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The same as the
previous one:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git format-patch -M -B
origin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, it detects and
handles renames and complete rewrites intelligently to
produce a renaming patch. A renaming patch reduces the
amount of text output, and <br>
generally makes it easier to review. Note that non-Git
&quot;patch&quot; programs won&acirc;t understand renaming
patches, so use it only when you know the recipient uses Git
to apply your <br>
patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Extract three
topmost commits from the current branch and format them as
e-mailable patches:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git format-patch -3</p>
