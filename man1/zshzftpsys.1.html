zshzftpsys - zftp function front-end
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This describes the set of shell functions supplied with the source distribution
  as an interface to the <b>zftp</b> builtin command, allowing you to perform
  FTP operations from the shell command line or within functions or scripts. The
  interface is similar to a traditional FTP client (e.g. the <b>ftp</b> command
  itself, see <i>ftp</i>(1)), but as it is entirely done within the shell all
  the familiar completion, editing and globbing features, and so on, are
  present, and macros are particularly simple to write as they are just ordinary
  shell functions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The prerequisite is that the <b>zftp</b> command, as described in
  <i>zshmodules</i>(1) , must be available in the version of <b>zsh</b>
  installed at your site. If the shell is configured to load new commands at run
  time, it probably is: typing ` <b>zmodload zsh/zftp</b>' will make sure (if
  that runs silently, it has worked). If this is not the case, it is possible
  <b>zftp</b> was linked into the shell anyway: to test this, type ` <b>which
  zftp</b>' and if <b>zftp</b> is available you will get the message ` <b>zftp:
  shell built-in command</b>'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Commands given directly with <b>zftp</b> builtin may be interspersed between the
  functions in this suite; in a few cases, using <b>zftp</b> directly may cause
  some of the status information stored in shell parameters to become invalid.
  Note in particular the description of the variables <b>$ZFTP_TMOUT</b>,
  <b>$ZFTP_PREFS</b> and <b>$ZFTP_VERBOSE</b> for <b>zftp</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INSTALLATION"><a class="selflink" href="#INSTALLATION">INSTALLATION</a></h1>
You should make sure all the functions from the <b>Functions/Zftp</b> directory
  of the source distribution are available; they all begin with the two letters
  ` <b>zf</b>'. They may already have been installed on your system; otherwise,
  you will need to find them and copy them. The directory should appear as one
  of the elements of the <b>$fpath</b> array (this should already be the case if
  they were installed), and at least the function <b>zfinit</b> should be
  autoloaded; it will autoload the rest. Finally, to initialize the use of the
  system you need to call the <b>zfinit</b> function. The following code in your
  <b>.zshrc</b> will arrange for this; assume the functions are stored in the
  directory <b>~/myfns</b>:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<b>fpath=(~/myfns $fpath)</b>
<b>autoload -U zfinit</b>
<b>zfinit</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that <b>zfinit</b> assumes you are using the <b>zmodload</b> method to load
  the <b>zftp</b> command. If it is already built into the shell, change
  <b>zfinit</b> to <b>zfinit -n</b>. It is helpful (though not essential) if the
  call to <b>zfinit</b> appears after any code to initialize the new completion
  system, else unnecessary <b>compctl</b> commands will be given.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FUNCTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#FUNCTIONS">FUNCTIONS</a></h1>
The sequence of operations in performing a file transfer is essentially the same
  as that in a standard FTP client. Note that, due to a quirk of the shell's
  <b>getopts</b> builtin, for those functions that handle options you must use `
  <b>-</b><b>-</b>' rather than `<b>-</b>' to ensure the remaining arguments are
  treated literally (a single ` <b>-</b>' is treated as an argument).

      no arguments. If no arguments are given, the current parameters are
      displayed (the password will be shown as a line of asterisks). If a host
      is given, and either the <i>user</i> or <i>password</i> is not, they will
      be prompted for; also, any parameter given as ` <b>?</b>' will be prompted
      for, and if the ` <b>?</b>' is followed by a string, that will be used as
      the prompt. As <b>zfopen</b> calls <b>zfparams</b> to store the
      parameters, this usually need not be called directly.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
A single argument ` <b>-</b>' will delete the stored parameters. This will also
  cause the memory of the last directory (and so on) on the other host to be
  deleted.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

      <i>host</i> is not present, use a previously stored set of
    parameters.</dd>

If the command was successful, and the terminal is compatible with <b>xterm</b>
  or is <b>sun-cmd</b>, a summary will appear in the title bar, giving the local
  <b>host:directory</b> and the remote <b>host:directory</b>; this is handled by
  the function <b>zftp_chpwd</b>, described below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally, the <i>host</i>, <i>user</i> and <i>password</i> are internally
  recorded for later re-opening, either by a <b>zfopen</b> with no arguments, or
  automatically (see below). With the option ` <b>-1</b>', no information is
  stored. Also, if an open command with arguments failed, the parameters will
  not be retained (and any previous parameters will also be deleted). A
  <b>zfopen</b> on its own, or a <b>zfopen -1</b>, never alters the stored
  parameters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Both <b>zfopen</b> and <b>zfanon</b> (but not <b>zfparams</b>) understand URLs
  of the form <b>ftp://</b><i>host</i>/<i>path...</i> as meaning to connect to
  the <i>host</i>, then change directory to <i>path</i> (which must be a
  directory, not a file). The ` <b>ftp://</b>' can be omitted; the trailing
  `<b>/</b>' is enough to trigger recognition of the <i>path</i>. Note prefixes
  other than ` <b>ftp:</b>' are not recognized, and that all characters after
  the first slash beyond <i>host</i> are significant in <i>path</i>.</div>

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the first form with <i>dir</i> present, change to the directory <i>dir</i>.
  The command ` <b>zfcd ..</b>' is treated specially, so is guaranteed to work
  on non-UNIX servers (note this is handled internally by <b>zftp</b>). If
  <i>dir</i> is omitted, has the effect of ` <b>zfcd ~</b>'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second form changes to the directory previously current.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The third form attempts to change the current directory by replacing the first
  occurrence of the string <i>old</i> with the string <i>new</i> in the current
  directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that in this command, and indeed anywhere a remote filename is expected,
  the string which on the local host corresponds to ` <b>~</b>' is converted
  back to a ` <b>~</b>' before being passed to the remote machine. This is
  convenient because of the way expansion is performed on the command line
  before <b>zfcd</b> receives a string. For example, suppose the command is `
  <b>zfcd ~/foo</b>'. The shell will expand this to a full path such as `
  <b>zfcd /home/user2/pws/foo</b>'. At this stage, <b>zfcd</b> recognises the
  initial path as corresponding to ` <b>~</b>' and will send the directory to
  the remote host as <b>~/foo</b>, so that the `<b>~</b>' will be expanded by
  the server to the correct remote host directory. Other named directories of
  the form ` <b>~name</b>' are not treated in this fashion.</div>

      <i>dir-options</i> and <i>dir</i> are passed directly to the server and

</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
The directory is usually cached for re-use. In fact, two caches are maintained.
  One is for use when there is no <i>dir-options</i> or <i>dir</i>, i.e. a full
  listing of the current remote directory; it is flushed when the current remote
  directory changes. The other is kept for repeated use of <b>zfdir</b> with the
  same arguments; for example, repeated use of ` <b>zfdir /pub/gnu</b>' will
  only require the directory to be retrieved on the first call. Alternatively,
  this cache can be re-viewed with the <b>-r</b> option. As relative directories
  will confuse <b>zfdir</b>, the <b>-f</b> option can be used to force the cache
  to be flushed before the directory is listed. The option <b>-d</b> will delete
  both caches without showing a directory listing; it will also delete the cache
  of file names in the current remote directory, if any.</div>

The commands for retrieving files all take at least two options. <b>-G</b>
  suppresses remote filename expansion which would otherwise be performed (see

      <b>-c</b> (cat) forces all files to be sent as a single stream to standard

      the local file does not exist. If the remote file is older but the files
      have different sizes, or if the sizes are the same but the remote file is
      newer, the user will usually be queried. With the option <b>-s</b>, the
      command runs silently and will always retrieve the file in either of those
      two cases. With the option <b>-v</b>, the command prints more information

  It attempts to resolve this in various ways. First, if the <i>rdir</i>
  argument is ` <b>.</b>' or `<b>..</b>' or ends in a slash, it is assumed to be
  a directory. Secondly, if the operation of copying to a remote file in the
  first form failed, and the remote server sends back the expected failure code
  553 and a reply including the string ` <b>Is a directory</b>', then
  <b>zfpcp</b> will retry using the second form.</div>

Various styles are available using the standard shell style mechanism, described
  in <i>zshmodules</i>(1). Briefly, the command ` <b>zstyle ':zftp:*'</b>
  <i>style</i> <i>value</i> ...'. defines the <i>style</i> to have value
  <i>value</i>; more than one value may be given, although that is not useful in
  the cases described here. These values will then be used throughout the zftp
  function system. For more precise control, the first argument, which gives a
  context in which the style applies, can be modified to include a particular
  function, as for example ` <b>:zftp:zfget</b>': the style will then have the
  given value only in the <b>zfget</b> function. Values for the same style in
  different contexts may be set; the most specific function will be used, where
  strings are held to be more specific than patterns, and longer patterns and
  shorter patterns. Note that only the top level function name, as called by the
  user, is used; calling of lower level functions is transparent to the user.
  Hence modifications to the title bar in <b>zftp_chpwd</b> use the contexts
  <b>:zftp:zfopen</b>, <b>:zftp:zfcd</b>, etc., depending where it was called
  from. The following styles are understood:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>progress</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Controls the way that <b>zftp_progress</b> reports on the
      progress of a transfer. If empty, unset, or ` <b>none</b>', no progress
      report is made; if ` <b>bar</b>' a growing bar of inverse video is shown;
      if ` <b>percent</b>' (or any other string, though this may change in
      future), the percentage of the file transferred is shown. The bar meter
      requires that the width of the terminal be available via the
      <b>$COLUMNS</b> parameter (normally this is set automatically). If the
      size of the file being transferred is not available, <b>bar</b> and
      <b>percent</b> meters will simply show the number of bytes transferred so
      far.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
When <b>zfinit</b> is run, if this style is not defined for the context
  <b>:zftp:*</b>, it will be set to `bar'.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>update</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies the minimum time interval between updates of the
      progress meter in seconds. No update is made unless new data has been
      received, so the actual time interval is limited only by
      <b>$ZFTP_TIMEOUT</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>

  <dd class="It-tag">If set to `1', `yes' or `true', <b>zftp_chpwd</b> will put

  <dd class="It-tag">If set to `1' `yes' or `true', <b>zftp_chpwd</b> will call
      the function <b>chpwd</b> when a connection is closed. This is useful if
      the remote host details were put into the terminal title bar by
      <b>zftp_chpwd</b> and your usual <b>chpwd</b> also modifies the title
    bar.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
When <b>zfinit</b> is run, it will determine whether <b>chpwd</b> exists and if
  so it will set the default value for the style to 1 if none exists
  already.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that there is also an associative array <b>zfconfig</b> which contains
  values used by the function system. This should not be modified or
  overwritten.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Remote_globbing"><a class="selflink" href="#Remote_globbing">Remote
  globbing</a></h2>
The commands for retrieving files usually perform filename generation (globbing)
  on their arguments; this can be turned off by passing the option <b>-G</b> to
  each of the commands. Normally this operates by retrieving a complete list of
  files for the directory in question, then matching these locally against the
  pattern supplied. This has the advantage that the full range of zsh patterns
  (respecting the setting of the option <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b>) can be used.
  However, it means that the directory part of a filename will not be expanded
  and must be given exactly. If the remote server does not support the UNIX
  directory semantics, directory handling is problematic and it is recommended
  that globbing only be used within the current directory. The list of files in
  the current directory, if retrieved, will be cached, so that subsequent globs
  in the same directory without an intervening <b>zfcd</b> are much faster.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>remote-glob</b> style (see above) is set, globbing is instead
  performed on the remote host: the server is asked for a list of matching
  files. This is highly dependent on how the server is implemented, though
  typically UNIX servers will provide support for basic glob patterns. This may
  in some cases be faster, as it avoids retrieving the entire list of directory
  contents.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Automatic_and_temporary_reopening"><a class="selflink" href="#Automatic_and_temporary_reopening">Automatic
  and temporary reopening</a></h2>
As described for the <b>zfopen</b> command, a subsequent <b>zfopen</b> with no
  parameters will reopen the connection to the last host (this includes
  connections made with the <b>zfanon</b> command). Opened in this fashion, the
  connection starts in the default remote directory and will remain open until
  explicitly closed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Automatic re-opening is also available. If a connection is not currently open
  and a command requiring a connection is given, the last connection is
  implicitly reopened. In this case the directory which was current when the
  connection was closed again becomes the current directory (unless, of course,
  the command given changes it). Automatic reopening will also take place if the
  connection was close by the remote server for whatever reason (e.g. a
  timeout). It is not available if the <b>-1</b> option to <b>zfopen</b> or
  <b>zfanon</b> was used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Furthermore, if the command issued is a file transfer, the connection will be
  closed after the transfer is finished, hence providing a one-shot mode for
  transfers. This does not apply to directory changing or listing commands; for
  example a <b>zfdir</b> may reopen a connection but will leave it open. Also,
  automatic closure will only ever happen in the same command as automatic
  opening, i.e a <b>zfdir</b> directly followed by a <b>zfget</b> will never
  close the connection automatically.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Information about the previous connection is given by the <b>zfstat</b>
  function. So, for example, if that reports:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<b>Session:        default</b>
<b>Not connected.</b>
<b>Last session:   ftp.bar.com:/pub/textfiles</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
then the command <b>zfget file.txt</b> will attempt to reopen a connection to
  <b>ftp.bar.com</b>, retrieve the file <b>/pub/textfiles/file.txt</b>, and
  immediately close the connection again. On the other hand, <b>zfcd ..</b> will
  open the connection in the directory <b>/pub</b> and leave it open.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that all the above is local to each session; if you return to a previous
  session, the connection for that session is the one which will be reopened.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Completion"><a class="selflink" href="#Completion">Completion</a></h2>
Completion of local and remote files, directories, sessions and bookmarks is
  supported. The older, <b>compctl</b>-style completion is defined when
  <b>zfinit</b> is called; support for the new widget-based completion system is
  provided in the function <b>Completion/Zsh/Command/_zftp</b>, which should be
  installed with the other functions of the completion system and hence should
  automatically be available.</div>
