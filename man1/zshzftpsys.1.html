<p>ZSHZFTPSYS(1) General Commands Manual ZSHZFTPSYS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
zshzftpsys - zftp function front-end</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This describes the set of shell functions supplied with the
source distribution as an interface to the zftp builtin
command, allowing you to perform FTP operations from the
shell <br>
command line or within functions or scripts. The interface
is similar to a traditional FTP client (e.g. the ftp command
itself, see ftp(1)), but as it is entirely done within <br>
the shell all the familiar completion, editing and globbing
features, and so on, are present, and macros are
particularly simple to write as they are just ordinary shell
func&acirc; <br>
tions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The prerequisite is that the
zftp command, as described in zshmodules(1) , must be
available in the version of zsh installed at your site. If
the shell is configured to load new <br>
commands at run time, it probably is: typing &lsquo;zmodload
zsh/zftp&rsquo; will make sure (if that runs silently, it
has worked). If this is not the case, it is possible zftp
was linked <br>
into the shell anyway: to test this, type &lsquo;which
zftp&rsquo; and if zftp is available you will get the
message &lsquo;zftp: shell built-in command&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands given directly with
zftp builtin may be interspersed between the functions in
this suite; in a few cases, using zftp directly may cause
some of the status information <br>
stored in shell parameters to become invalid. Note in
particular the description of the variables $ZFTP_TMOUT,
$ZFTP_PREFS and $ZFTP_VERBOSE for zftp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
You should make sure all the functions from the
Functions/Zftp directory of the source distribution are
available; they all begin with the two letters
&lsquo;zf&rsquo;. They may already <br>
have been installed on your system; otherwise, you will need
to find them and copy them. The directory should appear as
one of the elements of the $fpath array (this should <br>
already be the case if they were installed), and at least
the function zfinit should be autoloaded; it will autoload
the rest. Finally, to initialize the use of the system you
<br>
need to call the zfinit function. The following code in your
.zshrc will arrange for this; assume the functions are
stored in the directory ~/myfns:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fpath=(~/myfns $fpath) <br>
autoload -U zfinit <br>
zfinit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that zfinit assumes you are
using the zmodload method to load the zftp command. If it is
already built into the shell, change zfinit to zfinit -n. It
is helpful (though <br>
not essential) if the call to zfinit appears after any code
to initialize the new completion system, else unnecessary
compctl commands will be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUNCTIONS <br>
The sequence of operations in performing a file transfer is
essentially the same as that in a standard FTP client. Note
that, due to a quirk of the shell&rsquo;s getopts builtin,
for <br>
those functions that handle options you must use
&lsquo;--&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;-&rsquo; to ensure the
remaining arguments are treated literally (a single
&lsquo;-&rsquo; is treated as an argument).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Opening a connection <br>
zfparams [ host [ user [ password ... ] ] ] <br>
Set or show the parameters for a future zfopen with no
arguments. If no arguments are given, the current parameters
are displayed (the password will be shown as a line of <br>
asterisks). If a host is given, and either the user or
password is not, they will be prompted for; also, any
parameter given as &lsquo;?&rsquo; will be prompted for, and
if the &lsquo;?&rsquo; <br>
is followed by a string, that will be used as the prompt. As
zfopen calls zfparams to store the parameters, this usually
need not be called directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A single argument
&lsquo;-&rsquo; will delete the stored parameters. This will
also cause the memory of the last directory (and so on) on
the other host to be deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfopen [ -1 ] [ host [ user [
password [ account ] ] ] ] <br>
If host is present, open a connection to that host under
username user with password password (and, on the rare
occasions when it is necessary, account account). If a <br>
necessary parameter is missing or given as &lsquo;?&rsquo;
it will be prompted for. If host is not present, use a
previously stored set of parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the command was successful,
and the terminal is compatible with xterm or is sun-cmd, a
summary will appear in the title bar, giving the local
host:directory and the <br>
remote host:directory; this is handled by the function
zftp_chpwd, described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, the host, user and
password are internally recorded for later re-opening,
either by a zfopen with no arguments, or automatically (see
below). With the option <br>
&lsquo;-1&rsquo;, no information is stored. Also, if an open
command with arguments failed, the parameters will not be
retained (and any previous parameters will also be deleted).
A <br>
zfopen on its own, or a zfopen -1, never alters the stored
parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both zfopen and zfanon (but not
zfparams) understand URLs of the form ftp://host/path... as
meaning to connect to the host, then change directory to
path (which must be a <br>
directory, not a file). The &lsquo;ftp://&rsquo; can be
omitted; the trailing &lsquo;/&rsquo; is enough to trigger
recognition of the path. Note prefixes other than
&lsquo;ftp:&rsquo; are not recognized, <br>
and that all characters after the first slash beyond host
are significant in path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfanon [ -1 ] host <br>
Open a connection host for anonymous FTP. The username used
is &lsquo;anonymous&rsquo;. The password (which will be
reported the first time) is generated as user@host; this is
then <br>
stored in the shell parameter $EMAIL_ADDR which can
alternatively be set manually to a suitable string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Directory management <br>
zfcd [ dir ] <br>
zfcd - <br>
zfcd old new <br>
Change the current directory on the remote server: this is
implemented to have many of the features of the shell
builtin cd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the first form with dir
present, change to the directory dir. The command
&lsquo;zfcd ..&rsquo; is treated specially, so is guaranteed
to work on non-UNIX servers (note this is <br>
handled internally by zftp). If dir is omitted, has the
effect of &lsquo;zfcd ~&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second form changes to the
directory previously current.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third form attempts to
change the current directory by replacing the first
occurrence of the string old with the string new in the
current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that in this command, and
indeed anywhere a remote filename is expected, the string
which on the local host corresponds to &lsquo;~&rsquo; is
converted back to a &lsquo;~&rsquo; before being <br>
passed to the remote machine. This is convenient because of
the way expansion is performed on the command line before
zfcd receives a string. For example, suppose the <br>
command is &lsquo;zfcd ~/foo&rsquo;. The shell will expand
this to a full path such as &lsquo;zfcd
/home/user2/pws/foo&rsquo;. At this stage, zfcd recognises
the initial path as corresponding <br>
to &lsquo;~&rsquo; and will send the directory to the remote
host as ~/foo, so that the &lsquo;~&rsquo; will be expanded
by the server to the correct remote host directory. Other
named directo&acirc; <br>
ries of the form &lsquo;~name&rsquo; are not treated in this
fashion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfhere Change directory on the
remote server to the one corresponding to the current local
directory, with special handling of &lsquo;~&rsquo; as in
zfcd. For example, if the current local <br>
directory is ~/foo/bar, then zfhere performs the effect of
&lsquo;zfcd ~/foo/bar&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfdir [ -rfd ] [ - ] [
dir-options ] [ dir ] <br>
Produce a long directory listing. The arguments dir-options
and dir are passed directly to the server and their effect
is implementation dependent, but specifying a par&acirc;
<br>
ticular remote directory dir is usually possible. The output
is passed through a pager given by the environment variable
$PAGER, or &lsquo;more&rsquo; if that is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directory is usually cached
for re-use. In fact, two caches are maintained. One is for
use when there is no dir-options or dir, i.e. a full listing
of the current <br>
remote directory; it is flushed when the current remote
directory changes. The other is kept for repeated use of
zfdir with the same arguments; for example, repeated use
<br>
of &lsquo;zfdir /pub/gnu&rsquo; will only require the
directory to be retrieved on the first call. Alternatively,
this cache can be re-viewed with the -r option. As relative
direc&acirc; <br>
tories will confuse zfdir, the -f option can be used to
force the cache to be flushed before the directory is
listed. The option -d will delete both caches without
show&acirc; <br>
ing a directory listing; it will also delete the cache of
file names in the current remote directory, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfls [ ls-options ] [ dir ] <br>
List files on the remote server. With no arguments, this
will produce a simple list of file names for the current
remote directory. Any arguments are passed directly to <br>
the server. No pager and no caching is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Status commands <br>
zftype [ type ] <br>
With no arguments, show the type of data to be transferred,
usually ASCII or binary. With an argument, change the type:
the types &lsquo;A&rsquo; or &lsquo;ASCII&rsquo; for ASCII
data and &lsquo;B&rsquo; or <br>
&lsquo;BINARY&rsquo;, &lsquo;I&rsquo; or &lsquo;IMAGE&rsquo;
for binary data are understood case-insensitively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfstat [ -v ] <br>
Show the status of the current or last connection, as well
as the status of some of zftp&rsquo;s status variables. With
the -v option, a more verbose listing is produced by <br>
querying the server for its version of events, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Retrieving files <br>
The commands for retrieving files all take at least two
options. -G suppresses remote filename expansion which would
otherwise be performed (see below for a more detailed <br>
description of that). -t attempts to set the modification
time of the local file to that of the remote file: see the
description of the function zfrtime below for more
informa&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfget [ -Gtc ] file1 ... <br>
Retrieve all the listed files file1 ... one at a time from
the remote server. If a file contains a &lsquo;/&rsquo;, the
full name is passed to the remote server, but the file is
<br>
stored locally under the name given by the part after the
final &lsquo;/&rsquo;. The option -c (cat) forces all files
to be sent as a single stream to standard output; in this
case <br>
the -t option has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfuget [ -Gvst ] file1 ... <br>
As zfget, but only retrieve files where the version on the
remote server is newer (has a later modification time), or
where the local file does not exist. If the remote <br>
file is older but the files have different sizes, or if the
sizes are the same but the remote file is newer, the user
will usually be queried. With the option -s, the <br>
command runs silently and will always retrieve the file in
either of those two cases. With the option -v, the command
prints more information about the files while it is <br>
working out whether or not to transfer them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfcget [ -Gt ] file1 ... <br>
As zfget, but if any of the local files exists, and is
shorter than the corresponding remote file, the command
assumes that it is the result of a partially completed <br>
transfer and attempts to transfer the rest of the file. This
is useful on a poor connection which keeps failing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this requires a
commonly implemented, but non-standard, version of the FTP
protocol, so is not guaranteed to work on all servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfgcp [ -Gt ] remote-file
local-file <br>
zfgcp [ -Gt ] rfile1 ... ldir <br>
This retrieves files from the remote server with arguments
behaving similarly to the cp command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the first form, copy
remote-file from the server to the local file
local-file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the second form, copy all the
remote files rfile1 ... into the local directory ldir
retaining the same basenames. This assumes UNIX directory
semantics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sending files <br>
zfput [ -r ] file1 ... <br>
Send all the file1 ... given separately to the remote
server. If a filename contains a &lsquo;/&rsquo;, the full
filename is used locally to find the file, but only the
basename is <br>
used for the remote file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the option -r, if any of
the files are directories they are sent recursively with all
their subdirectories, including files beginning with
&lsquo;.&rsquo;. This requires that <br>
the remote machine understand UNIX file semantics, since
&lsquo;/&rsquo; is used as a directory separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfuput [ -vs ] file1 ... <br>
As zfput, but only send files which are newer than their
local equivalents, or if the remote file does not exist. The
logic is the same as for zfuget, but reversed <br>
between local and remote files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfcput file1 ... <br>
As zfput, but if any remote file already exists and is
shorter than the local equivalent, assume it is the result
of an incomplete transfer and send the rest of the file <br>
to append to the existing part. As the FTP append command is
part of the standard set, this is in principle more likely
to work than zfcget.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfpcp local-file remote-file
<br>
zfpcp lfile1 ... rdir <br>
This sends files to the remote server with arguments
behaving similarly to the cp command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With two arguments, copy
local-file to the server as remote-file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With more than two arguments,
copy all the local files lfile1 ... into the existing remote
directory rdir retaining the same basenames. This assumes
UNIX directory seman&acirc; <br>
tics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A problem arises if you attempt
to use zfpcp lfile1 rdir, i.e. the second form of copying
but with two arguments, as the command has no simple way of
knowing if rdir cor&acirc; <br>
responds to a directory or a filename. It attempts to
resolve this in various ways. First, if the rdir argument is
&lsquo;.&rsquo; or &lsquo;..&rsquo; or ends in a slash, it
is assumed to be a <br>
directory. Secondly, if the operation of copying to a remote
file in the first form failed, and the remote server sends
back the expected failure code 553 and a reply <br>
including the string &lsquo;Is a directory&rsquo;, then
zfpcp will retry using the second form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Closing the connection <br>
zfclose <br>
Close the connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Session management <br>
zfsession [ -lvod ] [ sessname ] <br>
Allows you to manage multiple FTP sessions at once. By
default, connections take place in a session called
&lsquo;default&rsquo;; by giving the command
&lsquo;zfsession sessname&rsquo; you can <br>
change to a new or existing session with a name of your
choice. The new session remembers its own connection, as
well as associated shell parameters, and also the <br>
host/user parameters set by zfparams. Hence you can have
different sessions set up to connect to different hosts,
each remembering the appropriate host, user and pass&acirc;
<br>
word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With no arguments, zfsession
prints the name of the current session; with the option -l
it lists all sessions which currently exist, and with the
option -v it gives a ver&acirc; <br>
bose list showing the host and directory for each session,
where the current session is marked with an asterisk. With
-o, it will switch to the most recent previous ses&acirc;
<br>
sion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -d, the given session (or
else the current one) is removed; everything to do with it
is completely forgotten. If it was the only session, a new
session called <br>
&lsquo;default&rsquo; is created and made current. It is
safest not to delete sessions while background commands
using zftp are active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zftransfer sess1:file1
sess2:file2 <br>
Transfer files between two sessions; no local copy is made.
The file is read from the session sess1 as file1 and written
to session sess2 as file file2; file1 and file2 <br>
may be relative to the current directories of the session.
Either sess1 or sess2 may be omitted (though the colon
should be retained if there is a possibility of a colon <br>
appearing in the file name) and defaults to the current
session; file2 may be omitted or may end with a slash, in
which case the basename of file1 will be added. The
ses&acirc; <br>
sions sess1 and sess2 must be distinct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The operation is performed using
pipes, so it is required that the connections still be valid
in a subshell, which is not the case under versions of some
operating sys&acirc; <br>
tems, presumably due to a system bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bookmarks <br>
The two functions zfmark and zfgoto allow you to
&lsquo;bookmark&rsquo; the present location (host, user and
directory) of the current FTP connection for later use. The
file to be used for <br>
storing and retrieving bookmarks is given by the parameter
$ZFTP_BMFILE; if not set when one of the two functions is
called, it will be set to the file .zfbkmarks in the
direc&acirc; <br>
tory where your zsh startup files live (usually ~).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfmark [ bookmark ] <br>
If given an argument, mark the current host, user and
directory under the name bookmark for later use by zfgoto.
If there is no connection open, use the values for the <br>
last connection immediately before it was closed; it is an
error if there was none. Any existing bookmark under the
same name will be silently replaced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If not given an argument, list
the existing bookmarks and the points to which they refer in
the form user@host:directory; this is the format in which
they are stored, and <br>
the file may be edited directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfgoto [ -n ] bookmark <br>
Return to the location given by bookmark, as previously set
by zfmark. If the location has user &lsquo;ftp&rsquo; or
&lsquo;anonymous&rsquo;, open the connection with zfanon, so
that no password <br>
is required. If the user and host parameters match those
stored for the current session, if any, those will be used,
and again no password is required. Otherwise a pass&acirc;
<br>
word will be prompted for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the option -n, the bookmark
is taken to be a nickname stored by the ncftp program in its
bookmark file, which is assumed to be ~/.ncftp/bookmarks.
The function works <br>
identically in other ways. Note that there is no mechanism
for adding or modifying ncftp bookmarks from the zftp
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other functions <br>
Mostly, these functions will not be called directly (apart
from zfinit), but are described here for completeness. You
may wish to alter zftp_chpwd and zftp_progress, in
particu&acirc; <br>
lar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfinit [ -n ] <br>
As described above, this is used to initialize the zftp
function system. The -n option should be used if the zftp
command is already built into the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfautocheck [ -dn ] <br>
This function is called to implement automatic reopening
behaviour, as described in more detail below. The options
must appear in the first argument; -n prevents the
com&acirc; <br>
mand from changing to the old directory, while -d prevents
it from setting the variable do_close, which it otherwise
does as a flag for automatically closing the connec&acirc;
<br>
tion after a transfer. The host and directory for the last
session are stored in the variable $zflastsession, but the
internal host/user/password parameters must also be <br>
correctly set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfcd_match prefix suffix <br>
This performs matching for completion of remote directory
names. If the remote server is UNIX, it will attempt to
persuade the server to list the remote directory with <br>
subdirectories marked, which usually works but is not
guaranteed. On other hosts it simply calls zfget_match and
hence completes all files, not just directories. On some
<br>
systems, directories may not even look like filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfget_match prefix suffix <br>
This performs matching for completion of remote filenames.
It caches files for the current directory (only) in the
shell parameter $zftp_fcache. It is in the form to be <br>
called by the -K option of compctl, but also works when
called from a widget-style completion function with prefix
and suffix set appropriately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfrglob varname <br>
Perform remote globbing, as describes in more detail below.
varname is the name of a variable containing the pattern to
be expanded; if there were any matches, the same <br>
variable will be set to the expanded set of filenames on
return.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zfrtime lfile rfile [ time ]
<br>
Set the local file lfile to have the same modification time
as the remote file rfile, or the explicit time time in FTP
format CCYYMMDDhhmmSS for the GMT timezone. This <br>
uses the shell&rsquo;s zsh/datetime module to perform the
conversion from GMT to local time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zftp_chpwd <br>
This function is called every time a connection is opened,
or closed, or the remote directory changes. This version
alters the title bar of an xterm-compatible or sun-cmd <br>
terminal emulator to reflect the local and remote hostnames
and current directories. It works best when combined with
the function chpwd. In particular, a function of <br>
the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chpwd() { <br>
if [[ -n $ZFTP_USER ]]; then <br>
zftp_chpwd <br>
else <br>
# usual chpwd e.g put host:directory in title bar <br>
fi <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fits in well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zftp_progress <br>
This function shows the status of the transfer. It will not
write anything unless the output is going to a terminal;
however, if you transfer files in the background, you <br>
should turn off progress reports by hand using &lsquo;zstyle
&rsquo;:zftp:*&rsquo; progress none&rsquo;. Note also that
if you alter it, any output must be to standard error, as
standard output <br>
may be a file being received. The form of the progress
meter, or whether it is used at all, can be configured
without altering the function, as described in the next
sec&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zffcache <br>
This is used to implement caching of files in the current
directory for each session separately. It is used by
zfget_match and zfrglob.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES <br>
Configuration <br>
Various styles are available using the standard shell style
mechanism, described in zshmodules(1). Briefly, the command
&lsquo;zstyle &rsquo;:zftp:*&rsquo; style value ...&rsquo;.
defines the style to <br>
have value value; more than one value may be given, although
that is not useful in the cases described here. These values
will then be used throughout the zftp function system. <br>
For more precise control, the first argument, which gives a
context in which the style applies, can be modified to
include a particular function, as for example
&lsquo;:zftp:zfget&rsquo;: <br>
the style will then have the given value only in the zfget
function. Values for the same style in different contexts
may be set; the most specific function will be used, where
<br>
strings are held to be more specific than patterns, and
longer patterns and shorter patterns. Note that only the top
level function name, as called by the user, is used; calling
<br>
of lower level functions is transparent to the user. Hence
modifications to the title bar in zftp_chpwd use the
contexts :zftp:zfopen, :zftp:zfcd, etc., depending where it
was <br>
called from. The following styles are understood:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">progress <br>
Controls the way that zftp_progress reports on the progress
of a transfer. If empty, unset, or &lsquo;none&rsquo;, no
progress report is made; if &lsquo;bar&rsquo; a growing bar
of inverse video <br>
is shown; if &lsquo;percent&rsquo; (or any other string,
though this may change in future), the percentage of the
file transferred is shown. The bar meter requires that the
width of <br>
the terminal be available via the $COLUMNS parameter
(normally this is set automatically). If the size of the
file being transferred is not available, bar and percent
<br>
meters will simply show the number of bytes transferred so
far.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When zfinit is run, if this
style is not defined for the context :zftp:*, it will be set
to &lsquo;bar&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update Specifies the minimum
time interval between updates of the progress meter in
seconds. No update is made unless new data has been
received, so the actual time interval is <br>
limited only by $ZFTP_TIMEOUT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As described for progress,
zfinit will force this to default to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote-glob <br>
If set to &lsquo;1&rsquo;, &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or
&lsquo;true&rsquo;, filename generation (globbing) is
performed on the remote machine instead of by zsh itself;
see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">titlebar <br>
If set to &lsquo;1&rsquo;, &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or
&lsquo;true&rsquo;, zftp_chpwd will put the remote host and
remote directory into the titlebar of terminal emulators
such as xterm or sun-cmd that allow this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As described for progress,
zfinit will force this to default to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chpwd If set to &lsquo;1&rsquo;
&lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;true&rsquo;, zftp_chpwd will
call the function chpwd when a connection is closed. This is
useful if the remote host details were put into the terminal
<br>
title bar by zftp_chpwd and your usual chpwd also modifies
the title bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When zfinit is run, it will
determine whether chpwd exists and if so it will set the
default value for the style to 1 if none exists already.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that there is also an
associative array zfconfig which contains values used by the
function system. This should not be modified or
overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remote globbing <br>
The commands for retrieving files usually perform filename
generation (globbing) on their arguments; this can be turned
off by passing the option -G to each of the commands. <br>
Normally this operates by retrieving a complete list of
files for the directory in question, then matching these
locally against the pattern supplied. This has the advantage
<br>
that the full range of zsh patterns (respecting the setting
of the option EXTENDED_GLOB) can be used. However, it means
that the directory part of a filename will not be <br>
expanded and must be given exactly. If the remote server
does not support the UNIX directory semantics, directory
handling is problematic and it is recommended that globbing
<br>
only be used within the current directory. The list of files
in the current directory, if retrieved, will be cached, so
that subsequent globs in the same directory without an <br>
intervening zfcd are much faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the remote-glob style (see
above) is set, globbing is instead performed on the remote
host: the server is asked for a list of matching files. This
is highly dependent on how <br>
the server is implemented, though typically UNIX servers
will provide support for basic glob patterns. This may in
some cases be faster, as it avoids retrieving the entire
list <br>
of directory contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatic and temporary
reopening <br>
As described for the zfopen command, a subsequent zfopen
with no parameters will reopen the connection to the last
host (this includes connections made with the zfanon
command). <br>
Opened in this fashion, the connection starts in the default
remote directory and will remain open until explicitly
closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatic re-opening is also
available. If a connection is not currently open and a
command requiring a connection is given, the last connection
is implicitly reopened. In this <br>
case the directory which was current when the connection was
closed again becomes the current directory (unless, of
course, the command given changes it). Automatic reopening
<br>
will also take place if the connection was close by the
remote server for whatever reason (e.g. a timeout). It is
not available if the -1 option to zfopen or zfanon was
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, if the command
issued is a file transfer, the connection will be closed
after the transfer is finished, hence providing a one-shot
mode for transfers. This does not <br>
apply to directory changing or listing commands; for example
a zfdir may reopen a connection but will leave it open.
Also, automatic closure will only ever happen in the same
<br>
command as automatic opening, i.e a zfdir directly followed
by a zfget will never close the connection
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Information about the previous
connection is given by the zfstat function. So, for example,
if that reports:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Session: default <br>
Not connected. <br>
Last session: ftp.bar.com:/pub/textfiles</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then the command zfget file.txt
will attempt to reopen a connection to ftp.bar.com, retrieve
the file /pub/textfiles/file.txt, and immediately close the
connection again. On the <br>
other hand, zfcd .. will open the connection in the
directory /pub and leave it open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that all the above is local
to each session; if you return to a previous session, the
connection for that session is the one which will be
reopened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Completion <br>
Completion of local and remote files, directories, sessions
and bookmarks is supported. The older, compctl-style
completion is defined when zfinit is called; support for the
new <br>
widget-based completion system is provided in the function
Completion/Zsh/Command/_zftp, which should be installed with
the other functions of the completion system and hence <br>
should automatically be available.</p>
