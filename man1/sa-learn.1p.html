<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Given a typical selection of your incoming mail classified as spam or ham
  (non-spam), this tool will feed each mail to SpamAssassin, allowing it to
  'learn' what signs are likely to mean spam, and which are likely to mean ham.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Simply run this command once for each of your mail folders, and it will
  ''learn'' from the mail therein.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that csh-style <i>globbing</i> in the mail folder names is supported; in
  other words, listing a folder name as &quot;*&quot; will scan every folder
  that matches. See &quot;Mail::SpamAssassin::ArchiveIterator&quot; for more
  details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
SpamAssassin remembers which mail messages it has learnt already, and will not
  re-learn those messages again, unless you use the <b>--forget</b> option.
  Messages learnt as spam will have SpamAssassin markup removed, on the fly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you make a mistake and scan a mail as ham when it is spam, or vice versa,
  simply rerun this command with the correct classification, and the mistake
  will be corrected. SpamAssassin will automatically 'forget' the previous
  indications.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Users of &quot;spamd&quot; who wish to perform training remotely, over a
  network, should investigate the &quot;spamc -L&quot; switch.

    Clarification: The state of <i>--no-sync</i> overrides the
      <i>bayes_learn_to_journal</i> configuration option. If not specified,
      sa-learn will learn to the database directly. If specified, sa-learn will
      learn to the journal file.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note: <i>--sync</i> and <i>--no-sync</i> can be specified on the same

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MIGRATION"><a class="selflink" href="#MIGRATION">MIGRATION</a></h1>
There are now multiple backend storage modules available for storing user's
  bayesian data. As such you might want to migrate from one backend to another.
  Here is a simple procedure for migrating from one backend to another.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that if you have individual user databases you will have to perform a
  similar procedure for each one of them.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">sa-learn --sync</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This will sync any outstanding journal entries</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">sa-learn --backup &gt; backup.txt</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This will save all your Bayes data to a plain text
    file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">sa-learn --clear</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is optional, but good to do to clear out the old
      database.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Repeat!</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">At this point, if you have multiple databases, you should
      perform the procedure above for each of them. (i.e. each user's database
      needs to be backed up before continuing.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Switch backends</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Once you have backed up all databases you can update your
      configuration for the new database backend. This will involve at least the
      bayes_store_module config option and may involve some additional config
      options depending on what is required by the module. (For example, you may
      need to configure an SQL database.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">sa-learn --restore backup.txt</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Again, you need to do this for every database.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are migrating to SQL you can make use of the -u &lt;username&gt; option
  in sa-learn to populate each user's database. Otherwise, you must run sa-learn
  as the user who database you are restoring.

(Thanks to Michael Bell for this section!)
<div class="Pp"></div>
For a more lengthy description of how this works, go to
  http://www.paulgraham.com/ and see &quot;A Plan for Spam&quot;. It's
  reasonably readable, even if statistics make me break out in hives.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The short semi-inaccurate version: Given training, a spam heuristics engine can
  take the most &quot;spammy&quot; and &quot;hammy&quot; words and apply
  probabilistic analysis. Furthermore, once given a basis for the analysis, the
  engine can continue to learn iteratively by applying both the non-Bayesian and
  Bayesian rulesets together to create evolving &quot;intelligence&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
SpamAssassin 2.50 and later supports Bayesian spam analysis, in the form of the
  BAYES rules. This is a new feature, quite powerful, and is disabled until
  enough messages have been learnt.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The pros of Bayesian spam analysis:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Can greatly reduce false positives and false
    negatives.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">It learns from your mail, so it is tailored to your unique
      e-mail flow.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Once it starts learning, it can continue to learn from
    SpamAssassin and improve over time.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And the cons:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">A decent number of messages are required before results are
    useful for ham/spam determination.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">It's hard to explain why a message is or isn't marked as
    spam.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">i.e.: a straightforward rule, that matches, say,
      &quot;VIAGRA&quot; is easy to understand. If it generates a false positive
      or false negative, it is fairly easy to understand why.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    With Bayesian analysis, it's all probabilities - &quot;because the past says
      it is likely as this falls into a probabilistic distribution common to
      past spam in your systems&quot;. Tell that to your users! Tell that to the
      client when he asks &quot;what can I do to change this&quot;. (By the way,
      the answer in this case is &quot;use whitelisting&quot;.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">It will take disk space and memory.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The databases it maintains take quite a lot of resources to
      store and use.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GETTING_STARTED"><a class="selflink" href="#GETTING_STARTED">GETTING
  STARTED</a></h1>
Still interested? Ok, here's the guidelines for getting this working.
<div class="Pp"></div>
First a high-level overview:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Build a significant sample of both ham and spam.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">I suggest several thousand of each, placed in SPAM and HAM
      directories or mailboxes. Yes, you MUST hand-sort this - otherwise the
      results won't be much better than SpamAssassin on its own. Verify the
      spamminess/haminess of EVERY message. You're urged to avoid using a
      publicly available corpus (sample) - this must be taken from YOUR mail
      server, if it is to be statistically useful. Otherwise, the results may be
      pretty skewed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Use this tool to teach SpamAssassin about these samples,
    like so:</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
        sa-learn --spam /path/to/spam/folder
        sa-learn --ham /path/to/ham/folder
        ...
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Let SpamAssassin proceed, learning stuff. When it finds ham and spam it will
      add the &quot;interesting tokens&quot; to the database.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">If you need SpamAssassin to forget about specific messages,
    use the <b>--forget</b> option.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This can be applied to either ham or spam that has run
      through the <b>sa-learn</b> processes. It's a bit of a hammer, really,
      lowering the weighting of the specific tokens in that message (only if
      that message has been processed before).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Learning from single messages uses a command like
    this:</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
        sa-learn --ham --no-sync mailmessage
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This is handy for binding to a key in your mail user agent. It's very fast,
      as all the time-consuming stuff is deferred until you run with the
      &quot;--sync&quot; option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Autolearning is enabled by default</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If you don't have a corpus of mail saved to learn, you can
      let SpamAssassin automatically learn the mail that you receive. If you are
      autolearning from scratch, the amount of mail you receive will determine

  TRAINING</a></h1>
Learning filters require training to be effective. If you don't train them, they
  won't work. In addition, you need to train them with new messages regularly to
  keep them up-to-date, or their data will become stale and impact accuracy.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You need to train with both spam <i>and</i> ham mails. One type of mail alone
  will not have any effect.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that if your mail folders contain things like forwarded spam, discussions
  of spam-catching rules, etc., this will cause trouble. You should avoid
  scanning those messages if possible. (An easy way to do this is to move them
  aside, into a folder which is not scanned.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the messages you are learning from have already been filtered through
  SpamAssassin, the learner will compensate for this. In effect, it learns what
  each message would look like if you had run &quot;spamassassin -d&quot; over
  it in advance.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another thing to be aware of, is that typically you should aim to train with at
  least 1000 messages of spam, and 1000 ham messages, if possible. More is
  better, but anything over about 5000 messages does not improve accuracy
  significantly in our tests.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Be careful that you train from the same source -- for example, if you train on
  old spam, but new ham mail, then the classifier will think that a mail with an
  old date stamp is likely to be spam.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It's also worth noting that training with a very small quantity of ham, will
  produce atrocious results. You should aim to train with at least the same
  amount (or more if possible!) of ham data than spam.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On an on-going basis, it is best to keep training the filter to make sure it has
  fresh data to work from. There are various ways to do this:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1. Supervised learning</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This means keeping a copy of all or most of your mail,
      separated into spam and ham piles, and periodically re-training using
      those. It produces the best results, but requires more work from you, the
      user.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    (An easy way to do this, by the way, is to create a new folder for 'deleted'
      messages, and instead of deleting them from other folders, simply move
      them in there instead. Then keep all spam in a separate folder and never
      delete it. As long as you remember to move misclassified mails into the
      correct folder set, it is easy enough to keep up to date.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2. Unsupervised learning from Bayesian classification</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Another way to train is to chain the results of the
      Bayesian classifier back into the training, so it reinforces its own
      decisions. This is only safe if you then retrain it based on any errors
      you discover.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    SpamAssassin does not support this method, due to experimental results which
      strongly indicate that it does not work well, and since Bayes is only one
      part of the resulting score presented to the user (while Bayes may have
      made the wrong decision about a mail, it may have been overridden by
      another system).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3. Unsupervised learning from SpamAssassin rules</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Also called 'auto-learning' in SpamAssassin. Based on
      statistical analysis of the SpamAssassin success rates, we can
      automatically train the Bayesian database with a certain degree of
      confidence that our training data is accurate.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    It should be supplemented with some supervised training in addition, if
      possible.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This is the default, but can be turned off by setting the SpamAssassin
      configuration parameter &quot;bayes_auto_learn&quot; to 0.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">4. Mistake-based training</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This means training on a small number of mails, then only
      training on messages that SpamAssassin classifies incorrectly. This works,
      but it takes longer to get it right than a full training session
    would.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></h1>
<b>sa-learn</b> and the other parts of SpamAssassin's Bayesian learner, use a
  set of persistent database files to store the learnt tokens, as follows.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">bayes_toks</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The database of tokens, containing the tokens learnt, their
      count of occurrences in ham and spam, and the timestamp when the token was
      last seen in a message.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This database also contains some 'magic' tokens, as follows: the version
      number of the database, the number of ham and spam messages learnt, the
      number of tokens in the database, and timestamps of: the last journal
      sync, the last expiry run, the last expiry token reduction count, the last
      expiry timestamp delta, the oldest token timestamp in the database, and
      the newest token timestamp in the database.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This is a database file, using &quot;DB_File&quot;. The database 'version
      number' is 0 for databases from 2.5x, 1 for databases from certain 2.6x
      development releases, 2 for 2.6x, and 3 for 3.0 and later releases.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">bayes_seen</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A map of Message-Id and some data from headers and body to
      what that message was learnt as. This is used so that SpamAssassin can
      avoid re-learning a message it has already seen, and so it can reverse the
      training if you later decide that message was learnt incorrectly.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This is a database file, using &quot;DB_File&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">bayes_journal</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">While SpamAssassin is scanning mails, it needs to track
      which tokens it uses in its calculations. To avoid the contention of
      having each SpamAssassin process attempting to gain write access to the
      Bayes DB, the token timestamps are written to a 'journal' file which will
      later (either automatically or via &quot;sa-learn --sync&quot;) be used to
      synchronize the Bayes DB.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Also, through the use of &quot;bayes_learn_to_journal&quot;, or when using
      the &quot;--no-sync&quot; option with sa-learn, the actual learning data
      will take be placed into the journal for later synchronization. This is
      typically useful for high-traffic sites to avoid the same contention as
      stated above.</dd>

Since SpamAssassin can auto-learn messages, the Bayes database files could
  increase perpetually until they fill your disk. To control this, SpamAssassin
  performs journal synchronization and bayes expiration periodically when
  certain criteria (listed below) are met.
<div class="Pp"></div>
SpamAssassin can sync the journal and expire the DB tokens either manually or
  opportunistically. A journal sync is due if <i>--sync</i> is passed to
  sa-learn (manual), or if the following is true (opportunistic):
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">- bayes_journal_max_size does not equal 0 (means don't
    sync)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">- the journal file exists</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and either:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">- the journal file has a size greater than
    bayes_journal_max_size</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">- a journal sync has previously occurred, and at least 1
    day has passed since that sync</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Expiry is due if <i>--force-expire</i> is passed to sa-learn (manual), or if all
  of the following are true (opportunistic):
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">- the last expire was attempted at least 12hrs ago</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">- bayes_auto_expire does not equal 0</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">- the number of tokens in the DB is &gt; 100,000</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">- the number of tokens in the DB is &gt;
    bayes_expiry_max_db_size</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">- there is at least a 12 hr difference between the oldest
    and newest token atimes</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="EXPIRE_LOGIC"><a class="selflink" href="#EXPIRE_LOGIC">EXPIRE
  LOGIC</a></h2>
If either the manual or opportunistic method causes an expire run to start, here
  is the logic that is used:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">- figure out how many tokens to keep. take the larger of
    either bayes_expiry_max_db_size * 75% or 100,000 tokens. therefore, the goal
    reduction is number of tokens - number of tokens to keep.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">- if the reduction number is &lt; 1000 tokens, abort (not
    worth the effort).</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">- if an expire has been done before, guesstimate the new
    atime delta based on the old atime delta. (new_atime_delta = old_atime_delta
    * old_reduction_count / goal)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">- if no expire has been done before, or the last expire
    looks &quot;weird&quot;, do an estimation pass. The definition of
    &quot;weird&quot; is:</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">- last expire over 30 days ago</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">- last atime delta was &lt; 12 hrs</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">- last reduction count was &lt; 1000 tokens</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">- estimated new atime delta is &lt; 12 hrs</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">- the difference between the last reduction count and the
    goal reduction count is &gt; 50%</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"></div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="ESTIMATION_PASS_LOGIC"><a class="selflink" href="#ESTIMATION_PASS_LOGIC">ESTIMATION
  PASS LOGIC</a></h2>
Go through each of the DB's tokens. Starting at 12hrs, calculate whether or not
  the token would be expired (based on the difference between the token's atime
  and the db's newest token atime) and keep the count. Work out from 12hrs
  exponentially by powers of 2. ie: 12hrs * 1, 12hrs * 2, 12hrs * 4, 12hrs * 8,
  and so on, up to 12hrs * 512 (6144hrs, or 256 days).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The larger the delta, the smaller the number of tokens that will be expired.
  Conversely, the number of tokens goes up as the delta gets smaller. So
  starting at the largest atime delta, figure out which delta will expire the
  most tokens without going above the goal expiration count. Use this to choose
  the atime delta to use, unless one of the following occurs:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">- the largest atime (smallest reduction count) would expire
    too many tokens. this means the learned tokens are mostly old and there
    needs to be new tokens learned before an expire can occur.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">- all of the atime choices result in 0 tokens being
    removed. this means the tokens are all newer than 12 hours and there needs
    to be new tokens learned before an expire can occur.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">- the number of tokens that would be removed is &lt; 1000.
    the benefit isn't worth the effort. more tokens need to be learned.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the expire run gets past this point, it will continue to the end. A new DB is
  created since the majority of DB libraries don't shrink the DB file when
  tokens are removed. So we do the &quot;create new, migrate old to new, remove
  old, rename new&quot; shuffle.
