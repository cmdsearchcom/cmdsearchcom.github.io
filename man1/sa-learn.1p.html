<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Given a typical selection of your incoming mail classified
as spam or ham (non-spam), this tool will feed each mail to
SpamAssassin, allowing it to &rsquo;learn&rsquo; what signs
are likely <br>
to mean spam, and which are likely to mean ham.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simply run this command once for
each of your mail folders, and it will
&rsquo;&rsquo;learn&rsquo;&rsquo; from the mail therein.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that csh-style globbing in
the mail folder names is supported; in other words, listing
a folder name as &quot;*&quot; will scan every folder that
matches. See <br>
&quot;Mail::SpamAssassin::ArchiveIterator&quot; for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SpamAssassin remembers which
mail messages it has learnt already, and will not re-learn
those messages again, unless you use the --forget option.
Messages learnt as spam will <br>
have SpamAssassin markup removed, on the fly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you make a mistake and scan a
mail as ham when it is spam, or vice versa, simply rerun
this command with the correct classification, and the
mistake will be corrected. <br>
SpamAssassin will automatically &rsquo;forget&rsquo; the
previous indications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users of &quot;spamd&quot; who
wish to perform training remotely, over a network, should
investigate the &quot;spamc -L&quot; switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--ham <br>
Learn the input message(s) as ham. If you have previously
learnt any of the messages as spam, SpamAssassin will forget
them first, then re-learn them as ham. <br>
Alternatively, if you have previously learnt them as ham,
it&rsquo;ll skip them this time around. If the messages have
already been filtered through SpamAssassin, the learner will
<br>
ignore any modifications SpamAssassin may have made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--spam <br>
Learn the input message(s) as spam. If you have previously
learnt any of the messages as ham, SpamAssassin will forget
them first, then re-learn them as spam. <br>
Alternatively, if you have previously learnt them as spam,
it&rsquo;ll skip them this time around. If the messages have
already been filtered through SpamAssassin, the learner <br>
will ignore any modifications SpamAssassin may have
made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--folders=filename, -f filename
<br>
sa-learn will read in the list of folders from the specified
file, one folder per line in the file. If the folder is
prefixed with &quot;ham:type:&quot; or
&quot;spam:type:&quot;, sa-learn will <br>
learn that folder appropriately, otherwise the folders will
be assumed to be of the type specified by --ham or
--spam.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;type&quot; above is
optional, but is the same as the standard for
ArchiveIterator: mbox, mbx, dir, file, or detect (the
default if not specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mbox <br>
sa-learn will read in the file(s) containing the emails to
be learned, and will process them in mbox format (one or
more emails per file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mbx <br>
sa-learn will read in the file(s) containing the emails to
be learned, and will process them in mbx format (one or more
emails per file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-ignores <br>
Don&rsquo;t learn the message if a from address matches
configuration file item &quot;bayes_ignore_from&quot; or a
to address matches &quot;bayes_ignore_to&quot;. The option
might be used when <br>
learning from a large file of messages from which the hammy
spam messages or spammy ham messages have not been
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sync <br>
Synchronize the journal and databases. Upon successfully
syncing the database with the entries in the journal, the
journal file is removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force-expire <br>
Forces an expiry attempt, regardless of whether it may be
necessary or not. Note: This doesn&rsquo;t mean any tokens
will actually expire. Please see the EXPIRATION section <br>
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: &quot;--force-expire&quot;
also causes the journal data to be synchronized into the
Bayes databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--forget <br>
Forget a given message previously learnt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dbpath <br>
Allows a commandline override of the bayes_path
configuration option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dump option <br>
Display the contents of the Bayes database. Without an
option or with the all option, all magic tokens and data
tokens will be displayed. magic will only display magic <br>
tokens, and data will only display the data tokens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can also use the --regexp RE
option to specify which tokens to display based on a regular
expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--clear <br>
Clear an existing Bayes database by removing all traces of
the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: This is destructive and
should be used with care.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--backup <br>
Performs a dump of the Bayes database in machine/human
readable format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dump will include token and
seen data. It is suitable for input back into the --restore
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--restore=filename <br>
Performs a restore of the Bayes database defined by
filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: This is a destructive
operation, previous Bayes data will be wiped out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print help message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u username, --username=username
<br>
If specified this username will override the username taken
from the runtime environment. You can use this option to
specify users in a virtual user configuration when using
<br>
SQL as the Bayes backend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This option will not
change to the given username, it will only attempt to act on
behalf of that user. Because of this you will need to have
proper permissions to be <br>
able to change files owned by username. In the case of SQL
this generally is not a problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C path, --configpath=path,
--config-file=path <br>
Use the specified path for locating the distributed
configuration files. Ignore the default directories (usually
&quot;/usr/share/spamassassin&quot; or similar).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--siteconfigpath=path <br>
Use the specified path for locating site-specific
configuration files. Ignore the default directories (usually
&quot;/etc/spamassassin&quot; or similar).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cf=&rsquo;config line&rsquo;
<br>
Add additional lines of configuration directly from the
command-line, parsed after the configuration files are read.
Multiple --cf arguments can be used, and each will be <br>
considered a separate line of configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p prefs, --prefspath=prefs,
--prefs-file=prefs <br>
Read user score preferences from prefs (usually
&quot;$HOME/.spamassassin/user_prefs&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--progress <br>
Prints a progress bar (to STDERR) showing the current
progress. In the case where no valid terminal is found this
option will behave very much like the --showdots option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D [area,...], --debug
[area,...] <br>
Produce debugging output. If no areas are listed, all
debugging information is printed. Diagnostic output can also
be enabled for each area individually; area is the area of
<br>
the code to instrument. For example, to produce diagnostic
output on bayes, learn, and dns, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamassassin -D
bayes,learn,dns</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information about which
areas (also known as channels) are available, please see the
documentation at:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">C&lt;http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/DebugChannels&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Higher priority informational
messages that are suitable for logging in normal
circumstances are available with an area of
&quot;info&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-sync <br>
Skip the slow synchronization step which normally takes
place after changing database entries. If you plan to learn
from many folders in a batch, or to learn many individual
<br>
messages one-by-one, it is faster to use this switch and run
&quot;sa-learn --sync&quot; once all the folders have been
scanned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clarification: The state of
--no-sync overrides the bayes_learn_to_journal configuration
option. If not specified, sa-learn will learn to the
database directly. If <br>
specified, sa-learn will learn to the journal file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: --sync and --no-sync can
be specified on the same commandline, which is slightly
confusing. In this case, the --no-sync option is ignored
since there is no learn <br>
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --local <br>
Do not perform any network accesses while learning details
about the mail messages. This will speed up the learning
process, but may result in a slightly lower accuracy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this is currently
ignored, as current versions of SpamAssassin will not
perform network access while learning; but future versions
may.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--import <br>
If you previously used SpamAssassin&rsquo;s Bayesian learner
without the &quot;DB_File&quot; module installed, it will
have created files in other formats, such as
&quot;GDBM_File&quot;, &quot;NDBM_File&quot;, <br>
or &quot;SDBM_File&quot;. This switch allows you to migrate
that old data into the &quot;DB_File&quot; format. It will
overwrite any data currently in the &quot;DB_File&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can also be used with the
--dbpath path option to specify the location of the Bayes
files to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIGRATION <br>
There are now multiple backend storage modules available for
storing user&rsquo;s bayesian data. As such you might want
to migrate from one backend to another. Here is a simple
<br>
procedure for migrating from one backend to another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if you have individual
user databases you will have to perform a similar procedure
for each one of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sa-learn --sync <br>
This will sync any outstanding journal entries</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sa-learn --backup &gt;
backup.txt <br>
This will save all your Bayes data to a plain text file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sa-learn --clear <br>
This is optional, but good to do to clear out the old
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Repeat! <br>
At this point, if you have multiple databases, you should
perform the procedure above for each of them. (i.e. each
user&rsquo;s database needs to be backed up before
continuing.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switch backends <br>
Once you have backed up all databases you can update your
configuration for the new database backend. This will
involve at least the bayes_store_module config option and
may <br>
involve some additional config options depending on what is
required by the module. (For example, you may need to
configure an SQL database.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sa-learn --restore backup.txt
<br>
Again, you need to do this for every database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are migrating to SQL you
can make use of the -u &lt;username&gt; option in sa-learn
to populate each user&rsquo;s database. Otherwise, you must
run sa-learn as the user who database <br>
you are restoring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION TO BAYESIAN
FILTERING <br>
(Thanks to Michael Bell for this section!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a more lengthy description
of how this works, go to http://www.paulgraham.com/ and see
&quot;A Plan for Spam&quot;. It&rsquo;s reasonably readable,
even if statistics make me break out in <br>
hives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The short semi-inaccurate
version: Given training, a spam heuristics engine can take
the most &quot;spammy&quot; and &quot;hammy&quot; words and
apply probabilistic analysis. Furthermore, once given <br>
a basis for the analysis, the engine can continue to learn
iteratively by applying both the non-Bayesian and Bayesian
rulesets together to create evolving
&quot;intelligence&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SpamAssassin 2.50 and later
supports Bayesian spam analysis, in the form of the BAYES
rules. This is a new feature, quite powerful, and is
disabled until enough messages have <br>
been learnt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pros of Bayesian spam
analysis:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can greatly reduce false
positives and false negatives. <br>
It learns from your mail, so it is tailored to your unique
e-mail flow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once it starts learning, it can
continue to learn from SpamAssassin and improve over
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And the cons:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A decent number of messages are
required before results are useful for ham/spam
determination. <br>
It&rsquo;s hard to explain why a message is or isn&rsquo;t
marked as spam. <br>
i.e.: a straightforward rule, that matches, say,
&quot;VIAGRA&quot; is easy to understand. If it generates a
false positive or false negative, it is fairly easy to
understand why.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With Bayesian analysis,
it&rsquo;s all probabilities - &quot;because the past says
it is likely as this falls into a probabilistic distribution
common to past spam in your systems&quot;. <br>
Tell that to your users! Tell that to the client when he
asks &quot;what can I do to change this&quot;. (By the way,
the answer in this case is &quot;use
whitelisting&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It will take disk space and
memory. <br>
The databases it maintains take quite a lot of resources to
store and use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GETTING STARTED <br>
Still interested? Ok, here&rsquo;s the guidelines for
getting this working.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First a high-level overview:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Build a significant sample of
both ham and spam. <br>
I suggest several thousand of each, placed in SPAM and HAM
directories or mailboxes. Yes, you MUST hand-sort this -
otherwise the results won&rsquo;t be much better than <br>
SpamAssassin on its own. Verify the spamminess/haminess of
EVERY message. You&rsquo;re urged to avoid using a publicly
available corpus (sample) - this must be taken from YOUR
<br>
mail server, if it is to be statistically useful. Otherwise,
the results may be pretty skewed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this tool to teach
SpamAssassin about these samples, like so: <br>
sa-learn --spam /path/to/spam/folder <br>
sa-learn --ham /path/to/ham/folder <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Let SpamAssassin proceed,
learning stuff. When it finds ham and spam it will add the
&quot;interesting tokens&quot; to the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need SpamAssassin to
forget about specific messages, use the --forget option.
<br>
This can be applied to either ham or spam that has run
through the sa-learn processes. It&rsquo;s a bit of a
hammer, really, lowering the weighting of the specific
tokens in that <br>
message (only if that message has been processed
before).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Learning from single messages
uses a command like this: <br>
sa-learn --ham --no-sync mailmessage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is handy for binding to a
key in your mail user agent. It&rsquo;s very fast, as all
the time-consuming stuff is deferred until you run with the
&quot;--sync&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Autolearning is enabled by
default <br>
If you don&rsquo;t have a corpus of mail saved to learn, you
can let SpamAssassin automatically learn the mail that you
receive. If you are autolearning from scratch, the amount
<br>
of mail you receive will determine how long until the
BAYES_* rules are activated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EFFECTIVE TRAINING <br>
Learning filters require training to be effective. If you
don&rsquo;t train them, they won&rsquo;t work. In addition,
you need to train them with new messages regularly to keep
them up-to- <br>
date, or their data will become stale and impact
accuracy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You need to train with both spam
and ham mails. One type of mail alone will not have any
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if your mail folders
contain things like forwarded spam, discussions of
spam-catching rules, etc., this will cause trouble. You
should avoid scanning those messages if <br>
possible. (An easy way to do this is to move them aside,
into a folder which is not scanned.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the messages you are learning
from have already been filtered through SpamAssassin, the
learner will compensate for this. In effect, it learns what
each message would look <br>
like if you had run &quot;spamassassin -d&quot; over it in
advance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another thing to be aware of, is
that typically you should aim to train with at least 1000
messages of spam, and 1000 ham messages, if possible. More
is better, but anything <br>
over about 5000 messages does not improve accuracy
significantly in our tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be careful that you train from
the same source -- for example, if you train on old spam,
but new ham mail, then the classifier will think that a mail
with an old date stamp is <br>
likely to be spam.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s also worth noting
that training with a very small quantity of ham, will
produce atrocious results. You should aim to train with at
least the same amount (or more if <br>
possible!) of ham data than spam.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On an on-going basis, it is best
to keep training the filter to make sure it has fresh data
to work from. There are various ways to do this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Supervised learning <br>
This means keeping a copy of all or most of your mail,
separated into spam and ham piles, and periodically
re-training using those. It produces the best results, but
<br>
requires more work from you, the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(An easy way to do this, by the
way, is to create a new folder for &rsquo;deleted&rsquo;
messages, and instead of deleting them from other folders,
simply move them in there instead. <br>
Then keep all spam in a separate folder and never delete it.
As long as you remember to move misclassified mails into the
correct folder set, it is easy enough to keep up to <br>
date.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Unsupervised learning from
Bayesian classification <br>
Another way to train is to chain the results of the Bayesian
classifier back into the training, so it reinforces its own
decisions. This is only safe if you then retrain it <br>
based on any errors you discover.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SpamAssassin does not support
this method, due to experimental results which strongly
indicate that it does not work well, and since Bayes is only
one part of the resulting <br>
score presented to the user (while Bayes may have made the
wrong decision about a mail, it may have been overridden by
another system).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Unsupervised learning from
SpamAssassin rules <br>
Also called &rsquo;auto-learning&rsquo; in SpamAssassin.
Based on statistical analysis of the SpamAssassin success
rates, we can automatically train the Bayesian database with
a certain <br>
degree of confidence that our training data is accurate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It should be supplemented with
some supervised training in addition, if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the default, but can be
turned off by setting the SpamAssassin configuration
parameter &quot;bayes_auto_learn&quot; to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Mistake-based training <br>
This means training on a small number of mails, then only
training on messages that SpamAssassin classifies
incorrectly. This works, but it takes longer to get it right
than <br>
a full training session would.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
sa-learn and the other parts of SpamAssassin&rsquo;s
Bayesian learner, use a set of persistent database files to
store the learnt tokens, as follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bayes_toks <br>
The database of tokens, containing the tokens learnt, their
count of occurrences in ham and spam, and the timestamp when
the token was last seen in a message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This database also contains some
&rsquo;magic&rsquo; tokens, as follows: the version number
of the database, the number of ham and spam messages learnt,
the number of tokens in the <br>
database, and timestamps of: the last journal sync, the last
expiry run, the last expiry token reduction count, the last
expiry timestamp delta, the oldest token timestamp in <br>
the database, and the newest token timestamp in the
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a database file, using
&quot;DB_File&quot;. The database &rsquo;version
number&rsquo; is 0 for databases from 2.5x, 1 for databases
from certain 2.6x development releases, 2 for 2.6x, and <br>
3 for 3.0 and later releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bayes_seen <br>
A map of Message-Id and some data from headers and body to
what that message was learnt as. This is used so that
SpamAssassin can avoid re-learning a message it has already
<br>
seen, and so it can reverse the training if you later decide
that message was learnt incorrectly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a database file, using
&quot;DB_File&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bayes_journal <br>
While SpamAssassin is scanning mails, it needs to track
which tokens it uses in its calculations. To avoid the
contention of having each SpamAssassin process attempting to
<br>
gain write access to the Bayes DB, the token timestamps are
written to a &rsquo;journal&rsquo; file which will later
(either automatically or via &quot;sa-learn --sync&quot;) be
used to <br>
synchronize the Bayes DB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, through the use of
&quot;bayes_learn_to_journal&quot;, or when using the
&quot;--no-sync&quot; option with sa-learn, the actual
learning data will take be placed into the journal for later
<br>
synchronization. This is typically useful for high-traffic
sites to avoid the same contention as stated above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXPIRATION <br>
Since SpamAssassin can auto-learn messages, the Bayes
database files could increase perpetually until they fill
your disk. To control this, SpamAssassin performs journal
<br>
synchronization and bayes expiration periodically when
certain criteria (listed below) are met.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SpamAssassin can sync the
journal and expire the DB tokens either manually or
opportunistically. A journal sync is due if --sync is passed
to sa-learn (manual), or if the <br>
following is true (opportunistic):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- bayes_journal_max_size does
not equal 0 (means don&rsquo;t sync) <br>
- the journal file exists</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and either:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the journal file has a size
greater than bayes_journal_max_size</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- a journal sync has previously
occurred, and at least 1 day has passed since that sync</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expiry is due if --force-expire
is passed to sa-learn (manual), or if all of the following
are true (opportunistic):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the last expire was attempted
at least 12hrs ago <br>
- bayes_auto_expire does not equal 0 <br>
- the number of tokens in the DB is &gt; 100,000 <br>
- the number of tokens in the DB is &gt;
bayes_expiry_max_db_size <br>
- there is at least a 12 hr difference between the oldest
and newest token atimes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXPIRE LOGIC <br>
If either the manual or opportunistic method causes an
expire run to start, here is the logic that is used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- figure out how many tokens to
keep. take the larger of either bayes_expiry_max_db_size *
75% or 100,000 tokens. therefore, the goal reduction is
number of tokens - number of <br>
tokens to keep. <br>
- if the reduction number is &lt; 1000 tokens, abort (not
worth the effort). <br>
- if an expire has been done before, guesstimate the new
atime delta based on the old atime delta. (new_atime_delta =
old_atime_delta * old_reduction_count / goal) <br>
- if no expire has been done before, or the last expire
looks &quot;weird&quot;, do an estimation pass. The
definition of &quot;weird&quot; is: <br>
- last expire over 30 days ago <br>
- last atime delta was &lt; 12 hrs <br>
- last reduction count was &lt; 1000 tokens <br>
- estimated new atime delta is &lt; 12 hrs <br>
- the difference between the last reduction count and the
goal reduction count is &gt; 50%</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESTIMATION PASS LOGIC <br>
Go through each of the DB&rsquo;s tokens. Starting at 12hrs,
calculate whether or not the token would be expired (based
on the difference between the token&rsquo;s atime and the
db&rsquo;s newest <br>
token atime) and keep the count. Work out from 12hrs
exponentially by powers of 2. ie: 12hrs * 1, 12hrs * 2,
12hrs * 4, 12hrs * 8, and so on, up to 12hrs * 512 (6144hrs,
or 256 <br>
days).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The larger the delta, the
smaller the number of tokens that will be expired.
Conversely, the number of tokens goes up as the delta gets
smaller. So starting at the largest <br>
atime delta, figure out which delta will expire the most
tokens without going above the goal expiration count. Use
this to choose the atime delta to use, unless one of the
<br>
following occurs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the largest atime (smallest
reduction count) would expire too many tokens. this means
the learned tokens are mostly old and there needs to be new
tokens learned before an <br>
expire can occur. <br>
- all of the atime choices result in 0 tokens being removed.
this means the tokens are all newer than 12 hours and there
needs to be new tokens learned before an expire can <br>
occur. <br>
- the number of tokens that would be removed is &lt; 1000.
the benefit isn&rsquo;t worth the effort. more tokens need
to be learned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the expire run gets past this
point, it will continue to the end. A new DB is created
since the majority of DB libraries don&rsquo;t shrink the DB
file when tokens are removed. So <br>
we do the &quot;create new, migrate old to new, remove old,
rename new&quot; shuffle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXPIRY RELATED CONFIGURATION
SETTINGS <br>
&quot;bayes_auto_expire&quot; is used to specify whether or
not SpamAssassin ought to opportunistically attempt to
expire the Bayes database. The default is 1 (yes). <br>
&quot;bayes_expiry_max_db_size&quot; specifies both the
auto-expire token count point, as well as the resulting
number of tokens after expiry as described above. The
default value is <br>
150,000, which is roughly equivalent to a 6Mb database file
if you&rsquo;re using DB_File. <br>
&quot;bayes_journal_max_size&quot; specifies how large the
Bayes journal will grow before it is opportunistically
synced. The default value is 102400.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
The sa-learn command is part of the Mail::SpamAssassin Perl
module. Install this as a normal Perl module, using
&quot;perl -MCPAN -e shell&quot;, or by hand.</p>
