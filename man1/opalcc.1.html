<p>opalcc(1) Open MPI opalcc(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
opalcc -- Open PAL C wrapper compiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX <br>
opalcc [-showme|-showme:compile|-showme:link] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--showme <br>
This option comes in several different variants (see below).
None of the variants invokes the underlying compiler; they
all provide information on how the underlying com&acirc;
<br>
piler would have been invoked had --showme not been used.
The basic --showme option outputs the command line that
would be executed to compile the program. NOTE: If a <br>
non-filename argument is passed on the command line, the
-showme option will not display any additional flags. For
example, both &quot;opalcc --showme&quot; and &quot;opalcc
--showme <br>
my_source.c&quot; will show all the wrapper-supplied flags.
But &quot;opalcc --showme -v&quot; will only show the
underlying compiler name and &quot;-v&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--showme:compile <br>
Output the compiler flags that would have been supplied to
the C compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--showme:link <br>
Output the linker flags that would have been supplied to the
C compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--showme:command <br>
Outputs the underlying C compiler command (which may be one
or more tokens).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--showme:incdirs <br>
Outputs a space-delimited (but otherwise undecorated) list
of directories that the wrapper compiler would have provided
to the underlying C compiler to indicate where rel&acirc;
<br>
evant header files are located.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--showme:libdirs <br>
Outputs a space-delimited (but otherwise undecorated) list
of directories that the wrapper compiler would have provided
to the underlying linker to indicate where relevant <br>
libraries are located.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--showme:libs <br>
Outputs a space-delimited (but otherwise undecorated) list
of library names that the wrapper compiler would have used
to link an application. For example: &quot;mpi open-rte <br>
open-pal util&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--showme:version <br>
Outputs the version number of Open MPI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--showme:help <br>
Output a brief usage help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the man page for your
underlying C compiler for other options that can be passed
through opalcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Conceptually, the role of these commands is quite simple:
transparently add relevant compiler and linker flags to the
user&rsquo;s command line that are necessary to compile /
link <br>
Open PAL programs, and then invoke the underlying compiler
to actually perform the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As such, these commands are
frequently referred to as &quot;wrapper&quot; compilers
because they do not actually compile or link applications
themselves; they only add in command line <br>
flags and invoke the back-end compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Background <br>
Open MPI is comprised of three software layers: OPAL (Open
Portable Access Layer), ORTE (Open Run-Time Environment),
and OMPI (Open MPI). There are wrapper compilers for each
<br>
layer; each layer&rsquo;s wrapper only links in the
libraries relevant for that layer. Specifically, each layer
provides the following wrapper compilers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPAL <br>
opalcc and opalc++</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ORTE <br>
ortecc and ortec++</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OMPI <br>
mpicc, mpic++, mpicxx, mpiCC (only on systems with
case-senstive file systems), and mpifort (and its
legacy/deprecated names mpif77 and mpif90). Note that
mpic++, mpicxx, <br>
and mpiCC all invoke the same underlying C++ compiler with
the same options. All are provided as compatibility with
other MPI implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fortran Notes <br>
The Fortran wrapper compiler for MPI (mpifort, and its
legacy/deprecated names mpif77 and mpif90) can compile and
link MPI applications that use any/all of the MPI Fortran
bind&acirc; <br>
ings: mpif.h, the mpi module, and the mpi_f08 module
(assuming Open MPI was installed with support for each of
these Fortran bindings). Specifically: it is no longer
necessary <br>
to use different wrapper compilers for applications that use
mpif.h vs. applications that use the mpi module -- just use
mpifort for all Fortran MPI applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, however, that the Fortran
compiler may require additional command-line options to
enforce a specific Fortran dialect. For example, in some
versions of the IBM XLF com&acirc; <br>
piler, if xlf90 is the underlying Fortran compiler, -qfixed
may be necessary to compile fixed-format Fortran source
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, note that mpifort will
be inoperative and will return an error on use if Fortran
support was not built into the MP Ilayer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overview <br>
opalcc is a convenience wrappers for the underlying C
compiler. Translation of an Open PAL program requires the
linkage of the Open PAL-specific libraries which may not
reside <br>
in one of the standard search directories of ld(1). It also
often requires the inclusion of header files what may also
not be found in a standard location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opalcc passes its arguments to
the underlying C compiler along with the -I, -L and -l
options required by Open PAL programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Open PAL Team strongly
encourages using the wrapper compilers instead of attempting
to link to the Open PAL libraries manually. This allows the
specific implementation of <br>
Open PAL to change without forcing changes to linker
directives in users&rsquo; Makefiles. Indeed, the specific
set of flags and libraries used by the wrapper compilers
depends on how <br>
Open PAL was configured and built; the values can change
between different installations of the same version of Open
PAL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Indeed, since the wrappers are
simply thin shells on top of an underlying compiler, there
are very, very few compelling reasons not to use opalcc.
When it is not possible to use <br>
the wrappers directly, the -showme:compile and -showme:link
options should be used to determine what flags the wrappers
would have used. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell$ cc -c file1.c
&lsquo;mpicc -showme:compile&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell$ cc -c file2.c
&lsquo;mpicc -showme:compile&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell$ cc file1.o file2.o
&lsquo;mpicc -showme:link&lsquo; -o my_mpi_program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
It is possible to make the wrapper compilers multi-lib
aware. That is, the libraries and includes specified may
differ based on the compiler flags specified (for example,
with <br>
the GNU compilers on Linux, a different library path may be
used if -m32 is seen versus -m64 being seen). This is not
the default behavior in a standard build, but can be
acti&acirc; <br>
vated (for example, in a binary package providing both 32
and 64 bit support). More information can be found at:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/wiki/compilerwrapper3264</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
The string that the wrapper compilers insert into the
command line before invoking the underlying compiler are
stored in a text file created by Open PAL and installed to
$pkg&acirc; <br>
data/opalcc-wrapper-data.txt, where $pkgdata is typically
$prefix/share/openmpi, and $prefix is the top installation
directory of Open PAL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is rarely necessary to edit
this file, but it can be examined to gain insight into what
flags the wrappers are placing on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
By default, the wrappers use the compilers that were
selected when Open PAL was configured. These compilers were
either found automatically by Open MPI&rsquo;s
&quot;configure&quot; script, or <br>
were selected by the user in the CC, CXX, F77, and/or FC
environment variables before &quot;configure&quot; was
invoked. Additionally, other arguments specific to the
compiler may have <br>
been selected by configure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These values can be selectively
overridden by either editing the text files containing this
configuration information (see the FILES section), or by
setting selected environment <br>
variables of the form &quot;OPAL_value&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Valid value names are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPPFLAGS <br>
Flags added when invoking the preprocessor (C or C++)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LDFLAGS <br>
Flags added when invoking the linker (C, C++, or
Fortran)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIBS Libraries added when
invoking the linker (C, C++, or Fortran)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CC C compiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CFLAGS C compiler flags</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CXX C++ compiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CXXFLAGS <br>
C++ compiler flags</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FC Fortran compiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FCFLAGS <br>
Fortran compiler flags</p>
