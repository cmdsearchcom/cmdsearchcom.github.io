authbind - bind sockets to privileged ports without root
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>authbind</b> [<i>options</i>] <i>program</i> [<i>argument</i> ...]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>authbind</b> allows a program which does not or should not run as root to
  bind to low-numbered ports in a controlled way.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You must invoke the program using <b>authbind</b>. <b>authbind</b> will set up
  some environment variables, including an <b>LD_PRELOAD</b>, which will allow
  the program (including any subprocesses it may run) to bind to low-numbered
  (&lt;512) ports if the system is configured to allow this.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--deep</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Normally, <b>authbind</b> arranges for only the program
      which it directly invokes to be affected by its special version of
      <b>bind</b>(2). If you specify <b>--deep</b> then all programs which that
      program invokes directly or indirectly will be affected, so long as they
      do not unset the environment variables set up by <b>authbind</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--depth</b><i> levels</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Causes <b>authbind</b> to affect programs which are
      <i>levels</i> deep in the calling graph. The default is <b>--depth
    1</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ACCESS_CONTROL"><a class="selflink" href="#ACCESS_CONTROL">ACCESS
  CONTROL</a></h1>
Access to low numbered ports is controlled by permissions and contents of files
  in a configuration area, <b>/etc/authbind</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Firstly, <b>/etc/authbind/byport/</b><i>port</i> is tested. If this file is
  accessible for execution to the calling user, according to <b>access</b>(2),
  then binding to the port is authorised. If the file can be seen not to exist
  (the existence check returns <b>ENOENT</b>) then further tests will be used to
  find authorisation; otherwise, binding is not authorised, and the <b>bind</b>
  call will return with the <b>errno</b> value from the <b>access</b>(2) call,
  usually <b>EACCES</b> (<i>Permission denied</i>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Secondly, if that test fails to resolve the matter,
  <b>/etc/authbind/byaddr/</b><i>addr</i><b>,</b><i>port</i> (any protocol) or
  failing that <b>/etc/authbind/byaddr/</b><i>addr</i><b>:</b><i>port</i> (IPv4
  only) is tested, in the same manner as above. Here <i>addr</i> is as from
  <b>inet_ntop</b>, and <i>port</i> is the (local) TCP or UDP port number,
  expressed as an unsigned integer in the minimal non-zero number of digits.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Thirdly, for IPv6 only: since the textual representation from <b>inet_ntop</b>
  is complicated to predict, a variant of <i>addr</i> is also tested which does
  not use the double colon abbreviation: each 16-byte chunk expressed in the
  minimal nonzero number of hex digits (i.e. with leading zeroes removed), the
  chunks being separated by colons as is conventional.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Fourthly, if the question is still unresolved, the file
  <b>/etc/authbind/byuid/</b><i>uid</i> will be opened and read. If the file
  does not exist then the binding is not authorised and <b>bind</b> will return
  <b>EPERM</b> (<i>Operation not permitted</i>, or <i>Not owner</i>). If the
  file does exist it will be searched for a line of the form
<pre>
<i>	addrmin</i>[<b>-</b><i>addrmax</i>]<b>,</b><i>portmin</i>[<b>-</b><i>portmax</i>]
<i>	addr</i>[<b>/</b><i>length</i>]<b>,</b><i>portmin</i>[<b>-</b><i>portmax</i>]
<i>	addr4</i><b>/</b><i>length</i><b>:</b><i>portmin</i><b>,</b><i>portmax</i>
</pre>
matching the request. The first form requires that the address lies in the
  relevant range (inclusive at both ends). The second and third forms require
  that the initial <i>length</i> bits of <i>addr</i> match those in the proposed
  <b>bind</b> call. The third form is only available for IPv4 since IPv6
  addresses contain colons. Addresses in the byuid file can be in any form
  acceptable to inet_pton. In all cases the proposed port number must lie is in
  the inclusive range specified. If such a line is found then the binding is
  authorised. Otherwise it is not, and <b>bind</b> will fail with <b>ENOENT</b>
  (<i>No such file or directory</i>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a read error occurs, or the directory <b>/etc/authbind</b> cannot be
  accessed, then not only will <b>bind</b> fail, but an error message will be
  printed to stderr. Unrecognised lines in <b>/etc/authbind/byuid/</b><i>uid</i>
  files are silently ignored, as are lines whose <i>addr</i> has non-zero bits
  more than <i>length</i> from the top or where some <i>min</i> is larger than
  <i>max</i>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLE"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLE">EXAMPLE</a></h1>
So for example an attempt by uid 432 to bind to port 80 of address
  [2620:106:e002:f00f::21] would result in authbind calling <i>access(2)</i> on,
  in order,
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"><b>/etc/authbind/byport/80</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>/etc/authbind/byaddr/2620:106:e002:f00f::21,80</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>/etc/authbind/byaddr/2620:106:e002:f00f:0:0:0:21,80</b></div>
If none of these files exist, authbind will read
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"><b>/etc/authbind/byuid/432</b></div>
and search for a line to permit the relevant access; examples of lines which
  would do so are:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"><b>2620:106:e002:f00f::21,80</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>::/0,80</b></div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PORTS_512-1023"><a class="selflink" href="#PORTS_512-1023">PORTS
  512-1023</a></h1>
Authorising binding to ports from 512 to 1023 inclusive is not recommended. Some
  protocols (including some versions of NFS) authorise clients by seeing that
  they are using a port number in this range. So by authorising a program to be
  a server for such a port, you are also authorising it to impersonate the whole
  host for those protocols.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To make sure that this isn't done by accident, if the port number requested is
  in the range 512-1023, authbind will expect the permission files to have an
  additional <b>!</b> at the start of their leafname.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MECHANISM"><a class="selflink" href="#MECHANISM">MECHANISM</a></h1>
The shared library loaded using <b>LD_PRELOAD</b> overrides the <b>bind</b>(2)
  system call. When a program invoked via <b>authbind</b> calls <b>bind</b> to
  bind a socket to a low-numbered TCP/IP port, and if the program doesn't
  already have an effective uid of 0, the version of <b>bind</b> supposed by
  <b>authbind</b> forks and executes a setuid-root helper program. For
  non-TCP/IP sockets, high-numbered ports, or programs which are already root,
  <b>authbind</b> passes the call to the original <b>bind</b>(2) system call,
  which is found using <b>dlsym</b>(3) with the handle <b>RTLD_NEXT</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ERROR_HANDLING"><a class="selflink" href="#ERROR_HANDLING">ERROR
  HANDLING</a></h1>
Usually the normal C error handling mechanisms apply. If <b>authbind</b> cannot
  find the program it has been asked to execute it will print a message to
  stderr and exit with code 255.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The helper program usually reports back to the shared library with an exit
  status containing an <b>errno</b> value which encodes whether the <b>bind</b>
  was permitted and successful. This will be returned to the calling program in
  the usual way.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the case of apparent configuration or other serious errors the library and/or
  the helper program may cause messages to be printed to the program's stderr,
  was well as returning -1 from <b>bind</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
<b>authbind</b> currently only supports IPv4 and IPv6 sockets. Programs which
  open other kinds of sockets will not benefit from <b>authbind</b>, but it
  won't get in their way.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The use of <b>LD_PRELOAD</b> makes an <b>authbind</b> installation specific to a
  particular C library. This version is for GNU/Linux libc6 (glibc2).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>authbind</b> may not operate correctly with multithreaded programs. It is
  inherently very difficult (if not impossible) to perform the kind of trickery
  that authbind does while preventing all undesirable interactions between
  authbind's activities and those of (say) a threading runtime system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is quite possible that <b>authbind</b> and other programs and facilities
  which use <b>LD_PRELOAD</b> may interfere with each other, causing
  unpredictable behaviour or even core dumps. <b>authbind</b> is known sometimes
  not to work correctly with <b>fakeroot</b>, for example (even supposing it
  could be determined what `correctly' means in this context).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>authbind</b> is ineffective with setuid programs, because they do not honour
  <b>LD_PRELOAD</b> references outside the system directories, for security
  reasons. (In fact, setuid programs should not honour <b>LD_PRELOAD</b> at
  all.) Of course a setuid-root program does not need <b>authbind</b>, but it
  might be useful to apply it to program which are setuid to another user or
  setgid. If the author or builder of such a programs wishes it to use authbind
  they could have it load the <b>libauthbind</b> library explicitly rather than
  via <b>LD_PRELOAD</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some programs may have trouble because <b>authbind</b> spawns a child process
  `under their feet', causing (for example) a <b>fork</b>(2) to happen and
  <b>SIGCHLD</b> signal to be delivered. Unfortunately the Unix API does not
  make it possible to deal with this problem in a sane way.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The access control configuration scheme is somewhat strange.
