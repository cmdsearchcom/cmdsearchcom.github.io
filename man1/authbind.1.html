<p>AUTHBIND(1) Debian Linux manual AUTHBIND(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
authbind - bind sockets to privileged ports without root</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
authbind [options] program [argument ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
authbind allows a program which does not or should not run
as root to bind to low-numbered ports in a controlled
way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You must invoke the program
using authbind. authbind will set up some environment
variables, including an LD_PRELOAD, which will allow the
program (including any subprocesses it <br>
may run) to bind to low-numbered (&lt;512) ports if the
system is configured to allow this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--deep Normally, authbind arranges for only the program
which it directly invokes to be affected by its special
version of bind(2). If you specify --deep then all programs
which <br>
that program invokes directly or indirectly will be
affected, so long as they do not unset the environment
variables set up by authbind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--depth levels <br>
Causes authbind to affect programs which are levels deep in
the calling graph. The default is --depth 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACCESS CONTROL <br>
Access to low numbered ports is controlled by permissions
and contents of files in a configuration area,
/etc/authbind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Firstly,
/etc/authbind/byport/port is tested. If this file is
accessible for execution to the calling user, according to
access(2), then binding to the port is authorised. If <br>
the file can be seen not to exist (the existence check
returns ENOENT) then further tests will be used to find
authorisation; otherwise, binding is not authorised, and the
bind <br>
call will return with the errno value from the access(2)
call, usually EACCES (Permission denied).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Secondly, if that test fails to
resolve the matter, /etc/authbind/byaddr/addr,port (any
protocol) or failing that /etc/authbind/byaddr/addr:port
(IPv4 only) is tested, in the <br>
same manner as above. Here addr is as from inet_ntop, and
port is the (local) TCP or UDP port number, expressed as an
unsigned integer in the minimal non-zero number of
digits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thirdly, for IPv6 only: since
the textual representation from inet_ntop is complicated to
predict, a variant of addr is also tested which does not use
the double colon abbrevia&acirc; <br>
tion: each 16-byte chunk expressed in the minimal nonzero
number of hex digits (i.e. with leading zeroes removed), the
chunks being separated by colons as is conventional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fourthly, if the question is
still unresolved, the file /etc/authbind/byuid/uid will be
opened and read. If the file does not exist then the binding
is not authorised and bind <br>
will return EPERM (Operation not permitted, or Not owner).
If the file does exist it will be searched for a line of the
form <br>
addrmin[-addrmax],portmin[-portmax] <br>
addr[/length],portmin[-portmax] <br>
addr4/length:portmin,portmax <br>
matching the request. The first form requires that the
address lies in the relevant range (inclusive at both ends).
The second and third forms require that the initial length
<br>
bits of addr match those in the proposed bind call. The
third form is only available for IPv4 since IPv6 addresses
contain colons. Addresses in the byuid file can be in any
<br>
form acceptable to inet_pton. In all cases the proposed port
number must lie is in the inclusive range specified. If such
a line is found then the binding is authorised. Oth&acirc;
<br>
erwise it is not, and bind will fail with ENOENT (No such
file or directory).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a read error occurs, or the
directory /etc/authbind cannot be accessed, then not only
will bind fail, but an error message will be printed to
stderr. Unrecognised lines in <br>
/etc/authbind/byuid/uid files are silently ignored, as are
lines whose addr has non-zero bits more than length from the
top or where some min is larger than max.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
So for example an attempt by uid 432 to bind to port 80 of
address [2620:106:e002:f00f::21] would result in authbind
calling access(2) on, in order, <br>
/etc/authbind/byport/80 <br>
/etc/authbind/byaddr/2620:106:e002:f00f::21,80 <br>
/etc/authbind/byaddr/2620:106:e002:f00f:0:0:0:21,80 <br>
If none of these files exist, authbind will read <br>
/etc/authbind/byuid/432 <br>
and search for a line to permit the relevant access;
examples of lines which would do so are: <br>
2620:106:e002:f00f::21,80 <br>
::/0,80</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PORTS 512-1023 <br>
Authorising binding to ports from 512 to 1023 inclusive is
not recommended. Some protocols (including some versions of
NFS) authorise clients by seeing that they are using a <br>
port number in this range. So by authorising a program to be
a server for such a port, you are also authorising it to
impersonate the whole host for those protocols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make sure that this
isn&rsquo;t done by accident, if the port number requested
is in the range 512-1023, authbind will expect the
permission files to have an additional ! at the <br>
start of their leafname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MECHANISM <br>
The shared library loaded using LD_PRELOAD overrides the
bind(2) system call. When a program invoked via authbind
calls bind to bind a socket to a low-numbered TCP/IP port,
and <br>
if the program doesn&rsquo;t already have an effective uid
of 0, the version of bind supposed by authbind forks and
executes a setuid-root helper program. For non-TCP/IP
sockets, <br>
high-numbered ports, or programs which are already root,
authbind passes the call to the original bind(2) system
call, which is found using dlsym(3) with the handle
RTLD_NEXT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERROR HANDLING <br>
Usually the normal C error handling mechanisms apply. If
authbind cannot find the program it has been asked to
execute it will print a message to stderr and exit with code
255.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The helper program usually
reports back to the shared library with an exit status
containing an errno value which encodes whether the bind was
permitted and successful. This <br>
will be returned to the calling program in the usual
way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the case of apparent
configuration or other serious errors the library and/or the
helper program may cause messages to be printed to the
program&rsquo;s stderr, was well as return&acirc; <br>
ing -1 from bind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
authbind currently only supports IPv4 and IPv6 sockets.
Programs which open other kinds of sockets will not benefit
from authbind, but it won&rsquo;t get in their way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of LD_PRELOAD makes an
authbind installation specific to a particular C library.
This version is for GNU/Linux libc6 (glibc2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">authbind may not operate
correctly with multithreaded programs. It is inherently very
difficult (if not impossible) to perform the kind of
trickery that authbind does while pre&acirc; <br>
venting all undesirable interactions between
authbind&rsquo;s activities and those of (say) a threading
runtime system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is quite possible that
authbind and other programs and facilities which use
LD_PRELOAD may interfere with each other, causing
unpredictable behaviour or even core dumps. <br>
authbind is known sometimes not to work correctly with
fakeroot, for example (even supposing it could be determined
what &lsquo;correctly&rsquo; means in this context).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">authbind is ineffective with
setuid programs, because they do not honour LD_PRELOAD
references outside the system directories, for security
reasons. (In fact, setuid programs <br>
should not honour LD_PRELOAD at all.) Of course a
setuid-root program does not need authbind, but it might be
useful to apply it to program which are setuid to another
user or <br>
setgid. If the author or builder of such a programs wishes
it to use authbind they could have it load the libauthbind
library explicitly rather than via LD_PRELOAD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some programs may have trouble
because authbind spawns a child process &lsquo;under their
feet&rsquo;, causing (for example) a fork(2) to happen and
SIGCHLD signal to be delivered. Unfortu&acirc; <br>
nately the Unix API does not make it possible to deal with
this problem in a sane way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The access control configuration
scheme is somewhat strange.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES AND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
<br>
/usr/lib/authbind/libauthbind.so.1.0 <br>
The shared library which authbind causes to be loaded using
LD_PRELOAD, and which actually implements the diversion of
bind(2) to an external program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_PRELOAD <br>
The variable used by the dynamic linker when starting
dynamically linked programs and deciding which shared
libraries to load and modifed by the authbind program to
allow <br>
it to override the usual meaning of bind(2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHBIND_LIB <br>
If set, forces authbind to use its value as the path to the
shared library to put in LD_PRELOAD, instead of the
compiled-in value. In any case, unless --deep was
speci&acirc; <br>
fied, authbind will set this variable to the name of the
library actually added to LD_PRELOAD, so that the library
can find and remove the right entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHBIND_LEVELS <br>
This variable is set by authbind to the number of levels
left from the --depth or --deep option, minus one. It is
decremented during _init by the library on each program <br>
call, and the library will remove itself from the LD_PRELOAD
when it reaches zero. The special value y means --deep was
specified.</p>
