<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xzgv - picture viewer for X, with thumbnail-based file
selector</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xzgv [options] [dir | file ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
(NB: This man page is automagically generated from
xzgv&rsquo;s texinfo file, and so may look a bit odd. We
apologise for the inconvenience. :-))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xzgv is a picture viewer for X,
with a thumbnail-based file selector. The thumbnails used
(thumbnails being small &lsquo;preview&rsquo; versions of
the pictures) are compatible with xv, <br>
zgv, and the Gimp. The kinds of pictures xzgv allows to be
viewed are raster-format pictures (sometimes called
&lsquo;bitmaps&rsquo; and/or &lsquo;pixmaps&rsquo;); things
like GIF files, JPEG files, PNG <br>
files, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of the time, you will
probably want to use xzgv&rsquo;s file selector (see The
File Selector) to pick which file(s) to view. This is what
appears on the left-hand side of the win&acirc; <br>
dow when you start xzgv as just &lsquo;xzgv&rsquo; (see
Options). It displays a list of subdirectories and picture
files in the current directory, along with small
&lsquo;thumbnail&rsquo; versions of <br>
the pictures if they exist. (If no thumbnails appear in a
given directory, or if they are missing for some files, you
can create/update them by pressing &lsquo;u&rsquo;. See
Updating Thumb&acirc; <br>
nails.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you&rsquo;ve picked a file
to view, you can view it by clicking on it, or pressing
&lsquo;Enter&rsquo;. This reads the picture and displays it
in the right-hand part of the window, the viewer <br>
(see The Viewer). You can then move around the picture (if
it is larger than will fit) by dragging it with the mouse,
or using the scrollbars, or the cursor keys. You can then
<br>
select another image with the file selector (though you need
to press &lsquo;Esc&rsquo; or &lsquo;Tab&rsquo; first if
using the keyboard), or you can quit xzgv by pressing
&lsquo;q&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While xzgv works much like any
other X program, and is certainly mouse-friendly :-),
it&rsquo;s also designed to be keyboard-friendly. Everything
in xzgv can be done entirely from the <br>
keyboard. Much of this keyboard support works like the
original zgv (a similar console-based picture viewer for
Linux).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This overview is, as you might
expect, only the very simplest of introductions to what xzgv
can do, and describes only a very basic use of xzgv. xzgv
can do a lot more; read on <br>
to find out what.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS <br>
xzgv was primarily written by Russell Marks, also the author
of this manual. It is maintained by Reuben Thomas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Costa Sapuntzakis contributed
code for much faster JPEG thumbnail generation (to zgv,
which I adapted for xzgv).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directory/file icons used
were loosely based on gmc&rsquo;s dir-close.xpm. I think
Tuomas Kuosmanen was responsible for that, judging from the
change log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;mkinstalldirs&rsquo; is
straight from the &lsquo;texinfo&rsquo; package, and was
written by Noah Friedman. (This is also used during
installation.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Huge thanks go to the many
people responsible for GTK+, without which xzgv would almost
certainly not have happened. (But no thanks for Electric
Eyes, which was nearly nice <br>
enough for me not to bother with xzgv at all! :-))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getopt*.[ch] are from the GNU
libc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Normally you&rsquo;d invoke xzgv as plain &lsquo;xzgv&rsquo;
(perhaps via a window manager menu, or GNOME/KDE menu,
etc.). However, you can directly specify files to view, or a
start directory, on <br>
the command-line. In addition, there are various
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(If you&rsquo;re new to xzgv,
you should probably skip the rest of this section for now
and come back to it later.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The general format of the xzgv
command-line goes roughly like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xzgv [options] [dir | file
...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two types of options are
supported --- the traditional Unix single-letter options,
and GNU-style long options. Most options can be used in
either way, and both forms are listed <br>
in the table below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that all options are
processed after any configuration file(s). Config file
settings are just like the long-option names below minus the
&lsquo;--&rsquo; (see Configuring xzgv), though <br>
a few command-line options are not permitted as config file
settings (e.g. &lsquo;help&rsquo;), and vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s what the options
do:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;-a&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;--auto-hide&rsquo; <br>
Automatically hide selector when a picture is selected,
allowing the viewer to use the whole window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;--careful-jpeg&rsquo;
<br>
Enable libjpeg &lsquo;fancy upsampling&rsquo;. xzgv defaults
to using the faster method; as the libjpeg documentation
puts it, &lsquo;&lsquo;The visual impact of the sloppier
method is often very <br>
small.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;--delete-single-prompt&rsquo;
<br>
(Note that this is normally enabled; use
&lsquo;--delete-single-prompt=off&rsquo; to disable it.) If
disabled, xzgv will immediately delete a file when told to,
without prompting for <br>
confirmation. (It&rsquo;s &lsquo;single&rsquo; because
deleting multiple files at once will be supported in future,
and that will have a separate prompt override.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;--dither-hicol&rsquo;
<br>
Use dithering in 15/16-bit, whatever the default setting is.
See Viewer Options, for a discussion of benefits/drawbacks.
You can also use &lsquo;--dither-hicol=off&rsquo; to disable
<br>
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;--exif-orient&rsquo; <br>
In JPEG files, use Exif orientation tags (inserted by e.g.
digital cameras) to correct image orientation before
display. See Viewer Options, for details.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;--fast-recursive-update&rsquo;
<br>
When doing a recursive thumbnail update, don&rsquo;t read
existing thumbnails before updating. This is pretty much
obsolete as of xzgv 0.7, as the speed increase is now
negligi&acirc; <br>
ble. But, it may still be useful if you want to update a
huge number of small directories for which few if any
updates are needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;-f&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;--fullscreen&rsquo; <br>
Run fullscreen, using the entire screen for xzgv&rsquo;s
window, without even any window-manager decorations (window
frame, title bar, etc.) if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;-G val&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;--gamma val&rsquo; <br>
[Not supported in 0.9.] Set the gamma adjustment used (see
Gamma Adjustment). The default is 1.0. This also sets the
&lsquo;initial value&rsquo; used when resetting the gamma
adjust&acirc; <br>
ment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;-g geom&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;--geometry geom&rsquo; <br>
Set the xzgv window&rsquo;s geometry (position and/or size)
to geom. The geometry string should be in the usual X
format, with the extension that positions/sizes may have a
&lsquo;%&rsquo; <br>
suffix meaning that they are treated as percentages of the
screen width/height. The default geometry is
&lsquo;92%x85%&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For those unfamiliar with the
way &lsquo;geometry&rsquo; works, here&rsquo;s a brief
description of the syntax. It&rsquo;s &lsquo;WxH&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;+X+Y&rsquo;, or &lsquo;WxH+X+Y&rsquo;, where
&lsquo;W&rsquo; is width, &lsquo;H&rsquo; height,
&lsquo;X&rsquo; the <br>
x position, and &lsquo;Y&rsquo; the y position. The first
form specifies only the size, the second only the position
--- the &lsquo;WxH+X+Y&rsquo; form specifies both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, the &lsquo;+X+Y&rsquo; bit
normally specifies where the top-left of the window is. But
you can use &lsquo;-&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;+&rsquo; for
the x and/or y position, in which case it specifies the <br>
gap between the right/bottom of the window and the
right/bottom of the screen. (Note, however, that any window
frame your window manager adds to the window is disregarded
<br>
in this calculation, so you may need to experiment somewhat
to get the desired position.) You can also use negative
numbers with both &lsquo;+&rsquo; and &lsquo;-&rsquo; --- so
&lsquo;+-50+0&rsquo; puts the <br>
window partly off the left of the screen, and
&lsquo;+0--50&rsquo; puts it partly off the bottom of the
screen --- but this is of questionable value. :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, as mentioned above,
xzgv extends this syntax by allowing you to use
&lsquo;%&rsquo; to specify percentages of the screen
width/height rather than pixels, e.g. <br>
&lsquo;50%x30%-30%-20%&rsquo;. It also allows you to use
real numbers such as &lsquo;12.34&rsquo;, which can be
useful with &lsquo;%&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;-h&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;--help&rsquo; <br>
Display a list of options and a terse description of what
the options do.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;--image-bigness-threshold
numpix&rsquo; <br>
Set the boundary numpix after which images are considered
&lsquo;big&rsquo;, and are no longer rendered all-at-once
(which gives much nicer scrolling, but is harder on memory
and can <br>
be slow for big images) but are instead rendered
piece-by-piece. Units are number of pixels in image (i.e.
width times height), and the default is 2000000 pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;--interpolate&rsquo; <br>
Interpolate between the picture&rsquo;s pixels when scaling
up (see Scaling). This usually looks nicer, but it&rsquo;s
rather slow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;--mouse-scale-x&rsquo;
<br>
If enabled, control-clicking on the viewer scales only the X
axis. (The default is to scale only the Y axis.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;--revert-orient&rsquo;
<br>
(Note that this is normally enabled; use
&lsquo;--revert-orient=off&rsquo; to disable it.) If
disabled, orientation (flip/mirror/rotate) state is retained
between pictures (see Viewer <br>
Options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;--revert-scale&rsquo;
<br>
(Note that this is normally enabled; use
&lsquo;--revert-scale=off&rsquo; to disable it.) If
disabled, scaling is retained between pictures (see Viewer
Options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;--selector-width&rsquo;
<br>
Set the default/initial size of the selector in pixels. The
normal setting is 200.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;-T&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;--show-tagged&rsquo; <br>
Show names of currently-tagged files on exiting xzgv.
(They&rsquo;re listed to stdout, one per line.) This can be
useful when you want to select multiple files graphically
and <br>
work on them with something else.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;--show-thumbnail-messages&rsquo;
<br>
Show on the status bar when thumbnails are being read. The
status bar must be enabled for these messages to be visible,
of course. :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;-k&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;--skip-parent&rsquo; <br>
For the first directory shown, skip the cursor past .. (the
parent dir). This can be useful when you&rsquo;d like to
immediately use space to &lsquo;page&rsquo; through the
dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;-o order&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;--sort-order order&rsquo; <br>
Set the initial sorting order used in the selector. Possible
settings are &lsquo;name&rsquo;, &lsquo;ext&rsquo;,
&lsquo;size&rsquo;, and &lsquo;date&rsquo; (or
&lsquo;time&rsquo;); only the first char of the setting <br>

(&lsquo;n&rsquo;/&lsquo;e&rsquo;/&lsquo;s&rsquo;/&lsquo;d&rsquo;/&lsquo;t&rsquo;)
need be given. The default is name order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;--sort-timestamp-type
type&rsquo; <br>
Set the timestamp type to use when using time/date sorting
order. Possible settings are &lsquo;mtime&rsquo; (default),
&lsquo;ctime&rsquo;, and &lsquo;atime&rsquo;; only the first
char of the setting <br>
(&lsquo;m&rsquo;/&lsquo;c&rsquo;/&lsquo;a&rsquo;) need be
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;--statusbar&rsquo; <br>
Show a status bar below the selector; this, for example,
says when a picture is being read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;-t&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;--thin-rows&rsquo; <br>
Use rows a third the normal height in the selector. This can
be very useful on lower-resolution screens, or if
you&rsquo;re really interested in filenames, not
thumbnails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;-v&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;--version&rsquo; <br>
Show version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;--version-gtk&rsquo; <br>
Show version number of GTK+ xzgv is using.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;-z&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;--zoom&rsquo; <br>
Fit picture to viewer window, whatever its actual size (see
Zoom Mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;-r&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;--zoom-reduce-only&rsquo; <br>
When in zoom mode, only reduce pictures to fit; i.e. make
big pictures viewable all-at-once while leaving small
picures intact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If started with &lsquo;xzgv
files&rsquo;, xzgv hides the file selector and treats the
file or files as if they were the sole contents of a
directory. (It also automatically loads the first <br>
file.) As such, you can use the Next Image and Previous
Image commands to navigate between the images, or do Exit to
Selector and use the selector directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If started with &lsquo;xzgv
start-dir&rsquo;, xzgv starts up as usual, but with the
selector starting on the directory specified (rather than
the current directory).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Settings which are either on or
off (boolean) are, as you might expect, enabled by using
e.g. &lsquo;-z&rsquo; or &lsquo;--zoom&rsquo;. However,
there&rsquo;s an alternative long-option form for setting
<br>
these, resembling how they&rsquo;re set in config files ---
the syntax is &lsquo;--option=state&rsquo;, where state is
&lsquo;on&rsquo;/&lsquo;y&rsquo;/&lsquo;yes&rsquo;/&lsquo;1&rsquo;
to enable the option, or
&lsquo;off&rsquo;/&lsquo;n&rsquo;/&lsquo;no&rsquo;/&lsquo;0&rsquo;
to disable it. <br>
The most useful thing about this is that it allows you to
disable options which were previously enabled, by using e.g.
&lsquo;--zoom=off&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Readers used to the way
GNU-style long options work should note that, since this
&lsquo;on&rsquo;/&lsquo;off&rsquo;/etc. arg is optional, you
can&rsquo;t use the &lsquo;--option arg&rsquo; form in this
case; it must be <br>
&lsquo;--option=arg&rsquo; for it to work.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A NOTE ON NOTATION <br>
Much of this manual is taken up by a description of
xzgv&rsquo;s various commands in its file selector and
viewer. Most of these are available both from the keyboard,
and from popup <br>
menus. (A popup menu appears when you press
&lsquo;F10&rsquo; or &lsquo;Menu&rsquo;, or right-click on
the selector or the viewer; each has its own menu.) So in
the manual, you will often see things <br>
rather like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;key&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Menu the item is in, Menu item&rsquo;
<br>
Description of what the key/menu item does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes the key given has a
&lsquo;(Selector)&rsquo; or &lsquo;(Viewer)&rsquo; suffix;
this is because some keypresses in xzgv are specific to the
selector or the viewer, and won&rsquo;t work unless the <br>
relevant part of xzgv has the keyboard focus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE FILE SELECTOR <br>
Usually, on starting up xzgv, you&rsquo;ll want to use the
file selector --- the list of files on the left. (The other
subwindow (on the right) is the viewer.) The selector lets
you <br>
pick files to view (among other things). It lists the
subdirectories and picture files in the current directory,
along with small &lsquo;thumbnail&rsquo; versions of the
pictures if they <br>
exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE SELECTOR MENU <br>
Almost all selector commands are available from the
selector&rsquo;s pop-up menu, which appears when you
right-click anywhere on the selector. (You can also press
&lsquo;F10&rsquo; or &lsquo;Menu&rsquo; to <br>
bring up the menu, but as there are keyboard shortcuts for
just about everything in xzgv, this isn&rsquo;t often that
useful. :-))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usually, it doesn&rsquo;t matter
where on the selector you right-click. However, a few
commands on the File menu operate on a single file, the one
selected by the keyboard cursor. A <br>
problem when using the mouse, you might think --- but when
you right-click on the selector, as well as popping up the
menu, xzgv moves this cursor to the file you right-clicked
<br>
on (if any). (You can see this by the way a hollow box is
drawn around the file.) So to use e.g. Details on the File
menu, you need to right-click on the file you want details
<br>
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both the selector and viewer
have &lsquo;Help&rsquo; menus, most items of which refer you
to this manual:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;F1&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Help, Contents&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Help, Contents&rsquo; <br>
View the manual&rsquo;s overall contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Selector menu, Help, The
File Selector&rsquo; <br>
View the manual&rsquo;s section on the file selector.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Viewer menu, Help, The
Viewer&rsquo; <br>
View the manual&rsquo;s section on the viewer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Selector menu, Help,
Index&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Help, Index&rsquo; <br>
View the manual&rsquo;s concept index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Selector menu, Help,
About&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Help, About&rsquo; <br>
Give some brief information about xzgv, including the
version number and homepage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, the way xzgv lets you
read the manual is a bit crude; it runs the
&lsquo;info&rsquo; program (see Top in the info-stnd info
file) in an &lsquo;xterm&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXITING XZGV <br>
You can exit xzgv either by using one of two exit
keypresses, or by selecting the appropriate option from the
selector&rsquo;s popup menu:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;q&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Ctrl-q&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Exit xzgv&rsquo; <br>
Quit xzgv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(There&rsquo;s also an exit
option on the selector&rsquo;s File menu (&lsquo;Selector
menu, File, Exit&rsquo;), as &lsquo;Exit&rsquo; is generally
on any File menu.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THUMBNAILS <br>
(This section is deliberately early on in the manual, as
thumbnails are probably the most important feature of the
file selector, so it&rsquo;s best that you know how to
create/update <br>
them sooner rather than later.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thumbnails are small versions of
the pictures they represent, and are displayed by the file
selector if they exist. xzgv uses xv-compatible thumbnails
--- if you create thumb&acirc; <br>
nails with xv they will work with xzgv, and vice versa.
xzgv&rsquo;s thumbnails are also compatible with the Gimp,
and zgv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no thumbnail exists for a
file, a small &lsquo;document&rsquo; icon appears instead
(similar to the &lsquo;folder&rsquo; icon used for
directories).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Updating Thumbnails <br>
While thumbnails can be made relatively quickly, it&rsquo;s
by no means an instant process. For this reason, thumbnails
have to be created in advance, and are stored as files in
their <br>
own right in a subdirectory .xvpics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xzgv never creates/updates
thumbnails without you telling it to. So, if you enter a
directory where the picture files don&rsquo;t have any
thumbnails, or where the thumbnails seem to <br>
be out of date, you should press &lsquo;u&rsquo;, or select
Update Thumbnails from the selector&rsquo;s menu. (Even if
the thumbnails can&rsquo;t be written (say, if you
don&rsquo;t have permission to write <br>
them), the selector will still show the updated thumbnails
until you leave the directory.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, you can
create/update thumbnails for the current directory and all
subdirectories by using &lsquo;Alt-u&rsquo; or Recursive
Update. But be warned that a recursive update can <br>
take some time!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;u&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Update Thumbnails&rsquo; <br>
Create thumbnails for any files which don&rsquo;t have them,
and update thumbnails which are older than the corresponding
file. While this is going on, a window appears showing <br>
how far through the process xzgv is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While the update is in progress,
you can abort it by clicking on the Cancel button, or
pressing &lsquo;Esc&rsquo; or &lsquo;Enter&rsquo;, or by
clicking the delete-window button (if your window <br>
manager provides one) on the title bar. xzgv will stop once
it has finished the thumbnail it is currently working on (if
any).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Alt-u&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Recursive Update&rsquo; <br>
Create/update thumbnails for all files in the current
directory and all subdirectories. This can take some time,
so you are prompted to confirm you really want to do this
<br>
(see Dialog Boxes). Progress is indicated in much the same
way as for a normal update, but only for the directory
currently being updated --- the overall progress is not <br>
indicated, other than by the current dir being (as ever)
displayed in the main window&rsquo;s title. You can abort a
recursive thumbnail update in the same ways as for a normal
<br>
update (see above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, xzgv behaves a
little oddly when doing a recursive update, to give some
consistency with the normal update. See Thumbnail Issues,
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thumbnail Issues <br>
Dealing with thumbnails can be &lsquo;interesting&rsquo; at
times, and there are a few ways this influences things:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- xzgv doesn&rsquo;t read the
thumbnails in a directory all at once. Instead, it just
reads the directory contents, then starts up what is
effectively a kind of background task to read <br>
in the thumbnails. So xzgv may not be quite as responsive as
usual for a short time after entering a directory with many
thumbnails (say, a few hundred) --- but on the other <br>
hand, at least it is responding. :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The &lsquo;background
task&rsquo; makes a special effort to show thumbnails for
the files currently visible in the selector first, no matter
how much you move around the list, but it reads <br>
them all in eventually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The thumbnails used in xzgv
require 256 colours to display. This can be a problem if
you&rsquo;re running X in 256 colours or less as, even if
you&rsquo;re running an 8-bit (256 colour) <br>
server, there will almost inevitably be fewer colours
available. Currently, xzgv just uses whatever gdk reports as
the closest match to each individual colour used in
thumbnails. <br>
This gives a tolerable result on 8-bit servers, assuming gdk
was able to allocate a large number of colours; however, it
gives terrible results if it couldn&rsquo;t, or if running
on <br>
4-bit or 1-bit servers. Sorry about this --- it should be
fixed in future (either by using gdk to draw the thumbnail
pixmaps, or by dithering them &lsquo;by hand&rsquo; to suit
the colours <br>
available).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Finally, when doing a
recursive thumbnail update, xzgv (by default) reads existing
thumbnails in a directory before updating any. Or rather, it
reads thumbnails for those files <br>
currently visible in the selector. This can slow things down
very slightly, but keeps the &lsquo;look and feel&rsquo;
consistent with the normal update. (Still, you can disable
this with <br>
the &lsquo;--fast-recursive-update&rsquo; command-line
option (see Invoking xzgv) or equivalent config file entry
(see Configuring xzgv).)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SELECTOR LAYOUT AND RESIZING
<br>
The file selector is simply a list of subdirectories and
filenames, along with any thumbnails that exist for them.
The list is normally in asciibetical order (but you can
change <br>
this; see Changing the Sorting Order). Names of directories
are shown first, and they are shown in order at the
beginning of the list, before all the picture files. Long
file&acirc; <br>
names may not fit in the visible part of the file selector
display; if so, there will be a horizontal scrollbar you can
use to see the rest of the name(s) (you can use cursor <br>
left/right to do this from the keyboard).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list is very often larger
than can fit on the screen at once. If this is the case,
only part is shown at a time, but you can move around the
list using the (vertical) scroll&acirc; <br>
bar, or with cursor up/down and the like.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you find the selector window
to be too small vertically, and would like to see more files
at once, you can start xzgv fullscreen by using the -f
option (see Options), and/or <br>
use &lsquo;thin rows&rsquo; mode (see File Selector
Options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you find the selector too
small (or too big) horizontally, you can change this by
moving the splitter line&rsquo;s &lsquo;handle&rsquo; (a
small square button between the selector and viewer, <br>
near the bottom of the window), which changes the relative
sizes of the selector and viewer. You can move it by
dragging it with the mouse, or with these keys:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;[&rsquo; <br>
Move the window split left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Ctrl-[&rsquo; <br>
Move the window split left more slowly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;]&rsquo; <br>
Move the window split right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Ctrl-]&rsquo; <br>
Move the window split right more slowly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;~&rsquo; <br>
Reset the window split to its default position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also set the
initial/default size of the selector --- in effect, the
position of the window split --- using
&lsquo;--selector-width&rsquo; (see Options) or the config
file option <br>
&lsquo;selector-width&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MOVING AROUND THE LIST <br>
This section is mainly for those of us more inclined to the
keyboard side of the force. :-) Mouse-happy types can freely
skip it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the selector has the
keyboard focus, the cursor (or in GTK+ jargon, the
&lsquo;focus row&rsquo;) is normally shown as a hollow box
around one of the list&rsquo;s rows. This serves the
follow&acirc; <br>
ing functions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- It selects a file for view
commands to operate on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- It determines which part of
the list is shown, as the part of the list shown onscreen
always contains the cursor (unless you move around using the
mouse).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several commands for
moving the cursor. In summary, most &lsquo;special&rsquo;
keys like the cursors do what you&rsquo;d imagine they do,
but in more detail:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Cursor Up&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;k&rsquo; <br>
Move up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Cursor Down&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;j&rsquo; <br>
Move down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Page Up&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Ctrl-u&rsquo; <br>
Move the cursor back roughly a page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Page Down&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Ctrl-v&rsquo; <br>
Move the cursor forward roughly a page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Ctrl-Home&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Ctrl-a&rsquo; <br>
Move the cursor to the start of the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Ctrl-End&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Ctrl-e&rsquo; <br>
Move the cursor to the end of the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;g&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
Move the cursor to the first filename starting with the next
key pressed, which would generally be a letter or number.
Case is significant; &lsquo;a&rsquo; and &lsquo;A&rsquo; are
different. If <br>
no key is pressed within 2 seconds, the command is
cancelled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no files start with the
specified character, it moves to the first file which starts
with a later char (in asciibetical order). If there are none
for which this is the <br>
case, it moves to the last file --- unless there are no
files (just directories), in which case it has no
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VIEWING A FILE <br>
To view a file from the selector, you can click on it, or
press &lsquo;Enter&rsquo; after moving the cursor to the
relevant file, or right-click on the file and choose
&lsquo;File&rsquo; then &lsquo;Open&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Enter&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Left-click-on-file&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, File, Open&rsquo; <br>
View the chosen picture file, or if a subdirectory is
chosen, make that the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIALOG BOXES <br>
See The Viewer, for details of how the viewer works. If xzgv
has a serious problem reading a file, it will give an error.
Errors are shown in dialogs which appear in the middle <br>
of the screen --- they stay there until you click Ok (or
press &lsquo;Enter&rsquo; or &lsquo;Esc&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xzgv also uses similar dialog
boxes for other things:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Getting confirmation that you
want to do something. &lsquo;Enter&rsquo; or &lsquo;y&rsquo;
picks &lsquo;yes&rsquo;; &lsquo;Esc&rsquo; or
&lsquo;n&rsquo; picks no. (Again, you can click on the
relevant button with the mouse to do the <br>
same.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Showing progress when updating
a thumbnail. This is a slightly unusual dialog, in that it
automatically disappears when the update is complete.
However, it does provide a Can&acirc; <br>
cel button which you can click to abort the update (pressing
&lsquo;Enter&rsquo; or &lsquo;Esc&rsquo; does the same).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Reading a directory name. Here
you should type the directory name then click Ok (or press
&lsquo;Enter&rsquo;), or click Cancel (or press
&lsquo;Esc&rsquo;) to abort. The text-input
&lsquo;widget&rsquo; used <br>
allows a certain amount of editing, including these
keys:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Cursor Left&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Ctrl-b&rsquo; <br>
Move the cursor left. (A vertical bar shows the cursor
position.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Cursor Right&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Ctrl-f&rsquo; <br>
Move the cursor right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Home&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Ctrl-a&rsquo; <br>
Move the cursor to the start of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;End&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Ctrl-e&rsquo; <br>
Move the cursor to the end of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Backspace&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Ctrl-h&rsquo; <br>
Delete char to the left of the cursor. (Note that
&lsquo;Backspace&rsquo; is (usually) the key above the main
&lsquo;Enter&rsquo; key; it is often labelled simply as an
arrow.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Delete&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Ctrl-d&rsquo; <br>
Delete the char the cursor is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also set the X selection
(by selecting text with the mouse, or holding
&lsquo;Shift&rsquo; while moving the cursor) to allow
pasting text into other programs, and you can <br>
cut/copy/paste text in the usual ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Shift-Delete&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Ctrl-x&rsquo; <br>
Cut text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Ctrl-Insert&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Ctrl-c&rsquo; <br>
Copy text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Shift-Insert&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Ctrl-v&rsquo; <br>
Paste text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can paste text from (some)
other programs using the latter command, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLOSING A FILE <br>
Usually, when you view a file, the viewer subwindow keeps
displaying it until you view a different file. However, if
you &lsquo;close&rsquo; the file, the viewer stops
displaying the file <br>
and returns to its initial state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Ctrl-w&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, File, Close&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Close&rsquo; the currently-viewed file, clearing the
viewer subwindow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE DETAILS <br>
The listing the selector gives for a file is pretty sparse
--- just the filename and (if the file has one) the
accompanying thumbnail. While this does keep things simple,
you <br>
sometimes want to know how much space a file takes up, when
it was last modified, the dimensions of the image, that kind
of thing. So, you can show details of a single file using
<br>
the &lsquo;file details&rsquo; command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;:&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;;&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, File, Details&rsquo; <br>
Show various details about the file pointed to by the
keyboard cursor. See The Selector Menu, for how to choose
the file details are given for when using the mouse. <br>
(Basically, you right-click on the file when popping up the
menu.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of the details shown come
from the OS (by using the &lsquo;stat(2)&rsquo; system
call), and should always be available unless you have
limited permissions for the directory the file is <br>
in. The file dimensions (width/height), however, come from
the file&rsquo;s thumbnail. If it doesn&rsquo;t have one, or
if it&rsquo;s unreadable, or if it has one and it&rsquo;s
readable but it doesn&rsquo;t <br>
mention the original image&rsquo;s width/height, then the
Details from thumbnail area is greyed out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(In explanation of the latter
point --- pre-5.0 versions of zgv did not generate
width/height comments in thumbnails, so zgv users in
particular may find the width/height details <br>
missing. (xzgv has always been ok, though, it&rsquo;s just
zgv which had this problem.) Worse yet, versions 5.0 and 5.1
generated them with incorrect sizes for most JPEGs. To fix
<br>
either problem for a given directory, do &lsquo;rm -fr
.xvpics&rsquo; in that dir from a shell prompt and recreate
the thumbnails with zgv 5.2 or later, or xzgv/xv/Gimp.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TAGGING <br>
The file selector is not restricted to working on one file
at a time. You can &lsquo;tag&rsquo; as many (or as few)
files as you wish, and certain commands described in this
section will <br>
act on them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Initially, all files are
untagged, and the filenames usually appear in black (though
this depends on the GTK+ theme you&rsquo;re using). Tagged
files appear in red.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tag and Untag Commands <br>
There are several ways to tag or untag files. The
keyboard-based ones which work on individual files (also
available on the Tagging menu) move the cursor down one row
afterwards, <br>
to make tagging or untagging multiple files easier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To tag or untag a single file
with the mouse, control-click (i.e. hold down the control
key and click) on the relevant filename or thumbnail in the
selector. It&rsquo;s true that you <br>
could use Tag and/or Untag on the Tagging menu (see The
Selector Menu, for how to choose the file tagged/untagged
when doing it this way), but this is usually much less
conve&acirc; <br>
nient than using control-click. (The menu entries for those
are really just for completeness.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also a command
available in the viewer to tag the currently-viewed file.
See Changing Picture, for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;=&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;+&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Keypad +&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;0&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Tagging, Tag&rsquo; <br>
Tag file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;-&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Keypad -&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;9&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Tagging, Untag&rsquo; <br>
Untag file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Alt =&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Alt-Keypad +&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Alt-0&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Tagging, Tag All&rsquo; <br>
Tag all files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Alt -&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Alt-Keypad -&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Alt-9&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Tagging, Untag All&rsquo; <br>
Untag all files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Alt-o&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Tagging, Toggle All&rsquo; <br>
Toggle all tags. This inverts the tagged state, so that all
previously tagged files become untagged, and all previously
untagged files become tagged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently there is no way to
toggle a (single) file&rsquo;s tag state from the
keyboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Moving Between Tagged Files <br>
These commands let you search for (move to) the next or
previous tagged file (if any). Note that &lsquo;next&rsquo;
and &lsquo;previous&rsquo; here are relative to the keyboard
cursor&rsquo;s position; if you <br>
use these from the menu, be careful to right-click on the
file you want to start the search from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;/&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Tagging, Next Tagged&rsquo; <br>
Move to next tagged file in dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;?&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Tagging, Previous Tagged&rsquo; <br>
Move to previous tagged file in dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Equivalent commands are also
available in the viewer (see Changing Picture).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copying/Moving Files <br>
You can copy or move tagged files to a directory you
specify. If no files are tagged, xzgv copies/moves the file
the cursor is currently on --- unless the cursor is on a
subdi&acirc; <br>
rectory, in which case it gives an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;C (Shift-c)&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, File, Copy&rsquo; <br>
Copy tagged files (or the current file) to a given
directory. xzgv asks for the destination directory using a
dialog (see Dialog Boxes) and copies the files there. If it
<br>
comes to copy a file but there is an existing file in the
dir with the same name, the file is not copied and nor are
any of the remaining files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;M (Shift-m)&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, File, Move&rsquo; <br>
Move tagged files (or the current file) similarly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RENAMING A FILE <br>
As well as copying/moving files, you can rename them:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Ctrl-n&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, File, Rename file&rsquo; <br>
Rename the current file or directory --- xzgv will refuse to
overwrite any existing files/directories. The new name must
remain in the current directory. (See Copying/Mov&acirc;
<br>
ing Files, for how to move a file to a different directory
(albeit keeping the same name).) See The Selector Menu, for
how to choose the file renamed when using the mouse. <br>
(Basically, you right-click on the file when popping up the
menu.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I know &lsquo;Ctrl-n&rsquo;
isn&rsquo;t the most mnemonic keypress possible for
&lsquo;rename&rsquo;, but all the good ones were taken.
:-/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DELETING A FILE <br>
Deleting a file is pretty straightforward:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Ctrl-d&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, File, Delete file&rsquo; <br>
Delete the file pointed to by the keyboard cursor (and any
accompanying thumbnail). See The Selector Menu, for how to
choose the file deleted when using the mouse. (Basi&acirc;
<br>
cally, you right-click on the file when popping up the
menu.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that only one file is
deleted (hence &lsquo;Delete file&rsquo;); there is
currently no way to delete all tagged files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHANGING DIRECTORY <br>
The easiest way to change the current directory in xzgv is
usually to click on a directory entry in the file list (or
move the cursor to it and press &lsquo;Enter&rsquo;).
Selecting the &lsquo;..&rsquo; <br>
entry moves to the parent directory of the current one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is an alternative
though:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note that the key for this
command is shift-&lsquo;g&rsquo;, not &lsquo;g&rsquo;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;G&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Directory, Change&rsquo; <br>
Go to a specified directory. xzgv asks for the destination
directory using a dialog box which you should type the
dir&rsquo;s name into (see Dialog Boxes), and moves to that
<br>
directory if it exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESCANNING THE DIRECTORY <br>
Normally, xzgv reads a directory once (on starting up, or
when a new directory is selected). So if the contents of the
directory are changed by another program, this is not
auto&acirc; <br>
matically reflected. You can, however, explicitly tell xzgv
to &lsquo;rescan&rsquo; the directory (reread the contents),
which will update xzgv&rsquo;s notion of what&rsquo;s in
it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Ctrl-r&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Directory, Rescan&rsquo; <br>
Rescan the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHANGING THE SORTING ORDER <br>
Normally, the files are listed in asciibetical order by
name. However, you can instead have the file list sorted by
size, last-modified date/time, or by &lsquo;extension&rsquo;
(the file <br>
type).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Only the order of files can be
altered; directories are always listed first, and always in
name order.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Alt-n&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Directory, Sort by Name&rsquo; <br>
Sort by name. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Alt-e&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Directory, Sort by Extension&rsquo;
<br>
Sort by extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Alt-s&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Directory, Sort by Size&rsquo; <br>
Sort by size. The biggest files are listed last.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Alt-d&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Directory, Sort by Time &amp;
Date&rsquo; <br>
Sort by time/date. The newest files are listed last.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can set the default sort
order via the command-line (see Invoking xzgv) or a config
file (see Configuring xzgv).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are three possible
timestamps you can use for the &lsquo;Time &amp; Date&rsquo;
sorting order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Alt-Shift-m&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Directory, Time &amp; Date Type,
Modification Time (mtime)&rsquo; <br>
Use the last-modified time (&lsquo;mtime&rsquo;). This is
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Alt-Shift-c&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Directory, Time &amp; Date Type,
Attribute Change Time (ctime)&rsquo; <br>
Use the last-attribute-change time (&lsquo;ctime&rsquo;).
Note that this is not always the time the file was created,
which it&rsquo;s sometimes mistaken for; for example, moving
a file <br>
with &lsquo;mv&rsquo; will usually change the ctime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Alt-Shift-a&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Directory, Time &amp; Date Type,
Access Time (atime)&rsquo; <br>
Use the last-accessed time (&lsquo;mtime&rsquo;). The
selector order is not automatically updated when xzgv reads
files, since this would probably be annoying; do a manual
rescan if <br>
need be.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE SELECTOR OPTIONS <br>
Various aspects of the file selector&rsquo;s behaviour can
be configured while xzgv is running, by using these toggle
commands (which enable the feature if it was previously
disabled, <br>
and vice versa).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These settings can also be
altered using command-line options (see Options) and/or
config file settings (see Configuring xzgv).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Alt-a&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Options, Auto Hide&rsquo; <br>
Toggle the auto-hiding of the selector when a picture is
viewed (off by default). This is handy for small
screens/windows, or for old-time zgv users who just dig that
<br>
groovy modal interface, er, man. :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Alt-b&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Options, Status Bar&rsquo; <br>
Toggle status bar at the bottom of the selector (off by
default). This displays messages in certain circumstances
--- normally, it just says when a picture is being read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Selector menu, Options,
Thumbnail Msgs&rsquo; <br>
Toggle reading-thumbnails messages (default is off), only
visible if the status bar is enabled. These messages make it
clear when all thumbnails have been read, but having <br>
something flash up every time you change directory is
generally just annoying.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;v&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Selector menu, Options, Thin Rows&rsquo; <br>
Toggle &lsquo;thin rows&rsquo; mode (off by default), in
which thumbnails are shown at a third their normal size so
that many more files can be shown at once. (The odd keyboard
short&acirc; <br>
cut for this is inherited from zgv&rsquo;s
&lsquo;visual&rsquo; mode toggle, which had a roughly
similar effect.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE VIEWER <br>
Once you&rsquo;ve selected a file to view, it&rsquo;s shown
in the viewer (the right-hand part of xzgv&rsquo;s window).
This section describes what you can do while viewing the
picture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like the selector, the viewer
has its own menu --- right-click anywhere on the viewer (or
press &lsquo;F10&rsquo; or &lsquo;Menu&rsquo;) to show it
--- and a similar help menu (see The Selector Menu).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXITING THE VIEWER <br>
When using the mouse to control xzgv, it doesn&rsquo;t
matter whether the selector or the viewer has keyboard focus
--- mouse operations transcend such petty boundaries. :-)
But key&acirc; <br>
board control is (of necessity) effectively modal, and so
you need to &lsquo;exit&rsquo; the viewer in order to have
keyboard control over the selector again. You also need to
exit the <br>
viewer if you&rsquo;ve enabled auto-hide mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exiting the viewer is
simple:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Esc&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Tab&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Exit to Selector&rsquo; <br>
Exit the viewer. This also returns the selector to its
former size, if it was previously &lsquo;hidden&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another way of exiting the
viewer is to middle-click on it, but this mouse-only
approach is really only of use when the selector is
&lsquo;hidden&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BIG PICTURES <br>
A picture may well be too large to fit entirely in the
viewer window. There are two main things which can help you
see more of the picture at once:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Make the xzgv window larger.
You could &lsquo;maximize&rsquo; it with your window
manager, or you could start xzgv with a larger window using
&lsquo;--geometry&rsquo; or fullscreen mode (see Options).
<br>
The fullscreen mode gives xzgv the maximum window size
possible, but needs co-operation from your window manager
(and alas, many are not as willing as one might like) --- in
some <br>
cases you may even find &lsquo;--geometry 100%x100%&rsquo;
to be more effective.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Hide the selector. To do this,
either use auto-hide mode (see File Selector Options), or
hide the selector explicitly (see Hiding the Selector).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But of course, these are only
partial solutions to the problem; there will inevitably
always be pictures larger than your screen can show at once.
In general, then, there are two <br>
ways to see the whole of the picture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scrolling <br>
Scrolling is the default approach to handling big pictures
in xzgv. When the viewer is started up, the top-left of the
picture is shown --- you can either drag the picture around
<br>
with the mouse (i.e. click and hold the button down, then
move the mouse around), or use the scrollbars, or use the
cursor keys (and others) to move around the rest of the
pic&acirc; <br>
ture:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Cursor Up&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;K&rsquo; <br>
Move up 100 pixels. &lsquo;Ctrl-Cursor Up&rsquo; and
&lsquo;k&rsquo; both move up 10 pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Cursor Down&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;J&rsquo; <br>
Move down 100 pixels. &lsquo;Ctrl-Cursor Down&rsquo; and
&lsquo;j&rsquo; both move down 10 pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Cursor Left&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;H&rsquo; <br>
Move left 100 pixels. &lsquo;Ctrl-Cursor Left&rsquo; and
&lsquo;h&rsquo; both move left 10 pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Cursor Right&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;L&rsquo; <br>
Move right 100 pixels. &lsquo;Ctrl-Cursor Right&rsquo; and
&lsquo;l&rsquo; both move right 10 pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Page Up&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Shift-Cursor Up&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Ctrl-u&rsquo; <br>
Move up (nearly) the window height. (It moves by 90% of the
height.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Page Down&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Shift-Cursor Down&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Ctrl-v&rsquo; <br>
Move down (nearly) the window height.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;-&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Shift-Cursor Left&rsquo; <br>
Move left (nearly) a window-length. (It moves by 90% of
it.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;=&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Shift-Cursor Right&rsquo; <br>
Move right (nearly) a window-length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Home&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Ctrl-a&rsquo; <br>
Move to the top-left of the picture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;End&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Ctrl-e&rsquo; <br>
Move to the bottom-right of the picture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zoom Mode <br>
An alternative way of viewing the whole picture, one which
lets you see the picture onscreen all at once no matter how
big (or small) it is, is zoom mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zoom mode&rsquo;s name derives
from the idea of &lsquo;zooming&rsquo; a small file up to
fit the window. But in reality, it is more often used to
reduce a large file to fit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zoom mode is not the default,
and has to be enabled. Once enabled, it stays on until you
turn it off again (or until you enable scaling, or select
Normal (see Scaling)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;z&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Options, Zoom (fit to window)&rsquo;
<br>
Toggle zoom mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Alt-r&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Options, When Zooming Reduce Only&rsquo;
<br>
When in zoom mode, only reduce pictures to fit. This can be
useful when going through a lot of unpredictably-sized
pictures, as it means that you can see all of a big
pic&acirc; <br>
ture easily without also meaning that tiny little icons
assume a scale of Biblical proportions. :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The way zoom mode reduces a file
to fit the window is (relatively) quick but harsh, and may
make the picture look a bit ugly. In future there may be a
smoothing option like zgv&rsquo;s <br>
vkludge, but for now I&rsquo;m afraid the fairly crude
resize is all that&rsquo;s available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is in fact an alternative
to zoom mode, as you can scale down an image instead. This
is generally only useful for very large images, however;
zoom mode tends to be the <br>
Right Thing for the most part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCALING <br>
You can scale a picture --- this makes it appear larger (or
smaller) onscreen. xzgv acts much as if the scaled picture
were the real picture; for example, the cursor keys scroll
<br>
around in steps of 100 scaled pixels, even if this means
moving a fraction of a pixel (or many pixels) in the
original picture (and similarly for movement with the
mouse).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main limitation of scaling
(other than how much it slows things down :-), at least when
scaling up) is that you can only scale by integer values, so
you can only make each <br>
pixel in the image twice as wide/high, or three times as
wide/high, or four times, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(It may seem odd saying e.g.
&lsquo;twice as wide/high&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;twice
the size&rsquo;, but technically &lsquo;twice the
size&rsquo; would be referring to scaling up the width (and
height) by about <br>
1.414...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, xzgv does no scaling,
which could be considered a ratio of 1:1. Scaling up
increases that ratio. How it is increased depends on which
option/key you use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;d&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Scaling, Double Scaling&rsquo; <br>
Increase the ratio by doubling it --- this leads to ratios
of 2:1, 4:1, 8:1...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;s&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Scaling, Add 1 to Scaling&rsquo; <br>
Increase the ratio by adding one --- leads to ratios of 2:1,
3:1, 4:1...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are similar commands to
decrease the ratio:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;D (Shift-d)&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Scaling, Halve Scaling&rsquo; <br>
Decrease the ratio by halving it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;S (Shift-s)&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Scaling, Sub 1 from Scaling&rsquo; <br>
Decrease the ratio by subtracting one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usually the double/halve
scalings are more useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that you can also
double/halve the scaling by using shift-left-click on the
viewer to double, and shift-right-click to halve. This still
changes scale &lsquo;around&rsquo; the middle of <br>
the window though (rather than around the point clicked on,
as you might expect), which is a little strange and may
possibly be changed in future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you scale
&lsquo;below&rsquo; 1:1, the above commands lead to ratios
of (e.g.) 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, etc. --- that is, the ratios work
the same way, but the other way around. This gives you <br>
an increasingly small image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The scaling ratio is never
decreased below 1:32. It is also never increased beyond the
point where the overall image size would exceed 32767x32767
--- this limit is due to the <br>
combination of X&rsquo;s limit on window sizes, and the
implementation used by xzgv for scaling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One problem with scaling up,
given the way it&rsquo;s currently implemented, is that
it&rsquo;s not well-suited to dithered display --- so if
you&rsquo;re running on an 8-bit server, dragging the <br>
image around slowly when using scaling (especially scaling
with interpolation) may result in some nasty, streaky,
undithered-looking parts of the picture. :-(</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can undo the effect of
scaling (up or down) at any time:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;n&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Scaling, Normal&rsquo; <br>
Resume &lsquo;normal&rsquo; display --- disables scaling
mode, and also zoom mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, scaling up works by
simply making the pixels into larger and larger squares (in
effect), which remain the same colour. However, you can
enable a feature called &lsquo;inter&acirc; <br>
polation&rsquo; which smoothly graduates the colour change
between the top-left corners of each pixel. This is very
slow, but looks nice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;i&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Options, Interpolate when Scaling&rsquo;
<br>
Toggle interpolation in scaling mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(If you like the appearance of
scaling with interpolation, you may also be interested in a
program I wrote called pnminterp, which can scale up a PGM
or PPM file while applying <br>
this effect. These days it&rsquo;s part of the netpbm
package.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scaling down, however, is
implemented a bit like a special-case zoom mode, and
currently there are no ways of making that look nicer.
:-/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xzgv normally
&lsquo;reverts&rsquo; scaling (returning the scale to 1:1)
back to normal when you view a new picture. However,
it&rsquo;s possible to disable this behaviour (see Viewer
Options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also support for an
alternative form of scaling --- decoupled, or axis-specific,
scaling. When you scale in this way, only one axis of the
image is scaled at once. For <br>
example, you might choose to effectively double the height
of an image (with the width left unchanged). Indeed, this
sort of scaling is useful for temporarily correcting
pictures <br>
intended for display using pixels twice as wide or high as
normal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;x&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Scaling, X Only, Double Scaling&rsquo;
<br>
Increase the (x axis) ratio by doubling it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;X (Shift-x)&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Scaling, X Only, Halve Scaling&rsquo;
<br>
Decrease the (x axis) ratio by halving it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Alt-x&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Scaling, X Only, Add 1 to Scaling&rsquo;
<br>
Increase the (x axis) ratio by adding one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Alt-Shift-x&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Scaling, X Only, Sub 1 from
Scaling&rsquo; <br>
Decrease the (x axis) ratio by subtracting one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;y&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Scaling, Y Only, Double Scaling&rsquo;
<br>
Increase the (y axis) ratio by doubling it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Y (Shift-y)&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Scaling, Y Only, Halve Scaling&rsquo;
<br>
Decrease the (y axis) ratio by halving it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Alt-y&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Scaling, Y Only, Add 1 to Scaling&rsquo;
<br>
Increase the (y axis) ratio by adding one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Alt-Shift-y&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Scaling, Y Only, Sub 1 from
Scaling&rsquo; <br>
Decrease the (y axis) ratio by subtracting one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are also mouse shortcuts
for scaling up/down a single axis; control-left-click scales
up, and control-right-click scales down. By default this
acts on the y axis, but the <br>
active axis can be toggled with &lsquo;Alt-c&rsquo;, or by
toggling the &lsquo;Ctl+Click Scales X Axis&rsquo; option
(see Viewer Options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interpolation is not currently
supported in situations where the x scaling does not match
the y scaling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIRROR AND ROTATE <br>
Sometimes when viewing a picture you will want to flip it
horizontally or vertically, or rotate it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;m&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Orientation, Mirror (horiz)&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Mirror&rsquo; the picture (flip it horizontally).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;f&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Orientation, Flip (vert)&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Flip&rsquo; the picture (flip it vertically).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;r&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Orientation, Rotate Right&rsquo; <br>
Rotate the picture 90 degrees clockwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;R (Shift-r)&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Orientation, Rotate Left&rsquo; <br>
Rotate the picture 90 degrees anti-clockwise. (Any US
readers surprised and/or annoyed by my not saying
&lsquo;counter-clockwise&rsquo; will realise why the menus
say rotate <br>
right/left. :-))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;N (Shift-n)&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Orientation, Normal&rsquo; <br>
Restore the picture orientation to normal. This undoes the
effect of any mirrors, flips, and/or rotations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xzgv normally
&lsquo;reverts&rsquo; the picture orientation (the way the
picture has been transformed by mirror/flip/rotate) back to
normal when you view a new picture. However, it&rsquo;s
possi&acirc; <br>
ble to disable this (see Viewer Options), so that any new
pictures are mirrored, flipped, and/or rotated in the same
way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BRIGHTNESS AND CONTRAST <br>
[Brightness and contrast changing is not supported in xzgv
0.9.] xzgv provides support for changing brightness and
contrast, though given the way it has to redraw the image to
<br>
do so, it can be a little slow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently there is no way to do
this with the mouse; this should be fixed soon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;,&rsquo; <br>
Decrease contrast.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;.&rsquo; <br>
Increase contrast.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;&lt;&rsquo; <br>
Decrease brightness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;&gt;&rsquo; <br>
Increase brightness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;:&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;;&rsquo; <br>
Reset contrast and brightness to normal. (&lsquo;*&rsquo; is
also supported, for hysterical raisins.) Note that this
deliberately does not affect the gamma adjustment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any contrast change is applied
before any brightness change, and any gamma adjustment is
applied before both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GAMMA ADJUSTMENT <br>
[Gamma is not supported in xzgv 0.9.] Ah yes, gamma. What
fun. The basic problem is this --- differing displays have
differing intensity response curves. &lsquo;&lsquo;This has
made a lot <br>
of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad
move.&rsquo;&rsquo; :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It means that you need some way
of adjusting how brightly you display the picture to
compensate. But since we&rsquo;re dealing with response
curves, this isn&rsquo;t just a matter of chang&acirc; <br>
ing the brightness in a linear fashion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That doesn&rsquo;t seem so hard
to deal with, right? All you need is to get the gamma (a
number which specifies how much the curve bends) for the
image, and for the screen, divide one <br>
by the other and adjust as appropriate. Joy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But, given that the problem has
existed since we started displaying more than eight colours,
you won&rsquo;t be surprised to find that it&rsquo;s already
been fixed. And the fixes all tend <br>
to clash, and everybody has a different notion of how to fix
it. The usual &lsquo;fix&rsquo; is to assume that whoever
made the image made it with a gamma matching the gamma of
your display, <br>
so you can just stuff the bits right on the screen. Since
this is easy, it&rsquo;s the most widespread approach. But
it&rsquo;s a bit stupid, so not everyone does it. Combine
that with the <br>
lack of gamma specification in most image formats, and the
often-bogus values specified by people in those that do, and
hey presto --- the image gamma could be just about
any&acirc; <br>
thing. And the screen&rsquo;s gamma also tends not to be
easily determined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So how on earth do you deal with
something like that in a remotely sane fashion?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The answer chosen in xzgv is to
just live with the fact that the probability of
automatically obtaining correct values for both the screen
and image gamma is basically zero. Once <br>
you accept that, the sensible thing to do is to make it very
easy and fast to change gamma adjustment to
commonly-required values. So here&rsquo;s how to do it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;1&rsquo; <br>
Set gamma adjustment to 1.0, i.e. no adjustment. This is the
default setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;2&rsquo; <br>
Set gamma adjustment to 2.2. This is useful for viewing
linear-gamma files (one classic example being raytracer
output) on an average PC monitor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;3&rsquo; <br>
Set gamma adjustment to 1 divided by 2.2, i.e. roughly 0.45.
This is useful for the reverse --- viewing
average-PC-monitor-gamma files on a linear-gamma display.
Histori&acirc; <br>
cally I believe the classic example would have been viewing
PC files on a Mac, but I don&rsquo;t know how true that is
these days.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;4&rsquo; <br>
Set gamma adjustment to its initial value, as specified by a
&lsquo;--gamma&rsquo; command-line option (see Options) or
equivalent config file setting (see Configuring xzgv). The
<br>
default value used if none was specified is 1.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A brief clarification is
probably in order. The gamma adjustment value which you set
in xzgv is actually inverted from (i.e. one divided by) the
true adjustment value used. This <br>
is (believe it or not :-)) intended to avoid confusion by
reflecting the fact that screen gamma is the one most widely
considered/well known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also tweak the
adjustment more precisely, in a similar way to
brightness/contrast:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Alt-,&rsquo; <br>
Decrease gamma adjustment (divide it by 1.05).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Alt-.&rsquo; <br>
Increase gamma adjustment (multiply it by 1.05).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that &lsquo;:&rsquo;, and
the other keys which reset the brightness/contrast,
deliberately avoid resetting the gamma adjustment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As with brightness/contrast,
there is currently no way to adjust gamma with the mouse;
this should be fixed soon. (But the 1/2/3/4 keyboard-based
method is likely to still be the <br>
faster method.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHANGING PICTURE <br>
It&rsquo;s possible to go directly to the previous or next
file (or tagged file) in the directory, or to tag a file,
without having to pick the file from the file selector by
hand. <br>
These commands are particularly useful when using xzgv from
the keyboard, but there&rsquo;s also a notable mouse
shortcut for moving to the next image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Space&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Next Image&rsquo; <br>
Move to next file in dir, and view it. You can also click on
the picture/viewer to do this. (If you find this interferes
with dragging the picture around (though it <br>
shouldn&rsquo;t), or just don&rsquo;t like it, it can be
disabled (see Config Variables).)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;b&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Previous Image&rsquo; <br>
Move to previous file in dir, and view it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Ctrl-Space&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Tagging, Tag then Next&rsquo; <br>
Tag current file, then move to next file in dir and view
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;/&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Tagging, Next Tagged&rsquo; <br>
Move to next tagged file in dir, and view it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;?&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Tagging, Previous Tagged&rsquo; <br>
Move to previous tagged file in dir, and view it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HIDING THE SELECTOR <br>
When running on small screens, or in a small window, it can
get a bit annoying to lose viewer space by having the
selector constantly displayed when you don&rsquo;t actually
need it. <br>
The usual solution to this problem is to enable auto-hide
mode. But what if some pictures you&rsquo;re viewing are
small and some large? It can sometimes be nearly as annoying
having <br>
the selector hidden to &lsquo;make room for&rsquo; a small
picture which didn&rsquo;t need it. So for that reason, or
perhaps if you just don&rsquo;t like auto-hide mode :-), you
may prefer to leave <br>
auto-hide off and explicitly hide the selector when
necessary:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Z (shift-z)&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Window, Hide Selector&rsquo; <br>
Hide the selector. (This is actually a toggle, of sorts;
&lsquo;hide selector&rsquo; when it&rsquo;s already hidden
unhides it.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also hide or unhide the
selector by middle-clicking on the viewer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MINIMIZING XZGV <br>
Generally it&rsquo;s easy enough to use your window manager
to change windows etc., but when running fullscreen this can
sometimes be a little problematic. For this reason, xzgv has
<br>
built-in support for &lsquo;iconifying&rsquo; itself:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Ctrl-z&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Window, Minimize&rsquo; <br>
Minimize the xzgv window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VIEWER OPTIONS <br>
As with the selector, various options can be
disabled/enabled which relate to the viewer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These settings can also be
altered using command-line options (see Options) and/or
config file settings (see Configuring xzgv).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;z&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Options, Zoom (fit to window)&rsquo;
<br>
Toggle zoom mode, discussed in more detail elsewhere (see
Zoom Mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Alt-r&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Options, When Zooming Reduce Only&rsquo;
<br>
Toggle reduce-only in zoom mode, also covered elsewhere (see
Zoom Mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;i&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Options, Interpolate when Scaling&rsquo;
<br>
Toggle interpolation when a picture is being scaled-up.
Again, this has already been mentioned (see Scaling).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Alt-c&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Options, Ctl+Click Scales X Axis&rsquo;
<br>
Toggle the axis scaled when you control-click (or
control-right-click) on the image. The default is to scale
the y axis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;F (shift-f)&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;Viewer menu, Options, Dither in 15 &amp;
16-bit&rsquo; <br>
Toggle dithering in 15/16-bit modes. This increases the
apparent colour depth making gradations look much better,
but it&rsquo;s slower than undithered rendering, and can (in
<br>
16-bit) slightly distort a picture&rsquo;s colour balance.
(The &lsquo;F&rsquo; key was chosen for this as the dither
toggle is functionally similar to zgv&rsquo;s
&lsquo;fakecols&rsquo; toggle.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Viewer menu, Options,
Revert Scaling For New Pic&rsquo; <br>
Normally xzgv returns the scaling back down to 1 (normal)
when a new picture is selected. By disabling this, you can
retain scaling across picture selection. (There is <br>
currently no keyboard shortcut for this
fairly-seldom-changed option --- to toggle it from the
keyboard, you should use the popup menu (press
&lsquo;F10&rsquo;), and select the menu <br>
item.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Viewer menu, Options,
Revert Orient. For New Pic&rsquo; <br>
Similarly, xzgv returns to the picture&rsquo;s true
orientation (not mirrored, rotated, etc.) on selecting a new
picture. Disabling this option means that any mir&acirc;
<br>
rors/flips/rotates applied persist across multiple images.
(No keyboard shortcut --- see above.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;Viewer menu, Options, Use
Exif Orientation&rsquo; <br>
Toggle support for Exif orientation. Devices which create
JPEG files in the Exif format (e.g. many digital cameras)
may add an orientation tag to the file, which says how <br>
the camera was being held when the picture was taken. When
this tag is present, xzgv can adjust the image to compensate
for a camera being held on its side. (This isn&rsquo;t <br>
done by default as it misrepresents the true image, which
could be confusing if you don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s
happening.) Enabling this option may be useful if you take
pictures <br>
with your camera on its side, but don&rsquo;t want to have
to rotate the pictures before being able to view them
properly. Of course, for this to work your camera has to be
<br>
inserting the orientation tag in the first place --- but it
can&rsquo;t hurt to try it and see. (No keyboard shortcut
--- see above.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE FORMATS <br>
Picture files are stored in a variety of different forms, or
&lsquo;file formats&rsquo;. xzgv, via gdk, supports
many.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE TYPE IDENTIFICATION <br>
The format a file is in is identified by its content. The
file-reading code relies on libgdk to determine the file
type and read the file correctly; generally this uses the
for&acirc; <br>
mat&rsquo;s &lsquo;magic number&rsquo; to determine file
type --- e.g. a JPEG/JFIF file starts with the (hex) bytes
&lsquo;FF D8&rsquo;. So if you start xzgv with xzgv foo, and
foo is in a supported format <br>
(such as JPEG), the format will be figured out and the file
loaded even though the &lsquo;extension&rsquo; is
absent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURING XZGV <br>
Many aspects of the way xzgv works can be modified by using
a configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIG FILES <br>
A configuration file lets you alter aspects of xzgv&rsquo;s
behaviour. xzgv supports two possible config files --- a
system-wide one, /etc/xzgv.conf; and one for each user in
their <br>
home directory, $HOME/.xzgvrc. Both are optional. If
$HOME/.xzgvrc exists, it is used instead of
/etc/xzgv.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before describing the format of
config files, it may help to give an example file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Sample xzgv config file <br>
# Comment lines begin with &lsquo;#&rsquo; and are ignored,
<br>
# as are blank lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># make pics fit window <br>
zoom on <br>
# hog the screen :-) <br>
fullscreen on</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is a line-based format. Each
line (or rather, each line which is not a comment line and
is not blank) assigns a value to a single predefined
&lsquo;variable&rsquo;. xzgv has many such <br>
variables it lets you modify in this way. For example, the
fullscreen option above controls whether or not xzgv tries
to use the whole screen for its window. If it is given the
<br>
value
&lsquo;on&rsquo;/&lsquo;y&rsquo;/&lsquo;yes&rsquo;/&lsquo;1&rsquo;
it does; if
&lsquo;off&rsquo;/&lsquo;n&rsquo;/&lsquo;no&rsquo;/&lsquo;0&rsquo;,
it doesn&rsquo;t. Most variables are of this yes-or-no
&lsquo;boolean&rsquo; type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the variables set in a
config file have a direct effect on how xzgv works, it can
be easier to simply call them &lsquo;settings&rsquo;.
Indeed, such terminology is used on occasion in <br>
this documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIG VARIABLE TYPES <br>
There are various types of variable:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Boolean. These are on-or-off,
yes-or-no variables. Most of xzgv&rsquo;s config file
variables are of this type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Integer (currently unused).
These are whole numbers. The meaning of the number depends
on what the variable is used for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Real (floating-point). This
can be a whole number or a decimal fraction. Only the gamma
variable is of this type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Geometry. This window
size-and/or-position specification format is only used for
the &lsquo;geometry&rsquo; setting. See Options, for a
description of how this type works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIG VARIABLES <br>
Currently, most configuration variables (settings) in xzgv
can also be set by command-line options; indeed, the name of
the setting in all such cases is identical to that for the
<br>
long version of the option (e.g. &lsquo;fullscreen&rsquo;,
&lsquo;auto-hide&rsquo;). As such, they&rsquo;re documented
in the section which discusses command-line options and the
like (see Options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, there are some settings
only available in the config file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">click-for-next <br>
This is enabled by default, allowing you to click on the
viewer to skip to the next image. If disabled, clicking on
the viewer does nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
Here I (RJM) attempt to explain why I did things the way I
did. This is presented in a question-and-answer format of
sorts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WHY YET ANOTHER VIEWER? <br>
Previously, this section concentrated on xv; that may have
made sense when I originally wrote it, and still makes a
certain limited amount of sense for zgv, but for xzgv it was
<br>
looking increasingly dated. And so here I am writing an
update. :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I originally wrote xzgv as I
simply wasn&rsquo;t happy with the viewers for X that I was
aware of at the time (mid-1999). At the time of writing
(late 2000), other key things about <br>
xzgv are becoming apparent, partly through responses
I&rsquo;ve been getting to it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o It&rsquo;s &lsquo;fast&rsquo;.
No, it doesn&rsquo;t do any particular operation faster than
other viewers as far as I know (well, maybe thumbnail
updates :-)); rather, the interface tries not to get <br>
in your way. Click on a filename, and the picture appears.
No multiplicity of toolbars or windows, it&rsquo;s just
there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o As with zgv, it tries to do
one thing well, viewing pictures. It isn&rsquo;t perfect in
this regard, I&rsquo;ll admit, but at least it stays well
clear of picture editing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o It&rsquo;s, er, quite a lot
like zgv. Some of us old fogies like this. :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I won&rsquo;t pretend xzgv is
The Ultimate Viewer For Everyone. Some people will prefer
other approaches, or just simply prefer other viewers. (Some
people may even still use xv, ghod <br>
forbid.) There are a few viewers which you may like to try
if you don&rsquo;t think much of xzgv:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o gqview. This seems to be
well-regarded. I find it a bit gimmicky and
kitchen-sink-ish; not quite as &lsquo;pure&rsquo; or focused
as xzgv, IMHO. I think more people use it than xzgv <br>
though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o xli. I&rsquo;m not sure if
this is maintained these days, but it&rsquo;s not too bad a
viewer. No thumbnails or file selector though. (These days I
mostly use this for setting the root <br>
window pixmap, something I don&rsquo;t think belongs in a
viewer, but which xli does happen to be quite good at.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o qiv. If I read between the
lines correctly, this is essentially a modern replacement
for xli.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o gtksee. I&rsquo;ve not tried
this, but I think the idea is that it&rsquo;s an ACDSee
clone, and there seem to be an awful lot of people who want
a clone of that. Which is their problem. <br>
:^)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Electric Eyes. To be honest, I
think this has been outclassed by other viewers these days,
which shows how far we&rsquo;ve come.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ah, you say, what of xv? Well,
we&rsquo;ve emphatically reached the point where no-one need
use xv any more. Anyone using xv these days really should
drop that pile of ill-conceived <br>
non-Free crap and use one of the better viewers now
available. It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WHY NO IMAGE-EDITING
CAPABILITIES? <br>
It&rsquo;s a fscking viewer, dammit. If you want xv you know
where to find it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(OTOH, if you want a decent
image editor, use the Gimp.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WHY A TEXINFO MANUAL? <br>
For years, I maintained a conventional &lsquo;man
page&rsquo; for zgv (which xzgv was loosely based on). But
over time, I realised just how impossibly confusing the zgv
man page had become.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So I wanted to rewrite
zgv&rsquo;s documentation in a more sensible way, in some
other format than a man page. I wanted an established,
well-supported format with structure and cross- <br>
referencing. I felt this made it a choice between HTML and
texinfo. HTML seemed to me to be a moving target like no
other, and not as well supported on text-only terminals as
<br>
Info (and thus texinfo). (This latter point is admittedly
not too relevant as far as xzgv is concerned.) When I
noticed that a converter existed to convert texinfo to HTML
in any <br>
case, the case was closed. xzgv&rsquo;s documentation was
then based on zgv&rsquo;s --- the documentation is probably
more similar than the programs are. :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t get me wrong --- I
like man pages. And even with the excellent Texinfo
documentation and Emacs&rsquo; very helpful Texinfo mode,
writing texinfo is hardly easy. (Without Texinfo <br>
mode&rsquo;s node- and menu-update commands, I personally
would find it near-impossible!) But big man pages just
aren&rsquo;t that good for reference, and this is made worse
by the relative <br>
lack of structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WHY ONE-SPACE SENTENCE ENDS?
<br>
The conventional way to write texinfo is to follow each
sentence with two spaces after the dot (or whatever ends the
sentence). Many people normally write this way in a
non-tex&acirc; <br>
info context too. But a sizeable proportion of people
normally write text with only one space after the dot ---
and I&rsquo;m one of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Texinfo documentation gives
the impression that two-space must be used; it says
&lsquo;&lsquo;it is important to put two spaces at the end
of sentences in Texinfo documents.&rsquo;&rsquo; But the
<br>
only circumstance in which spacing from the texinfo file is
preserved at all (in any sense other than &lsquo;there is a
space here&rsquo;) is when the texinfo is converted to Info
format. <br>
So, in fact, the decision to use two-space depends on how
the author wants Info output to appear --- this is a
subjective decision which should be entirely down to the
preference <br>
of the author, despite the Texinfo documentation&rsquo;s
attempt to make two-space sound like an objective
you-must-do-this kind of thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You might wonder what the
problem with using one-space is, then. Well,
&lsquo;makeinfo&rsquo; has to reformat paragraphs, and
whenever it needs to insert space at (what appears to it to
be) <br>
the end of a sentence, it inserts two spaces. This behaviour
cannot be altered, unlike in Emacs
(sentence-end-double-space; see Fill Commands in the emacs
info file) and GNU fmt <br>
(-u; see fmt invocation in the textutils info file). Also,
attempting to &lsquo;fix&rsquo; the output Info with sed
doesn&rsquo;t work properly because the &lsquo;tags&rsquo;
used to find nodes quickly are <br>
then incorrect. These could of course also be fixed, but
this would involve a lot more work than a simple sed
invocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So realistically, anyone who
writes texinfo with one-space has to put up with the
occasional two-space sentence end being inserted into their
text --- worse still, the current <br>
&lsquo;makeinfo&rsquo; formatting algorithm seems to insert
two spaces even after abbreviations (such as
&lsquo;e.g.&rsquo; and &lsquo;etc.&rsquo;), which breaks
even two-space texinfo. (This is particularly <br>
ironic, by the way, since two-space partisans&rsquo; main
argument in favour of the practice is often the way it makes
it possible to tell the difference between abbreviations and
the <br>
end of a sentence.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One last point may be worth
noting; I am not the first person to write texinfo files
using one-space. At the time of writing, it is used in the
texinfo documentation for BFD, <br>
gdbm, GTK/GDK, (Linux) IPC, and viper, and I expect there
are instances I&rsquo;m not aware of.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS AND RESTRICTIONS <br>
All (non-trivial) programs have bugs. Anyone who denies
this...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- clearly hasn&rsquo;t written
too many programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- is wrong. ;-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It follows that xzgv, like
everything else, always has some bugs. Usually these are not
too serious, or I&rsquo;d have fixed them before releasing
xzgv. But either way, bugs and other <br>
problems with xzgv are noted here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN BUGS <br>
- In zoom mode, it copes with resizing the window as a
whole, but doesn&rsquo;t when you change the size of the
pane (apart from when hiding/showing selector or resizing
from keyboard, <br>
but that&rsquo;s only &rsquo;cos I kludged it :-)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- When scaling up and dithering,
you end up with a crappy-looking picture if you drag the
picture around slowly (since each exposed bit is dithered
independently, with no regard <br>
given to matching up to any previous error-diffusion).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Scaling up is slow. Not sure
if I can do much about this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Using an alignment widget to
centre the viewer window results in some annoying
&lsquo;bounce&rsquo; in certain resizing situations etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Thumbnails don&rsquo;t look so
great in palette-based (e.g. 8-bit) modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- When dragging an image around,
if you quickly move the mouse pointer over from the image
area to the selector area, the image seems to
&lsquo;jump&rsquo; a little. I think this may have <br>
something to do with the paned window&rsquo;s
window-splitting bit, but I&rsquo;m not sure. Also, it jumps
when moving across scrollbar sliders and the paned window
splitter handle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- It doesn&rsquo;t apply any
tranparency mask. The practical result of this seems to be
purple transparent bits in thumbnails and scaled-up images,
and black transparent bits else&acirc; <br>
where. This doesn&rsquo;t affect PNG files, though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- If a GIF file is corrupted in
such a way that the decompressed image has a larger number
of pixels in it, the extra pixels will be ignored and no
error or warning will be gen&acirc; <br>
erated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- If you look up &lsquo;joe
code&rsquo; in a dictionary, right next to &lsquo;&lsquo;see
zgv&rsquo;&rsquo; it now says &lsquo;&lsquo;but for really
in-depth insight into the joe code nature, see
xzgv&rsquo;&rsquo;. :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUBOPTIMAL FEATURES <br>
- Thumbnails are given an accurate width/height
&lsquo;IMGINFO&rsquo; comment, but are always claimed to be
&quot;RGB&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- xzgv doesn&rsquo;t duplicate
zgv&rsquo;s behaviour of generating thumbnails under
~/.xvpics/_foo_bar_baz if it can&rsquo;t generate them in
/foo/bar/baz/.xvpics. I doubt anything else supported <br>
it, and it complicated lots of things unnecessarily. This
isn&rsquo;t particularly suboptimal, but as an
incompatibility with zgv it merits mention.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
- Only the first image of a multiple-image GIF is used.
(These days, multiple-image GIFs are usually
animations.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORTING BUGS <br>
If you find xzgv does something wrong, which you suspect
might be a fault of some sort (a bug) in the program, it is
best to report it as I may not be aware of the problem. (But
<br>
first, check it is not a &lsquo;known bug&rsquo;. See Known
Bugs. It is not usually helpful to report a bug I already
know about.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important to include as
much detail in a bug report as you can. Here are some
details you should include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The version of xzgv you are
running. &lsquo;xzgv --version&rsquo; reports this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The versions of GTK+ you are
using. &lsquo;xzgv --version-gtk&rsquo; reports the GTK+
version being used by xzgv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The bitdepth your X server is
running in (common depths are 8-bit (256 colours), 15-bit,
16-bit, 24-bit, and 32-bit). If you don&rsquo;t know what
depth you&rsquo;re running in, try &lsquo;xdpy&acirc; <br>
info|grep depth&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A description of the bug ---
what effects it has, the circumstances it occurs in, and so
on. Does it only happen for certain types of file? Only when
in 8-bit modes? Only when <br>
dithering is enabled? Even &lsquo;irrelevant&rsquo; details
can sometimes be useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Finally, if you are a
programmer and believe you have managed to fix the bug
yourself, patches are gratefully accepted. :-) You should
generate the patch using &lsquo;diff -c&rsquo; or <br>
(preferably) &lsquo;diff -u&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So, if you think you&rsquo;ve
found a bug in xzgv, report it by emailing me at
&lt;rrt@sc3d.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORTING DOCUMENTATION BUGS
<br>
Bugs in the documentation can sometimes cause as much
trouble as bugs in the program; if you notice a problem in
the documentation, it&rsquo;s a good idea to report it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For reports of documentation
bugs, you should include these details:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The version of xzgv the
documentation is for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o If it is a problem in one
specific section of the documentation, specify which part it
is (by this I mean the heading it comes under; texinfophiles
should read this as &lsquo;the <br>
node name&rsquo; :-)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The format of the
documentation you saw the problem in (e.g. info, man page,
HTML).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A description of the
problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE CHANGES <br>

report. If you want to suggest a feature you&rsquo;d like in
xzgv, or a change to an existing feature, contact me at <br>
&lt;rus@svgalib.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xzgv is rather a moving target
at the moment, so for now future changes etc. are only
listed in the TODO file. Normal service will be resumed once
things settle down a bit. :-)</p>
