xzgv - picture viewer for X, with thumbnail-based file selector

(NB: This man page is automagically generated from xzgv's texinfo file, and so
  may look a bit odd. We apologise for the inconvenience. :-))
<div class="Pp"></div>
xzgv is a picture viewer for X, with a thumbnail-based file selector. The
  thumbnails used (thumbnails being small `preview' versions of the pictures)
  are compatible with xv, zgv, and the Gimp. The kinds of pictures xzgv allows
  to be viewed are raster-format pictures (sometimes called `bitmaps' and/or
  `pixmaps'); things like GIF files, JPEG files, PNG files, and so on.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most of the time, you will probably want to use xzgv's file selector (see <b>The
  File Selector</b>) to pick which file(s) to view. This is what appears on the
  left-hand side of the window when you start xzgv as just ` <b>xzgv</b>' (see
  <b>Options</b>). It displays a list of subdirectories and picture files in the
  current directory, along with small `thumbnail' versions of the pictures if
  they exist. (If no thumbnails appear in a given directory, or if they are
  missing for some files, you can create/update them by pressing ` <b>u</b>'.
  See <b>Updating</b> <b>Thumbnails</b>.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you've picked a file to view, you can view it by clicking on it, or
  pressing ` <b>Enter</b>'. This reads the picture and displays it in the
  right-hand part of the window, the viewer (see <b>The</b> <b>Viewer</b>). You
  can then move around the picture (if it is larger than will fit) by dragging
  it with the mouse, or using the scrollbars, or the cursor keys. You can then
  select another image with the file selector (though you need to press `
  <b>Esc</b>' or ` <b>Tab</b>' first if using the keyboard), or you can quit
  xzgv by pressing ` <b>q</b>'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
While xzgv works much like any other X program, and is certainly mouse-friendly
  :-), it's also designed to be keyboard-friendly. Everything in xzgv can be
  done entirely from the keyboard. Much of this keyboard support works like the
  original zgv (a similar console-based picture viewer for Linux).
<div class="Pp"></div>
This overview is, as you might expect, only the very simplest of introductions
  to what xzgv can do, and describes only a very basic use of xzgv. xzgv can do
  a lot more; read on to find out what.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS"><a class="selflink" href="#ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</a></h1>
xzgv was primarily written by Russell Marks, also the author of this manual. It
  is maintained by Reuben Thomas.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Costa Sapuntzakis contributed code for much faster JPEG thumbnail generation (to
  zgv, which I adapted for xzgv).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The directory/file icons used were loosely based on gmc's <i>dir-close.xpm</i>.
  I think Tuomas Kuosmanen was responsible for that, judging from the change
  log.
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>mkinstalldirs</b>' is straight from the `<b>texinfo</b>' package, and was
  written by Noah Friedman. (This is also used during installation.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Huge thanks go to the many people responsible for GTK+, without which xzgv would
  almost certainly not have happened. (But no thanks for Electric Eyes, which
  was nearly nice enough for me not to bother with xzgv at all! :-))
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>getopt*.[ch]</i> are from the GNU libc.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
Normally you'd invoke xzgv as plain ` <b>xzgv</b>' (perhaps via a window manager
  menu, or GNOME/KDE menu, etc.). However, you can directly specify files to
  view, or a start directory, on the command-line. In addition, there are
  various options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
(If you're new to xzgv, you should probably skip the rest of this section for
  now and come back to it later.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The general format of the xzgv command-line goes roughly like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
xzgv [ <i>options</i>] [<i>dir</i> | <i>file</i> ...]
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Two types of options are supported --- the traditional Unix single-letter
  options, and GNU-style long options. Most options can be used in either way,
  and both forms are listed in the table below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that all options are processed after any configuration file(s). Config file
  settings are just like the long-option names below minus the ` <b>--</b>' (see
  <b>Configuring xzgv</b>), though a few command-line options are not permitted
  as config file settings (e.g. ` <b>help</b>'), and vice versa.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here's what the options do:
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>-a</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>--auto-hide</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Automatically hide selector when a picture is
  selected, allowing the viewer to use the whole window.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>--careful-jpeg</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Enable libjpeg `fancy upsampling'. xzgv
  defaults to using the faster method; as the libjpeg documentation puts it,
  ``The visual impact of the sloppier method is often very small.''</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>--delete-single-prompt</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">(Note that this is normally enabled; use `
  <b>--delete-single-prompt=off</b>' to disable it.) If <i>disabled</i>, xzgv
  will immediately delete a file when told to, without prompting for
  confirmation. (It's ` <b>single</b>' because deleting multiple files at once
  will be supported in future, and that will have a separate prompt
  override.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>--dither-hicol</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Use dithering in 15/16-bit, whatever the
  default setting is. See <b>Viewer Options</b>, for a discussion of
  benefits/drawbacks. You can also use ` <b>--dither-hicol=off</b>' to disable
  this.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>--exif-orient</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">In JPEG files, use Exif orientation tags
  (inserted by e.g. digital cameras) to correct image orientation before
  display. See <b>Viewer</b> <b>Options</b>, for details.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>--fast-recursive-update</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">When doing a recursive thumbnail update, don't
  read existing thumbnails before updating. This is pretty much obsolete as of
  xzgv 0.7, as the speed increase is now negligible. But, it may still be useful
  if you want to update a <i>huge</i> number of small directories for which few
  if any updates are needed.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>-f</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>--fullscreen</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Run fullscreen, using the entire screen for
  xzgv's window, without even any window-manager decorations (window frame,
  title bar, etc.) if possible.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>-G </b><i>val</i>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>--gamma </b><i>val</i>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">[Not supported in 0.9.] Set the gamma
  adjustment used (see <b>Gamma</b> <b>Adjustment</b>). The default is 1.0. This
  also sets the `initial value' used when resetting the gamma adjustment.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>-g </b><i>geom</i>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>--geometry </b><i>geom</i>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Set the xzgv window's geometry (position
  and/or size) to <i>geom</i>. The geometry string should be in the usual X
  format, with the extension that positions/sizes may have a ` <b>%</b>' suffix
  meaning that they are treated as percentages of the screen width/height. The
  default geometry is ` <b>92%x85%</b>'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For those unfamiliar with the way `geometry' works, here's a brief description
  of the syntax. It's ` <b>WxH</b>', or `<b>+X+Y</b>', or ` <b>WxH+X+Y</b>',
  where ` <b>W</b>' is width, `<b>H</b>' height, `<b>X</b>' the x position, and
  ` <b>Y</b>' the y position. The first form specifies only the size, the second
  only the position --- the ` <b>WxH+X+Y</b>' form specifies both.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now, the ` <b>+X+Y</b>' bit normally specifies where the top-left of the window
  is. But you can use ` <b>-</b>' instead of `<b>+</b>' for the x and/or y
  position, in which case it specifies the gap between the right/bottom of the
  window and the right/bottom of the screen. (Note, however, that any window
  frame your window manager adds to the window is disregarded in this
  calculation, so you may need to experiment somewhat to get the desired
  position.) You can also use negative numbers with both ` <b>+</b>' and `
  <b>-</b>' --- so ` <b>+-50+0</b>' puts the window partly off the left of the
  screen, and ` <b>+0--50</b>' puts it partly off the bottom of the screen ---
  but this is of questionable value. :-)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, as mentioned above, xzgv extends this syntax by allowing you to use `
  <b>%</b>' to specify percentages of the screen width/height rather than
  pixels, e.g. ` <b>50%x30%-30%-20%</b>'. It also allows you to use real numbers
  such as ` <b>12.34</b>', which can be useful with `<b>%</b>'.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>-h</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>--help</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Display a list of options and a terse
  description of what the options do.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>--image-bigness-threshold </b><i>numpix</i>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Set the boundary <i>numpix</i> after which
  images are considered `big', and are no longer rendered all-at-once (which
  gives much nicer scrolling, but is harder on memory and can be slow for big
  images) but are instead rendered piece-by-piece. Units are number of pixels in
  image (i.e. width times height), and the default is 2000000 pixels.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>--interpolate</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Interpolate between the picture's pixels when
  scaling up (see <b>Scaling</b>). This usually looks nicer, but it's rather
  slow.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>--mouse-scale-x</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If enabled, control-clicking on the viewer
  scales only the X axis. (The default is to scale only the Y axis.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>--revert-orient</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">(Note that this is normally enabled; use
  `<b>--revert-orient=off</b>' to disable it.) If <i>disabled</i>, orientation
  (flip/mirror/rotate) state is retained between pictures (see <b>Viewer
  Options</b>).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>--revert-scale</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">(Note that this is normally enabled; use
  `<b>--revert-scale=off</b>' to disable it.) If <i>disabled</i>, scaling is
  retained between pictures (see <b>Viewer Options</b>).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>--selector-width</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Set the default/initial size of the selector
  in pixels. The normal setting is 200.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>-T</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>--show-tagged</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Show names of currently-tagged files on
  exiting xzgv. (They're listed to stdout, one per line.) This can be useful
  when you want to select multiple files graphically and work on them with
  something else.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>--show-thumbnail-messages</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Show on the status bar when thumbnails are
  being read. The status bar must be enabled for these messages to be visible,
  of course. :-)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>-k</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>--skip-parent</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">For the first directory shown, skip the cursor
  past <i>..</i> (the parent dir). This can be useful when you'd like to
  immediately use space to `page' through the dir.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>-o </b><i>order</i>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>--sort-order </b><i>order</i>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Set the initial sorting order used in the
  selector. Possible settings are ` <b>name</b>', `<b>ext</b>', `<b>size</b>',
  and ` <b>date</b>' (or ` <b>time</b>'); only the first char of the setting (`
  <b>n</b>'/`<b>e</b>'/`<b>s</b>'/`<b>d</b>'/`<b>t</b>') need be given. The
  default is name order.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>--sort-timestamp-type </b><i>type</i>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Set the timestamp type to use when using
  time/date sorting order. Possible settings are `mtime' (default), `ctime', and
  `atime'; only the first char of the setting (`
  <b>m</b>'/`<b>c</b>'/`<b>a</b>') need be given.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>--statusbar</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Show a status bar below the selector; this,
  for example, says when a picture is being read.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>-t</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>--thin-rows</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Use rows a third the normal height in the
  selector. This can be very useful on lower-resolution screens, or if you're
  really interested in filenames, not thumbnails.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>-v</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>--version</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Show version number.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>--version-gtk</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Show version number of GTK+ xzgv is
  using.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>-z</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>--zoom</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Fit picture to viewer window, whatever its
  actual size (see <b>Zoom</b> <b>Mode</b>).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>-r</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>--zoom-reduce-only</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">When in zoom mode, only <i>reduce</i> pictures
  to fit; i.e. make big pictures viewable all-at-once while leaving small
  picures intact.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If started with ` <b>xzgv </b><i>files</i>', xzgv hides the file selector and
  treats the file or files as if they were the sole contents of a directory. (It
  also automatically loads the first file.) As such, you can use the Next Image
  and Previous Image commands to navigate between the images, or do Exit to
  Selector and use the selector directly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If started with ` <b>xzgv </b><i>start-dir</i>', xzgv starts up as usual, but
  with the selector starting on the directory specified (rather than the current
  directory).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Settings which are either on or off (boolean) are, as you might expect, enabled
  by using e.g. ` <b>-z</b>' or `<b>--zoom</b>'. However, there's an alternative
  long-option form for setting these, resembling how they're set in config files
  --- the syntax is ` <b>--option=</b><i>state</i>', where <i>state</i> is
  `<b>on</b>'/` <b>y</b>'/`<b>yes</b>'/`<b>1</b>' to enable the option, or `
  <b>off</b>'/` <b>n</b>'/`<b>no</b>'/`<b>0</b>' to disable it. The most useful
  thing about this is that it allows you to disable options which were
  previously enabled, by using e.g. ` <b>--zoom=off</b>'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
(Readers used to the way GNU-style long options work should note that, since
  this ` <b>on</b>'/`<b>off</b>'/etc. arg is optional, you can't use the `
  <b>--option arg</b>' form in this case; it must be ` <b>--option=arg</b>' for
  it to work.)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="A_NOTE_ON_NOTATION"><a class="selflink" href="#A_NOTE_ON_NOTATION">A
  NOTE ON NOTATION</a></h1>
Much of this manual is taken up by a description of xzgv's various commands in
  its file selector and viewer. Most of these are available both from the
  keyboard, and from popup menus. (A popup menu appears when you press `
  <b>F10</b>' or ` <b>Menu</b>', or right-click on the selector or the viewer;
  each has its own menu.) So in the manual, you will often see things rather
  like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>key</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Menu the item is in, Menu item</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Description of what the key/menu item
  does.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sometimes the key given has a ` <b>(Selector)</b>' or `<b>(Viewer)</b>' suffix;
  this is because some keypresses in xzgv are specific to the selector or the
  viewer, and won't work unless the relevant part of xzgv has the keyboard
  focus.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_FILE_SELECTOR"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_FILE_SELECTOR">THE
  FILE SELECTOR</a></h1>
Usually, on starting up xzgv, you'll want to use the file selector --- the list
  of files on the left. (The other subwindow (on the right) is the viewer.) The
  selector lets you pick files to view (among other things). It lists the
  subdirectories and picture files in the current directory, along with small
  `thumbnail' versions of the pictures if they exist.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_SELECTOR_MENU"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_SELECTOR_MENU">THE
  SELECTOR MENU</a></h1>
Almost all selector commands are available from the selector's pop-up menu,
  which appears when you right-click anywhere on the selector. (You can also
  press ` <b>F10</b>' or `<b>Menu</b>' to bring up the menu, but as there are
  keyboard shortcuts for just about everything in xzgv, this isn't often that
  useful. :-))
<div class="Pp"></div>
Usually, it doesn't matter where on the selector you right-click. However, a few
  commands on the <i>File</i> menu operate on a single file, the one selected by
  the keyboard cursor. A problem when using the mouse, you might think --- but
  when you right-click on the selector, as well as popping up the menu, xzgv
  moves this cursor to the file you right-clicked on (if any). (You can see this
  by the way a hollow box is drawn around the file.) So to use e.g.
  <i>Details</i> on the <i>File</i> menu, you need to right-click <i>on the file
  you want details on</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Both the selector and viewer have `Help' menus, most items of which refer you to
  this manual:
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>F1</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Help, Contents</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Help, Contents</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">View the manual's overall contents.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Help, The File Selector</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">View the manual's section on the file
  selector.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Help, The Viewer</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">View the manual's section on the viewer.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Help, Index</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Help, Index</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">View the manual's concept index.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Help, About</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Help, About</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Give some brief information about xzgv,
  including the version number and homepage.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Currently, the way xzgv lets you read the manual is a bit crude; it runs the `
  <b>info</b>' program (see <b>Top</b> in the <i>info-stnd</i> info file) in an
  ` <b>xterm</b>'.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXITING_XZGV"><a class="selflink" href="#EXITING_XZGV">EXITING
  XZGV</a></h1>
You can exit xzgv either by using one of two exit keypresses, or by selecting
  the appropriate option from the selector's popup menu:
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>q</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-q</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Exit xzgv</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Quit xzgv.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(There's also an exit option on the selector's <i>File</i> menu (` <b>Selector
  menu, File, Exit</b>'), as `Exit' is generally on any File menu.)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THUMBNAILS"><a class="selflink" href="#THUMBNAILS">THUMBNAILS</a></h1>
(This section is deliberately early on in the manual, as thumbnails are probably
  the most important feature of the file selector, so it's best that you know
  how to create/update them sooner rather than later.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Thumbnails are small versions of the pictures they represent, and are displayed
  by the file selector if they exist. xzgv uses xv-compatible thumbnails --- if
  you create thumbnails with xv they will work with xzgv, and vice versa. xzgv's
  thumbnails are also compatible with the Gimp, and zgv.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If no thumbnail exists for a file, a small `document' icon appears instead
  (similar to the `folder' icon used for directories).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Updating_Thumbnails"><a class="selflink" href="#Updating_Thumbnails">Updating
  Thumbnails</a></h2>
While thumbnails can be made relatively quickly, it's by no means an instant
  process. For this reason, thumbnails have to be created in advance, and are
  stored as files in their own right in a subdirectory <i>.xvpics</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
xzgv never creates/updates thumbnails without you telling it to. So, if you
  enter a directory where the picture files don't have any thumbnails, or where
  the thumbnails seem to be out of date, you should press ` <b>u</b>', or select
  <i>Update Thumbnails</i> from the selector's menu. (Even if the thumbnails
  can't be written (say, if you don't have permission to write them), the
  selector will still show the updated thumbnails until you leave the
  directory.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Alternatively, you can create/update thumbnails for the current directory and
  all subdirectories by using ` <b>Alt-u</b>' or <i>Recursive</i> <i>Update</i>.
  But be warned that a recursive update can take some time!
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>u</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Update Thumbnails</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Create thumbnails for any files which don't
  have them, and update thumbnails which are older than the corresponding file.
  While this is going on, a window appears showing how far through the process
  xzgv is.
<div class="Pp"></div>
While the update is in progress, you can abort it by clicking on the
  <i>Cancel</i> button, or pressing ` <b>Esc</b>' or `<b>Enter</b>', or by
  clicking the delete-window button (if your window manager provides one) on the
  title bar. xzgv will stop once it has finished the thumbnail it is currently
  working on (if any).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Alt-u</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Recursive Update</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Create/update thumbnails for all files in the
  current directory and all subdirectories. This can take some time, so you are
  prompted to confirm you really want to do this (see <b>Dialog Boxes</b>).
  Progress is indicated in much the same way as for a normal update, but only
  for the directory currently being updated --- the overall progress is not
  indicated, other than by the current dir being (as ever) displayed in the main
  window's title. You can abort a recursive thumbnail update in the same ways as
  for a normal update (see above).
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, xzgv behaves a little oddly when doing a recursive update, to give
  some consistency with the normal update. See <b>Thumbnail</b> <b>Issues</b>,
  for details.</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Thumbnail_Issues"><a class="selflink" href="#Thumbnail_Issues">Thumbnail
  Issues</a></h2>
Dealing with thumbnails can be `interesting' at times, and there are a few ways
  this influences things:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> xzgv doesn't read the thumbnails in a directory all at once. Instead,
  it just reads the directory contents, then starts up what is effectively a
  kind of background task to read in the thumbnails. So xzgv may not be quite as
  responsive as usual for a short time after entering a directory with many
  thumbnails (say, a few hundred) --- but on the other hand, at least it
  <i>is</i> responding. :-)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> The `background task' makes a special effort to show thumbnails for the
  files currently visible in the selector first, no matter how much you move
  around the list, but it reads them all in eventually.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> The thumbnails used in xzgv require 256 colours to display. This can be
  a problem if you're running X in 256 colours or less as, even if you're
  running an 8-bit (256 colour) server, there will almost inevitably be fewer
  colours available. Currently, xzgv just uses whatever gdk reports as the
  closest match to each individual colour used in thumbnails. This gives a
  tolerable result on 8-bit servers, assuming gdk was able to allocate a large
  number of colours; however, it gives terrible results if it couldn't, or if
  running on 4-bit or 1-bit servers. Sorry about this --- it should be fixed in
  future (either by using gdk to draw the thumbnail pixmaps, or by dithering
  them `by hand' to suit the colours available).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> Finally, when doing a recursive thumbnail update, xzgv (by default)
  reads existing thumbnails in a directory before updating any. Or rather, it
  reads thumbnails for those files currently visible in the selector. This can
  slow things down very slightly, but keeps the `look and feel' consistent with
  the normal update. (Still, you can disable this with the `
  <b>--fast-recursive-update</b>' command-line option (see <b>Invoking</b>
  <b>xzgv</b>) or equivalent config file entry (see <b>Configuring xzgv</b>).)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SELECTOR_LAYOUT_AND_RESIZING"><a class="selflink" href="#SELECTOR_LAYOUT_AND_RESIZING">SELECTOR
  LAYOUT AND RESIZING</a></h1>
The file selector is simply a list of subdirectories and filenames, along with
  any thumbnails that exist for them. The list is normally in asciibetical order
  (but you can change this; see <b>Changing the Sorting</b> <b>Order</b>). Names
  of directories are shown first, and they are shown in order at the beginning
  of the list, before all the picture files. Long filenames may not fit in the
  visible part of the file selector display; if so, there will be a horizontal
  scrollbar you can use to see the rest of the name(s) (you can use cursor
  left/right to do this from the keyboard).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The list is very often larger than can fit on the screen at once. If this is the
  case, only part is shown at a time, but you can move around the list using the
  (vertical) scrollbar, or with cursor up/down and the like.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you find the selector window to be too small vertically, and would like to
  see more files at once, you can start xzgv fullscreen by using the <i>-f</i>
  option (see <b>Options</b>), and/or use `thin rows' mode (see <b>File Selector
  Options</b>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you find the selector too small (or too big) horizontally, you can change
  this by moving the splitter line's `handle' (a small square button between the
  selector and viewer, near the bottom of the window), which changes the
  relative sizes of the selector and viewer. You can move it by dragging it with
  the mouse, or with these keys:
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>[</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move the window split left.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-[</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move the window split left more slowly.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>]</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move the window split right.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-]</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move the window split right more slowly.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>~</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Reset the window split to its default
  position.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also set the initial/default size of the selector --- in effect, the
  position of the window split --- using ` <b>--selector-width</b>' (see
  <b>Options</b>) or the config file option ` <b>selector-width</b>'.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MOVING_AROUND_THE_LIST"><a class="selflink" href="#MOVING_AROUND_THE_LIST">MOVING
  AROUND THE LIST</a></h1>
This section is mainly for those of us more inclined to the keyboard side of the
  force. :-) Mouse-happy types can freely skip it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the selector has the keyboard focus, the cursor (or in GTK+ jargon, the
  `focus row') is normally shown as a hollow box around one of the list's rows.
  This serves the following functions:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> It selects a file for view commands to operate on.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> It determines which part of the list is shown, as the part of the list
  shown onscreen always contains the cursor (unless you move around using the
  mouse).
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are several commands for moving the cursor. In summary, most `special'
  keys like the cursors do what you'd imagine they do, but in more detail:
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Cursor Up</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>k</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move up.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Cursor Down</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>j</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move down.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Page Up</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-u</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move the cursor back roughly a page.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Page Down</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-v</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move the cursor forward roughly a page.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-Home</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-a</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move the cursor to the start of the
  list.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-End</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-e</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move the cursor to the end of the list.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>g</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>'</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move the cursor to the first filename starting
  with the next key pressed, which would generally be a letter or number. Case
  is significant; ` <b>a</b>' and `<b>A</b>' are different. If no key is pressed
  within 2 seconds, the command is cancelled.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If no files start with the specified character, it moves to the first file which
  starts with a later char (in asciibetical order). If there are none for which
  this is the case, it moves to the last file --- unless there are no files
  (just directories), in which case it has no effect.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="VIEWING_A_FILE"><a class="selflink" href="#VIEWING_A_FILE">VIEWING
  A FILE</a></h1>
To view a file from the selector, you can click on it, or press ` <b>Enter</b>'
  after moving the cursor to the relevant file, or right-click on the file and
  choose `File' then `Open'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Enter</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Left-click-on-file</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, File, Open</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">View the chosen picture file, or if a
  subdirectory is chosen, make that the current directory.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DIALOG_BOXES"><a class="selflink" href="#DIALOG_BOXES">DIALOG
  BOXES</a></h1>
See <b>The Viewer</b>, for details of how the viewer works. If xzgv has a
  serious problem reading a file, it will give an error. Errors are shown in
  dialogs which appear in the middle of the screen --- they stay there until you
  click <i>Ok</i> (or press `<b>Enter</b>' or ` <b>Esc</b>').
<div class="Pp"></div>
xzgv also uses similar dialog boxes for other things:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> Getting confirmation that you want to do something. ` <b>Enter</b>' or
  ` <b>y</b>' picks `yes'; `<b>Esc</b>' or `<b>n</b>' picks no. (Again, you can
  click on the relevant button with the mouse to do the same.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> Showing progress when updating a thumbnail. This is a slightly unusual
  dialog, in that it automatically disappears when the update is complete.
  However, it does provide a <i>Cancel</i> button which you can click to abort
  the update (pressing ` <b>Enter</b>' or `<b>Esc</b>' does the same).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> Reading a directory name. Here you should type the directory name then
  click <i>Ok</i> (or press `<b>Enter</b>'), or click <i>Cancel</i> (or press `
  <b>Esc</b>') to abort. The text-input `widget' used allows a certain amount of
  editing, including these keys:
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Cursor Left</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-b</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move the cursor left. (A vertical bar shows
  the cursor position.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Cursor Right</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-f</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move the cursor right.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Home</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-a</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move the cursor to the start of the
  line.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>End</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-e</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move the cursor to the end of the line.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Backspace</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-h</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Delete char to the left of the cursor. (Note
  that ` <b>Backspace</b>' is (usually) the key above the main ` <b>Enter</b>'
  key; it is often labelled simply as an arrow.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Delete</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-d</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Delete the char the cursor is on.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also set the X selection (by selecting text with the mouse, or holding `
  <b>Shift</b>' while moving the cursor) to allow pasting text into other
  programs, and you can cut/copy/paste text in the usual ways:
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Shift-Delete</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-x</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Cut text.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-Insert</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-c</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Copy text.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Shift-Insert</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-v</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Paste text.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can paste text from (some) other programs using the latter command, too.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CLOSING_A_FILE"><a class="selflink" href="#CLOSING_A_FILE">CLOSING
  A FILE</a></h1>
Usually, when you view a file, the viewer subwindow keeps displaying it until
  you view a different file. However, if you `close' the file, the viewer stops
  displaying the file and returns to its initial state.
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-w</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, File, Close</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">`Close' the currently-viewed file, clearing
  the viewer subwindow.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILE_DETAILS"><a class="selflink" href="#FILE_DETAILS">FILE
  DETAILS</a></h1>
The listing the selector gives for a file is pretty sparse --- just the filename
  and (if the file has one) the accompanying thumbnail. While this does keep
  things simple, you sometimes want to know how much space a file takes up, when
  it was last modified, the dimensions of the image, that kind of thing. So, you
  can show details of a single file using the `file details' command:
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>:</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>;</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, File, Details</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Show various details about the file pointed to
  by the keyboard cursor. See <b>The Selector Menu</b>, for how to choose the
  file details are given for when using the mouse. (Basically, you right-click
  on the file when popping up the menu.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most of the details shown come from the OS (by using the ` <b>stat(2)</b>'
  system call), and should always be available unless you have limited
  permissions for the directory the file is in. The file dimensions
  (width/height), however, come from the file's thumbnail. If it doesn't have
  one, or if it's unreadable, or if it has one and it's readable but it doesn't
  mention the original image's width/height, then the <i>Details from
  thumbnail</i> area is greyed out.
<div class="Pp"></div>
(In explanation of the latter point --- pre-5.0 versions of zgv did not generate
  width/height comments in thumbnails, so zgv users in particular may find the
  width/height details missing. (xzgv has always been ok, though, it's just zgv
  which had this problem.) Worse yet, versions 5.0 and 5.1 generated them with
  incorrect sizes for most JPEGs. To fix either problem for a given directory,
  do ` <b>rm -fr .xvpics</b>' in that dir from a shell prompt and recreate the
  thumbnails with zgv 5.2 or later, or xzgv/xv/Gimp.)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TAGGING"><a class="selflink" href="#TAGGING">TAGGING</a></h1>
The file selector is not restricted to working on one file at a time. You can
  `tag' as many (or as few) files as you wish, and certain commands described in
  this section will act on them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Initially, all files are untagged, and the filenames usually appear in black
  (though this depends on the GTK+ theme you're using). Tagged files appear in
  red.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Tag_and_Untag_Commands"><a class="selflink" href="#Tag_and_Untag_Commands">Tag
  and Untag Commands</a></h2>
There are several ways to tag or untag files. The keyboard-based ones which work
  on individual files (also available on the <i>Tagging</i> menu) move the
  cursor down one row afterwards, to make tagging or untagging multiple files
  easier.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To tag or untag a single file with the mouse, control-click (i.e. hold down the
  control key and click) on the relevant filename or thumbnail in the selector.
  It's true that you could use <i>Tag</i> and/or <i>Untag</i> on the
  <i>Tagging</i> menu (see <b>The Selector Menu</b>, for how to choose the file
  tagged/untagged when doing it this way), but this is usually much less
  convenient than using control-click. (The menu entries for those are really
  just for completeness.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is also a command available in the viewer to tag the currently-viewed
  file. See <b>Changing Picture</b>, for details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>=</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>+</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Keypad +</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>0</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Tagging, Tag</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Tag file.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>-</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Keypad -</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>9</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Tagging, Untag</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Untag file.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Alt =</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Alt-Keypad +</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Alt-0</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Tagging, Tag All</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Tag all files.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Alt -</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Alt-Keypad -</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Alt-9</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Tagging, Untag All</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Untag all files.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Alt-o</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Tagging, Toggle All</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Toggle all tags. This inverts the tagged
  state, so that all previously tagged files become untagged, and all previously
  untagged files become tagged.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Currently there is no way to toggle a (single) file's tag state from the
  keyboard.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Moving_Between_Tagged_Files"><a class="selflink" href="#Moving_Between_Tagged_Files">Moving
  Between Tagged Files</a></h2>
These commands let you search for (move to) the next or previous tagged file (if
  any). Note that `next' and `previous' here are relative to the keyboard
  cursor's position; if you use these from the menu, be careful to right-click
  on the file you want to start the search from.
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>/</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Tagging, Next Tagged</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move to next tagged file in dir.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>?</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Tagging, Previous Tagged</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move to previous tagged file in dir.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Equivalent commands are also available in the viewer (see <b>Changing</b>
  <b>Picture</b>).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Copying/Moving_Files"><a class="selflink" href="#Copying/Moving_Files">Copying/Moving
  Files</a></h2>
You can copy or move tagged files to a directory you specify. If no files are
  tagged, xzgv copies/moves the file the cursor is currently on --- unless the
  cursor is on a subdirectory, in which case it gives an error.
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>C (Shift-c)</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, File, Copy</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Copy tagged files (or the current file) to a
  given directory. xzgv asks for the destination directory using a dialog (see
  <b>Dialog Boxes</b>) and copies the files there. If it comes to copy a file
  but there is an existing file in the dir with the same name, the file is not
  copied and nor are any of the remaining files.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>M (Shift-m)</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, File, Move</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move tagged files (or the current file)
  similarly.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RENAMING_A_FILE"><a class="selflink" href="#RENAMING_A_FILE">RENAMING
  A FILE</a></h1>
As well as copying/moving files, you can rename them:
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-n</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, File, Rename file</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Rename the current file or directory --- xzgv
  will refuse to overwrite any existing files/directories. The new name must
  remain in the current directory. (See <b>Copying/Moving Files</b>, for how to
  move a file to a different directory (albeit keeping the same name).) See
  <b>The Selector</b> <b>Menu</b>, for how to choose the file renamed when using
  the mouse. (Basically, you right-click on the file when popping up the
  menu.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
I know ` <b>Ctrl-n</b>' isn't the most mnemonic keypress possible for `rename',
  but all the good ones were taken. :-/
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DELETING_A_FILE"><a class="selflink" href="#DELETING_A_FILE">DELETING
  A FILE</a></h1>
Deleting a file is pretty straightforward:
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-d</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, File, Delete file</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Delete the file pointed to by the keyboard
  cursor (and any accompanying thumbnail). See <b>The Selector Menu</b>, for how
  to choose the file deleted when using the mouse. (Basically, you right-click
  on the file when popping up the menu.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that only one file is deleted (hence `Delete file'); there is currently no
  way to delete all tagged files.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CHANGING_DIRECTORY"><a class="selflink" href="#CHANGING_DIRECTORY">CHANGING
  DIRECTORY</a></h1>
The easiest way to change the current directory in xzgv is usually to click on a
  directory entry in the file list (or move the cursor to it and press `
  <b>Enter</b>'). Selecting the ` <b>..</b>' entry moves to the parent directory
  of the current one.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is an alternative though:
<div class="Pp"></div>
(Note that the key for this command is shift-` <b>g</b>', not `<b>g</b>'.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>G</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Directory, Change</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Go to a specified directory. xzgv asks for the
  destination directory using a dialog box which you should type the dir's name
  into (see <b>Dialog Boxes</b>), and moves to that directory if it
  exists.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RESCANNING_THE_DIRECTORY"><a class="selflink" href="#RESCANNING_THE_DIRECTORY">RESCANNING
  THE DIRECTORY</a></h1>
Normally, xzgv reads a directory once (on starting up, or when a new directory
  is selected). So if the contents of the directory are changed by another
  program, this is not automatically reflected. You can, however, explicitly
  tell xzgv to `rescan' the directory (reread the contents), which will update
  xzgv's notion of what's in it:
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-r</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Directory, Rescan</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Rescan the current directory.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CHANGING_THE_SORTING_ORDER"><a class="selflink" href="#CHANGING_THE_SORTING_ORDER">CHANGING
  THE SORTING ORDER</a></h1>
Normally, the files are listed in asciibetical order by name. However, you can
  instead have the file list sorted by size, last-modified date/time, or by
  `extension' (the file type).
<div class="Pp"></div>
(Only the order of files can be altered; directories are always listed first,
  and always in name order.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Alt-n</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Directory, Sort by Name</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Sort by name. This is the default.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Alt-e</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Directory, Sort by Extension</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Sort by extension.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Alt-s</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Directory, Sort by Size</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Sort by size. The biggest files are listed
  last.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Alt-d</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Directory, Sort by Time &amp; Date</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Sort by time/date. The newest files are listed
  last.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can set the default sort order via the command-line (see <b>Invoking</b>
  <b>xzgv</b>) or a config file (see <b>Configuring xzgv</b>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are three possible timestamps you can use for the `Time &amp; Date'
  sorting order:
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Alt-Shift-m</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Directory, Time &amp; Date Type, Modification Time
  (mtime)</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Use the last-modified time (`mtime'). This is
  the default.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Alt-Shift-c</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Directory, Time &amp; Date Type, Attribute Change Time
  (ctime)</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Use the last-attribute-change time (`ctime').
  Note that this is <i>not</i> always the time the file was created, which it's
  sometimes mistaken for; for example, moving a file with ` <b>mv</b>' will
  usually change the ctime.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Alt-Shift-a</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Directory, Time &amp; Date Type, Access Time (atime)</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Use the last-accessed time (`mtime'). The
  selector order is not automatically updated when xzgv reads files, since this
  would probably be annoying; do a manual rescan if need be.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILE_SELECTOR_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#FILE_SELECTOR_OPTIONS">FILE
  SELECTOR OPTIONS</a></h1>
Various aspects of the file selector's behaviour can be configured while xzgv is
  running, by using these toggle commands (which enable the feature if it was
  previously disabled, and vice versa).
<div class="Pp"></div>
These settings can also be altered using command-line options (see
  <b>Options</b>) and/or config file settings (see <b>Configuring</b>
  <b>xzgv</b>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Alt-a</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Options, Auto Hide</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Toggle the auto-hiding of the selector when a
  picture is viewed (off by default). This is handy for small screens/windows,
  or for old-time zgv users who just dig that groovy modal interface, er, man.
  :-)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Alt-b</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Options, Status Bar</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Toggle status bar at the bottom of the
  selector (off by default). This displays messages in certain circumstances ---
  normally, it just says when a picture is being read.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Options, Thumbnail Msgs</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Toggle reading-thumbnails messages (default is
  off), only visible if the status bar is enabled. These messages make it clear
  when all thumbnails have been read, but having something flash up every time
  you change directory is generally just annoying.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>v</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Selector menu, Options, Thin Rows</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Toggle `thin rows' mode (off by default), in
  which thumbnails are shown at a third their normal size so that many more
  files can be shown at once. (The odd keyboard shortcut for this is inherited
  from zgv's `visual' mode toggle, which had a roughly similar effect.)</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_VIEWER"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_VIEWER">THE
  VIEWER</a></h1>
Once you've selected a file to view, it's shown in the viewer (the right-hand
  part of xzgv's window). This section describes what you can do while viewing
  the picture.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Like the selector, the viewer has its own menu --- right-click anywhere on the
  viewer (or press ` <b>F10</b>' or `<b>Menu</b>') to show it --- and a similar
  help menu (see <b>The Selector Menu</b>).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXITING_THE_VIEWER"><a class="selflink" href="#EXITING_THE_VIEWER">EXITING
  THE VIEWER</a></h1>
When using the mouse to control xzgv, it doesn't matter whether the selector or
  the viewer has keyboard focus --- mouse operations transcend such petty
  boundaries. :-) But keyboard control is (of necessity) effectively modal, and
  so you need to `exit' the viewer in order to have keyboard control over the
  selector again. You also need to exit the viewer if you've enabled auto-hide
  mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Exiting the viewer is simple:
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Esc</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Tab</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Exit to Selector</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Exit the viewer. This also returns the
  selector to its former size, if it was previously `hidden'.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another way of exiting the viewer is to middle-click on it, but this mouse-only
  approach is really only of use when the selector is `hidden'.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BIG_PICTURES"><a class="selflink" href="#BIG_PICTURES">BIG
  PICTURES</a></h1>
A picture may well be too large to fit entirely in the viewer window. There are
  two main things which can help you see more of the picture at once:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> Make the xzgv window larger. You could `maximize' it with your window
  manager, or you could start xzgv with a larger window using `
  <b>--geometry</b>' or fullscreen mode (see <b>Options</b>). The fullscreen
  mode gives xzgv the maximum window size possible, but needs co-operation from
  your window manager (and alas, many are not as willing as one might like) ---
  in some cases you may even find ` <b>--geometry</b> <b>100%x100%</b>' to be
  more effective.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> Hide the selector. To do this, either use auto-hide mode (see
  <b>File</b> <b>Selector Options</b>), or hide the selector explicitly (see
  <b>Hiding the</b> <b>Selector</b>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
But of course, these are only partial solutions to the problem; there will
  inevitably always be pictures larger than your screen can show at once. In
  general, then, there are two ways to see the whole of the picture.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Scrolling"><a class="selflink" href="#Scrolling">Scrolling</a></h2>
Scrolling is the default approach to handling big pictures in xzgv. When the
  viewer is started up, the top-left of the picture is shown --- you can either
  drag the picture around with the mouse (i.e. click and hold the button down,
  then move the mouse around), or use the scrollbars, or use the cursor keys
  (and others) to move around the rest of the picture:
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Cursor Up</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>K</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move up 100 pixels. `<b>Ctrl-Cursor Up</b>'
  and ` <b>k</b>' both move up 10 pixels.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Cursor Down</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>J</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move down 100 pixels. `<b>Ctrl-Cursor
  Down</b>' and ` <b>j</b>' both move down 10 pixels.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Cursor Left</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>H</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move left 100 pixels. `<b>Ctrl-Cursor
  Left</b>' and ` <b>h</b>' both move left 10 pixels.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Cursor Right</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>L</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move right 100 pixels. `<b>Ctrl-Cursor
  Right</b>' and ` <b>l</b>' both move right 10 pixels.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Page Up</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Shift-Cursor Up</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-u</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move up (nearly) the window height. (It moves
  by 90% of the height.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Page Down</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Shift-Cursor Down</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-v</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move down (nearly) the window height.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>-</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Shift-Cursor Left</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move left (nearly) a window-length. (It moves
  by 90% of it.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>=</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Shift-Cursor Right</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move right (nearly) a window-length.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Home</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-a</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move to the top-left of the picture.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>End</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-e</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move to the bottom-right of the picture.</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Zoom_Mode"><a class="selflink" href="#Zoom_Mode">Zoom
  Mode</a></h2>
An alternative way of viewing the whole picture, one which lets you see the
  picture onscreen all at once no matter how big (or small) it is, is zoom mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Zoom mode's name derives from the idea of `zooming' a small file up to fit the
  window. But in reality, it is more often used to reduce a large file to fit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Zoom mode is not the default, and has to be enabled. Once enabled, it stays on
  until you turn it off again (or until you enable scaling, or select
  <i>Normal</i> (see <b>Scaling</b>)).
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>z</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Options, Zoom (fit to window)</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Toggle zoom mode.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Alt-r</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Options, When Zooming Reduce Only</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">When in zoom mode, only <i>reduce</i> pictures
  to fit. This can be useful when going through a lot of unpredictably-sized
  pictures, as it means that you can see all of a big picture easily without
  also meaning that tiny little icons assume a scale of Biblical proportions.
  :-)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The way zoom mode reduces a file to fit the window is (relatively) quick but
  harsh, and may make the picture look a bit ugly. In future there may be a
  smoothing option like zgv's <i>vkludge</i>, but for now I'm afraid the fairly
  crude resize is all that's available.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is in fact an alternative to zoom mode, as you can scale down an image
  instead. This is generally only useful for very large images, however; zoom
  mode tends to be the Right Thing for the most part.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SCALING"><a class="selflink" href="#SCALING">SCALING</a></h1>
You can scale a picture --- this makes it appear larger (or smaller) onscreen.
  xzgv acts much as if the scaled picture were the real picture; for example,
  the cursor keys scroll around in steps of 100 scaled pixels, even if this
  means moving a fraction of a pixel (or many pixels) in the original picture
  (and similarly for movement with the mouse).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The main limitation of scaling (other than how much it slows things down :-), at
  least when scaling up) is that you can only scale by integer values, so you
  can only make each pixel in the image twice as wide/high, or three times as
  wide/high, or four times, and so on.
<div class="Pp"></div>
(It may seem odd saying e.g. `twice as wide/high' rather than `twice the size',
  but technically `twice the size' would be referring to scaling up the width
  (and height) by about 1.414...)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally, xzgv does no scaling, which could be considered a ratio of 1:1.
  Scaling up increases that ratio. How it is increased depends on which
  option/key you use:
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>d</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Scaling, Double Scaling</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Increase the ratio by doubling it --- this
  leads to ratios of 2:1, 4:1, 8:1...</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>s</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Scaling, Add 1 to Scaling</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Increase the ratio by adding one --- leads to
  ratios of 2:1, 3:1, 4:1...</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are similar commands to decrease the ratio:
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>D (Shift-d)</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Scaling, Halve Scaling</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Decrease the ratio by halving it.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>S (Shift-s)</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Scaling, Sub 1 from Scaling</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Decrease the ratio by subtracting one.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Usually the double/halve scalings are more useful.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that you can also double/halve the scaling by using shift-left-click on the
  viewer to double, and shift-right-click to halve. This still changes scale
  `around' the middle of the window though (rather than around the point clicked
  on, as you might expect), which is a little strange and may possibly be
  changed in future.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you scale `below' 1:1, the above commands lead to ratios of (e.g.) 1:2,
  1:4, 1:8, etc. --- that is, the ratios work the same way, but the other way
  around. This gives you an increasingly small image.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The scaling ratio is never decreased below 1:32. It is also never increased
  beyond the point where the overall image size would exceed 32767x32767 ---
  this limit is due to the combination of X's limit on window sizes, and the
  implementation used by xzgv for scaling.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One problem with scaling up, given the way it's currently implemented, is that
  it's not well-suited to dithered display --- so if you're running on an 8-bit
  server, dragging the image around slowly when using scaling (especially
  scaling with interpolation) may result in some nasty, streaky,
  undithered-looking parts of the picture. :-(
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can undo the effect of scaling (up or down) at any time:
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>n</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Scaling, Normal</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Resume `normal' display --- disables scaling
  mode, and also zoom mode.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally, scaling up works by simply making the pixels into larger and larger
  squares (in effect), which remain the same colour. However, you can enable a
  feature called `interpolation' which smoothly graduates the colour change
  between the top-left corners of each pixel. This is <i>very</i> slow, but
  looks nice.
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>i</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Options, Interpolate when Scaling</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Toggle interpolation in scaling mode.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(If you like the appearance of scaling with interpolation, you may also be
  interested in a program I wrote called <i>pnminterp</i>, which can scale up a
  PGM or PPM file while applying this effect. These days it's part of the netpbm
  package.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Scaling down, however, is implemented a bit like a special-case zoom mode, and
  currently there are no ways of making that look nicer. :-/
<div class="Pp"></div>
xzgv normally `reverts' scaling (returning the scale to 1:1) back to normal when
  you view a new picture. However, it's possible to disable this behaviour (see
  <b>Viewer Options</b>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is also support for an alternative form of scaling --- decoupled, or
  axis-specific, scaling. When you scale in this way, only one axis of the image
  is scaled at once. For example, you might choose to effectively double the
  height of an image (with the width left unchanged). Indeed, this sort of
  scaling is useful for temporarily correcting pictures intended for display
  using pixels twice as wide or high as normal.
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>x</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Scaling, X Only, Double Scaling</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Increase the (x axis) ratio by doubling
  it.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>X (Shift-x)</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Scaling, X Only, Halve Scaling</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Decrease the (x axis) ratio by halving
  it.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Alt-x</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Scaling, X Only, Add 1 to Scaling</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Increase the (x axis) ratio by adding
  one.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Alt-Shift-x</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Scaling, X Only, Sub 1 from Scaling</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Decrease the (x axis) ratio by subtracting
  one.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>y</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Scaling, Y Only, Double Scaling</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Increase the (y axis) ratio by doubling
  it.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Y (Shift-y)</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Scaling, Y Only, Halve Scaling</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Decrease the (y axis) ratio by halving
  it.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Alt-y</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Scaling, Y Only, Add 1 to Scaling</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Increase the (y axis) ratio by adding
  one.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Alt-Shift-y</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Scaling, Y Only, Sub 1 from Scaling</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Decrease the (y axis) ratio by subtracting
  one.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are also mouse shortcuts for scaling up/down a single axis;
  control-left-click scales up, and control-right-click scales down. By default
  this acts on the y axis, but the active axis can be toggled with `
  <b>Alt-c</b>', or by toggling the ` <b>Ctl+Click Scales X Axis</b>' option
  (see <b>Viewer Options</b>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Interpolation is not currently supported in situations where the x scaling does
  not match the y scaling.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MIRROR_AND_ROTATE"><a class="selflink" href="#MIRROR_AND_ROTATE">MIRROR
  AND ROTATE</a></h1>
Sometimes when viewing a picture you will want to flip it horizontally or
  vertically, or rotate it:
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>m</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Orientation, Mirror (horiz)</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">`Mirror' the picture (flip it
  horizontally).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>f</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Orientation, Flip (vert)</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">`Flip' the picture (flip it vertically).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>r</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Orientation, Rotate Right</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Rotate the picture 90 degrees clockwise.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>R (Shift-r)</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Orientation, Rotate Left</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Rotate the picture 90 degrees anti-clockwise.
  (Any US readers surprised and/or annoyed by my not saying `counter-clockwise'
  will realise why the menus say rotate right/left. :-))</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>N (Shift-n)</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Orientation, Normal</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Restore the picture orientation to normal.
  This undoes the effect of any mirrors, flips, and/or rotations.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
xzgv normally `reverts' the picture orientation (the way the picture has been
  transformed by mirror/flip/rotate) back to normal when you view a new picture.
  However, it's possible to disable this (see <b>Viewer</b> <b>Options</b>), so
  that any new pictures are mirrored, flipped, and/or rotated in the same way.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BRIGHTNESS_AND_CONTRAST"><a class="selflink" href="#BRIGHTNESS_AND_CONTRAST">BRIGHTNESS
  AND CONTRAST</a></h1>
[Brightness and contrast changing is not supported in xzgv 0.9.] xzgv provides
  support for changing brightness and contrast, though given the way it has to
  redraw the image to do so, it can be a little slow.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Currently there is no way to do this with the mouse; this should be fixed soon.
<div class="Pp"></div>

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Reset contrast and brightness to normal.
  (`<b>*</b>' is also supported, for hysterical raisins.) Note that this
  deliberately <i>does not</i> affect the gamma adjustment.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any contrast change is applied before any brightness change, and any gamma
  adjustment is applied before both.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GAMMA_ADJUSTMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#GAMMA_ADJUSTMENT">GAMMA
  ADJUSTMENT</a></h1>
[Gamma is not supported in xzgv 0.9.] Ah yes, gamma. What fun. The basic problem
  is this --- differing displays have differing intensity response curves.
  ``This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad
  move.'' :-)
<div class="Pp"></div>
It means that you need some way of adjusting how brightly you display the
  picture to compensate. But since we're dealing with response curves, this
  isn't just a matter of changing the brightness in a linear fashion.
<div class="Pp"></div>
That doesn't seem so hard to deal with, right? All you need is to get the gamma
  (a number which specifies how much the curve bends) for the image, and for the
  screen, divide one by the other and adjust as appropriate. Joy.
<div class="Pp"></div>
But, given that the problem has existed since we started displaying more than
  eight colours, you won't be surprised to find that it's already been fixed.
  And the fixes all tend to clash, and everybody has a different notion of how
  to fix it. The usual `fix' is to assume that whoever made the image made it
  with a gamma matching the gamma of your display, so you can just stuff the
  bits right on the screen. Since this is easy, it's the most widespread
  approach. But it's a bit stupid, so not everyone does it. Combine that with
  the lack of gamma specification in most image formats, and the often-bogus
  values specified by people in those that do, and hey presto --- the image
  gamma could be just about anything. And the screen's gamma also tends not to
  be easily determined.
<div class="Pp"></div>
So how on earth do you deal with something like <i>that</i> in a remotely sane
  fashion?
<div class="Pp"></div>
The answer chosen in xzgv is to just live with the fact that the probability of
  automatically obtaining correct values for both the screen and image gamma is
  basically zero. Once you accept that, the sensible thing to do is to make it
  <i>very</i> easy and fast to change gamma adjustment to commonly-required
  values. So here's how to do it:
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>1</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Set gamma adjustment to 1.0, i.e. no
  adjustment. This is the default setting.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>2</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Set gamma adjustment to 2.2. This is useful
  for viewing linear-gamma files (one classic example being raytracer output) on
  an average PC monitor.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>3</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Set gamma adjustment to 1 divided by 2.2, i.e.
  roughly 0.45. This is useful for the reverse --- viewing
  average-PC-monitor-gamma files on a linear-gamma display. Historically I
  believe the classic example would have been viewing PC files on a Mac, but I
  don't know how true that is these days.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>4</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Set gamma adjustment to its initial value, as
  specified by a ` <b>--gamma</b>' command-line option (see <b>Options</b>) or
  equivalent config file setting (see <b>Configuring xzgv</b>). The default
  value used if none was specified is 1.0.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A brief clarification is probably in order. The gamma adjustment value which you
  set in xzgv is actually inverted from (i.e. one divided by) the true
  adjustment value used. This is (believe it or not :-)) intended to avoid
  confusion by reflecting the fact that <i>screen</i> gamma is the one most
  widely considered/well known.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also tweak the adjustment more precisely, in a similar way to
  brightness/contrast:
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Alt-,</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Decrease gamma adjustment (divide it by
  1.05).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Alt-.</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Increase gamma adjustment (multiply it by
  1.05).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that ` <b>:</b>', and the other keys which reset the brightness/contrast,
  deliberately avoid resetting the gamma adjustment.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As with brightness/contrast, there is currently no way to adjust gamma with the

  likely to still be the faster method.)

It's possible to go directly to the previous or next file (or tagged file) in
  the directory, or to tag a file, without having to pick the file from the file
  selector by hand. These commands are particularly useful when using xzgv from
  the keyboard, but there's also a notable mouse shortcut for moving to the next
  image.
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Space</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Next Image</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move to next file in dir, and view it. You can
  also click on the picture/viewer to do this. (If you find this interferes with
  dragging the picture around (though it shouldn't), or just don't like it, it
  can be disabled (see <b>Config Variables</b>).)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>b</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>

  THE SELECTOR</a></h1>
When running on small screens, or in a small window, it can get a bit annoying
  to lose viewer space by having the selector constantly displayed when you
  don't actually need it. The usual solution to this problem is to enable
  auto-hide mode. But what if some pictures you're viewing are small and some
  large? It can sometimes be nearly as annoying having the selector hidden to
  `make room for' a small picture which didn't need it. So for that reason, or
  perhaps if you just don't like auto-hide mode :-), you may prefer to leave
  auto-hide off and explicitly hide the selector when necessary:
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Z (shift-z)</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Window, Hide Selector</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Hide the selector. (This is actually a toggle,
  of sorts; `hide selector' when it's already hidden unhides it.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also hide or unhide the selector by middle-clicking on the viewer.

Generally it's easy enough to use your window manager to change windows etc.,
  but when running fullscreen this can sometimes be a little problematic. For
  this reason, xzgv has built-in support for `iconifying' itself:
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Ctrl-z</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Window, Minimize</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Minimize the xzgv window.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="VIEWER_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#VIEWER_OPTIONS">VIEWER
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
As with the selector, various options can be disabled/enabled which relate to
  the viewer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
These settings can also be altered using command-line options (see
  <b>Options</b>) and/or config file settings (see <b>Configuring</b>
  <b>xzgv</b>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>z</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Options, Zoom (fit to window)</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Toggle zoom mode, discussed in more detail
  elsewhere (see <b>Zoom Mode</b>).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Alt-r</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Options, When Zooming Reduce Only</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Toggle reduce-only in zoom mode, also covered
  elsewhere (see <b>Zoom</b> <b>Mode</b>).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>i</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Options, Interpolate when Scaling</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Toggle interpolation when a picture is being
  scaled-up. Again, this has already been mentioned (see <b>Scaling</b>).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Alt-c</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Options, Ctl+Click Scales X Axis</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Toggle the axis scaled when you control-click
  (or control-right-click) on the image. The default is to scale the y
  axis.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>F (shift-f)</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Options, Dither in 15 &amp; 16-bit</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Toggle dithering in 15/16-bit modes. This
  increases the apparent colour depth making gradations look much better, but
  it's slower than undithered rendering, and can (in 16-bit) slightly distort a
  picture's colour balance. (The ` <b>F</b>' key was chosen for this as the
  dither toggle is functionally similar to zgv's `fakecols' toggle.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Options, Revert Scaling For New Pic</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Normally xzgv returns the scaling back down to
  1 (normal) when a new picture is selected. By disabling this, you can retain
  scaling across picture selection. (There is currently no keyboard shortcut for
  this fairly-seldom-changed option --- to toggle it from the keyboard, you
  should use the popup menu (press ` <b>F10</b>'), and select the menu
  item.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Options, Revert Orient. For New Pic</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Similarly, xzgv returns to the picture's true
  orientation (not mirrored, rotated, etc.) on selecting a new picture.
  Disabling this option means that any mirrors/flips/rotates applied persist
  across multiple images. (No keyboard shortcut --- see above.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
` <b>Viewer menu, Options, Use Exif Orientation</b>'
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Toggle support for Exif orientation. Devices
  which create JPEG files in the Exif format (e.g. many digital cameras) may add
  an orientation tag to the file, which says how the camera was being held when
  the picture was taken. When this tag is present, xzgv can adjust the image to
  compensate for a camera being held on its side. (This isn't done by default as
  it misrepresents the true image, which could be confusing if you don't know
  why it's happening.) Enabling this option may be useful if you take pictures
  with your camera on its side, but don't want to have to rotate the pictures
  before being able to view them properly. Of course, for this to work your
  camera has to be inserting the orientation tag in the first place --- but it
  can't hurt to try it and see. (No keyboard shortcut --- see above.)</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILE_FORMATS"><a class="selflink" href="#FILE_FORMATS">FILE
  FORMATS</a></h1>
Picture files are stored in a variety of different forms, or `file formats'.
  xzgv, via gdk, supports many.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILE_TYPE_IDENTIFICATION"><a class="selflink" href="#FILE_TYPE_IDENTIFICATION">FILE
  TYPE IDENTIFICATION</a></h1>
The format a file is in is identified by its content. The file-reading code
  relies on libgdk to determine the file type and read the file correctly;
  generally this uses the format's `magic number' to determine file type ---
  e.g. a JPEG/JFIF file starts with the (hex) bytes ` <b>FF</b> <b>D8</b>'. So
  if you start xzgv with <i>xzgv foo</i>, and foo is in a supported format (such
  as JPEG), the format will be figured out and the file loaded even though the
  `extension' is absent.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURING_XZGV"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURING_XZGV">CONFIGURING
  XZGV</a></h1>
Many aspects of the way xzgv works can be modified by using a configuration
  file.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIG_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIG_FILES">CONFIG
  FILES</a></h1>
A configuration file lets you alter aspects of xzgv's behaviour. xzgv supports
  two possible config files --- a system-wide one, <i>/etc/xzgv.conf</i>; and
  one for each user in their home directory, <i>$HOME/.xzgvrc</i>. Both are
  optional. If <i>$HOME/.xzgvrc</i> exists, it is used <i>instead of</i>
  <i>/etc/xzgv.conf</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before describing the format of config files, it may help to give an example
  file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
# Sample xzgv config file
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
# Comment lines begin with `#' and are ignored,
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
# as are blank lines.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
# make pics fit window
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
zoom on
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
# hog the screen :-)
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
fullscreen on
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is a line-based format. Each line (or rather, each line which is not a
  comment line and is not blank) assigns a value to a single predefined
  `variable'. xzgv has many such variables it lets you modify in this way. For
  example, the <i>fullscreen</i> option above controls whether or not xzgv tries
  to use the whole screen for its window. If it is given the value `
  <b>on</b>'/` <b>y</b>'/`<b>yes</b>'/`<b>1</b>' it does; if `
  <b>off</b>'/`<b>n</b>'/` <b>no</b>'/`<b>0</b>', it doesn't. Most variables are
  of this yes-or-no `boolean' type.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since the variables set in a config file have a direct effect on how xzgv works,
  it can be easier to simply call them `settings'. Indeed, such terminology is
  used on occasion in this documentation.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIG_VARIABLE_TYPES"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIG_VARIABLE_TYPES">CONFIG
  VARIABLE TYPES</a></h1>
There are various types of variable:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> Boolean. These are on-or-off, yes-or-no variables. Most of xzgv's
  config file variables are of this type.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> Integer (currently unused). These are whole numbers. The meaning of the
  number depends on what the variable is used for.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> Real (floating-point). This can be a whole number or a decimal
  fraction. Only the <i>gamma</i> variable is of this type.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> Geometry. This window size-and/or-position specification format is only
  used for the ` <b>geometry</b>' setting. See <b>Options</b>, for a description
  of how this type works.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIG_VARIABLES"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIG_VARIABLES">CONFIG
  VARIABLES</a></h1>
Currently, most configuration variables (settings) in xzgv can also be set by
  command-line options; indeed, the name of the setting in all such cases is
  <i>identical</i> to that for the long version of the option (e.g. `
  <b>fullscreen</b>', ` <b>auto-hide</b>'). As such, they're documented in the
  section which discusses command-line options and the like (see
  <b>Options</b>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, there are some settings only available in the config file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>click-for-next</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This is enabled by default, allowing you to
  click on the viewer to skip to the next image. If disabled, clicking on the
  viewer does nothing.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="selflink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>

Previously, this section concentrated on xv; that may have made sense when I
  originally wrote it, and still makes a certain limited amount of sense for
  zgv, but for xzgv it was looking increasingly dated. And so here I am writing
  an update. :-)
<div class="Pp"></div>
I originally wrote xzgv as I simply wasn't happy with the viewers for X that I
  was aware of at the time (mid-1999). At the time of writing (late 2000), other
  key things about xzgv are becoming apparent, partly through responses I've
  been getting to it:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>o</b> It's `fast'. No, it doesn't do any particular operation faster than
  other viewers as far as I know (well, maybe thumbnail updates :-)); rather,
  the interface tries not to get in your way. Click on a filename, and the
  picture appears. No multiplicity of toolbars or windows, it's just there.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>o</b> As with zgv, it tries to do one thing well, viewing pictures. It isn't
  perfect in this regard, I'll admit, but at least it stays well clear of
  picture editing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>o</b> It's, er, quite a lot like zgv. Some of us old fogies like this. :-)
<div class="Pp"></div>
I won't pretend xzgv is The Ultimate Viewer For Everyone. Some people will
  prefer other approaches, or just simply prefer other viewers. (Some people may
  even still use xv, ghod forbid.) There are a few viewers which you may like to
  try if you don't think much of xzgv:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>o</b> gqview. This seems to be well-regarded. I find it a bit gimmicky and
  kitchen-sink-ish; not quite as `pure' or focused as xzgv, IMHO. I think more
  people use it than xzgv though.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>o</b> xli. I'm not sure if this is maintained these days, but it's not too
  bad a viewer. No thumbnails or file selector though. (These days I mostly use
  this for setting the root window pixmap, something I <i>don't</i> think
  belongs in a viewer, but which xli does happen to be quite good at.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>o</b> qiv. If I read between the lines correctly, this is essentially a
  modern replacement for xli.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>o</b> gtksee. I've not tried this, but I think the idea is that it's an
  ACDSee clone, and there seem to be an awful lot of people who want a clone of
  that. Which is their problem. :^)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>o</b> Electric Eyes. To be honest, I think this has been outclassed by other
  viewers these days, which shows how far we've come.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Ah, you say, what of xv? Well, we've <i>emphatically</i> reached the point where
  no-one need use xv any more. Anyone using xv these days really should drop
  that pile of ill-conceived non-Free crap and use one of the better viewers now
  available. It's that simple.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WHY_NO_IMAGE-EDITING_CAPABILITIES?"><a class="selflink" href="#WHY_NO_IMAGE-EDITING_CAPABILITIES?">WHY
  NO IMAGE-EDITING CAPABILITIES?</a></h1>
It's a fscking <i>viewer</i>, dammit. If you want xv you know where to find it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
(OTOH, if you want a <i>decent</i> image editor, use the Gimp.)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WHY_A_TEXINFO_MANUAL?"><a class="selflink" href="#WHY_A_TEXINFO_MANUAL?">WHY
  A TEXINFO MANUAL?</a></h1>
For years, I maintained a conventional `man page' for zgv (which xzgv was
  loosely based on). But over time, I realised just how impossibly confusing the
  zgv man page had become.
<div class="Pp"></div>
So I wanted to rewrite zgv's documentation in a more sensible way, in some other
  format than a man page. I wanted an established, well-supported format with
  structure and cross-referencing. I felt this made it a choice between HTML and
  texinfo. HTML seemed to me to be a moving target like no other, and not as
  well supported on text-only terminals as Info (and thus texinfo). (This latter
  point is admittedly not too relevant as far as xzgv is concerned.) When I
  noticed that a converter existed to convert texinfo to HTML in any case, the
  case was closed. xzgv's documentation was then based on zgv's --- the
  documentation is probably more similar than the programs are. :-)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Don't get me wrong --- I like man pages. And even with the excellent Texinfo
  documentation and Emacs' very helpful Texinfo mode, writing texinfo is hardly
  easy. (Without Texinfo mode's node- and menu-update commands, I personally
  would find it near-impossible!) But big man pages just aren't that good for
  reference, and this is made worse by the relative lack of structure.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WHY_ONE-SPACE_SENTENCE_ENDS?"><a class="selflink" href="#WHY_ONE-SPACE_SENTENCE_ENDS?">WHY
  ONE-SPACE SENTENCE ENDS?</a></h1>
The conventional way to write texinfo is to follow each sentence with two spaces
  after the dot (or whatever ends the sentence). Many people normally write this
  way in a non-texinfo context too. But a sizeable proportion of people normally
  write text with only one space after the dot --- and I'm one of them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Texinfo documentation gives the impression that two-space <i>must</i> be
  used; it says ``it is important to put two spaces at the end of sentences in
  Texinfo documents.'' But the only circumstance in which spacing from the
  texinfo file is preserved at all (in any sense other than `there is a space
  here') is when the texinfo is converted to Info format. So, in fact, the
  decision to use two-space depends on how the author wants Info output to
  appear --- this is a subjective decision which should be <i>entirely down to
  the preference of the author</i>, despite the Texinfo documentation's attempt
  to make two-space sound like an objective you-must-do-this kind of thing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You might wonder what the problem with using one-space is, then. Well,
  `makeinfo' has to reformat paragraphs, and whenever it needs to insert space
  at (what appears to it to be) the end of a sentence, it inserts two spaces.
  This behaviour cannot be altered, unlike in Emacs (
  <i>sentence-end-double-space</i>; see <b>Fill Commands</b> in the <i>emacs</i>
  info file) and GNU fmt ( <i>-u</i>; see <b>fmt</b> <b>invocation</b> in the
  <i>textutils</i> info file). Also, attempting to `fix' the output Info with
  sed doesn't work properly because the `tags' used to find nodes quickly are
  then incorrect. These could of course also be fixed, but this would involve a
  lot more work than a simple sed invocation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
So realistically, anyone who writes texinfo with one-space has to put up with
  the occasional two-space sentence end being inserted into their text --- worse
  still, the current `makeinfo' formatting algorithm seems to insert two spaces
  even after abbreviations (such as `e.g.' and `etc.'), which breaks even
  two-space texinfo. (This is particularly ironic, by the way, since two-space
  partisans' main argument in favour of the practice is often the way it makes
  it possible to tell the difference between abbreviations and the end of a
  sentence.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
One last point may be worth noting; I am not the first person to write texinfo
  files using one-space. At the time of writing, it is used in the texinfo
  documentation for BFD, gdbm, GTK/GDK, (Linux) IPC, and viper, and I expect
  there are instances I'm not aware of.

All (non-trivial) programs have bugs. Anyone who denies this...
<div class="Pp"></div>

<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> is wrong. ;-)
<div class="Pp"></div>
It follows that xzgv, like everything else, always has some bugs. Usually these
  are not too serious, or I'd have fixed them before releasing xzgv. But either
  way, bugs and other problems with xzgv are noted here.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="KNOWN_BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#KNOWN_BUGS">KNOWN
  BUGS</a></h1>
<b>-</b> In zoom mode, it copes with resizing the window as a whole, but
  <i>doesn't</i> when you change the size of the pane (apart from when
  hiding/showing selector or resizing from keyboard, but that's only 'cos I
  kludged it :-)).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> When scaling up and dithering, you end up with a crappy-looking picture
  if you drag the picture around slowly (since each exposed bit is dithered
  independently, with no regard given to matching up to any previous
  error-diffusion).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> Scaling up is slow. Not sure if I can do much about this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> Using an alignment widget to centre the viewer window results in some
  annoying `bounce' in certain resizing situations etc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> Thumbnails don't look so great in palette-based (e.g. 8-bit) modes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> When dragging an image around, if you quickly move the mouse pointer
  over from the image area to the selector area, the image seems to `jump' a
  little. I think this may have something to do with the paned window's
  window-splitting bit, but I'm not sure. Also, it jumps when moving across
  scrollbar sliders and the paned window splitter handle.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> It doesn't apply any tranparency mask. The practical result of this
  seems to be purple transparent bits in thumbnails and scaled-up images, and
  black transparent bits elsewhere. This doesn't affect PNG files, though.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> If a GIF file is corrupted in such a way that the decompressed image
  has a larger number of pixels in it, the extra pixels will be ignored and no
  error or warning will be generated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> If you look up `joe code' in a dictionary, right next to ``see zgv'' it
  now says ``but for <i>really</i> in-depth insight into the joe code nature,
  see xzgv''. :-)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SUBOPTIMAL_FEATURES"><a class="selflink" href="#SUBOPTIMAL_FEATURES">SUBOPTIMAL
  FEATURES</a></h1>
<b>-</b> Thumbnails are given an accurate width/height `IMGINFO' comment, but
  are always claimed to be &quot;RGB&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-</b> xzgv <i>doesn't</i> duplicate zgv's behaviour of generating thumbnails
  under <i>~/.xvpics/_foo_bar_baz</i> if it can't generate them in
  <i>/foo/bar/baz/.xvpics</i>. I doubt anything else supported it, and it
  complicated lots of things unnecessarily. This isn't particularly suboptimal,
  but as an incompatibility with zgv it merits mention.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RESTRICTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#RESTRICTIONS">RESTRICTIONS</a></h1>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="REPORTING_BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#REPORTING_BUGS">REPORTING
  BUGS</a></h1>
If you find xzgv does something wrong, which you suspect might be a fault of
  some sort (a bug) in the program, it is best to report it as I may not be
  aware of the problem. (But first, check it is not a `known bug'. See <b>Known
  Bugs</b>. It is not usually helpful to report a bug I already know about.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is important to include as much detail in a bug report as you can. Here are
  some details you should include:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>o</b> The version of xzgv you are running. ` <b>xzgv --version</b>' reports
  this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>o</b> The versions of GTK+ you are using. ` <b>xzgv --version-gtk</b>'
  reports the GTK+ version being used by xzgv.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>o</b> The bitdepth your X server is running in (common depths are 8-bit (256
  colours), 15-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit, and 32-bit). If you don't know what depth
  you're running in, try ` <b>xdpyinfo|grep depth</b>'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>o</b> A description of the bug --- what effects it has, the circumstances it
  occurs in, and so on. Does it only happen for certain types of file? Only when
  in 8-bit modes? Only when dithering is enabled? Even `irrelevant' details can
  sometimes be useful.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>o</b> Finally, if you are a programmer and believe you have managed to fix
  the bug yourself, patches are gratefully accepted. :-) You should generate the
  patch using ` <b>diff -c</b>' or (preferably) `<b>diff -u</b>'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
So, if you think you've found a bug in xzgv, report it by emailing me at
  &lt;rrt@sc3d.org&gt;.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="REPORTING_DOCUMENTATION_BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#REPORTING_DOCUMENTATION_BUGS">REPORTING

Bugs in the documentation can sometimes cause as much trouble as bugs in the
  program; if you notice a problem in the documentation, it's a good idea to
  report it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For reports of documentation bugs, you should include these details:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>o</b> The version of xzgv the documentation is for.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>o</b> If it is a problem in one specific section of the documentation,
  specify which part it is (by this I mean the heading it comes under;
  texinfophiles should read this as `the node name' :-)).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>o</b> The format of the documentation you saw the problem in (e.g. info, man
  page, HTML).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>o</b> A description of the problem.
