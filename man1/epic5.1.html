<p>EPIC5(1) BSD General Commands Manual EPIC5(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
epic5 &acirc; Internet Relay Chat client for UNIX like
systems</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
epic5 [-a] [-b] [-B] [-c chan] [-d] [-f] [-F] [-h] [-H
hostname] [-l filename] [-L filename] [-n nickname] [-o]
[-O] [-p port] [-q] [-s] [-S] [-v] [-x] [-z username]
[nickname] <br>
[server description list]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The EPIC5 program is a unix-based character oriented user
agent (&rsquo;client&rsquo;) to Internet Relay Chat. It is a
fully functional ircII client with many useful extensions.
This version <br>
works with modern irc2 server networks as of early 2006.
Support for non-irc2 networks (such as OPN or MS Comic Chat)
is hit-and-miss.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a Append the [server description list] to the end of the
hardcoded default server list, rather than replacing it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Operate in so called
&acirc;bot mode.&acirc; This also turns on the [-d] option.
EPIC5 will fork(2) immediately and the parent process will
exit, returning you to your shell. This was <br>
more useful before GNU screen and tmux, when logging out
killed your processes. It&rsquo;s a better idea to just run
your bot as a foreground client in another window. Some IRC
<br>
networks limit the number of connections from an IP address
to discourage bots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c chan <br>
Join chan the first time you successfully connect to a
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Operate in &acirc;dumb
mode.&acirc; This is an alternate interface that is not
full-screen. Input is read from stdin, and output is written
to stdout. This interface is useful for <br>
screen readers and bots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display a moderately concise
help message and exit immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H hostname <br>
Use the IP address for hostname as your &acirc;local&acirc;
IP address. This is for people with vhosts. Please note, the
client doesn&rsquo;t tell the irc server what hostname to
appear as, <br>
the server decides that. Usually it is the official hostname
of your IP address. This option overrides the IRCHOST
environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l filename,[filename] <br>
Use the specified filename(s) as the startup file. The
startup file is loaded the first time you successfully
connect to a server, unless you specify the [-B] option.
This <br>
overrides the EPICRC environment variable. If this option is
not specified, and the EPICRC environment variable is not
set, then ~/.epicrc is the default startup file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n nickname <br>
Use the specified nickname as the default nickname whenever
you connect to an irc server. This option overrides the
IRCNICK environment variable. This option can be over&acirc;
<br>
ridden if you specify nickname argument in the command line
(see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
Use the specified port as the default port for new server
connections. The default port is usually 6667. Make sure
that the servers you want to connect to are listening on
<br>
this port before you try to connect there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Suppress the loading of any
file when you first establish a connection to an irc
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Do not connect to a server
after reading the startup script. Instead, present the
server list and advise the user to connect to a server
manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S The EPIC5 program is being
run as a shell script. You must make this look like
#/path/to/epic -S other args.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Output version identification
(VID) information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x This undocumented feature
turns on all of the XDEBUG flags. Refer to the help files
for XDEBUG if you want to know what happens if you use
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z username <br>
Use the specified username when negotiating a connection to
a new irc server. This overrides the IRCUSER environment
variable. If this option is not specified, then the <br>
user name specified in /etc/passwd for your user is used.
This feature was formerly undocumented, but because of
identd(8) this option isn&rsquo;t as useful as it once was.
If <br>
you are a sysadmin, please install identd, and then this
flag will provide no value to your users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nickname <br>
The first bare word found is taken as the default nickname
to use. This overrides all other options, including the -n
option and the IRCNICK environment variable. If all <br>
else fails, then the client uses your login name as the
default nickname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server,[server] <br>
After the nickname, a list of one or more server
specifications can be listed. Unless you specify the -a
option, this will replace your default server list! The -a
option <br>
forces any servers listed here to be appended to the default
server list. The format for server specifications is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hostname:port:password:nick</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any item can be omitted by
leaving the field blank, and any trailing colons can also be
omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DETAILED DESCRIPTION <br>
The Screen: <br>
The screen is split into two parts, separated by an
inverse-video status line (if supported). The upper (larger)
part of the screen displays responses from the ircd(8)
server. <br>
The lower part of the screen (a single line) accepts
keyboard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some terminals do not support
certain features required by epic5 , in which case you
receive a message stating this. If this occurs, try changing
the terminal type or run epic5 <br>
with the -d option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Irc Commands: <br>
Any line beginning with the slash character &acirc;/&acirc;
is regarded as an epic5 command (the command character may
be changed). Any line not beginning with this character is
treated as a <br>
message to be sent to the current channel. The client has a
built in help system. Install the help files (they should be
available at the same place you got the client) and then
<br>
type &acirc;/help&acirc; to open up the help system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .epicrc File: <br>
When epic5 is executed, it checks the user&rsquo;s home
directory for a ~/.epicrc file, executing the commands in
the file. Commands in this file do not need to have a
leading slash <br>
character &acirc;/&acirc; This allows predefinition of
aliases and other features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRACTICAL EXAMPLES <br>
Certainly any description of epic5 in this man page will be
sorely inadequate because most of the confusion
doesn&rsquo;t even start until after you get the client to
connect to a <br>
server. But if you really have problems getting the client
to connect to a server, try some of these:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">epic5 <br>
Try this first. This will assume all the defaults. If the
person who is maintaining epic at your site has done a
halfway decent job, this will put you on a server that is
<br>
somewhat local to you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">epic5 nickname irc.domain.com
<br>
or something similar will attempt to connect to the irc
server running on the host &quot;irc.domain.com&quot; (fill
in a real irc server here) with the nickname of well,
&quot;nickname&quot;. <br>
This is the most common way to specify an alternate server
to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">epic5 nickname
irc.domain.com:6664 <br>
Sometimes, some servers are really busy, and it can take
them a long time to establish a connection with you on the
default port (6667). Most major servers on big public <br>
networks accept connections on many different ports, with
the most common being most or all of the ports between 6660
and 6675. You can usually connect much faster if you <br>
use a port other than 6667, if the server you&rsquo;re
connecting to supports an alternate port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">epic5 nickname irc.efnet.net
<br>
If you&rsquo;re totally stumped and trying to get on efnet,
try this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">epic5 nickname irc.undernet.org
<br>
If you&rsquo;re totally stumped and trying to get on
undernet, try this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">epic5 nickname irc.dal.net <br>
If you&rsquo;re totally stumped and trying to get on dalnet,
try this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/local/bin/epic5 the default location of the binary</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.epicrc default initialization
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.epic/ directory you can put
your own epic5 scripts into, that can then be loaded with
/load</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/local/share/epic5 default
directory containing message-of-the-day, master
initialization, help files and epic5 scripts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE HELP FILES <br>
Starting up the client is the easy part. Once you get
connected, you&rsquo;ll probably find you have no idea what
you&rsquo;re doing. That&rsquo;s where the help files come
in. If the person who <br>
maintains irc at your site didn&rsquo;t install the help
files, pester them until they do. Once the help files are
available, use the &acirc;/help&acirc; command to get
started. There are a bazil&acirc; <br>
lion commands and a multitude of nuances that will take a
few months to get down pat. But once you do, you will be so
firmly addicted to irc that your wife will divorce you, your
<br>
kids will leave you, your dog will run away, and
you&rsquo;ll flunk all your classes, and be left to sing the
blues.</p>

Lots of great help for new irc users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
epic5 handles the following signals gracefully</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 Closes all DCC
connections and EXEC&rsquo;d processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
It can be helpful to predefine certain variables in in the
~/.cshrc , ~/.profile , or ~/.login file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IRCNICK The user&rsquo;s default
IRC nickname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IRCNAME The user&rsquo;s default
IRC realname (otherwise retrieved from /etc/passwd )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IRCSERVER The user&rsquo;s
default IRC server list (see server option for details)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME Overrides the default home
page in /etc/password</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERM The type of terminal
emulation to use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
ircd(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Any non-trivial piece of software has bugs. EPIC5 is no
exception. You can refer to the KNOWNBUGS file that is
distributed with the client source code for a list of
problems that <br>
are known to exist and may or may not be fixed some day. If
you find a bug that is not listed there, you can refer to
the BUG_FORM file that is also distributed with the source
<br>
code. It will give you instructions on how to fill out the
report and where to send it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERRATA <br>
The online documentation probably should be in docbook form
rather than in the current help format. The entire help
system is a hack. This manual page only describes the
options <br>
to epic, but doesn&rsquo;t tell you what to do once you get
connected.</p>
