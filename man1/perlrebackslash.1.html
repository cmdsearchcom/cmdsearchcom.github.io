perlrebackslash - Perl Regular Expression Backslash Sequences and Escapes
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The top level documentation about Perl regular expressions is found in perlre.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This document describes all backslash and escape sequences. After explaining the
  role of the backslash, it lists all the sequences that have a special meaning
  in Perl regular expressions (in alphabetical order), then describes each of
  them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most sequences are described in detail in different documents; the primary
  purpose of this document is to have a quick reference guide describing all
  backslash and escape sequences.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_backslash"><a class="selflink" href="#The_backslash">The
  backslash</a></h2>
In a regular expression, the backslash can perform one of two tasks: it either
  takes away the special meaning of the character following it (for instance,
  &quot;\|&quot; matches a vertical bar, it's not an alternation), or it is the
  start of a backslash or escape sequence.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The rules determining what it is are quite simple: if the character following
  the backslash is an ASCII punctuation (non-word) character (that is, anything
  that is not a letter, digit, or underscore), then the backslash just takes
  away any special meaning of the character following it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the character following the backslash is an ASCII letter or an ASCII digit,
  then the sequence may be special; if so, it's listed below. A few letters have
  not been used yet, so escaping them with a backslash doesn't change them to be
  special. A future version of Perl may assign a special meaning to them, so if
  you have warnings turned on, Perl issues a warning if you use such a sequence.
  [1].
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is however guaranteed that backslash or escape sequences never have a
  punctuation character following the backslash, not now, and not in a future
  version of Perl 5. So it is safe to put a backslash in front of a non-word
  character.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the backslash itself is special; if you want to match a backslash, you
  have to escape the backslash with a backslash: &quot;/\\/&quot; matches a
  single backslash.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">[1]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">There is one exception. If you use an alphanumeric
      character as the delimiter of your pattern (which you probably shouldn't
      do for readability reasons), you have to escape the delimiter if you want
      to match it. Perl won't warn then. See also &quot;Gory details of parsing
      quoted constructs&quot; in perlop.</dd>

</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 $str =~ /\t/;   # Matches if $str contains a (horizontal) tab.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Control characters</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;\c&quot; is used to denote a control character; the character following
  &quot;\c&quot; determines the value of the construct. For example the value of
  &quot;\cA&quot; is chr(1), and the value of &quot;\cb&quot; is chr(2), etc.
  The gory details are in &quot;Regexp Quote-Like Operators&quot; in perlop. A
  complete list of what chr(1), etc. means for ASCII and EBCDIC platforms is in
  &quot;OPERATOR DIFFERENCES&quot; in perlebcdic.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that &quot;\c\&quot; alone at the end of a regular expression (or
  doubled-quoted string) is not valid. The backslash must be followed by another
  character. That is, &quot;\c\ <i>X</i>&quot; means &quot;chr(28) .
  '<i>X</i>'&quot; for all characters <i>X</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To write platform-independent code, you must use &quot;\N{ <i>NAME</i>}&quot;
  instead, like &quot;\N{ESCAPE}&quot; or &quot;\N{U+001B}&quot;, see charnames.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mnemonic: <i>c</i>ontrol character.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 $str =~ /\cK/;  # Matches if $str contains a vertical tab (control-K).
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Named or numbered characters and character sequences</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Unicode characters have a Unicode name and numeric code point (ordinal) value.
  Use the &quot;\N{}&quot; construct to specify a character by either of these
  values. Certain sequences of characters also have names.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To specify by name, the name of the character or character sequence goes between
  the curly braces.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To specify a character by Unicode code point, use the form &quot;\N{U+
  <i>code</i> <i>point</i>}&quot;, where <i>code point</i> is a number in
  hexadecimal that gives the code point that Unicode has assigned to the desired
  character. It is customary but not required to use leading zeros to pad the
  number to 4 digits. Thus &quot;\N{U+0041}&quot; means &quot;LATIN CAPITAL
  LETTER A&quot;, and you will rarely see it written without the two leading
  zeros. &quot;\N{U+0041}&quot; means &quot;A&quot; even on EBCDIC machines
  (where the ordinal value of &quot;A&quot; is not 0x41).
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is even possible to give your own names to characters and character
  sequences. For details, see charnames.
<div class="Pp"></div>
(There is an expanded internal form that you may see in debug output:
  &quot;\N{U+ <i>code point</i>.<i>code point</i>...}&quot;. The &quot;...&quot;
  means any number of these <i>code point</i>s separated by dots. This
  represents the sequence formed by the characters. This is an internal form
  only, subject to change, and you should not try to use it yourself.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mnemonic: <i>N</i>amed character.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that a character or character sequence expressed as a named or numbered
  character is considered a character without special meaning by the regex
  engine, and will match &quot;as is&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 $str =~ /\N{THAI CHARACTER SO SO}/;  # Matches the Thai SO SO character
 use charnames 'Cyrillic';            # Loads Cyrillic names.
 $str =~ /\N{ZHE}\N{KA}/;             # Match &quot;ZHE&quot; followed by &quot;KA&quot;.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Octal escapes</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are two forms of octal escapes. Each is used to specify a character by its
  code point specified in octal notation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One form, available starting in Perl 5.14 looks like &quot;\o{...}&quot;, where
  the dots represent one or more octal digits. It can be used for any Unicode
  character.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It was introduced to avoid the potential problems with the other form, available
  in all Perls. That form consists of a backslash followed by three octal
  digits. One problem with this form is that it can look exactly like an
  old-style backreference (see &quot;Disambiguation rules between old-style
  octal escapes and backreferences&quot; below.) You can avoid this by making
  the first of the three digits always a zero, but that makes \077 the largest
  code point specifiable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In some contexts, a backslash followed by two or even one octal digits may be
  interpreted as an octal escape, sometimes with a warning, and because of some
  bugs, sometimes with surprising results. Also, if you are creating a regex out
  of smaller snippets concatenated together, and you use fewer than three
  digits, the beginning of one snippet may be interpreted as adding digits to
  the ending of the snippet before it. See &quot;Absolute referencing&quot; for
  more discussion and examples of the snippet problem.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that a character expressed as an octal escape is considered a character
  without special meaning by the regex engine, and will match &quot;as is&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To summarize, the &quot;\o{}&quot; form is always safe to use, and the other
  form is safe to use for code points through \077 when you use exactly three
  digits to specify them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mnemonic: <i>0</i>ctal or <i>o</i>ctal.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Examples (assuming an ASCII platform)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 $str = &quot;Perl&quot;;
 $str =~ /\o{120}/;  # Match, &quot;\120&quot; is &quot;P&quot;.
 $str =~ /\120/;     # Same.
 $str =~ /\o{120}+/; # Match, &quot;\120&quot; is &quot;P&quot;, it's repeated at least once
 $str =~ /\120+/;    # Same.
 $str =~ /P\053/;    # No match, &quot;\053&quot; is &quot;+&quot; and taken literally.
 /\o{23073}/         # Black foreground, white background smiling face.
 /\o{4801234567}/    # Raises a warning, and yields chr(4)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Disambiguation rules between old-style octal escapes and backreferences
<div class="Pp"></div>
Octal escapes of the &quot;\000&quot; form outside of bracketed character
  classes potentially clash with old-style backreferences. (see &quot;Absolute
  referencing&quot; below). They both consist of a backslash followed by
  numbers. So Perl has to use heuristics to determine whether it is a
  backreference or an octal escape. Perl uses the following rules to
  disambiguate:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the backslash is followed by a single digit, it's a
      backreference.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the first digit following the backslash is a 0, it's an
      octal escape.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the number following the backslash is N (in decimal),
      and Perl already has seen N capture groups, Perl considers this a
      backreference. Otherwise, it considers it an octal escape. If N has more
      than three digits, Perl takes only the first three for the octal escape;
      the rest are matched as is.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
 my $pat  = &quot;(&quot; x 999;
    $pat .= &quot;a&quot;;
    $pat .= &quot;)&quot; x 999;
 /^($pat)\1000$/;   #  Matches 'aa'; there are 1000 capture groups.
 /^$pat\1000$/;     #  Matches 'a@0'; there are 999 capture groups
                    #    and \1000 is seen as \100 (a '@') and a '0'
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can force a backreference interpretation always by using the
  &quot;\g{...}&quot; form. You can the force an octal interpretation always by
  using the &quot;\o{...}&quot; form, or for numbers up through \077 (= 63
  decimal), by using three digits, beginning with a &quot;0&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Hexadecimal escapes</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Like octal escapes, there are two forms of hexadecimal escapes, but both start
  with the same thing, &quot;\x&quot;. This is followed by either exactly two
  hexadecimal digits forming a number, or a hexadecimal number of arbitrary
  length surrounded by curly braces. The hexadecimal number is the code point of
  the character you want to express.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that a character expressed as one of these escapes is considered a
  character without special meaning by the regex engine, and will match &quot;as
  is&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mnemonic: he <i>x</i>adecimal.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Examples (assuming an ASCII platform)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 $str = &quot;Perl&quot;;
 $str =~ /\x50/;    # Match, &quot;\x50&quot; is &quot;P&quot;.
 $str =~ /\x50+/;   # Match, &quot;\x50&quot; is &quot;P&quot;, it is repeated at least once
 $str =~ /P\x2B/;   # No match, &quot;\x2B&quot; is &quot;+&quot; and taken literally.
 /\x{2603}\x{2602}/ # Snowman with an umbrella.
                    # The Unicode character 2603 is a snowman,
                    # the Unicode character 2602 is an umbrella.
 /\x{263B}/         # Black smiling face.
 /\x{263b}/         # Same, the hex digits A - F are case insensitive.
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Modifiers"><a class="selflink" href="#Modifiers">Modifiers</a></h2>
A number of backslash sequences have to do with changing the character, or
  characters following them. &quot;\l&quot; will lowercase the character
  following it, while &quot;\u&quot; will uppercase (or, more accurately,
  titlecase) the character following it. They provide functionality similar to
  the functions &quot;lcfirst&quot; and &quot;ucfirst&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To uppercase or lowercase several characters, one might want to use
  &quot;\L&quot; or &quot;\U&quot;, which will lowercase/uppercase all
  characters following them, until either the end of the pattern or the next
  occurrence of &quot;\E&quot;, whichever comes first. They provide
  functionality similar to what the functions &quot;lc&quot; and &quot;uc&quot;
  provide.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;\Q&quot; is used to quote (disable) pattern metacharacters, up to the next
  &quot;\E&quot; or the end of the pattern. &quot;\Q&quot; adds a backslash to
  any character that could have special meaning to Perl. In the ASCII range, it
  quotes every character that isn't a letter, digit, or underscore. See
  &quot;quotemeta&quot; in perlfunc for details on what gets quoted for
  non-ASCII code points. Using this ensures that any character between
  &quot;\Q&quot; and &quot;\E&quot; will be matched literally, not interpreted
  as a metacharacter by the regex engine.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;\F&quot; can be used to casefold all characters following, up to the next
  &quot;\E&quot; or the end of the pattern. It provides the functionality
  similar to the &quot;fc&quot; function.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mnemonic: <i>L</i>owercase, <i>U</i>ppercase, <i>F</i>old-case,
  <i>Q</i>uotemeta, <i>E</i>nd.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Examples
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 $sid     = &quot;sid&quot;;
 $greg    = &quot;GrEg&quot;;
 $miranda = &quot;(Miranda)&quot;;
 $str     =~ /\u$sid/;        # Matches 'Sid'
 $str     =~ /\L$greg/;       # Matches 'greg'
 $str     =~ /\Q$miranda\E/;  # Matches '(Miranda)', as if the pattern
                              #   had been written as /\(Miranda\)/
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Character_classes"><a class="selflink" href="#Character_classes">Character
  classes</a></h2>
Perl regular expressions have a large range of character classes. Some of the
  character classes are written as a backslash sequence. We will briefly discuss
  those here; full details of character classes can be found in perlrecharclass.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;\w&quot; is a character class that matches any single <i>word</i>
  character (letters, digits, Unicode marks, and connector punctuation (like the
  underscore)). &quot;\d&quot; is a character class that matches any decimal
  digit, while the character class &quot;\s&quot; matches any whitespace
  character. New in perl 5.10.0 are the classes &quot;\h&quot; and
  &quot;\v&quot; which match horizontal and vertical whitespace characters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The exact set of characters matched by &quot;\d&quot;, &quot;\s&quot;, and
  &quot;\w&quot; varies depending on various pragma and regular expression
  modifiers. It is possible to restrict the match to the ASCII range by using
  the &quot;/a&quot; regular expression modifier. See perlrecharclass.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The uppercase variants (&quot;\W&quot;, &quot;\D&quot;, &quot;\S&quot;,
  &quot;\H&quot;, and &quot;\V&quot;) are character classes that match,
  respectively, any character that isn't a word character, digit, whitespace,
  horizontal whitespace, or vertical whitespace.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mnemonics: <i>w</i>ord, <i>d</i>igit, <i>s</i>pace, <i>h</i>orizontal,
  <i>v</i>ertical.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Unicode classes</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;\pP&quot; (where &quot;P&quot; is a single letter) and
  &quot;\p{Property}&quot; are used to match a character that matches the given
  Unicode property; properties include things like &quot;letter&quot;, or
  &quot;thai character&quot;. Capitalizing the sequence to &quot;\PP&quot; and
  &quot;\P{Property}&quot; make the sequence match a character that doesn't
  match the given Unicode property. For more details, see &quot;Backslash
  sequences&quot; in perlrecharclass and &quot;Unicode Character
  Properties&quot; in perlunicode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mnemonic: <i>p</i>roperty.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Referencing"><a class="selflink" href="#Referencing">Referencing</a></h2>
If capturing parenthesis are used in a regular expression, we can refer to the
  part of the source string that was matched, and match exactly the same thing.
  There are three ways of referring to such <i>backreference</i>: absolutely,
  relatively, and by name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Absolute referencing</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Either &quot;\g <i>N</i>&quot; (starting in Perl 5.10.0), or
  &quot;\<i>N</i>&quot; (old-style) where <i>N</i> is a positive (unsigned)
  decimal number of any length is an absolute reference to a capturing group.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>N</i> refers to the Nth set of parentheses, so &quot;\g<i>N</i>&quot; refers
  to whatever has been matched by that set of parentheses. Thus &quot;\g1&quot;
  refers to the first capture group in the regex.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;\g <i>N</i>&quot; form can be equivalently written as
  &quot;\g{<i>N</i>}&quot; which avoids ambiguity when building a regex by
  concatenating shorter strings. Otherwise if you had a regex
  &quot;qr/$a$b/&quot;, and $a contained &quot;\g1&quot;, and $b contained
  &quot;37&quot;, you would get &quot;/\g137/&quot; which is probably not what
  you intended.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the &quot;\ <i>N</i>&quot; form, <i>N</i> must not begin with a
  &quot;0&quot;, and there must be at least <i>N</i> capturing groups, or else
  <i>N</i> is considered an octal escape (but something like &quot;\18&quot; is
  the same as &quot;\0018&quot;; that is, the octal escape &quot;\001&quot;
  followed by a literal digit &quot;8&quot;).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mnemonic: <i>g</i>roup.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Examples
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 /(\w+) \g1/;    # Finds a duplicated word, (e.g. &quot;cat cat&quot;).
 /(\w+) \1/;     # Same thing; written old-style

<i>Relative referencing</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;\g- <i>N</i>&quot; (starting in Perl 5.10.0) is used for relative
  addressing. (It can be written as &quot;\g{- <i>N</i>&quot;.) It refers to the
  <i>N</i>th group before the &quot;\g{- <i>N</i>}&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The big advantage of this form is that it makes it much easier to write patterns
  with references that can be interpolated in larger patterns, even if the
  larger pattern also contains capture groups.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Examples
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 /(A)        # Group 1
  (          # Group 2
    (B)      # Group 3
    \g{-1}   # Refers to group 3 (B)
    \g{-3}   # Refers to group 1 (A)
  )
 /x;         # Matches &quot;ABBA&quot;.
 my $qr = qr /(.)(.)\g{-2}\g{-1}/;  # Matches 'abab', 'cdcd', etc.
 /$qr$qr/                           # Matches 'ababcdcd'.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Named referencing</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;\g{ <i>name</i>}&quot; (starting in Perl 5.10.0) can be used to back refer
  to a named capture group, dispensing completely with having to think about
  capture buffer positions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To be compatible with .Net regular expressions, &quot;\g{name}&quot; may also be
  written as &quot;\k{name}&quot;, &quot;\k&lt;name&gt;&quot; or
  &quot;\k'name'&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To prevent any ambiguity, <i>name</i> must not start with a digit nor contain a
  hyphen.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Examples
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 /(?&lt;word&gt;\w+) \g{word}/ # Finds duplicated word, (e.g. &quot;cat cat&quot;)
 /(?&lt;word&gt;\w+) \k{word}/ # Same.
 /(?&lt;word&gt;\w+) \k&lt;word&gt;/ # Same.
 /(?&lt;letter1&gt;.)(?&lt;letter2&gt;.)\g{letter2}\g{letter1}/
                         # Match a four letter palindrome (e.g. &quot;ABBA&quot;)

Assertions are conditions that have to be true; they don't actually match parts
  of the substring. There are six assertions that are written as backslash
  sequences.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">\A</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;\A&quot; only matches at the beginning of the string.
      If the &quot;/m&quot; modifier isn't used, then &quot;/\A/&quot; is
      equivalent to &quot;/^/&quot;. However, if the &quot;/m&quot; modifier is
      used, then &quot;/^/&quot; matches internal newlines, but the meaning of
      &quot;/\A/&quot; isn't changed by the &quot;/m&quot; modifier.
      &quot;\A&quot; matches at the beginning of the string regardless whether
      the &quot;/m&quot; modifier is used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">\z, \Z</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;\z&quot; and &quot;\Z&quot; match at the end of the
      string. If the &quot;/m&quot; modifier isn't used, then &quot;/\Z/&quot;
      is equivalent to &quot;/$/&quot;; that is, it matches at the end of the
      string, or one before the newline at the end of the string. If the
      &quot;/m&quot; modifier is used, then &quot;/$/&quot; matches at internal
      newlines, but the meaning of &quot;/\Z/&quot; isn't changed by the
      &quot;/m&quot; modifier. &quot;\Z&quot; matches at the end of the string
      (or just before a trailing newline) regardless whether the &quot;/m&quot;
      modifier is used.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;\z&quot; is just like &quot;\Z&quot;, except that it does not match
      before a trailing newline. &quot;\z&quot; matches at the end of the string
      only, regardless of the modifiers used, and not just before a newline. It
      is how to anchor the match to the true end of the string under all
      conditions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">\G</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;\G&quot; is usually used only in combination with the
      &quot;/g&quot; modifier. If the &quot;/g&quot; modifier is used and the
      match is done in scalar context, Perl remembers where in the source string
      the last match ended, and the next time, it will start the match from
      where it ended the previous time.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;\G&quot; matches the point where the previous match on that string
      ended, or the beginning of that string if there was no previous match.

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">\b, \B</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;\b&quot; matches at any place between a word and a
      non-word character; &quot;\B&quot; matches at any place between characters
      where &quot;\b&quot; doesn't match. &quot;\b&quot; and &quot;\B&quot;
      assume there's a non-word character before the beginning and after the end
      of the source string; so &quot;\b&quot; will match at the beginning (or
      end) of the source string if the source string begins (or ends) with a
      word character. Otherwise, &quot;\B&quot; will match.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Do not use something like &quot;\b=head\d\b&quot; and expect it to match the
      beginning of a line. It can't, because for there to be a boundary before
      the non-word &quot;=&quot;, there must be a word character immediately
      previous. All boundary determinations look for word characters alone, not
      for non-words characters nor for string ends. It may help to understand
      how &lt;\b&gt; and &lt;\B&gt; work by equating them as follows:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    \b  really means    (?:(?&lt;=\w)(?!\w)|(?&lt;!\w)(?=\w))

Here we document the backslash sequences that don't fall in one of the
  categories above. These are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">\C</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;\C&quot; always matches a single octet, even if the
      source string is encoded in UTF-8 format, and the character to be matched
      is a multi-octet character. &quot;\C&quot; was introduced in perl 5.6.
      This is very dangerous, because it violates the logical character
      abstraction and can cause UTF-8 sequences to become malformed.

  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;\R&quot; matches a <i>generic newline</i>; that is,
      anything considered a linebreak sequence by Unicode. This includes all
      characters matched by &quot;\v&quot; (vertical whitespace), and the multi
      character sequence &quot;\x0D\x0A&quot; (carriage return followed by a
      line feed, sometimes called the network newline; it's the end of line
      sequence used in Microsoft text files opened in binary mode).
      &quot;\R&quot; is equivalent to &quot;(?&gt;\x0D\x0A|\v)&quot;. (The
      reason it doesn't backtrack is that the sequence is considered
      inseparable. That means that

    fails, because the &quot;\R&quot; matches the entire string, and won't
      backtrack to match just the &quot;\x0D&quot;.) Since &quot;\R&quot; can
      match a sequence of more than one character, it cannot be put inside a
