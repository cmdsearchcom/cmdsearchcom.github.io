<p>FTRACE(1) Frysk FTRACE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ftrace - trace system calls, function calls and signals</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ftrace [-f] [-follow] [-dl] [-m] [-o=FILE] [-p=PID...] [-pc]
[-sys=SYSCALL[,SYSCALL...]] [-sig=SIG[,SIG...]]
[-sym=RULE[,RULE...]] [-addr=RULE[,RULE...]] [-stack] [--]
<br>
command [arguments...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ftrace starts given command and according to tracing script
given via command-line arguments, it traces its system
calls, symbol entry points in general, and possibly other
<br>
events as well. It uses the Frysk framework to implement
tracing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The working set of events ftrace
should trace is defined by the following arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Process Selection Options <br>
-p=PID <br>
Attach to a process with given PID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, -follow <br>
Follow children: automatically attach to forks of traced
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Symbol Tracing <br>
-dl <br>
Trace inside dynamic linker. When this option is not
present, ftrace will function as if -#INTERP#* rule was
present at the end of each tracing script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sym=SYMBOL[,SYMBOL...] <br>
Trace calls through the symbol entry points. Ftrace displays
a message each time a thread of execution hits entry point
of one of the traced functions, and then when (if) the <br>
function returns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If SYMBOL references PLT slot,
calls done through that PLT slot are recorded. You then
effectively trace calls done FROM given library or
executable, and generally can&rsquo;t say <br>
which library the call leads TO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When tracing ordinary symbol,
catch all calls that end up at this symbol. That includes
the calls that don&rsquo;t go through PLT and as such are
not intended as inter-library <br>
calls, but rather intra-library calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See below for detailed
description of SYMBOL rule syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other Traceable Events <br>
-sys=SYSCALL[,SYSCALL...] <br>
Trace system calls that match given SYSCALL ruleset. See
below for description of SYSCALL syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sig=SIGNAL[,SIGNAL...] <br>
Trace signals that match given SIGNAL ruleset. See below for
description of SIGNAL syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-addr=RULE[,RULE...] <br>
Trace addresses given by RULEs. See below for description of
address RULE syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other Options <br>
-m <br>
Print each file mapped to or unmapped from address space of
the traced process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pc <br>
Show the value of instruction pointer at each reported
event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stack <br>
Stack trace when traced symbol is hit. Note that this option
also applies to traced system calls. If you need to
cherry-pick which event should stack trace, use # operator
<br>
described in sections below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stack Print Options <br>
-number-of-frames count <br>
Limit the back-trace to count frames. The default is to
limit the back-trace to 10 frames. Specify 0 or
&quot;all&quot; to print all frames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lite <br>
Perform a light-weight stack backtrace containing only
minimal information. Equivalent to -print -.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rich <br>
Perform a detailed stack back-trace that includes, where
possible, inlined function calls, parameter names and
values, and debug-names. Equivalent to -print <br>
inline,params,debug-names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print print-option,... <br>
Specify the level of detail to include in a stack
back-trace. print-option can be any of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug-names: use debug
information, such as DWARF, to determine the name of
functions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">paths: include the full path to
source files and libraries</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inline: include in-line function
in back-trace</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">locals: to include local
variables from each frame</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">params: include the function
parameters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To negate a print-option prefix
it with &quot;-&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard Frysk Options <br>
-exe <br>
The full path of the executable to read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noexe <br>
Do not attempt to read the corresponding executable when
loading a core file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sysroot directory <br>
The system root directory under which all executables,
libraries, and source are located.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-debug class=level... <br>
Set internal debug-tracing of the specified Java class to
level (level can be NONE, INFO, WARNING, FINE, and FINEST).
If the level is absent, FINE is assumed; if the class is
<br>
absent, the global level is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYMBOL RULE SYNTAX <br>
To decide which PLT slots or entry points should be traced,
following process takes place. A set of symbols to trace
(&quot;working set&quot;) is initially empty. Rules, if
present, are <br>
then enumerated from left to right, and set is modified
depending on the rules. Rules are delimited by a comma.
Syntax of each rule is following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-]pattern[/options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without the optional
&quot;-&quot; all symbols that match the pattern are added
to the working set. With &quot;-&quot;, matching symbols are
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;/&quot; is present at
the end of the rule, following letters are interpreted as
rule flags. Currently only one flag is available,
&quot;s&quot;. When present, it means ftrace should show a
<br>
stack trace when it hits a symbol that matches this
rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a &quot;-&quot; rule has an
&quot;/s&quot; flag, the call should still be traced, but
stack trace shouldn&rsquo;t be generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pattern defines which symbols or
PLT slots from which libraries should be added or removed
from working set. Syntax of pattern is as follows:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">[#soname#][filename.c#][(proc|line)#][plt:]symbol[@version]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">soname component is matched
against a soname of a library in which we wish to trace the
call. If the library has no associated soname (such as is
usual in case of main <br>
executable), the match is done against the file name
(without a path). Two special sonames are distinguished:
&quot;MAIN&quot;, which always matches main executable; and
&quot;INTERP&quot;, which <br>
always matches ELF interpreter (dynamic linker) of the main
executable. If the component is missing, then the rule is
applicable in all libraries and in main executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename.c component is matched
against the name of a file where the symbol is defined.
NOTE: This is currently not implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">proc component is matched
against the name of block surrounding the definition we wish
to trace. If the block doesn&rsquo;t have a name, you can
instead refer to it with the line <br>
number that the block surrounds. NOTE: This is currently not
implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">symbol component is matched
against the name of symbol under consideration. If
&quot;plt:&quot; prefix is present, the rule matches PLT
entry associated with the symbol instead of the <br>
symbol itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version component is matched
against version associated with symbol. If the symbol has no
associated version, it is considered to be an empty string.
(It is possible to request <br>
symbol without a version with the pattern &quot;foo@&quot;.)
NOTE: This is currently not implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All components are presented in
glob syntax. See glob(7) manual page for more details. See
below for examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSCALL AND SIGNAL RULE SYNTAX
<br>
Under the presence of the -sys (or -sig) option, ALL system
calls (or signals) are ALWAYS traced. This is a limitation
of the ptrace layer. The system call and signal rules <br>
however serve as a simple way of filtering out the output
that you are not interested in. In following paragraphs, the
word &quot;event&quot; will be used to mean &quot;signal or
syscall, <br>
whatever applies&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The system call and signal rule
syntax and semantics are the same as the symbol rule
syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-]pattern[/options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Event selection pattern syntax
is then as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[event name|event number]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the pattern is empty, it
matches all events known to frysk. When the pattern is
simple number (e.g. &quot;12&quot;), then the pattern
matches the event with the given number. <br>
Otherwise the pattern is considered to be case-insensitive
glob, and matched against event names. Whole name has to
match for event to be a part of working set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Signal can be given both with
and without leading &quot;sig&quot; (e.g.
&quot;sigkill&quot; as well as &quot;kill&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADDRESS RULE SYNTAX <br>
The process of establishing a working set of addresses that
should be traced is the same as for symbol rules, and the
general syntax reflects that. Each rule looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-]pattern[/options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each pattern then looks like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[#soname#][0x]address</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Addresses are always given in
hexadecimal notation, even if initial 0x is missing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">soname component is the same as
in symbol tracing, i.e. it&rsquo;s matched against a soname
of a library in which we wish to trace the address. Same
rules apply regarding INTERP and <br>
MAIN meta-sonames. Refer to the chapter &quot;SYMBOL RULE
SYNTAX&quot; for detailed description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even though soname is optional,
at least one soname has to be specified at the beginning of
the -addr command. That&rsquo;s because in general it makes
no sense to want to trace the <br>
same address in ALL object files at once. The components
that are soname-less are assumed to have a soname of the
previous component that has soname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, this will trace two
addresses from the main binary, and stack trace one of
them:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftrace
-addr=#MAIN#0x08052780/s,08049314 -- ls</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need to trace the same
address in several files, you can use the fact that the
soname pattern is a glob.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The addresses are assumed to be
copied from readelf or objdump. ftrace biases the value
accordingly depending on where the module is actually
mapped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Trace all system calls:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftrace -sys= ls</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trace variants of stat system
call and moreover a system call #3:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftrace
-sys=&rsquo;*stat*,3&rsquo; ls</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Various ways to tell ftrace that
you want to stack trace on SIGUSR1:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftrace
-sig=USR1/s,usr1/s,SIGUSR1/s,sigusr1/s,10/s ~/sig</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trace all library calls:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftrace -sym=plt:* ls</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trace all library calls to
functions that contain substring &quot;write&quot; in their
names:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftrace -sym=plt:*write* ls</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trace memory functions done from
libraries, i.e. not from main executable:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftrace
-sym=&rsquo;plt:*alloc,plt:free,-#MAIN#plt:*&rsquo; ls</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stack trace on everything,
except for memory allocation functions (which should still
be traced):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftrace
-sym=&rsquo;plt:*/s,-plt:*alloc/s,-plt:free/s&rsquo; ls</p>

frysk(7), glob(7)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The option parser is greedy when looking for options so
running ftrace on a program that uses options can be a
problem, use -- to split between ftrace and the program. So
change <br>
from:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/prefix/bin/ftrace
~/prefix/lib64/frysk/funit --arch 32
frysk.proc.TestAbandon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/prefix/bin/ftrace --
