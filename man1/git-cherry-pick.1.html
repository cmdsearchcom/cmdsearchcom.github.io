<p>GIT-CHERRY-PICK(1) Git Manual GIT-CHERRY-PICK(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-cherry-pick - Apply the changes introduced by some
existing commits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git cherry-pick [--edit] [-n] [-m parent-number] [-s] [-x]
[--ff] &lt;commit&gt;... <br>
git cherry-pick --continue <br>
git cherry-pick --quit <br>
git cherry-pick --abort</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Given one or more existing commits, apply the change each
one introduces, recording a new commit for each. This
requires your working tree to be clean (no modifications
from the <br>
HEAD commit).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When it is not obvious how to
apply a change, the following happens:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The current branch and HEAD
pointer stay at the last commit successfully made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The CHERRY_PICK_HEAD ref is
set to point at the commit that introduced the change that
is difficult to apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Paths in which the change
applied cleanly are updated both in the index file and in
your working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. For conflicting paths, the
index file records up to three versions, as described in the
&quot;TRUE MERGE&quot; section of git-merge(1). The working
tree files will include a <br>
description of the conflict bracketed by the usual conflict
markers &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. No other modifications are
made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See git-merge(1) for some hints
on resolving such conflicts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
&lt;commit&gt;... <br>
Commits to cherry-pick. For a more complete list of ways to
spell commits, see gitrevisions(7). Sets of commits can be
passed but no traversal is done by default, as if the <br>
--no-walk option was specified, see git-rev-list(1). Note
that specifying a range will feed all &lt;commit&gt;...
arguments to a single revision walk (see a later example
that uses <br>
maint master..next).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --edit <br>
With this option, git cherry-pick will let you edit the
commit message prior to committing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x <br>
When recording the commit, append a line that says
&quot;(cherry picked from commit ...)&quot; to the original
commit message in order to indicate which commit this change
was <br>
cherry-picked from. This is done only for cherry picks
without conflicts. Do not use this option if you are
cherry-picking from your private branch because the
information is <br>
useless to the recipient. If on the other hand you are
cherry-picking between two publicly visible branches (e.g.
backporting a fix to a maintenance branch for an older <br>
release from a development branch), adding this information
can be useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r <br>
It used to be that the command defaulted to do -x described
above, and -r was to disable it. Now the default is not to
do -x so this option is a no-op.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m parent-number, --mainline
parent-number <br>
Usually you cannot cherry-pick a merge because you do not
know which side of the merge should be considered the
mainline. This option specifies the parent number (starting
<br>
from 1) of the mainline and allows cherry-pick to replay the
change relative to the specified parent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-commit <br>
Usually the command automatically creates a sequence of
commits. This flag applies the changes necessary to
cherry-pick each named commit to your working tree and the
index, <br>
without making any commit. In addition, when this option is
used, your index does not have to match the HEAD commit. The
cherry-pick is done against the beginning state of <br>
your index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is useful when
cherry-picking more than one commits&rsquo; effect to your
index in a row.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --signoff <br>
Add Signed-off-by line at the end of the commit message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ff <br>
If the current HEAD is the same as the parent of the
cherry-pick&acirc;ed commit, then a fast forward to this
commit will be performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-empty <br>
By default, cherry-picking an empty commit will fail,
indicating that an explicit invocation of git commit
--allow-empty is required. This option overrides that
behavior, <br>
allowing empty commits to be preserved automatically in a
cherry-pick. Note that when &quot;--ff&quot; is in effect,
empty commits that meet the &quot;fast-forward&quot;
requirement will be kept <br>
even without this option. Note also, that use of this option
only keeps commits that were initially empty (i.e. the
commit recorded the same tree as its parent). Commits <br>
which are made empty due to a previous commit are dropped.
To force the inclusion of those commits use
--keep-redundant-commits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-empty-message <br>
By default, cherry-picking a commit with an empty message
will fail. This option overrides that behaviour, allowing
commits with empty messages to be cherry picked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keep-redundant-commits <br>
If a commit being cherry picked duplicates a commit already
in the current history, it will become empty. By default
these redundant commits are ignored. This option <br>
overrides that behavior and creates an empty commit object.
Implies --allow-empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--strategy=&lt;strategy&gt; <br>
Use the given merge strategy. Should only be used once. See
the MERGE STRATEGIES section in git-merge(1) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X&lt;option&gt;,
--strategy-option=&lt;option&gt; <br>
Pass the merge strategy-specific option through to the merge
strategy. See git-merge(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEQUENCER SUBCOMMANDS <br>
--continue <br>
Continue the operation in progress using the information in
.git/sequencer. Can be used to continue after resolving
conflicts in a failed cherry-pick or revert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quit <br>
Forget about the current operation in progress. Can be used
to clear the sequencer state after a failed cherry-pick or
revert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--abort <br>
Cancel the operation and return to the pre-sequence
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
git cherry-pick master <br>
Apply the change introduced by the commit at the tip of the
master branch and create a new commit with this change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git cherry-pick ..master, git
cherry-pick ^HEAD master <br>
Apply the changes introduced by all commits that are
ancestors of master but not of HEAD to produce new
commits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git cherry-pick maint next
^master, git cherry-pick maint master..next <br>
Apply the changes introduced by all commits that are
ancestors of maint or next, but not master or any of its
ancestors. Note that the latter does not mean maint and <br>
everything between master and next; specifically, maint will
not be used if it is included in master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git cherry-pick master~4
master~2 <br>
Apply the changes introduced by the fifth and third last
commits pointed to by master and create 2 new commits with
these changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git cherry-pick -n master~1 next
<br>
Apply to the working tree and the index the changes
introduced by the second last commit pointed to by master
and by the last commit pointed to by next, but do not create
any <br>
commit with these changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git cherry-pick --ff ..next <br>
If history is linear and HEAD is an ancestor of next, update
the working tree and advance the HEAD pointer to match next.
Otherwise, apply the changes introduced by those <br>
commits that are in next but not HEAD to the current branch,
creating a new commit for each new change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git rev-list --reverse master --
README | git cherry-pick -n --stdin <br>
Apply the changes introduced by all commits on the master
branch that touched README to the working tree and index, so
the result can be inspected and made into a single new <br>
commit if suitable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sequence attempts
to backport a patch, bails out because the code the patch
applies to has changed too much, and then tries again, this
time exercising more care <br>
about matching up context lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git cherry-pick topic^ (1)
<br>
$ git diff (2) <br>
$ git reset --merge ORIG_HEAD (3) <br>
$ git cherry-pick -Xpatience topic^ (4)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. apply the change that would
be shown by git show topic^. In this example, the patch does
not apply cleanly, so information about the conflict is
written to the index and <br>
working tree and no new commit results. <br>
2. summarize changes to be reconciled <br>
3. cancel the cherry-pick. In other words, return to the
pre-cherry-pick state, preserving any local modifications
you had in the working tree. <br>
4. try to apply the change introduced by topic^ again,
spending extra time to avoid mistakes based on incorrectly
matching context lines.</p>
