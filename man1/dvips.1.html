<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dvips - convert a TeX DVI file to PostScript</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dvips [OPTIONS] file[.dvi]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
THIS MAN PAGE IS OBSOLETE! See the Texinfo documentation
instead. You can read it either in Emacs or with the
standalone info program which comes with the GNU texinfo
distribu&acirc; <br>
tion as ftp.gnu.org:pub/gnu/texinfo/texinfo*.tar.gz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program dvips takes a DVI
file file[.dvi] produced by TeX (or by some other processor
such as GFtoDVI) and converts it to PostScript, sending the
output to a file or directly <br>
to a printer. The DVI file may be specified without the .dvi
extension. Fonts used may either be resident in the printer
or defined as bitmaps in PK files, or a
&lsquo;virtual&rsquo; com&acirc; <br>
bination of both. If the mktexpk program is installed, dvips
will automatically invoke METAFONT to generate fonts that
don&rsquo;t already exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information, see the
Texinfo manual dvips.texi, which should be installed
somewhere on your system, hopefully accessible through the
standard Info tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a Conserve memory by making three passes over the .dvi file
instead of two and only loading those characters actually
used. Generally only useful on machines with a very <br>
limited amount of memory, like some PCs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Print only odd pages (TeX
pages, not sequence pages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b num Generate num copies of
each page, but duplicating the page body rather than using
the #numcopies option. This can be useful in conjunction
with a header file setting p - <br>
ok to do color separations or other neat tricks. h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Print only even pages (TeX
pages, not sequence pages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c num Generate num copies of
every page. Default is 1. (For collated copies, see the -C
option below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C num Create num copies, but
collated (by replicating the data in the PostScript file).
Slower than the -c option, but easier on the hands, and
faster than resubmitting the <br>
same PostScript file multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d num Set the debug flags. This
is intended only for emergencies or for unusual fact-finding
expeditions; it will work only if dvips has been compiled
with the DEBUG option. <br>
If nonzero, prints additional information on standard error.
For maximum information, you can use &lsquo;-1&rsquo;. See
the Dvips Texinfo manual for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D num Set the resolution in dpi
(dots per inch) to num. This affects the choice of bitmap
fonts that are loaded and also the positioning of letters in
resident PostScript <br>
fonts. Must be between 10 and 10000. This affects both the
horizontal and vertical resolution. If a high resolution
(something greater than 400 dpi, say) is selected, <br>
the -Z flag should probably also be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e num Make sure that each
character is placed at most this many pixels from its
&lsquo;true&rsquo; resolution-independent position on the
page. The default value of this parameter is reso&acirc;
<br>
lution dependent. Allowing individual characters to
&lsquo;drift&rsquo; from their correctly rounded positions
by a few pixels, while regaining the true position at the
beginning of <br>
each new word, improves the spacing of letters in words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E makes dvips attempt to
generate an EPSF file with a tight bounding box. This only
works on one-page files, and it only looks at marks made by
characters and rules, not by <br>
any included graphics. In addition, it gets the glyph
metrics from the tfm file, so characters that lie outside
their enclosing tfm box may confuse it. In addition, the
<br>
bounding box might be a bit too loose if the character glyph
has significant left or right side bearings. Nonetheless,
this option works well for creating small EPSF <br>
files for equations or tables or the like. (Note, of course,
that dvips output is resolution dependent and thus does not
make very good EPSF files, especially if the <br>
images are to be scaled; use these EPSF files with a great
deal of care.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Run as a filter. Read the
.dvi file from standard input and write the PostScript to
standard output. The standard input must be seekable, so it
cannot be a pipe. If you <br>
must use a pipe, write a shell script that copies the pipe
output to a temporary file and then points dvips at this
file. This option also disables the automatic reading <br>
of the PRINTER environment variable, and turns off the
automatic sending of control D if it was turned on with the
-F option or in the configuration file; use -F after <br>
this option if you want both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Causes Control-D (ASCII code
4) to be appended as the very last character of the
PostScript file. This is useful when dvips is driving the
printer directly instead of <br>
working through a spooler, as is common on extremely small
systems. NOTE! DO NOT USE THIS OPTION!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Causes dvips to shift
non-printing characters to higher-numbered positions. This
may be useful sometimes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h name <br>
Prepend file name as an additional header file. (However, if
the name is simply &lsquo;-&rsquo; suppress all header files
from the output.) This header file gets added to the
Post&acirc; <br>
Script userdict.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Make each section be a
separate file. Under certain circumstances, dvips will split
the document up into &lsquo;sections&rsquo; to be processed
independently; this is most often done <br>
for memory reasons. Using this option tells dvips to place
each section into a separate file; the new file names are
created replacing the suffix of the supplied output <br>
file name by a three-digit sequence number. This option is
most often used in conjunction with the -S option which sets
the maximum section length in pages. For <br>
instance, some phototypesetters cannot print more than ten
or so consecutive pages before running out of steam; these
options can be used to automatically split a book <br>
into ten-page sections, each to its own file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j Download only needed
characters from Type 1 fonts. This is the default in the
current release. Some debugging flags trace this operation.
You can also control partial <br>
downloading on a per-font basis, via the psfonts.map
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Print crop marks. This option
increases the paper size (which should be specified, either
with a paper size special or with the -T option) by a half
inch in each dimen&acirc; <br>
sion. It translates each page by a quarter inch and draws
cross-style crop marks. It is mostly useful with typesetters
that can set the page size automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K This option causes comments
in included PostScript graphics, font files, and headers to
be removed. This is sometimes necessary to get around bugs
in spoolers or Post&acirc; <br>
Script post-processing programs. Specifically, the %%Page
comments, when left in, often cause difficulties. Use of
this flag can cause some included graphics to fail, <br>
since the PostScript header macros from some software
packages read portions of the input stream line by line,
searching for a particular comment. This option has been
<br>
turned off by default because PostScript previewers and
spoolers have been getting better.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l num The last page printed
will be the first one numbered num Default is the last page
in the document. If the num is prefixed by an equals sign,
then it (and any argument to <br>
the -p option) is treated as a sequence number, rather than
a value to compare with matter what the pages are actually
numbered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Specify manual feed for
printer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mode mode <br>
Use mode as the Metafont device name for path searching and
font generation. This overrides any value from configuration
files. With the default paths, explicitly speci&acirc; <br>
fying the mode also makes the program assume the fonts are
in a subdirectory named mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Turns off the automatic font
generation facility. If any fonts are missing, commands to
generate the fonts are appended to the file missfont.log in
the current directory; <br>
this file can then be executed and deleted to create the
missing fonts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n num At most num pages will be
printed. Default is 100000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Turns off structured
comments; this might be necessary on some systems that try
to interpret PostScript comments in weird ways, or on some
PostScript printers. Old ver&acirc; <br>
sions of TranScript in particular cannot handle modern
Encapsulated PostScript.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noomega <br>
This will disable the use of Omega extensions when
interpreting DVI files. By default, the additional opcodes
129 and 134 are recognized by dvips as Omega or pTeX
exten&acirc; <br>
sions and interpreted as requests to set 2-byte
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noptex <br>
This will disable the use of pTeX extensions when
interpreting DVI files. By default, the additional opcodes
130 and 135 are recognized by dvips as pTeX extensions and
<br>
interpreted as requests to set 3-byte characters, and 255 as
request to change the typesetting direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only drawback is that the
virtual font array will (at least temporarily) require 65536
or more positions instead of the default 256 positions,
i.e., the memory <br>
requirements of dvips will be somewhat larger. If you find
this unacceptable or encounter another problem with the
Omega or pTeX extensions, you can switch off the pTeX <br>
extension by using -noptex, or both by using -noomega (but
please do send a bug report if you find such problems - see
the bug address in the AUTHORS section below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o name <br>
The output will be sent to file name If no file name is
given (i.e., -o is last on the command line), the default
name is file.ps where the .dvi file was called file.dvi;
<br>
if this option isn&rsquo;t given, any default in the
configuration file is used. If the first character of the
supplied output file name is an exclamation mark, then the
<br>
remainder will be used as an argument to popen; thus,
specifying !lpr as the output file will automatically queue
the file for printing. This option also disables the <br>
automatic reading of the PRINTER environment variable, and
turns off the automatic sending of control D if it was
turned on with the -F option or in the configuration <br>
file; use -F after this option if you want both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O offset <br>
Move the origin by a certain amount. The offset is a
comma-separated pair of dimensions, such as .1in,-.3cm (in
the same syntax used in the papersize special). The
ori&acirc; <br>
gin of the page is shifted from the default position (of one
inch down, one inch to the right from the upper left corner
of the paper) by this amount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p num The first page printed
will be the first one numbered num. Default is the first
page in the document. If the num is prefixed by an equals
sign, then it (and any argument <br>
to the -l option) is treated as a sequence number, rather
than a value to compare with no matter what the pages are
actually numbered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pp pagelist <br>
A comma-separated list of pages and ranges (a-b) may be
given, which will be interpreted as may be specified or all
pages and page ranges can be specified with one -pp
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P printername <br>
Sets up the output for the appropriate printer. This is
implemented by reading in config.printername , which can
then set the output pipe (as in, !lpr -Pprintername as <br>
well as the font paths and any other config.ps defaults for
that printer only. Note that config.ps is read before
config.printername In addition, another file called <br>
~/.dvipsrc is searched for immediately after config.ps; this
file is intended for user defaults. If no -P command is
given, the environment variable PRINTER is checked. <br>
If that variable exists, and a corresponding configuration
file exists, that configuration file is read in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Run in quiet mode.
Don&rsquo;t chatter about pages converted, etc.; report
nothing but errors to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Stack pages in reverse order.
Normally, page 1 will be printed first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R[0|1|2] <br>
Run securely. -R2 disables both shell command execution in
cial&rsquo;{} (via backticks &lsquo; ) and config files (via
the E option), and opening of any absolute filenames. -R1
<br>
, the default, forbids shell escapes but allows absolute
filenames. -R0 allows both. The config file option is z</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Causes the entire global
output to be enclosed in a save/restore pair. This causes
the file to not be truly conformant, and is thus not
recommended, but is useful if you <br>
are driving the printer directly and don&rsquo;t care too
much about the portability of the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S num Set the maximum number of
pages in each &lsquo;section&rsquo;. This option is most
commonly used with the -i option; see that documentation
above for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t papertype <br>
This sets the paper type to papertype. The papertype should
be defined in one of the configuration files, along with the
appropriate code to select it. (Currently known <br>
types include letter, legal, ledger, a4, a3). You can also
specify -t landscape, which rotates a document by 90
degrees. To rotate a document whose size is not letter, <br>
you can use the -t option twice, once for the page size, and
once for landscape. You should not use any -t option when
the DVI file already contains a papersize special, <br>
as is done by some LaTeX packages, notably hyperref.sty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The upper left corner of each
page in the .dvi file is placed one inch from the left and
one inch from the top. Use of this option is highly
dependent on the configura&acirc; <br>
tion file. Note that executing the letter or a4 or other
PostScript operators cause the document to be nonconforming
and can cause it not to print on certain printers, so <br>
the paper size should not execute such an operator if at all
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T papersize <br>
Set the paper size to the given pair of dimensions. This
option takes its arguments in the same style as -O. It
overrides any paper size special in the dvi file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u psmapfile <br>
Set psmapfile to be the file that dvips uses for looking up
PostScript font aliases. If psmapfile begins with a +
character, then the rest of the name is used as the name
<br>
of the map file, and the map file is appended to the list of
map files (instead of replacing the list). In either case,
if psmapfile has no extension, then .map is added <br>
at the end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Disable a PostScript virtual
memory saving optimization that stores the character metric
information in the same string that is used to store the
bitmap information. This <br>
is only necessary when driving the Xerox 4045 PostScript
interpreter. It is caused by a bug in that interpreter that
results in &lsquo;garbage&rsquo; on the bottom of each
character. <br>
Not recommended unless you must drive this printer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print the dvips version
number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Download non-resident
PostScript fonts as bitmaps. This requires use of
&lsquo;gsftopk&rsquo; or &lsquo;pstopk&rsquo; or some other
such program(s) in order to generate the required bitmap
<br>
fonts; these programs are supplied with dvips.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x num Set the magnification
ratio to num/1000. Overrides the magnification specified in
the .dvi file. Must be between 10 and 100000. Instead of an
integer, num may be a real <br>
number for increased precision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X num Set the horizontal
resolution in dots per inch to num.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y num Set the magnification
ratio to num/1000 times the magnification specified in the
.dvi file. See -x above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y num Set the vertical
resolution in dots per inch to num.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Pass html hyperdvi specials
through to the output for eventual distillation into PDF.
This is not enabled by default to avoid including the header
files unnecessarily, <br>
and use of temporary files in creating the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z Causes bitmapped fonts to be
compressed before they are downloaded, thereby reducing the
size of the PostScript font-downloading information.
Especially useful at high <br>
resolutions or when very large fonts are used. Will slow
down printing somewhat, especially on early 68000-based
PostScript printers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Dvipsk uses the same environment variables and algorithms
for finding font files as TeX and its friends do. See the
documentation for the Kpathsea library for details.
(Repeat&acirc; <br>
ing it here is too cumbersome.)</p>
