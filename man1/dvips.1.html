dvips - convert a TeX DVI file to PostScript
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>dvips</b> [<i>OPTIONS</i>] <i>file</i>[<b>.dvi</b>]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
THIS MAN PAGE IS OBSOLETE! See the Texinfo documentation instead. You can read
  it either in Emacs or with the standalone <b>info</b> program which comes with
  the GNU texinfo distribution as ftp.gnu.org:pub/gnu/texinfo/texinfo*.tar.gz.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program <b>dvips</b> takes a DVI file <i>file</i>[<b>.dvi</b>] produced by
  TeX (or by some other processor such as GFtoDVI) and converts it to
  PostScript, sending the output to a file or directly to a printer. The DVI
  file may be specified without the <b>.dvi</b> extension. Fonts used may either
  be resident in the printer or defined as bitmaps in PK files, or a `virtual'
  combination of both. If the <b>mktexpk</b> program is installed, <b>dvips</b>
  will automatically invoke METAFONT to generate fonts that don't already exist.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For more information, see the Texinfo manual <i>dvips.texi</i>, which should be
  installed somewhere on your system, hopefully accessible through the standard
  Info tree.

      multiple times.</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d num</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set the debug flags. This is intended only for emergencies
      or for unusual fact-finding expeditions; it will work only if <b>dvips</b>
      has been compiled with the DEBUG option. If nonzero, prints additional
      information on standard error. For maximum information, you can use `-1'.
      See the Dvips Texinfo manual for more details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-D num</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set the resolution in dpi (dots per inch) to <i>num</i>.
      This affects the choice of bitmap fonts that are loaded and also the
      positioning of letters in resident PostScript fonts. Must be between 10
      and 10000. This affects both the horizontal and vertical resolution. If a
      high resolution (something greater than 400 dpi, say) is selected, the
      <i>-Z</i> flag should probably also be used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-e num</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Make sure that each character is placed at most this many
      pixels from its `true' resolution-independent position on the page. The
      default value of this parameter is resolution dependent. Allowing
      individual characters to `drift' from their correctly rounded positions by
      a few pixels, while regaining the true position at the beginning of each
      new word, improves the spacing of letters in words.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-E</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">makes <b>dvips</b> attempt to generate an EPSF file with a
      tight bounding box. This only works on one-page files, and it only looks
      at marks made by characters and rules, not by any included graphics. In
      addition, it gets the glyph metrics from the <i>tfm</i> file, so
      characters that lie outside their enclosing <i>tfm</i> box may confuse it.
      In addition, the bounding box might be a bit too loose if the character
      glyph has significant left or right side bearings. Nonetheless, this
      option works well for creating small EPSF files for equations or tables or
      the like. (Note, of course, that <b>dvips</b> output is resolution
      dependent and thus does not make very good EPSF files, especially if the
      images are to be scaled; use these EPSF files with a great deal of
    care.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-f</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Run as a filter. Read the <i>.dvi</i> file from standard
      input and write the PostScript to standard output. The standard input must
      be seekable, so it cannot be a pipe. If you must use a pipe, write a shell
      script that copies the pipe output to a temporary file and then points
      <b>dvips</b> at this file. This option also disables the automatic reading
      of the <i>PRINTER</i> environment variable, and turns off the automatic
      sending of control D if it was turned on with the <i>-F</i> option or in
      the configuration file; use <i>-F</i> after this option if you want
    both.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-F</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Causes Control-D (ASCII code 4) to be appended as the very
      last character of the PostScript file. This is useful when <b>dvips</b> is
      driving the printer directly instead of working through a spooler, as is
      common on extremely small systems. NOTE! DO NOT USE THIS OPTION!</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-G</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Causes <b>dvips</b> to shift non-printing characters to
      higher-numbered positions. This may be useful sometimes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-h name</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Prepend file <i>name</i> as an additional header file.
      (However, if the name is simply `-' suppress all header files from the
      output.) This header file gets added to the PostScript
    <i>userdict</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-i</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Make each section be a separate file. Under certain
      circumstances, <b>dvips</b> will split the document up into `sections' to
      be processed independently; this is most often done for memory reasons.
      Using this option tells <b>dvips</b> to place each section into a separate
      file; the new file names are created replacing the suffix of the supplied
      output file name by a three-digit sequence number. This option is most
      often used in conjunction with the <i>-S</i> option which sets the maximum
      section length in pages. For instance, some phototypesetters cannot print
      more than ten or so consecutive pages before running out of steam; these
      options can be used to automatically split a book into ten-page sections,
      each to its own file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-j</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Download only needed characters from Type 1 fonts. This is
      the default in the current release. Some debugging flags trace this
      operation. You can also control partial downloading on a per-font basis,
      via the <b>psfonts.map</b> file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-k</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Print crop marks. This option increases the paper size
      (which should be specified, either with a paper size special or with the
      <i>-T</i> option) by a half inch in each dimension. It translates each
      page by a quarter inch and draws cross-style crop marks. It is mostly
      useful with typesetters that can set the page size automatically.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-K</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option causes comments in included PostScript
      graphics, font files, and headers to be removed. This is sometimes
      necessary to get around bugs in spoolers or PostScript post-processing
      programs. Specifically, the %%Page comments, when left in, often cause
      difficulties. Use of this flag can cause some included graphics to fail,
      since the PostScript header macros from some software packages read
      portions of the input stream line by line, searching for a particular
      comment. This option has been turned off by default because PostScript
      previewers and spoolers have been getting better.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-l num</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The last page printed will be the first one numbered
      <i>num</i> Default is the last page in the document. If the <i>num</i> is
      prefixed by an equals sign, then it (and any argument to the <i>-p</i>
      option) is treated as a sequence number, rather than a value to compare
      with <i>\count0</i> values. Thus, using <i>-l =9</i> will end with the
      ninth page of the document, no matter what the pages are actually
      numbered.</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-mode mode</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use <i>mode</i> as the Metafont device name for path
      searching and font generation. This overrides any value from configuration
      files. With the default paths, explicitly specifying the mode also makes
      the program assume the fonts are in a subdirectory named <i>mode</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-M</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Turns off the automatic font generation facility. If any

  <dd class="It-tag">Turns off structured comments; this might be necessary on
      some systems that try to interpret PostScript comments in weird ways, or
      on some PostScript printers. Old versions of TranScript in particular
      cannot handle modern Encapsulated PostScript.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-noomega</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This will disable the use of Omega extensions when
      interpreting DVI files. By default, the additional opcodes <i>129</i> and
      <i>134</i> are recognized by dvips as Omega or pTeX extensions and
      interpreted as requests to set 2-byte characters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-noptex</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This will disable the use of pTeX extensions when
      interpreting DVI files. By default, the additional opcodes <i>130</i> and
      <i>135</i> are recognized by dvips as pTeX extensions and interpreted as
      requests to set 3-byte characters, and <i>255</i> as request to change the
      typesetting direction.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The only drawback is that the virtual font array will (at least temporarily)
      require 65536 or more positions instead of the default 256 positions,
      i.e., the memory requirements of dvips will be somewhat larger. If you
      find this unacceptable or encounter another problem with the Omega or pTeX
      extensions, you can switch off the pTeX extension by using <b>-noptex</b>,
      or both by using <b>-noomega</b> (but please do send a bug report if you
      find such problems - see the bug address in the <b>AUTHORS</b> section
      below).</dd>

      is given (i.e., -o is last on the command line), the default name is
      <i>file.ps</i> where the .dvi file was called <i>file.dvi</i>; if this
      option isn't given, any default in the configuration file is used. If the
      first character of the supplied output file name is an exclamation mark,
      then the remainder will be used as an argument to <i>popen</i>; thus,
      specifying <i>!lpr</i> as the output file will automatically queue the
      file for printing. This option also disables the automatic reading of the
      <i>PRINTER</i> environment variable, and turns off the automatic sending
      of control D if it was turned on with the <i>-F</i> option or in the
      configuration file; use <i>-F</i> after this option if you want both.</dd>

      syntax used in the <i>papersize</i> special). The origin of the page is
      shifted from the default position (of one inch down, one inch to the right
      from the upper left corner of the paper) by this amount.</dd>

      is prefixed by an equals sign, then it (and any argument to the <i>-l</i>
      option) is treated as a sequence number, rather than a value to compare
      with <i>\count0</i> values. Thus, using <i>-p =3</i> will start with the

      the output pipe (as in, <i>!lpr -Pprintername</i> as well as the font
      paths and any other <i>config.ps</i> defaults for that printer only. Note
      that <i>config.ps</i> is read before <i>config.printername</i> In
      addition, another file called <i>~/.dvipsrc</i> is searched for
      immediately after <i>config.ps</i>; this file is intended for user
      defaults. If no <i>-P</i> command is given, the environment variable
      <i>PRINTER</i> is checked. If that variable exists, and a corresponding
      configuration file exists, that configuration file is read in.</dd>

      along with the appropriate code to select it. (Currently known types
      include <b>letter</b>, <b>legal</b>, <b>ledger</b>, <b>a4</b>, <b>a3</b>).
      You can also specify <b>-t</b> <b>landscape</b>, which rotates a document
      by 90 degrees. To rotate a document whose size is not letter, you can use
      the <i>-t</i> option twice, once for the page size, and once for
      landscape. You should not use any <i>-t</i> option when the DVI file
      already contains a <i>papersize</i> special, as is done by some LaTeX
      packages, notably hyperref.sty.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The upper left corner of each page in the <i>.dvi</i> file is placed one
      inch from the left and one inch from the top. Use of this option is highly
      dependent on the configuration file. Note that executing the <b>letter</b>
      or <b>a4</b> or other PostScript operators cause the document to be
      nonconforming and can cause it not to print on certain printers, so the
