perlvos - Perl for Stratus VOS
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
This file contains notes for building perl on the Stratus VOS operating system.
  Perl is a scripting or macro language that is popular on many systems. See
  perlbook for a number of good books on Perl.
<div class="Pp"></div>
These are instructions for building Perl from source. This version of Perl is
  not supported on VOS Release 14.2 or earlier releases. If you have a Continuum
  platform running VOS Release 14.3 through 14.7, download Perl from the Stratus
  Anonymous FTP site at
  ftp://ftp.stratus.com/pub/vos/posix/ga/continuum/continuum.html. If you have a
  V Series platform running VOS Release 15.0 or later, or if you have a V Series
  platform running OpenVOS Release 17.0 or later, download Perl from
  ftp://ftp.stratus.com/pub/vos/posix/ga/v-series/v-series.html. The perl
  distribution files on the Stratus anonymous FTP site are stored in a format
  called a &quot;bundled file&quot;. Instructions for unbundling the Perl
  distribution file are at ftp://ftp.stratus.com/pub/vos/utility/utility.html.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are running VOS Release 14.4.1 or later, you can obtain a pre-compiled,
  supported copy of perl by purchasing Release 2.0.1 (or later) of the VOS GNU
  C/C++ and GNU Tools product from Stratus Technologies.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUILDING_PERL_FOR_VOS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUILDING_PERL_FOR_VOS">BUILDING
  PERL FOR VOS</a></h1>
To build perl from its source code on the Stratus Continuum platform, you must
  be have VOS Release 14.5.0 or later, the STCP product, and the GNU C/C++ and
  GNU Tools, Release 2.0.1 or later. On the V Series platform you must have VOS
  Release 15.0.0 or later, and any version of the GNU C/C++ and GNU Tools
  product.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To build full perl using the supplied Configure script and makefiles, change to
  the &quot;vos&quot; subdirectory and type the command
  &quot;compile_full_perl&quot; or &quot;start_process compile_full_perl&quot;.
  This will configure, build, and test perl.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Restrictions_of_Perl_on_VOS"><a class="selflink" href="#Restrictions_of_Perl_on_VOS">Restrictions
  of Perl on VOS</a></h2>
This port of Perl version 5 to VOS prefers Unix-style, slash-separated pathnames
  over VOS-style greater-than-separated pathnames. VOS-style pathnames should
  work in most contexts, but if you have trouble, replace all greater-than
  characters by slash characters. Because the slash character is used as a
  pathname delimiter, Perl cannot process VOS pathnames containing a slash
  character in a directory or file name; these must be renamed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This port of Perl also uses Unix-epoch date values internally. As long as you
  are dealing with ASCII character string representations of dates, this should
  not be an issue. The supported epoch is January 1, 1980 to January 17, 2038.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See the file pod/perlport.pod for more information about the VOS port of Perl.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Handling_of_underflow_and_overflow"><a class="selflink" href="#Handling_of_underflow_and_overflow">Handling
  of underflow and overflow</a></h2>
Prior to VOS Release 14.7.0, VOS does not support automatically mapping
  overflowed floating-point values to +infinity, nor automatically mapping
  underflowed floating-point values to zero, unlike many other platforms. The
  Perl pack function has been modified to perform such mapping in software on
  VOS. Performing other floating-point computations that underflow or overflow
  will probably result in SIGFPE. Don't push your luck.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As of VOS Release 14.7.0 or later, the VOS POSIX runtime sets up the PA-RISC and
  IA-32 hardware floating-point status register so that the overflow and
  underflow exceptions do not trap, but instead automatically convert the result
  to infinity or zero, as appropriate. As of this writing, there are still
  floating-point operations that can trap, for example, subtracting two infinite
  values. This is recorded as suggestion posix-1022, which has been fixed in VOS
  Release 15.2 and higher.

When Perl 5.9.0 is built using the native build process on VOS Release 14.7.0
  and GNU C++/GNU Tools 2.0.2a, all but nine attempted tests either pass or
  result in TODO (ignored) failures. The tests that fail are:
<div class="Pp"></div>
t/io/dup, test 2 t/io/tell, test 28 t/op/pack, test 0 ext/B/t/bytecode, test 1

I'm offering this port &quot;as is&quot;. You can ask me questions, but I can't
  guarantee I'll be able to answer them. There are some excellent books
  available on the Perl language; consult a book seller.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want a supported version of perl for VOS, purchase the VOS GNU C/C++ and
  GNU Tools Release 2.0.1 (or later) product from Stratus Technologies, along
  with a support contract (or from anyone else who will sell you support).
