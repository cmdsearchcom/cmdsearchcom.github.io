<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlvos - Perl for Stratus VOS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
This file contains notes for building perl on the Stratus
VOS operating system. Perl is a scripting or macro language
that is popular on many systems. See perlbook for a number
<br>
of good books on Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are instructions for
building Perl from source. This version of Perl is not
supported on VOS Release 14.2 or earlier releases. If you
have a Continuum platform running <br>
VOS Release 14.3 through 14.7, download Perl from the
Stratus Anonymous FTP site at
ftp://ftp.stratus.com/pub/vos/posix/ga/continuum/continuum.html.
If you have a V Series <br>
platform running VOS Release 15.0 or later, or if you have a
V Series platform running OpenVOS Release 17.0 or later,
download Perl from <br>

ftp://ftp.stratus.com/pub/vos/posix/ga/v-series/v-series.html.
The perl distribution files on the Stratus anonymous FTP
site are stored in a format called a &quot;bundled
file&quot;. <br>
Instructions for unbundling the Perl distribution file are
at ftp://ftp.stratus.com/pub/vos/utility/utility.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are running VOS Release
14.4.1 or later, you can obtain a pre-compiled, supported
copy of perl by purchasing Release 2.0.1 (or later) of the
VOS GNU C/C++ and GNU Tools <br>
product from Stratus Technologies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUILDING PERL FOR VOS <br>
To build perl from its source code on the Stratus Continuum
platform, you must be have VOS Release 14.5.0 or later, the
STCP product, and the GNU C/C++ and GNU Tools, Release <br>
2.0.1 or later. On the V Series platform you must have VOS
Release 15.0.0 or later, and any version of the GNU C/C++
and GNU Tools product.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To build full perl using the
supplied Configure script and makefiles, change to the
&quot;vos&quot; subdirectory and type the command
&quot;compile_full_perl&quot; or &quot;start_process <br>
compile_full_perl&quot;. This will configure, build, and
test perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLING PERL IN VOS <br>
1. If you have built perl using the Configure script, ensure
that you have modify and default write permission to
&quot;&gt;system&gt;ported&quot; and all subdirectories.
Then type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmake install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. While there are currently no
architecture-specific extensions or modules distributed with
perl, the following directories can be used to hold such
files (replace the string <br>
VERSION by the appropriate version number):</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;system&gt;ported&gt;lib&gt;perl5&gt;VERSION&gt;7100
<br>
&gt;system&gt;ported&gt;lib&gt;perl5&gt;VERSION&gt;8000 <br>
&gt;system&gt;ported&gt;lib&gt;perl5&gt;VERSION&gt;i786</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Site-specific perl extensions
and modules can be installed in one of two places. Put
architecture-independent files into:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;system&gt;ported&gt;lib&gt;perl5&gt;site_perl&gt;VERSION</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Put site-specific
architecture-dependent files into one of the following
directories:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;system&gt;ported&gt;lib&gt;perl5&gt;site_perl&gt;VERSION&gt;7100
<br>

&gt;system&gt;ported&gt;lib&gt;perl5&gt;site_perl&gt;VERSION&gt;8000
<br>

&gt;system&gt;ported&gt;lib&gt;perl5&gt;site_perl&gt;VERSION&gt;i786</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. You can examine the @INC
variable from within a perl program to see the order in
which Perl searches these directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING PERL IN VOS <br>
Restrictions of Perl on VOS <br>
This port of Perl version 5 to VOS prefers Unix-style,
slash-separated pathnames over VOS-style
greater-than-separated pathnames. VOS-style pathnames should
work in most <br>
contexts, but if you have trouble, replace all greater-than
characters by slash characters. Because the slash character
is used as a pathname delimiter, Perl cannot process VOS
<br>
pathnames containing a slash character in a directory or
file name; these must be renamed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This port of Perl also uses
Unix-epoch date values internally. As long as you are
dealing with ASCII character string representations of
dates, this should not be an issue. The <br>
supported epoch is January 1, 1980 to January 17, 2038.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the file pod/perlport.pod
for more information about the VOS port of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Handling of underflow and
overflow <br>
Prior to VOS Release 14.7.0, VOS does not support
automatically mapping overflowed floating-point values to
+infinity, nor automatically mapping underflowed
floating-point values <br>
to zero, unlike many other platforms. The Perl pack function
has been modified to perform such mapping in software on
VOS. Performing other floating-point computations that <br>
underflow or overflow will probably result in SIGFPE.
Don&rsquo;t push your luck.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of VOS Release 14.7.0 or
later, the VOS POSIX runtime sets up the PA-RISC and IA-32
hardware floating-point status register so that the overflow
and underflow exceptions do <br>
not trap, but instead automatically convert the result to
infinity or zero, as appropriate. As of this writing, there
are still floating-point operations that can trap, for <br>
example, subtracting two infinite values. This is recorded
as suggestion posix-1022, which has been fixed in VOS
Release 15.2 and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEST STATUS <br>
When Perl 5.9.0 is built using the native build process on
VOS Release 14.7.0 and GNU C++/GNU Tools 2.0.2a, all but
nine attempted tests either pass or result in TODO (ignored)
<br>
failures. The tests that fail are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t/io/dup, test 2 t/io/tell, test
28 t/op/pack, test 0 ext/B/t/bytecode, test 1
ext/Devel/Peek/t/Peek, test 1 ext/Encode/t/enc_module, test
1 ext/IO/t/io_dup, test 2 <br>
lib/ExtUtils/t/MM_Unix, test 94 lib/Net/ing/t/450_service,
test 8</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORT STATUS <br>
I&rsquo;m offering this port &quot;as is&quot;. You can ask
me questions, but I can&rsquo;t guarantee I&rsquo;ll be able
to answer them. There are some excellent books available on
the Perl language; <br>
consult a book seller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want a supported version
of perl for VOS, purchase the VOS GNU C/C++ and GNU Tools
Release 2.0.1 (or later) product from Stratus Technologies,
along with a support <br>
contract (or from anyone else who will sell you
support).</p>
