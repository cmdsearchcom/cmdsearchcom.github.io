<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dtrealms - Displays defaults defined for DNSSEC-Tools</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dtrealms [options] &lt;realm-file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dtrealms manages multiple distinct DNSSEC-Tools rollover
environments running simultaneously. Each rollover
environment, called a realm, is defined in a realms file.
dtrealms <br>
uses this file to determine how the rollover environment
must be initialized such that it can run independently of
the other rollover environments on a particular system. This
<br>
is useful for such things as managing very large collections
of zones, segregating customer zones, and software
tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The realms file may be created
with realminit. Currently, the distinct environment for each
realm must be created manually. It is hoped that a tool will
soon be available to <br>
assist with creating each realm&rsquo;s environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dtrealms isn&rsquo;t necessary
for running multiple realms. However, it does make it easier
to manage multiple realms running consecutively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REALM SETUP <br>
A realm is primarily defined by its entry in a realms file.
Four fields in particular describe where the realm&rsquo;s
files are located and how it runs. These are the
realm&rsquo;s <br>
configuration directory, state directory, realm directory,
and rollrec file. These directories are used to set the
DT_STATEDIR and DT_SYSCONFDIR environment variables, and the
<br>
rollrec file defines which zones are managed by the
realm&rsquo;s rollover manager.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">https://www.dnssec-tools.org/wiki/index.php/Rollover_Realms:_Multiple,_Simultaneous,_Independent_Rollover_Environments
has more information on creating realms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">configdir <br>
The configdir field of the realms file contains the name of
the realm&rsquo;s configuration directory. This file gives
command paths and configuration values for running the <br>
DNSSEC-Tools. The DNSSEC-Tools modules expects this
directory hierarchy to contain a dnssec-tools subdirectory,
and a dnssec-tools.conf file within that subdirectory. The
<br>
path fields in the configuration file point to various
things, such as commands and key archives. It is recommended
that these paths only point within the configdir <br>
hierarchy, other than for system utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DT_SYSCONFDIR environment
variable is set to the configdir field. This will tell the
DNSSEC-Tools programs and modules where to find their
required data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">statedir <br>
The statedir field of the realms file contains the name of
the realm&rsquo;s state directory. This directory contains
such files as the rollrec lock file and the rollerd <br>
communications socket. If a realm definition does not
contain a statedir field, then that realm will use the
configdir field as its statedir field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DT_STATEDIR environment
variable is set to the statedir field. This will tell the
DNSSEC-Tools programs and modules where to find these
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">realmdir <br>
The realmdir field of the realms file contains the name of
the directory in which the realm executes. This is where the
realm&rsquo;s zone, key, and other files are located.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rollrec <br>
The rollrec field of the realms file is the name of the file
that controls zone rollover. This file points to the various
keyrec files that define the locations of the zone <br>
files and their associated key files. A realm&rsquo;s
rollrec file can locate these files anywhere on the system,
but it is strongly recommended that they all remain within
the <br>
realm&rsquo;s realmdir hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While the DNSSEC-Tools programs
will work fine if a realm&rsquo;s configuration, state, and
realm directories are actually one directory, it is
recommended that at the least the <br>
realmdir files be separated from the configdir and statedir
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is further recommended that
the files for the various realms be segregated from each
other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are handled by dtrealms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-directory <br>
Directory in which dtrealms will be executed. Any relative
paths given in realms configuration files will use this
directory as their base.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display <br>
Start the grandvizier display program to give a graphical
indication of realm status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-foreground <br>
Run dtrealms in the foreground instead of as a daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-logfile <br>
Logging file to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-loglevel <br>
Logging level to use when writing to the log file. See
rolllog(3) for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-logtz <br>
Time zone to use with the log file. This must be either
&quot;gmt&quot; or &quot;local&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Version <br>
Displays the version information for dtrealms and the
DNSSEC-Tools package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help <br>
Displays a help message and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
This is an early prototype. Consider it to be beta
quality.</p>
