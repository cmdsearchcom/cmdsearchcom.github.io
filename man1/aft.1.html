<p>aft(1) General Commands Manual aft(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
aft - &quot;free form&quot; document preparation system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
aft [--verbose] [--autonumber] [--output=file | --output=-]
[--type=output-type] infile ..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
AFT is a nearly free format documentation system which can
be typed in using any editor or wordprocessor that supports
tabs or hard spaces (column-based spaces whose number <br>
doesn&rsquo;t shrink or grow based on formatting). By using
AFT, you are no longer constrained to one wordprocessing
file standard (such as Microsoft Word), nor do you have to
enter a <br>
plethora of weird syntactical incantations of an embedded
mark up language (such as LaTeX or HTML).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike other mark up languages,
AFT is designed to parse and recognize patterns rather than
formal commands. That is why there is no single escape or
command sequence that tells <br>
AFT what to do. In this regard, AFT will process almost
anything you throw at it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An AFT document is easily
converted into such popular formats as HTML, RTF and LaTeX.
Because there are few commands, learning to write a document
in AFT requires little effort. <br>
This doesn&rsquo;t mean that AFT is not powerful. In fact,
this very document was conceived and written using AFT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
Running AFT is as simple as typing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aft NAME_OF_YOUR_FILE.aft</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--verbose <br>
Generate a lot of commentary. By default, AFT will just
silently process files (unless errors occur). Using this
option causes AFT to keep you informed about what it is <br>
doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--autonumber <br>
This switch tells AFT to automatically number your
sections.--output=file |</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--output=- <br>
This tells AFT where to send its processed output. You can
supply a filename (file) or - which tells AFT to write to
your standard output (your display or stdout).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--type=output_type <br>
This tells AFT what type of output to do. For example HTML
output is used for html and DocBook output is used for
docbook. As a side effect, this will also specify the <br>
file name extension for the output file if the --output
option isn&rsquo;t specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">infile .. <br>
One or more AFT documents to be processed.</p>
