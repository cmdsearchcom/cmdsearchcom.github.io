Older, centralized version-control systems such as CVS and SVN centralize a
  repository on one host and identify users by their account names on that host.
  Distributed version-control systems such as git and Mercurial identify users
  by a netwide-unique ID consisting of a name-among-humans followed by an email
  address.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When moving a repository from a centralized to a distributed system, therefore,
  one of the prerequisites is a contributor map that associates each account
  name on the old system to a DVCS-style ID on the new one. This tool automates
  parts of that process.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The main argument file must be a contributor map such as is read by the
  <b>authors read</b> subcommand of <b>reposurgeon</b>(1). It may be a fresh or
  stub map, produced by <b>authors write</b> before any human-name or email
  information has been added to the repository. Or it may have name-among-humans
  and email information filled in for some entries.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A stub map entry looks something like this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
foonly = foonly &lt;foonly&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The same entry, fully filled in, might look something like this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
foonly = Fred Foonly &lt;foonly@fubar.net&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default behavior of the tool is to report all map entries, in effect a
  sorting copy of the file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With -i, it reports only entries that are not yet in DVCS form - that is, either
  the fullname field on the right side of the equals sign is identical to the
  account name on the left, or the email field contains no @-sign, or both.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With the -p option, this tool fills in the full-name field using the password
  file given as the option's argument. Only the username and the comment (or
  'gecos') field containing the user's name-among-humans are used. Other fields
  are ignored, including the password-hash field. (On modern Unixes this field
  does not contain the actual hash, which lives in a different file named
  /etc/shadow, so /etc/passwd can be shared without security risk.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the -p mode, for each entry in the contrib file the program looks for a
  username in the password file matching the name to the left of the equal sign.
  If a match is found, the user's name-among-humans is extracted from the gecos
  field and replaces the text between the &#x201C;=&#x201D; and the
  &#x201C;&lt;&#x201D;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Thus, the stub line above and the /etc/passwd line
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
foonly:x:1000:1000:Fred Foonly,,,:/home/foonly:/bin/bash
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
will combine to produce this on output:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
foonly = Fred Foonly &lt;foonly&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that the email-address part (and, if present, the optional trailing
  timezone field) are not normally modified.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, if the -h option is given, the argument is taken to be a host name
  which should be appended (after a @) to every email field that does not
  already contain a @. The argument would typically be the fully-qualified
  domain name of the repository host.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Thus, if the passwd file still contains an entry for every committer (which
  might not be the case if inactive committer accounts were ever removed), -p
  mode combined with an -h option can produce an entire, valid contributor map.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the -u mode of operation, the option argument must be a second contributor
  file, which is taken as a source of updates. Each contributor entry with a
  username not matching any in the first contributor map is copied into the
  first map, which is output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Output from this tool is always a contrib map sorted by username.
