<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
repomapper - update and manipulate contributor maps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
repomapper [-i] [-p passwordfile] [-u updatefile] [-h host]
contribmap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Older, centralized version-control systems such as CVS and
SVN centralize a repository on one host and identify users
by their account names on that host. Distributed <br>
version-control systems such as git and Mercurial identify
users by a netwide-unique ID consisting of a
name-among-humans followed by an email address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When moving a repository from a
centralized to a distributed system, therefore, one of the
prerequisites is a contributor map that associates each
account name on the old system <br>
to a DVCS-style ID on the new one. This tool automates parts
of that process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main argument file must be a
contributor map such as is read by the authors read
subcommand of reposurgeon(1). It may be a fresh or stub map,
produced by authors write before <br>
any human-name or email information has been added to the
repository. Or it may have name-among-humans and email
information filled in for some entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A stub map entry looks something
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foonly = foonly
&lt;foonly&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same entry, fully filled in,
might look something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foonly = Fred Foonly
&lt;foonly@fubar.net&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default behavior of the tool
is to report all map entries, in effect a sorting copy of
the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -i, it reports only entries
that are not yet in DVCS form - that is, either the fullname
field on the right side of the equals sign is identical to
the account name on the <br>
left, or the email field contains no @-sign, or both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the -p option, this tool
fills in the full-name field using the password file given
as the option&rsquo;s argument. Only the username and the
comment (or &rsquo;gecos&rsquo;) field containing <br>
the user&rsquo;s name-among-humans are used. Other fields
are ignored, including the password-hash field. (On modern
Unixes this field does not contain the actual hash, which
lives in <br>
a different file named /etc/shadow, so /etc/passwd can be
shared without security risk.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the -p mode, for each entry
in the contrib file the program looks for a username in the
password file matching the name to the left of the equal
sign. If a match is found, the <br>
user&rsquo;s name-among-humans is extracted from the gecos
field and replaces the text between the &acirc;=&acirc; and
the &acirc;&lt;&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus, the stub line above and
the /etc/passwd line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foonly:x:1000:1000:Fred
Foonly,,,:/home/foonly:/bin/bash</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will combine to produce this on
output:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foonly = Fred Foonly
&lt;foonly&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the email-address part
(and, if present, the optional trailing timezone field) are
not normally modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if the -h option is
given, the argument is taken to be a host name which should
be appended (after a @) to every email field that does not
already contain a @. The <br>
argument would typically be the fully-qualified domain name
of the repository host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus, if the passwd file still
contains an entry for every committer (which might not be
the case if inactive committer accounts were ever removed),
-p mode combined with an -h <br>
option can produce an entire, valid contributor map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the -u mode of operation, the
option argument must be a second contributor file, which is
taken as a source of updates. Each contributor entry with a
username not matching any <br>
in the first contributor map is copied into the first map,
which is output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output from this tool is always
a contrib map sorted by username.</p>
