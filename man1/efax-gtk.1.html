<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
efax-gtk - GUI front end for efax program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
efax-gtk [options] [ file ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options: [-rs] <br>
-r Start the program in receive standby mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Start the program hidden in
the system tray</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COPYRIGHT <br>
Efax-gtk is Copyright (C) Chris Vine, 2001 - 2008. It is
released under the General Public License, version 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
efax-gtk is a GTK+ front end for the efax program. It can be
used to send and receive faxes with a fax modem, and to
view, print and manage faxes received. It also provides a
<br>
socket interface to provide a &quot;virtual printer&quot;
for sending faxes from word processors and similar programs,
and can automatically e-mail a received fax to a designated
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The efax-gtk distribution
compiles and installs a patched version of efax-0.9a-001114,
so you do not need to separately build and install efax. In
particular, the version of <br>
efax supplied with efax-gtk provides internationalization
support, and resolves certain difficulties with locales in
the standard distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To avoid name conflicts the
patched versions of efax and efix are installed as efax-0.9a
and efix-0.9a. If you want to use the standard distributions
of efax, delete efax-0.9a <br>
and efix-0.9a, and then make a symbolic link from efax to
efax-0.9a and from efix to efix-0.9a so that efax-gtk can
find them. efax-0.9 or higher is recommended, although the
<br>
program will work with older versions of efax - with older
versions, some automatic configuration options will not be
available and the different lock file semantics means that a
<br>
binary and not UUCP lock file will be created, which may
confuse some other programs trying to access the same serial
port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any files to be faxed must be in
postscript format, which is the generic printer format for
Unix/Linux systems. The program will use ghostscript to
convert these into the Group <br>
3 fax format which the fax modem will understand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
A file may be passed as an argument to the program, in which
case that file will automatically appear in the &quot;File
to send&quot; box when the program starts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USE <br>
The first time you use the program, you will be asked if you
accept the terms of the General Public Licence, version
2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sending faxes <br>
Before sending a fax, the name of the file to be sent must
be specified in the &quot;File to fax&quot; box. The file
specified must be in postscript format, and will be
converted by the <br>
program into the correct tiffg3 fax format. It can be
entered manually in the &quot;Fax to send&quot; box, or
entered by means of the file selection dialog. If the file
comprises a sin&acirc; <br>
gle postscript file, then you can find it by pressing the
&quot;Single File&quot; button. It can be more easily found
with this dialog if it is placed in the $HOME/faxout
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where more than one file is
specified in the &quot;Fax to send&quot; box, they will be
sent as a single fax appended in the order in which they are
entered in the box. Such multiple files <br>
can be more easily selected using the file list brought up
by pressing the &quot;Multiple Files&quot; button. Pressing
the &quot;Multiple Files&quot; button enables files to be
found and added to <br>
the file list, and they can be reordered by using the Up or
Down arrow buttons, or by dragging and dropping with the
mouse. (If entering multiple files manually rather than by
<br>
means of the &quot;Multiple Files&quot; dialog, use a
&lsquo;,&Acirc;&acute; or a &lsquo;;&Acirc;&acute; as the
file name separator.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The telephone number to which
the fax is to be sent is entered into the &quot;Tel
number&quot; box. This can be entered directly into the box,
or by using the built-in addressbook. The <br>
addressbook can be invoked by pressing the &quot;Tel
number&quot; button, or from the &lsquo;File/Address
book&Acirc;&acute; pull-down menu item. See &quot;Using the
address book&quot; further below. However, if a <br>
telephone connection has already been established with the
remote fax receiver, then the fax can be sent without
dialing by leaving the &quot;Tel number&quot; box blank (a
dialog will come <br>
up asking if you would like to send the fax without dialing
- this does the same thing as &lsquo;fax send -m
...&Acirc;&acute; using the efax &lsquo;fax&Acirc;&acute;
script from the command line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a fax is received from the
print system via the socket server, the program settings can
be configured to bring up a dialog automatically. If the
program is inactive or is <br>
standing-by to receive faxes the fax can be sent directly
from this dialog without the need to invoke the list of
queued faxes received from the socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Successfully sent faxes are
copied to a directory in the $HOME/faxsent directory, which
has a name derived from the year, month, day, hour and
seconds when the sending of the fax <br>
was completed, and will appear in the faxes sent list. They
are only included in that list if they have been sent
without error. The efax message display box will report on
the <br>
progress of a fax being sent. The fax list can be brought up
from the &lsquo;File/List sent faxes&Acirc;&acute; pull down
menu item. See &quot;Using the fax lists&quot; further
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program can send a fax when
it is in receive standby mode. If sending a fax from receive
standby mode, when the fax has been sent (or there is an
error in sending the fax), <br>
the program will return to receive standby mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make sending faxes from word
processors easy, a socket server is provided interfacing
directly with the print system. See below for further
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ordinary ascii text files can be
converted into postscript if required using a number of
programs, of which probably the easiest to use are nenscript
or GNU enscript (&lsquo;man <br>
enscript&Acirc;&acute;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Receiving faxes <br>
Three ways of receiving faxes are provided for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, the program can be set to
answer a fax call which is ringing but has not been
answered, by pressing the &quot;Answer call&quot;
button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Secondly, the program can take
over a call which has already been answered (say, by a
telephone hand set) by pressing the &quot;Take over
call&quot; button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thirdly, the program can be
placed in standby mode by pressing the &quot;Standby&quot;
button. This will automatically answer any call after the
number of rings specified in the efax- <br>
gtkrc file, and receive the fax. The program will keep on
receiving faxes until the &quot;Stop&quot; button is
pressed. A fax can also be sent when the program is in
receive standby <br>
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Received faxes in tiffg3 format
(one file for each page) are placed in a directory in the
$HOME/faxin directory, which has a name derived from the
year, month, day, hour and sec&acirc; <br>
onds when the relevant &quot;Answer call&quot;, &quot;Take
over call&quot; or &quot;Standby&quot; button was pressed.
(Where in standby mode after a fax has been received, any
further fax will derive its <br>
name from the time when receipt of the last received fax has
been completed and the program goes back into standby
mode.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Received faxes can be printed,
viewed, described and managed using the built in fax list
facility. This can be brought up from the &lsquo;File/List
received faxes&Acirc;&acute; pull down menu <br>
item. See &quot;Using the fax lists&quot; further below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a fax is received, a pop-up
dialog can also be set to appear (go to the Settings dialog
to do this).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the settings dialog you can
also specify a program to be executed whenever a fax is
received. The fax ID number is passed as the first (and
only) argument to the program, <br>
which enables the program to find the fax in $HOME/faxin.
The distribution contains two executable scripts, mail_fax
and print_fax, which can be used to e-mail a fax to a user
<br>
or print a fax automatically when it is received. (These
scripts are not installed by &lsquo;make
install&Acirc;&acute; - if you want to use them, make them
executable with &lsquo;chmod +x&Acirc;&acute; and copy <br>
them to a directory which is in the system path, such as
/usr/local/bin, and then specify the script name in the
settings dialog).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the address book <br>
To pick a telephone number from the address book, highlight
the relevant address by pressing the left mouse button over
it, and then press the &quot;OK&quot; button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Addresses can be added to the
address book by pressing the add button, and then completing
the relevant dialog which will appear. To delete an address
from the address book, <br>
highlight the relevant address and press the delete
(trashcan) button. The addressbook can be sorted by using
the up and down arrow buttons on a highlighted address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Addresses are stored in file
&lsquo;$HOME/.efax-gtk_addressbook&Acirc;&acute;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the fax lists <br>
To bring up the fax lists, go to the the
&lsquo;File&Acirc;&acute; menu and pick the &lsquo;List
received faxes&Acirc;&acute; or &lsquo;List sent
faxes&Acirc;&acute; menu item. Highlight the fax to printed
or viewed by pressing the <br>
left mouse button. The programs to be used to print and view
the fax are specifed in the efax-gtkrc configuration file,
or if none are specified, the program will print using <br>
lpr (which will work for most Unix systems) and view with
gv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To print faxes, a PRINT_SHRINK
parameter can be specifed in efax-gtkrc to enable the fax
page to fit within the printer margins. A parameter of 98
will work with most printers. <br>
This can be changed while the program is running by bringing
up the &lsquo;Settings&Acirc;&acute; dialog and entering it
into the &lsquo;Print/Print Shrink&Acirc;&acute; box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A fax can be deleted from a fax
list by pressing the delete (trashcan) button. This will
place the deleted fax in the &lsquo;Trash&Acirc;&acute;
folder. If the delete (trashcan) button is pressed <br>
in relation to a fax in the &lsquo;Trash&Acirc;&acute;
folder, it will be deleted from the file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A description can be added to a
received fax when appearing in a fax list (or subsequently
amended) by pressing the relevant button -- this will enable
faxes to be more easily <br>
identified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The received faxes list will
show, at the far right of the tool bar, the number of faxes
received since the program was last started. If efax-gtk is
in receive standby mode, the <br>
&quot;tooltips&quot; for the program&rsquo;s icon in the
system tray will also indicate this number. The count can be
reset to 0 without restarting the program by pressing the
reset button in <br>
the received faxes list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Settings <br>
The program settings can be changed by manually editing the
efax-gtk configuration file comprising $HOME/.efax-gtkrc,
$sysconfdir/efax-gtkrc or /etc/efax-gtkrc. The file is <br>
searched for in that order, so $HOME/.efax-gtkrc takes
precedence over the other two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration file can also
be set by using the Settings dialog launched from the
&lsquo;File/Settings&Acirc;&acute; pull down menu item. The
settings entered using this dialog are always <br>
stored as $HOME/.efax-gtkrc. Accordingly, if the Settings
dialog has been used, and you want to revert to the global
settings, this can be done either by deleting the <br>
$HOME/.efax-gtkrc file, or by pressing the
&lsquo;Reset&Acirc;&acute; button in the Settings dialog,
which will reload the Settings dialog from the global
configuration file ($sysconfdir/efax-gtkrc <br>
or /etc/efax-gtkrc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help can be obtained when
filling out the Settings dialog by holding the mouse over
the relevant help (?) button, which will bring up a
&quot;Tips&quot; display, or by pressing the button, <br>
which will bring up an information display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGGING <br>
Errors and warnings from efax are displayed in red in the
application text window, and information messages and
reports on the progress of negotiations and on fax status
are dis&acirc; <br>
played in black in the window. In addition, these messages
are sent to stderr and stdout respectively. Accordingly, fax
status can be logged by redirecting stderr and stdout to
<br>
a log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an alternative, a log file
can also be maintained by setting the LOG_FILE parameter in
the efax-gtkrc configuration file, or by entering a log file
name via the Settings dia&acirc; <br>
log. If no log file is specified, no log file will be
maintained. If a log file is specified, then it can be
viewed from the &quot;Log&quot; pull-down menu, and if
efax-gtk is compiled <br>
against GTK+-2.10 or greater, the log file can also be
printed from the pull-down menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING WITH A WORD PROCESSOR <br>
Printing to file from the program itself <br>
Probably the simplest way of using the program with a word
processor is to print to file from the print dialog of the
word processor program concerned, and choosing a file name
<br>
in the $HOME/faxout directory which can then be selected
with the file selector dialog in efax-gtk. All Unix/Linux
word and document processing programs will print to file in
<br>
Postscript format, ready to be faxed by efax-gtk. (At least,
if there is one which does not, I do not know of it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Printing via CUPS <br>
Efax-gtk can run a socket server, which CUPS can connect to.
When the socket server is running, fax files received from
CUPS will automatically be displayed in a &quot;Queued faxes
<br>
from socket&quot; list maintained by efax-gtk. From this
list, a fax can be selected for sending by efax-gtk, so
there is no need to print to file from the word processor
and then <br>
select the file with the file selection dialog in
efax-gtk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a fax is received in this
way from the print system via the socket, the program
settings can also be configured to bring up a dialog
automatically. If the program is inac&acirc; <br>
tive or is standing-by to receive faxes, the fax can be sent
directly from this dialog without the need to invoke the
list of queued faxes received from the socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are using CUPS and you
want to connect it directly to efax-gtk as mentioned above,
you can do so by bringing up the fax administration page for
CUPS in a web browser, <br>
installing a new printer with a name of &quot;fax&quot; (or
whatever other name you want), choose the IPP protocol, pick
a URI of &quot;socket://[hostname]:[port]&quot;, and choose
the &quot;Raw&quot; CUPS <br>
printer driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The port number can be any port
number less than 65536 and more than 1023 which is not used
by any other service on your machine/network (this can be
checked out by using nmap, <br>
but it is best to avoid any listed in /etc/services). For
example, as you will usually be printing from a local
computer, if you choose a port number of 9900 (which would
be <br>
quite reasonable) the URI would be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">socket://localhost:9900</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an alternative, rather easier
than the web interface is adding a new CUPS virtual printer
for efax-gtk by using lpadmin. To do this, log in as
whatever user has appropriate <br>
permissions (usually root) and do it from the command line
with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/sbin/lpadmin -p FaxPrinter
-E -v socket://localhost:9900</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That will create a printer name
for efax-gtk called FaxPrinter for a case where efax-gtk is
listening on port 9900.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should then start efax-gtk,
go to the Socket tab in the settings dialog, check the
&quot;Run socket server&quot; box, and enter 9900 in the
&quot;Port to which faxes to be sent&quot; box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To send a fax from the
&quot;Queued faxes from socket&quot; dialog, highlight the
one to be sent, press the &quot;Enter selected fax to
send&quot; button in the dialog (the one with an icon
repre&acirc; <br>
senting a fax machine) which will enter the fax in the
&quot;File to fax&quot; box in efax-gtk, and then choose a
telephone number to send it to and press the &quot;Send
fax&quot; button in the <br>
ordinary way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If efax-gtk isn&rsquo;t running
when you attempt to send a file via CUPS to efax-gtk
don&rsquo;t worry. CUPS will queue the fax until it detects
that the efax-gtk socket server is running, <br>
and then send it to efax-gtk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where a fax is queued for
sending in the socket list, a small red circle will appear
in the main program window on the right hand side of the
&quot;Fax to send&quot; box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Printing via lpd/lprng <br>
The socket server can also be used in the same way with
lpd/lprng. The files efax-gtk-faxfilter and
efax-gtk-socket-client are installed in /var/spool/fax, when
you run &lsquo;make <br>
install&Acirc;&acute; (the installation directory can be
changed at the ./configure stage using the &quot;./configure
--spooldir=[dir]&quot; parameter. You should add at the end
of /etc/printcap the <br>
following -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fax: :sd=/var/spool/fax: :mx#0:
:sh: :lp=/dev/null:
:if=/var/spool/fax/efax-gtk-faxfilter:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will cause a printer by the
name of &quot;fax&quot; to be available, which (if printed
to) will send the file to the efax-gtk socket server. If you
set efax-gtk to listen on a port <br>
other than port 9900, you will need to amend the file
/var/spool/fax/efax-gtk-faxfilter by hand to specify the
correct port number on which efax-gtk is listening.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t forget to restart
the lpd printer daemon after amending /etc/printcap. (An
equivalent addition to /etc/printcap can also be made by
using the printer configuration tool <br>
with your distribution, choosing a printer name of
&quot;fax&quot; (or whatever other name you want), choosing
a printer device of &quot;/dev/null&quot;, a spool directory
of &quot;/var/spool/fax&quot; and an <br>
input filter of
&quot;/var/spool/fax/efax-gtk-faxfilter&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSTEM TRAY <br>
Efax-gtk has been written so that it will sit in the system
tray in GNOME and KDE when the program is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From the system tray, the
program can be hidden and raised again by left-clicking with
the mouse on the icon, and right-clicking on it will bring
up a menu from which certain <br>
program operations can be performed. A
&lsquo;tips&Acirc;&acute; display will also indicate the
program state if the mouse is left hovering over the
efax-gtk icon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clicking on the top right
(delete) button of the window frame will not cause the
program to terminate if the program is embedded in the
system tray. Instead it will hide it in <br>
the tray. If you want to close the program when it is
embedded in the tray, either select the &quot;Quit&quot;
menu item in the system tray efax-gtk menu, or select the
&quot;Quit&quot; menu item <br>
in the &quot;File&quot; pull-down menu in the program
toolbar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recent versions of GNOME call
the system tray a &quot;Notification Area&quot;. If your
desktop panel does not have a Notification Area installed,
it can be placed on the panel by right <br>
clicking on the panel, and going to Add to Panel -&gt;
Utility -&gt; Notification Area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WORKING DIRECTORY <br>
A working sub-directory for the storage of
.efax-gtk_addressbook, <br>
.efax-gtk_mainwin_save and .efax-gtk_queued_server_files and
the faxin, faxout, faxsent and efax-gtk-server directories
can be specified in the efax-gtkrc configuration file <br>
with the WORK_SUBDIR: parameter. This working subdirectory
will appear as a subdirectory of $HOME (so if WORK_SUBDIR:
is specified as efax-gtk, $HOME/efax-gtk will be the
work&acirc; <br>
ing directory). If none is specified, which is the default,
then these files/directories will be stored directly in
$HOME (which was what happened before the option was
avail&acirc; <br>
able, so past efax-gtk installations will not be broken if
this option is left unset). The WORK_SUBDIR: parameter
enables these files and folders to be kept together in a
sepa&acirc; <br>
rate directory if wanted. If a WORK_SUBDIR: parameter is
specified, only .efax-gtkrc will appear directly in
$HOME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if you specify a value
for WORK_SUBDIR: in the efax-gtkrc configuration file, you
will need to shift old versions of the files and directories
mentioned above into the <br>
new working directory or efax-gtk will not be able to find
them, so use this option with caution. In addition, if you
wish to use the &quot;print_fax&quot; or
&quot;mail_fax&quot; scripts, you will <br>
need to set the WORK_SUBDIR option in the relevant
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
efax-gtk <br>
The efax-gtk executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">efax-gtk-faxfilter <br>
A filter script for lpd/lprng which will send files to the
