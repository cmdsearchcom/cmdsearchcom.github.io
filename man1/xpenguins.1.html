<p>XPenguins(1) General Commands Manual XPenguins(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xpenguins - cute little penguins that walk along the tops of
your windows</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xpenguins [-option ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
XPenguins is a program for animating cute cartoons/animals
in your root window. By default it will be penguins - they
drop in from the top of the screen, walk along the tops of
<br>
your windows, up the side of your windows, levitate,
skateboard, and do other similarly exciting things. Be
careful when you move windows as the little guys squash
easily. If you <br>
send the program an interupt signal (such as by hitting
Ctrl-C) they will burst. XPenguins is now themeable, so it
is easy to select something else to animate instead of
pen&acirc; <br>
guins, or even (with a little artistic talent) define your
own; see the THEMES section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
In all the following cases a double dash can be replaced by
a single dash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --no-angels <br>
Do not show any cherubim flying up to heaven when a toon
gets squashed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --no-blood <br>
Do not show any gory death sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c dir, --config-dir dir <br>
Look for config files and themes in this directory. The
default is usually /usr/share/xpenguins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d display, --display display
<br>
Send the toons to the specified X display. In the absence of
this option, the display specified by the DISPLAY
environment variable is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print out a message describing the available options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --theme-info <br>
Print out the auxiliary information about a theme and exit.
Use the -t option to select the theme to describe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --list-themes <br>
List the available themes, one on each line, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m delay, --delay delay <br>
Set the delay between each frame in milliseconds. The
default is defined by the theme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n number, --penguins number
<br>
The number of toons to start, up to a maximum of 256. The
default is defined by the theme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --ignorepopups <br>
Toons fall through &lsquo;popup&rsquo; windows (those with
the save-under attribute set), such as tooltips. Note that
this also includes the KDE panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --rectwin <br>
Toons regard all windows as rectangular. This option results
in faster calculation of window positions, but if you use
one of those fancy new window managers with shaped <br>
windows then your toons might sometimes look like
they&rsquo;re walking on thin air.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --squish <br>
Enable the penguins to be squished using any of the mouse
buttons. Note that this disables any existing function of
the mouse buttons on the root window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t theme, --theme theme <br>
Use the named theme. The default is Penguins. If the theme
has spaces in its name then you can use underscores instead,
or alternatively just put the name in double <br>
quotes. This option can be called multiple times to run
several themes simultaneously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Suppress the exit message when an interupt is received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Print out the current version number and quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--all Load all available themes
and run them simultaneously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--id window <br>
Send toons to the window with this ID, instead of the root
window or whichever window is appropriate for the current
desktop environment. Note that the ID of X clients <br>
reported by xwininfo is rarely that of the foremost visible
window that should be used here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nice loadaverage1 loadaverage2
<br>
Start killing toons when the 1-min averaged system load
exceeds loadaverage1; when it exceeds loadaverage2 kill them
all. The toons will reappear when the load average <br>
comes down. The load is checked every 5 seconds by looking
in /proc/loadavg, so this option only works under unices
that implement this particular pseudo file (probably <br>
just Linux). When there are no toons on the screen,
XPenguins uses only a miniscule amount of CPU time - it just
wakes up every 5 seconds to recheck the load.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THEMES <br>
The system themes are usually kept in
/usr/share/xpenguins/themes, and these can be augmented or
overridden by the user&rsquo;s themes in
$HOME/.xpenguins/themes. Each theme has its <br>
own subdirectory which to be valid must contain a file
called config. The name of the theme is taken from the
directory name, although because many install scripts choke
on <br>
directory names containing spaces, all spaces in a theme
name are represented in the directory name by underscores.
Any directory name containing spaces is inaccessible by
xpen&acirc; <br>
guins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the config file,
the theme directory contains the toon images that make up
the theme in the form of xpm image files. Additionally,
there should be an about file <br>
which gives information on the creator of the theme, the
license under which it is distributed and various other
things. This file is principally for use by
xpenguins_applet, an <br>
applet for GNOME that allows different themes to be selected
at the click of a button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The config file has a reasonably
straightforward format. You can either read this rather
terse description of it or you can have a look at the config
file for the default Pen&acirc; <br>
guins theme, which is usually installed at
/usr/share/xpenguins/themes/Penguins/config, and is
reasonably well commented. We&rsquo;ll first establish some
simple terminology. Say you <br>
have a Farmyard theme with cows and sheep. The cows and
sheep are types of toon, while the various things they get
up to (walking, mooing and so on) are termed activities.
Each <br>
activity has its own xpm image file, in which the frames of
the animation are laid out horizontally. Some activities
(notably walking) use different images depending on the <br>
direction the toon is moving in. In this case the frames for
the two directions are laid out one above the other in the
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As in shell scripts, comments
are initiated with the # character and hide the remainder of
the line. The format is entirely free except that there is
an arbitrary limit on the <br>
length of a line of 512 characters. Spaces, tabs and
newlines all count equally as white space. Data is entered
as a sequence of key value pairs, all separated by white
space. <br>
Neither the keys nor the values are case sensitive, except
where the value is a filename. The following keys are
understood:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delay delay <br>
Set the recommended delay between frames in
milliseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">toon toon <br>
Begin defining a new toon called toon. If only one type of
toon is present in the theme then this key may be
omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">number number <br>
Set the default number of toons of the current type to
start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">define activity <br>
Begin defining an activity for the current toon. The
currently understood activities are walker, faller, tumbler,
climber, floater, runner, explosion, squashed, zapped, <br>
splatted, angel, exit and action?, where ? is a number
between 0 and 6. Once you&rsquo;ve seen the program in
action you should be able to guess which is which. A valid
theme <br>
must contain at least walkers and fallers. Additionally, you
may define a default activity (with define default); any
properties (such as width and speed) set here are <br>
then adopted by the activities defined from then on, if they
do not themselves explicitly define those properties. After
an activity has been declared with define, the <br>
following properties may be assigned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pixmap xpmfile <br>
The file containing the image data for the activity. Note
that you may not set a default pixmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">width width <br>
The width of each frame of the animation in pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">height height <br>
The height of each frame of the animation in pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">frames frames <br>
The number of frames in the animation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">directions directions <br>
The number of directions for the activity (can be 1 or
2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">speed speed <br>
The initial speed of the toon when engaged in this activity,
in pixels per frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">acceleration acceleration <br>
The rate at which the speed increases, in pixels per frame
squared. This property is not utilised by all
activities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">terminal_velocity
terminal_velocity <br>
The maximum speed in pixels per frame, again not utilised by
all activities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loop loop <br>
Only understood by the actions; indicates how many times to
repeat the action. If negative, then the probility of
stopping the action every time the action is complete is
<br>
-1/loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some notes regarding the various
activities. If you design a new theme, feel free to make the
splatted, squashed, zapped and exit animations as gory and
bloody as you like, but <br>
please keep the explosion activity nice and tame; that way
those of a nervous disposition can employ the --no-blood
option which replaces all these violent deaths with a
tasteful <br>
explosion that wouldn&rsquo;t offend your grandmother. Xpm
images files are a factor of two smaller if you can limit
the number of colours in the image such that only one
character <br>
need be used to represent each colour; this also makes
XPenguins start up much more rapidly. Rarely are more than
64 colours required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So that&rsquo;s about it for the
config file, now for the about file. This is very simple.
Again comments are initialised by a #. An entry consists of
a key at the start of a line, <br>
followed by the corresponding value which is read up to the
next newline. The following keys are understood, although
none are compulsory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">artist Used to list the
artist(s) who created the original images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maintainer <br>
The person who compiled the images into an XPenguins theme.
It is useful if an email address can also be provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">date The date when the theme was
last modified. My preferred format is day of the month, name
of the month in english, full year. For example: 24 April
2001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">icon The name of an image file
that can be used as an icon for the theme; XPM and PNG are
suitable formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">license The name of the license
under which the theme is distributed (e.g. GPL).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copyright <br>
The year and holder of the copyright.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comment Any other essential
information, such as the theme&rsquo;s web site, as brief as
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please test any about files you
create by looking at how the information is displayed by the
xpenguins_applet program.</p>

the form of the classic xsnow. Most penguin images were
taken from Pingus, a free lemmings clone that can be found
at <br>
&lt;http://pingus.seul.org/&gt;; these images were designed
by Joel Fauche &lt;joel.fauche@wanadoo.fr&gt; and Craig

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
XPenguins can load an X server and/or network (although the
CPU time used is small), and if a large number of penguins
are spawned then they may begin to flicker, depending on
<br>
the speed of the X server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
A new feature since version 2.1 is the ability to draw to
windows other than the root window in situations where the
window manager or desktop environment places a large window
<br>
over the root window that would otherwise obscure the toons.
Currently XPenguins can draw to the KDE Desktop (KDE 2.0 and
2.1), Enlightenment desktops greater than 0 (E16), the <br>
Nautilus desktop and the virtual root window of certain
window managers like amiwm. Of course, simpler window
managers that don&rsquo;t mess around like this will still
work (sawfish, <br>
blackbox and countless others). It cannot work with CDE and
probably never will. Future versions of KDE, Enlightenment
and Nautilus may not work; the classic symptom of this is
<br>
that XPenguins sits there as if it&rsquo;s doing something,
but no toons are visible. If this happens, try running the
program with one of the simpler window manager listed above,
or <br>
visit the XPenguins web site and download the latest
version. If there are icons drawn on the root window then
the toons will erase them when they walk over them, although
an <br>
expose event will be sent to the window every 100 frames to
redraw them.</p>
