xpenguins - cute little penguins that walk along the tops of your windows

<i>XPenguins</i> is a program for animating cute cartoons/animals in your root
  window. By default it will be penguins - they drop in from the top of the
  screen, walk along the tops of your windows, up the side of your windows,
  levitate, skateboard, and do other similarly exciting things. Be careful when
  you move windows as the little guys squash easily. If you send the program an
  interupt signal (such as by hitting Ctrl-C) they will burst. <i>XPenguins</i>
  is now themeable, so it is easy to select something else to animate instead of
  penguins, or even (with a little artistic talent) define your own; see the
  <b>THEMES</b> section below.

      checked every 5 seconds by looking in <i>/proc/loadavg</i>, so this option
      only works under unices that implement this particular pseudo file
      (probably just Linux). When there are no toons on the screen,
      <i>XPenguins</i> uses only a miniscule amount of CPU time - it just wakes
      up every 5 seconds to recheck the load.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THEMES"><a class="selflink" href="#THEMES">THEMES</a></h1>
The system themes are usually kept in <i>/usr/share/xpenguins/themes</i>, and
  these can be augmented or overridden by the user's themes in
  <i>$HOME/.xpenguins/themes</i>. Each theme has its own subdirectory which to
  be valid must contain a file called <i>config</i>. The name of the theme is
  taken from the directory name, although because many install scripts choke on
  directory names containing spaces, all spaces in a theme name are represented
  in the directory name by underscores. Any directory name containing spaces is
  inaccessible by <i>xpenguins</i>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In addition to the <i>config</i> file, the theme directory contains the toon
  images that make up the theme in the form of <i>xpm image files</i>.
  Additionally, there should be an <i>about</i> file which gives information on
  the creator of the theme, the license under which it is distributed and
  various other things. This file is principally for use by
  <i>xpenguins_applet</i>, an applet for <i>GNOME</i> that allows different
  themes to be selected at the click of a button.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <i>config</i> file has a reasonably straightforward format. You can either
  read this rather terse description of it or you can have a look at the config
  file for the default <b>Penguins</b> theme, which is usually installed at
  <i>/usr/share/xpenguins/themes/Penguins/config</i>, and is reasonably well
  commented. We'll first establish some simple terminology. Say you have a
  Farmyard theme with cows and sheep. The cows and sheep are types of
  <b>toon</b>, while the various things they get up to (walking, mooing and so
  on) are termed <b>activities</b>. Each <b>activity</b> has its own <i>xpm
  image file</i>, in which the <b>frames</b> of the animation are laid out
  horizontally. Some activities (notably walking) use different images depending
  on the <b>direction</b> the toon is moving in. In this case the frames for the
  two directions are laid out one above the other in the image.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
As in shell scripts, comments are initiated with the <b>#</b> character and hide
  the remainder of the line. The format is entirely free except that there is an
  arbitrary limit on the length of a line of 512 characters. Spaces, tabs and
  newlines all count equally as white space. Data is entered as a sequence of
  <b>key value</b> pairs, all separated by white space. Neither the <b>keys</b>
  nor the <b>values</b> are case sensitive, except where the <b>value</b> is a
  filename. The following <b>keys</b> are understood:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>delay </b><i>delay</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set the recommended delay between frames in
    milliseconds.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>toon </b><i>toon</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Begin defining a new toon called <i>toon</i>. If only one
      type of toon is present in the theme then this key may be omitted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>number </b><i>number</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set the default number of toons of the current type to
      start.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>define </b><i>activity</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Begin defining an <i>activity</i> for the current toon. The
      currently understood activities are <b>walker</b>, <b>faller</b>,
      <b>tumbler</b>, <b>climber</b>, <b>floater</b>, <b>runner</b>,
      <b>explosion</b>, <b>squashed</b>, <b>zapped</b>, <b>splatted</b>,
      <b>angel</b>, <b>exit</b> and <b>action?</b>, where <b>?</b> is a number
      between <b>0</b> and <b>6</b>. Once you've seen the program in action you
      should be able to guess which is which. A valid theme must contain at
      least <b>walkers</b> and <b>fallers</b>. Additionally, you may define a
      default activity (with <b>define default</b>); any properties (such as
      <b>width</b> and <b>speed</b>) set here are then adopted by the activities
      defined from then on, if they do not themselves explicitly define those
      properties. After an activity has been declared with <b>define</b>, the
      following properties may be assigned:</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>pixmap</b><i> xpmfile</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The file containing the image data for the activity. Note
      that you may not set a <b>default</b> pixmap.</dd>
</dl>

  <dd class="It-tag">The height of each frame of the animation in pixels.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>frames</b><i> frames</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The number of frames in the animation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>directions</b><i> directions</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The number of directions for the activity (can be 1 or
    2).</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>acceleration</b><i> acceleration</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The rate at which the speed increases, in pixels per frame
      squared. This property is not utilised by all activities.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>terminal_velocity</b><i> terminal_velocity</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The maximum speed in pixels per frame, again not utilised

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>loop</b><i> loop</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Only understood by the <b>actions</b>; indicates how many
      times to repeat the action. If negative, then the probility of stopping
      the action every time the action is complete is -1/<i>loop</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some notes regarding the various activities. If you design a new theme, feel
  free to make the <b>splatted</b>, <b>squashed</b>, <b>zapped</b> and
  <b>exit</b> animations as gory and bloody as you like, but please keep the
  <b>explosion</b> activity nice and tame; that way those of a nervous
  disposition can employ the <b>--no-blood</b> option which replaces all these
  violent deaths with a tasteful explosion that wouldn't offend your
  grandmother. Xpm images files are a factor of two smaller if you can limit the
  number of colours in the image such that only one character need be used to
  represent each colour; this also makes <i>XPenguins</i> start up much more
  rapidly. Rarely are more than 64 colours required.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
So that's about it for the <i>config</i> file, now for the <i>about</i> file.
  This is very simple. Again comments are initialised by a <b>#</b>. An entry
  consists of a <b>key</b> at the start of a line, followed by the corresponding
  <b>value</b> which is read up to the next newline. The following <b>keys</b>
  are understood, although none are compulsory.
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  these images were designed by Joel Fauche &lt;joel.fauche@wanadoo.fr&gt; and

<i>XPenguins</i> can load an X server and/or network (although the CPU time used
  is small), and if a large number of penguins are spawned then they may begin
  to flicker, depending on the speed of the X server.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
A new feature since version 2.1 is the ability to draw to windows other than the
  root window in situations where the window manager or desktop environment
  places a large window over the root window that would otherwise obscure the
  toons. Currently <i>XPenguins</i> can draw to the KDE Desktop (KDE 2.0 and
  2.1), Enlightenment desktops greater than 0 (E16), the Nautilus desktop and
  the virtual root window of certain window managers like amiwm. Of course,
  simpler window managers that don't mess around like this will still work
  (sawfish, blackbox and countless others). It cannot work with CDE and probably
  never will. Future versions of KDE, Enlightenment and Nautilus may not work;
  the classic symptom of this is that <i>XPenguins</i> sits there as if it's
  doing something, but no toons are visible. If this happens, try running the
  program with one of the simpler window manager listed above, or visit the
  <i>XPenguins</i> web site and download the latest version. If there are icons
  drawn on the root window then the toons will erase them when they walk over
  them, although an expose event will be sent to the window every 100 frames to
  redraw them.
