<i>Cowsay</i> generates an ASCII picture of a cow saying something provided by
  the user. If run with no arguments, it accepts standard input, word-wraps the
  message given at about 40 columns, and prints the cow saying the given message
  on standard output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To aid in the use of arbitrary messages with arbitrary whitespace, use the
  <b>-n</b> option. If it is specified, the given message will not be
  word-wrapped. This is possibly useful if you want to make the cow think or
  speak in figlet(6). If <b>-n</b> is specified, there must not be any
  command-line arguments left after all the switches have been processed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-W</b> specifies roughly (where the message should be wrapped. The
  default is equivalent to <b>-W 40</b> i.e. wrap words at or before the 40th
  column.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If any command-line arguments are left over after all switches have been
  processed, they become the cow's message. The program will not accept standard
  input for a message in this case.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are several provided modes which change the appearance of the cow
  depending on its particular emotional/physical state. The <b>-b</b> option
  initiates Borg mode; <b>-d</b> causes the cow to appear dead; <b>-g</b>
  invokes greedy mode; <b>-p</b> causes a state of paranoia to come over the
  cow; <b>-s</b> makes the cow appear thoroughly stoned; <b>-t</b> yields a
  tired cow; <b>-w</b> is somewhat the opposite of <b>-t</b>, and initiates
  wired mode; <b>-y</b> brings on the cow's youthful appearance.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The user may specify the <b>-e</b> option to select the appearance of the cow's
  eyes, in which case the first two characters of the argument string
  <i>eye_string</i> will be used. The default eyes are 'oo'. The tongue is
  similarly configurable through <b>-T</b> and <i>tongue_string</i>; it must be
  two characters and does not appear by default. However, it does appear in the
  'dead' and 'stoned' modes. Any configuration done by <b>-e</b> and <b>-T</b>
  will be lost if one of the provided modes is used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-f</b> option specifies a particular cow picture file (``cowfile'') to
  use. If the cowfile spec contains '/' then it will be interpreted as a path
  relative to the current directory. Otherwise, cowsay will search the path
  specified in the <b>COWPATH</b> environment variable. To list all cowfiles on
  the current <b>COWPATH</b>, invoke <b>cowsay</b> with the <b>-l</b> switch.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the program is invoked as <b>cowthink</b> then the cow will think its message
  instead of saying it.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COWFILE_FORMAT"><a class="selflink" href="#COWFILE_FORMAT">COWFILE
  FORMAT</a></h1>
A cowfile is made up of a simple block of <b>perl</b>(1) code, which assigns a
  picture of a cow to the variable <b>$the_cow</b>. Should you wish to customize
  the eyes or the tongue of the cow, then the variables <b>$eyes</b> and
  <b>$tongue</b> may be used. The trail leading up to the cow's message balloon
  is composed of the character(s) in the <b>$thoughts</b> variable. Any
  backslashes must be reduplicated to prevent interpolation. The name of a
  cowfile should end with <b>.cow</b>, otherwise it is assumed not to be a
  cowfile. Also, at-signs (``@'') must be backslashed because that is what Perl
  5 expects.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMPATIBILITY_WITH_OLDER_VERSIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#COMPATIBILITY_WITH_OLDER_VERSIONS">COMPATIBILITY
  WITH OLDER VERSIONS</a></h1>
What older versions? :-)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Version 3.x is fully backward-compatible with 2.x versions. If you're still
  using a 1.x version, consider upgrading. And tell me where you got the older
  versions, since I didn't exactly put them up for world-wide access.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Oh, just so you know, this manual page documents version 3.02 of cowsay.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
The COWPATH environment variable, if present, will be used to search for
  cowfiles. It contains a colon-separated list of directories, much like <b>PATH
  or</b> <b>MANPATH</b>. It should always contain the <b>/usr/share/cowsay</b>
  directory, or at least a directory with a file called <b>default.cow</b> in
  it.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></h1>
<b>/usr/share/cowsay</b> holds a sample set of cowfiles. If your <b>COWPATH</b>
  is not explicitly set, it automatically contains this directory.
