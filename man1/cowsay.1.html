<p>cowsay(1) General Commands Manual cowsay(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cowsay/cowthink - configurable speaking/thinking cow (and a
bit more)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cowsay [-e eye_string] [-f cowfile] [-h] [-l] [-n] [-T
tongue_string] [-W column] [-bdgpstwy]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Cowsay generates an ASCII picture of a cow saying something
provided by the user. If run with no arguments, it accepts
standard input, word-wraps the message given at about 40
<br>
columns, and prints the cow saying the given message on
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To aid in the use of arbitrary
messages with arbitrary whitespace, use the -n option. If it
is specified, the given message will not be word-wrapped.
This is possibly useful if <br>
you want to make the cow think or speak in figlet(6). If -n
is specified, there must not be any command-line arguments
left after all the switches have been processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -W specifies roughly (where
the message should be wrapped. The default is equivalent to
-W 40 i.e. wrap words at or before the 40th column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any command-line arguments
are left over after all switches have been processed, they
become the cow&rsquo;s message. The program will not accept
standard input for a message in <br>
this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several provided modes
which change the appearance of the cow depending on its
particular emotional/physical state. The -b option initiates
Borg mode; -d causes the <br>
cow to appear dead; -g invokes greedy mode; -p causes a
state of paranoia to come over the cow; -s makes the cow
appear thoroughly stoned; -t yields a tired cow; -w is
somewhat <br>
the opposite of -t, and initiates wired mode; -y brings on
the cow&rsquo;s youthful appearance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user may specify the -e
option to select the appearance of the cow&rsquo;s eyes, in
which case the first two characters of the argument string
eye_string will be used. The default <br>
eyes are &rsquo;oo&rsquo;. The tongue is similarly
configurable through -T and tongue_string; it must be two
characters and does not appear by default. However, it does
appear in the <br>
&rsquo;dead&rsquo; and &rsquo;stoned&rsquo; modes. Any
configuration done by -e and -T will be lost if one of the
provided modes is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -f option specifies a
particular cow picture file
(&lsquo;&lsquo;cowfile&rsquo;&rsquo;) to use. If the cowfile
spec contains &rsquo;/&rsquo; then it will be interpreted as
a path relative to the current direc&acirc; <br>
tory. Otherwise, cowsay will search the path specified in
the COWPATH environment variable. To list all cowfiles on
the current COWPATH, invoke cowsay with the -l switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the program is invoked as
cowthink then the cow will think its message instead of
saying it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COWFILE FORMAT <br>
A cowfile is made up of a simple block of perl(1) code,
which assigns a picture of a cow to the variable $the_cow.
Should you wish to customize the eyes or the tongue of the
<br>
cow, then the variables $eyes and $tongue may be used. The
trail leading up to the cow&rsquo;s message balloon is
composed of the character(s) in the $thoughts variable. Any
back&acirc; <br>
slashes must be reduplicated to prevent interpolation. The
name of a cowfile should end with .cow, otherwise it is
assumed not to be a cowfile. Also, at-signs
(&lsquo;&lsquo;@&rsquo;&rsquo;) must be <br>
backslashed because that is what Perl 5 expects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WITH OLDER
VERSIONS <br>
What older versions? :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 3.x is fully
backward-compatible with 2.x versions. If you&rsquo;re still
using a 1.x version, consider upgrading. And tell me where
you got the older versions, since I <br>
didn&rsquo;t exactly put them up for world-wide access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Oh, just so you know, this
manual page documents version 3.02 of cowsay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The COWPATH environment variable, if present, will be used
to search for cowfiles. It contains a colon-separated list
of directories, much like PATH or MANPATH. It should <br>
always contain the /usr/share/cowsay directory, or at least
a directory with a file called default.cow in it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/share/cowsay holds a sample set of cowfiles. If your
COWPATH is not explicitly set, it automatically contains
this directory.</p>
