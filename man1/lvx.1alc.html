<p>LVX(1) ALLIANCE USER COMMANDS LVX(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lvx - Logical Versus eXtracted net-list comparator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lvx format1 format2 filename1 filename2 [ -a ] [ -u ] [ -o ]
[ -f ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
lvx compares two gate-level or block level net-list. The
goal is to compare a specification net-list (logical
net-list), the input to a place and route tool, with the
physical <br>
net-list (extracted net-list) obtained by the cougar(1)
extractor. <br>
The net-list 1 is considered as the logical net-list and
net-list 2 as the extracted net-list. <br>
lvx is an one-level hierarchical tool:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The two net-list are flattened,
if the -f option is present, to the cells contained in the
catalog file. The path to the catalog file is indicated in
the MBK_CATA_LIB(1) <br>
variable for the cell library, and in the MBK_WORK_LIB(1)
variable with the name MBK_CATAL_NAME(1) for user blocks (
catal(5) ) that are not to be flattened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For both net-list, the instances
are considered as black-boxes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The two net-list must have the
same external connectors names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The two net-list must have the
same instances names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The two net-list must have the
same signals names for unconnected signals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The two net-list cannot directly
contain transistors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comparison is performed in three
steps:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compare terminals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compare instances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compare connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compare unconnected signals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an error occurs during first
or second step, a message is immediately displayed and the
third step will not start: lvx cannot compare connections
(signals) if terminals or <br>
instances are not equivalent. <br>
The -o option allows to order connectors if the steps
described before have been reached successfully.
Extracted_netlist is then saved on disk. The file get the
name filename2 <br>
suffixed by the value of MBK_OUT_LO(1) variable. <br>
Routers add automatically empty feed-through cells. These
cells must not be taken into account in the comparison. A
cell that have the F attribute in the catalog file ( catal
<br>
(5) ) is considered as feed-through cell, and are deleted,
in memory, from the net-list where it appears.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a Some routers generate layout with several physical
connectors for power and ground ( VDD or VSS ). If those
connectors are not internally connected, they will have
dif&acirc; <br>
ferent indexed names ( VDD1 , VDD2 etc...) in the extracted
net-list. It is possible to perform reduction on those power
and ground connectors before comparison, using <br>
the -a option. After reduction, each instance contains only
one VDD connector and one VSS connector, as the main
figure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o In this case, lvx produces a
modified net-list (saved with the name filename2 ), which is
a copy of net-list 2 with ordered connectors. Terminals and
instance connectors <br>
are relisted in the order of the models in net-list 1. The
saved net-list is done with the MBK_OUT_LO(1) format, so
user has to set this variable before running lvx . If <br>
he does not, default value is used, and net-list 1 could be
lost if filename are identical and input format same as
output format. <br>
If -a option is used, then the saved net-list is the reduced
net-list with only one VDD and one VSS .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u This option force lvx to
check the consistency of unassigned signals between the two
netlists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f The two net-lists are
flattened to the leaf cells contained in the catalog file.
Usually the extracted net-list is a flatten net-list, while
the logical one can be a hier&acirc; <br>
archical net-list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
With logical_netlist named amd2901.vst and the corresponding
extracted_netlist as amd2901.al containing multiple power
connectors, the command line is :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lvx vst al amd2901 amd2901
-a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
filename2.xx Netlist view saved when the -o option is
present. The suffixe depend on the MBK_OUT_LO(1) environment
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
MBK_CATA_LIB contains the directories where the cell
librtaries are. MBK_WORK_LIB contains the directory path of
the working directory, usually set to . (dot).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MBK_OUT_LO contains the expected
format of the netlist output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MBK_CATAL_NAME contains the name
of the user cell catalog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
cougar(1), MBK_OUT_LO(1), MBK_WORK_LIB(1), MBK_CATA_LIB(1),
MBK_CATAL_NAME(1), catal(5) .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The string &quot;_logic&quot; is appended to the net-list 1
and the string &quot;_extract&quot;, is appended to the
net-list 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two kinds of error message can
occur:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A fatal error causes the program
to exit. It happens when one of the net-lists is not
correct, lvx cannot construct internal structure for
compare.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A compare error occurs when the
figures are not identical. It happens when basic objects
(instances, connectors) do not exist in both net-list, or
when connections (sig&acirc; <br>
nals) do not connect same terminals or instances in the two
net-lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exit code 0 is returned for
identical net-lists.</p>
