<p>KIBITZ(1) General Commands Manual KIBITZ(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
kibitz - allow two people to interact with one shell</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
kibitz [ kibitz-args ] user [ program program-args... ] <br>
kibitz [ kibitz-args ] user@host [ program program-args...
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION <br>
kibitz allows two (or more) people to interact with one
shell (or any arbitrary program). Uses include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A novice user
can ask an expert user for help. Using kibitz, the expert
can see what the user is doing, and offer advice or show how
to do it right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; By running
kibitz and then starting a full-screen editor, people may
carry out a conversation, retaining the ability to scroll
backwards, save the entire conversation, <br>
or even edit it while in progress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; People can team
up on games, document editing, or other cooperative tasks
where each person has strengths and weaknesses that
complement one another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
To start kibitz, user1 runs kibitz with the argument of the
user to kibitz. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kibitz user2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kibitz starts a new shell (or
another program, if given on the command line), while
prompting user2 to run kibitz. If user2 runs kibitz as
directed, the keystrokes of both users <br>
become the input of the shell. Similarly, both users receive
the output from the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To terminate kibitz it suffices
to terminate the shell itself. For example, if either user
types ^D (and the shell accepts this to be EOF), the shell
terminates followed by kib&acirc; <br>
itz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, all characters are
passed uninterpreted. However, if the escape character
(described when kibitz starts) is issued, the user may talk
directly to the kibitz inter&acirc; <br>
preter. Any Expect(1) or Tcl(3) commands may be given. Also,
job control may be used while in the interpreter, to, for
example, suspend or restart kibitz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Various processes can provide
various effects. For example, you can emulate a two-way
write(1) session with the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kibitz user2 sleep 1000000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
kibitz takes arguments, these should also be separated by
whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -noproc flag runs kibitz
with no process underneath. Characters are passed to the
other kibitz. This is particularly useful for connecting
multiple interactive processes <br>
together. In this mode, characters are not echoed back to
the typist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noescape disables the escape
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-escape char sets the escape
character. The default escape character is ^].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-silent turns off informational
messages describing what kibitz is doing to initiate a
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tty ttyname defines the tty to
which the invitation should be sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you start kibitz to user2 on
a remote computer, kibitz performs a rlogin to the remote
computer with your current username. The flag -proxy
username causes rlogin to use user&acirc; <br>
name for the remote login (e.g. if your account on the
remote computer has a different username). If the -proxy
flag is not given, kibitz tries to determine your current
username <br>
by (in that order) inspecting the environment variables USER
and LOGNAME, then by using the commands whoami and
logname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The arguments -noescape and
-escape can also be given by user2 when prompted to run
kibitz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MORE THAN TWO USERS <br>
The current implementation of kibitz explicitly understands
only two users, however, it is nonetheless possible to have
a three (or more) -way kibitz, by kibitzing another
kib&acirc; <br>
itz. For example, the following command runs kibitz with the
current user, user2, and user3:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% kibitz user2 kibitz user3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional users may be added by
simply appending more &quot;kibitz user&quot; commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The xkibitz script is similar to
kibitz but supports the ability to add additional users (and
drop them) dynamically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
kibitz assumes the 2nd user has the same terminal type and
size as the 1st user. If this assumption is incorrect,
graphical programs may display oddly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kibitz handles character
graphics, but cannot handle bitmapped graphics. Thus,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% xterm -e kibitz will work <br>
% kibitz xterm will not work</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, you can get the effect
of the latter command by using xkibitz (see SEE ALSO below).
kibitz uses the same permissions as used by rlogin, rsh,
etc. Thus, you can only <br>
kibitz to users at hosts for which you can rlogin.
Similarly, kibitz will prompt for a password on the remote
host if rlogin would.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you kibitz to users at remote
hosts, kibitz needs to distinguish your prompt from other
things that may precede it during login. (Ideally, the end
of it is preferred but any <br>
part should suffice.) If you have an unusual prompt, set the
environment variable EXPECT_PROMPT to an egrep(1)-style
regular expression. Brackets should be preceded with one
<br>
backslash in ranges, and three backslashes for literal
brackets. The default prompt r.e. is &quot;($|%|#)
&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kibitz requires the kibitz
program on both hosts. kibitz requires expect(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By comparison, the xkibitz
script uses the X authorization mechanism for inter-host
communication so it does not need to login, recognize your
prompt, or require kibitz on the <br>
remote host. It does however need permission to access the
other X servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
An early version of Sun&rsquo;s tmpfs had a bug in it that
causes kibitz to blow up. If kibitz reports &quot;error
flushing ...: Is a directory&quot; ask Sun for patch
#100174.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your Expect is not compiled
with multiple-process support (i.e., you do not have a
working select or poll), you will not be able to run
kibitz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The environment variable SHELL is used to determine the
shell to start, if no other program is given on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the environment variable
EXPECT_PROMPT exists, it is taken as a regular expression
which matches the end of your login prompt (but does not
otherwise occur while logging in). <br>
See also CAVEATS above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the environment variables
USER or LOGNAME are defined, they are used to determine the
current user name for a kibitz to a remote computer. See
description of the -proxy option <br>
in ARGUMENTS above.</p>
