<p>javadoc(1) General Commands Manual javadoc(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
javadoc - The Java API Documentation Generator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generates HTML pages of API
documentation from Java source files. This document contains
Javadoc examples for Sun Solaris.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
javadoc [ options ] [ packagenames ] [ sourcefilenames ] [
-subpackages pkg1:pkg2:... ] [ @argfiles ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments can be in any order.
See processing of Source Files for details on how the
Javadoc tool determines which &quot;.java&quot; files to
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">options <br>
Command-line options, as specified in this document. To see
a typical use of javadoc options, see Real-World
Example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">packagenames <br>
A series of names of packages, separated by spaces, such as
java.lang java.lang.reflect java.awt. You must separately
specify each package you want to document. Wild&acirc; <br>
cards are not allowed; use -subpackages for recursion. The
Javadoc tool uses -sourcepath to look for these package
names. See Example - Documenting One or More Packages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sourcefilenames <br>
A series of source file names, separated by spaces, each of
which can begin with a path and contain a wildcard such as
asterisk (*). The Javadoc tool will process every <br>
file whose name ends with &quot;.java&quot;, and whose name,
when stripped of that suffix, is actually a legal class name
(see Identifiers @ <br>

http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/lexical.doc.html#40625).
Therefore, you can name files with dashes (such as
X-Buffer), or other illegal charac&acirc; <br>
ters, to prevent them from being documented. This is useful
for test files and template files The path that precedes the
source file name determines where javadoc will <br>
look for the file. (The Javadoc tool does not use
-sourcepath to look for these source file names.) Relative
paths are relative to the current directory, so passing in
<br>
Button.java is identical to ./Button.java. A source file
name with an absolute path and a wildcard, for example, is
/home/src/java/awt/Graphics*.java. See Example - Doc&acirc;
<br>
umenting One or More Classes. You can also mix packagenames
and sourcefilenames, as in Example - Documenting Both
Packages and Classes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-subpackages pkg1:pkg2:... <br>
Generates documentation from source files in the specified
packages and recursively in their subpackages. An
alternative to supplying packagenames or
sourcefilenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@argfiles <br>
One or more files that contain a list of Javadoc options,
packagenames and sourcefilenames in any order. Wildcards (*)
and -J options are not allowed in these files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The Javadoc tool parses the declarations and documentation
comments in a set of Java source files and produces a
corresponding set of HTML pages describing (by default) the
pub&acirc; <br>
lic and protected classes, nested classes (but not anonymous
inner classes), interfaces, constructors, methods, and
fields. You can use it to generate the API (Application
Pro&acirc; <br>
gramming Interface) documentation or the implementation
documentation for a set of source files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can run the Javadoc tool on
entire packages, individual source files, or both. When
documenting entire packages, you can either use -subpackages
for traversing recursively <br>
down from a top-level directory, or pass in an explicit list
of package names. When documenting individual source files,
you pass in a list of source (.java) filenames. Examples
<br>
are given at the end of this document. How Javadoc processes
source files is covered next.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Processing of source files <br>
The Javadoc tool processes files that end in
&quot;.java&quot; plus other files described under Source
Files. If you run the Javadoc tool by explicitly passing in
individual source file&acirc; <br>
names, you can determine exactly which &quot;.java&quot;
files are processed. However, that is not how most
developers want to work, as it is simpler to pass in package
names. The Javadoc <br>
tool can be run three ways without explicitly specifying the
source filenames. You can (1) pass in package names, (2) use
-subpackages, and (3) use wildcards with source file&acirc;
<br>
names (*.java). In these cases, the Javadoc tool processes a
&quot;.java&quot; file only if it fulfills all of the
following requirements:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Its name, after stripping off
the &quot;.java&quot; suffix, is actually a legal class name
(see Identifiers @ <br>

http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/lexical.doc.html#40625
for legal characters)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Its directory path relative to
the root of the source tree is actually a legal package name
(after converting its separators to dots)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Its package statement contains
the legal package name (specified in the previous
bullet)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Processing of links - During a
run, the Javadoc tool automatically adds cross-reference
links to package, class and member names that are being
documented as part of that run. <br>
Links appear in several places:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Declarations (return types,
argument types, field types)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o &quot;See Also&quot; sections
generated from @see tags</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o In-line text generated from
{@link} tags</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Exception names generated from
@throws tags</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o &quot;Specified by&quot; links
to members in interfaces and &quot;Overrides&quot; links to
members in classes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Summary tables listing
packages, classes and members</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Package and class inheritance
trees</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The index</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can add hyperlinks to
existing text for classes not included on the command line
(but generated separately) by way of the -link and
-linkoffline options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other processing details - The
Javadoc tool produces one complete document each time it is
run; it cannot do incremental builds -- that is, it cannot
modify or directly incorpo&acirc; <br>
rate results from previous runs of the Javadoc tool.
However, it can link to results from other runs, as just
mentioned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As implemented, the Javadoc tool
requires and relies on the java compiler to do its job. The
Javadoc tool calls part of javac to compile the
declarations, ignoring the member <br>
implementation. It builds a rich internal representation of
the classes, including the class hierarchy, and
&quot;use&quot; relationships, then generates the HTML from
that. The Javadoc <br>
tool also picks up user-supplied documentation from
documentation comments in the source code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In fact, the Javadoc tool will
run on .java source files that are pure stub files with no
method bodies. This means you can write documentation
comments and run the Javadoc tool <br>
in the earliest stages of design while creating the API,
before writing the implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Relying on the compiler ensures
that the HTML output corresponds exactly with the actual
implementation, which may rely on implicit, rather than
explicit, source code. For exam&acirc; <br>
ple, the Javadoc tool documents default constructors @ <br>

http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/names.doc.html#36154
(section 8.6.7 of Java Language Specification) that are
present in the .class files but not in the <br>
source code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In many cases, the Javadoc tool
allows you to generate documentation for source files whose
code is incomplete or erroneous. This is a benefit that
enables you to generate docu&acirc; <br>
mentation before all debugging and troubleshooting is done.
For example, according to the Java Language Specification, a
class that contains an abstract method should itself be <br>
declared abstract. The Javadoc tool does not check for this,
and would proceed without a warning, whereas the javac
compiler stops on this error. The Javadoc tool does do some
<br>
primitive checking of doc comments. Use the DocCheck doclet
to check the doc comments more thoroughly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the Javadoc tool builds its
internal structure for the documentation, it loads all
referenced classes. Because of this, the Javadoc tool must
be able to find all referenced <br>
classes, whether bootstrap classes, extensions, or user
classes. For more about this, see How Classes Are Found.
Generally speaking, classes you create must either be loaded
as <br>
an extension or in the Javadoc tool&rsquo;s class path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Javadoc Doclets <br>
You can customize the content and format of the Javadoc
tool&rsquo;s output by using doclets. The Javadoc tool has a
default &quot;built-in&quot; doclet, called the standard
doclet, that gener&acirc; <br>
ates HTML-formatted API documentation. You can modify or
subclass the standard doclet, or write your own doclet to
generate HTML, XML, MIF, RTF or whatever output format
you&rsquo;d <br>
like. Information about doclets and their use is at the
following locations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Javadoc Doclets</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The -doclet command-line
option</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a custom doclet is not
specified with the -doclet command line option, the Javadoc
tool will use the default standard doclet. The javadoc tool
has several command line <br>
options that are available regardless of which doclet is
being used. The standard doclet adds a supplementary set of
command line options. Both sets of options are described
<br>
below in the options section.</p>

http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/faq/index.html for answers
to common questions, information about Javadoc-related
tools, and workarounds for bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o How to Write Doc Comments for
Javadoc @ <br>

http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/index.html
for more information about Sun conventions for writing
documentation comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Requirements for Writing API
Specifications @ <br>
http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingapispecs/index.html
- Standard requirements used when writing the Java 2
Platform Specification. It can be useful whether you are
<br>
writing API specifications in source file documentation
comments or in other formats. It covers requirements for
packages, classes, interfaces, fields and methods to satisfy
<br>
testable assertions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Documentation Comment
Specification @ <br>

http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/first_edition/html/18.doc.html
- The original specification on documentation comments,
Chapter 18, Documentation Comments, in the Java <br>
Language Specification, First Edition, by James Gosling,
Bill Joy, and Guy Steele. (This chapter was removed from the
second edition.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o DocCheck Doclet @ <br>
http://java.sun.com/javadoc/doccheck - Checks doc comments
in source files and generates a report listing the errors
and irregularities it finds. It is part of the Sun Doc <br>
Check Utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o MIF Doclet @ <br>
http://java.sun.com/javadoc/mifdoclet - Can automate the
generation of API documentation in MIF, FrameMaker and PDF
formats. MIF is Adobe FrameMaker&rsquo;s interchange
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Terminology <br>
The terms documentation comment, doc comment, main
description, tag, block tag, and in-line tag are described
at Documentation Comments. These other terms have specific
meanings <br>
within the context of the Javadoc tool:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">generated document <br>
The document generated by the javadoc tool from the doc
comments in Java source code. The default generated document
is in HTML and is created by the standard doclet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name <br>
A name of a program element written in the Java Language --
that is, the name of a package, class, interface, field,
constructor or method. A name can be fully-qualified, <br>
such as java.lang.String.equals(java.lang.Object), or
partially-qualified, such as equals(Object).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">documented classes <br>
The classes and interfaces for which detailed documentation
is generated during a javadoc run. To be documented, the
source files must be available, their source filenames <br>
or package names must be passed into the javadoc command,
and they must not be filtered out by their access modifier
(public, protected, package-private or private). We <br>
also refer to these as the classes included in the javadoc
output, or the included classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">included classes <br>
Classes and interfaces whose details are documented during a
run of the Javadoc tool. Same as documented classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">excluded classes <br>
Classes and interfaces whose details are not documented
during a run of the Javadoc tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">referenced classes <br>
The classes and interfaces that are explicitly referred to
in the definition (implementation) or doc comments of the
documented classes and interfaces. Examples of refer&acirc;
<br>
ences include return type, parameter type, cast type,
extended class, implemented interface, imported classes,
classes used in method bodies, @see, {@link}, {@linkplain},
<br>
and {@inheritDoc} tags. (Notice this definition has changed
since 1.3 @ <br>

http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/tooldocs/solaris/javadoc.html#referencedclasses.)
When the Javadoc tool is run, it should load into memory all
of the referenced classes <br>
in javadoc&rsquo;s bootclasspath and classpath. (The Javadoc
tool prints a &quot;Class not found&quot; warning for
referenced classes not found.) The Javadoc tool can derive
enough infor&acirc; <br>
mation from the .class files to determine their existence
and the fully-qualified names of their members.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">external referenced classes <br>
The referenced classes whose documentation is not being
generated during a javadoc run. In other words, these
classes are not passed into the Javadoc tool on the command
<br>
line. Links in the generated documentation to those classes
are said to be external references or external links. For
example, if you run the Javadoc tool on only the <br>
java.awt package, then any class in java.lang, such as
Object, is an external referenced class. External referenced
classes can be linked to using the -link and -linkof&acirc;
<br>
fline options. An important property of an external
referenced class is that its source comments are normally
not available to the Javadoc run. In this case, these
comments <br>
cannot be inherited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOURCE FILES <br>
The Javadoc tool will generate output originating from four
different types of &quot;source&quot; files: Java language
source files for classes (.java), package comment files,
overview <br>
comment files, and miscellaneous unprocessed files. This
section also covers test files and template files that can
also be in the source tree, but which you want to be sure
not <br>
to document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Class Source Code Files <br>
Each class or interface and its members can have their own
documentation comments, contained in a .java file. For more
details about these doc comments, see Documentation
Com&acirc; <br>
ments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Package Comment Files <br>
Each package can have its own documentation comment,
contained in its own &quot;source&quot; file, that the
Javadoc tool will merge into the package summary page that
it generates. You <br>
typically include in this comment any documentation that
applies to the entire package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create a package comment
file, you have a choice of two files to place your
comments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o package-info.java - Can
contain a package declaration, package annotations, package
comments and Javadoc tags. This file is new in JDK 5.0, and
is preferred over pack&acirc; <br>
age.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o package.html - Can contain
only package comments and Javadoc tags, no package
annotations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A package may have a single
package.html file or a single package-info.java file but not
both. Place either file in the package directory in the
source tree along with your .java <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package-info.java This file can
contain a package comment of the following structure -- the
comment is placed before the package declaration:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File:
java/applet/package-info.java</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that while the comment
separators /** and /* must be present, the leading asterisks
on the intermediate lines can be omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package.html - This file can
contain a package comment of the following structure -- the
comment is placed in the &lt;body&gt; element:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File:
java/applet/package.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice this is just a normal
HTML file and does not include a package declaration. The
content of the package comment file is written in HTML, like
all other comments, with one <br>
exception: The documentation comment should not include the
comment separators /** and */ or leading asterisks. When
writing the comment, you should make the first sentence a
<br>
summary about the package, and not put a title or any other
text between &lt;body&gt; and the first sentence. You can
include package tags; as with any documentation comment, all
block <br>
tags must appear after the main description. If you add a
@see tag in a package comment file, it must have a
fully-qualified name. For more details, see the example of
pack&acirc; <br>
age.html @ <br>

http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/index.html#packagecomments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Processing of package comment
file - When the Javadoc tool runs, it will automatically
look for the package comment file; if found, the Javadoc
tool does the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Copies the comment for
processing. (For package.html, copies all content between
&lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt; HTML tags. You can include a
&lt;head&gt; section to put a &lt;title&gt;, source file
<br>
copyright statement, or other information, but none of these
will appear in the generated documentation.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Processes any package tags
that are present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Inserts the processed text at
the bottom of the package summary page it generates, as
shown in Package Summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Copies the first sentence of
the package comment to the top of the package summary page.
It also adds the package name and this first sentence to the
list of packages on the <br>
overview page, as shown in Overview Summary. The
end-of-sentence is determined by the same rules used for the
end of the first sentence of class and member main
descrip&acirc; <br>
tions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overview Comment File <br>
Each application or set of packages that you are documenting
can have its own overview documentation comment, kept in its
own &quot;source&quot; file, that the Javadoc tool will
merge into <br>
the overview page that it generates. You typically include
in this comment any documentation that applies to the entire
application or set of packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create an overview comment
file, you can name the file anything you want, typically
overview.html and place it anywhere, typically at the top
level of the source tree. For <br>
example, if the source files for the java.applet package are
contained in /home/user/src/java/applet directory, you could
create an overview comment file at
/home/user/src/over&acirc; <br>
view.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice you can have multiple
overview comment files for the same set of source files, in
case you want to run javadoc multiple times on different
sets of packages. For example, <br>
you could run javadoc once with -private for internal
documentation and again without that option for public
documentation. In this case, you could describe the
documentation as <br>
public or internal in the first sentence of each overview
comment file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The content of the overview
comment file is one big documentation comment, written in
HTML, like the package comment file described previously.
See that description for details. <br>
To re-iterate, when writing the comment, you should make the
first sentence a summary about the application or set of
packages, and not put a title or any other text between <br>
&lt;body&gt; and the first sentence. You can include
overview tags; as with any documentation comment, all tags
except in-line tags, such as {@link}, must appear after the
main <br>
description. If you add a @see tag, it must have a
fully-qualified name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you run the Javadoc tool,
you specify the overview comment file name with the
-overview option. The file is then processed similar to that
of a package comment file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Copies all content between
&lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt; tags for processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Processes any overview tags
that are present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Inserts the processed text at
the bottom of the overview page it generates, as shown in
Overview Summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Copies the first sentence of
the overview comment to the top of the overview summary
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous Unprocessed Files
<br>
You can also include in your source any miscellaneous files
that you want the Javadoc tool to copy to the destination
directory. These typically includes graphic files, example
<br>
Java source (.java) and class (.class) files, and
self-standing HTML files whose content would overwhelm the
documentation comment of a normal Java source file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To include unprocessed files,
put them in a directory called doc-files which can be a
subdirectory of any package directory that contains source
files. You can have one such sub&acirc; <br>
directory for each package. You might include images,
example code, source files, .class files, applets and HTML
files. For example, if you want to include the image of a
button <br>
button.gif in the java.awt.Button class documentation, you
place that file in the /home/user/src/java/awt/doc-files/
directory. Notice the doc-files directory should not be <br>
located at /home/user/src/java/doc-files because java is not
a package -- that is, it does not directly contain any
source files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All links to these unprocessed
files must be hard-coded, because the Javadoc tool does not
look at the files -- it simply copies the directory and all
its contents to the desti&acirc; <br>
nation. For example, the link in the Button.java doc comment
might look like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/** <br>
* This button looks like this: <br>
* &lt;img src=&quot;doc-files/Button.gif&quot;&gt; <br>
*/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Test Files and Template Files
<br>
Some developers have indicated they want to store test files
and templates files in the source tree near their
corresponding source files. That is, they would like to put
them in <br>
the same directory, or a subdirectory, of those source
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you run the Javadoc tool by
explicitly passing in individual source filenames, you can
deliberately omit test and templates files and prevent them
from being processed. How&acirc; <br>
ever, if you are passing in package names or wildcards, you
need to follow certain rules to ensure these test files and
templates files are not processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Test files differ from template
files in that the former are legal, compilable source files,
while the latter are not, but may end with
&quot;.java&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Test files - Often developers
want to put compilable, runnable test files for a given
package in the same directory as the source files for that
package. But they want the test <br>
files to belong to a package other than the source file
package, such as the unnamed package (so the test files have
no package statement or a different package statement from
<br>
the source). In this scenario, when the source is being
documented by specifying its package name specified on the
command line, the test files will cause warnings or errors.
You <br>
need to put such test files in a subdirectory. For example,
if you want to add test files for source files in
com.package1, put them in a subdirectory that would be an
invalid <br>
package name (because it contains a hyphen):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">com/package1/test-files/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The test directory will be
skipped by the Javadoc tool with no warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your test files contain doc
comments, you can set up a separate run of the Javadoc tool
to produce documentation of the test files by passing in
their test source filenames <br>
with wildcards, such as com/package1/test-files/*.java.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Templates for source files -
Template files have names that often end in
&quot;.java&quot; and are not compilable. If you have a
template for a source file that you want to keep in the <br>
source directory, you can name it with a dash (such as
Buffer-Template.java), or any other illegal Java character,
to prevent it from being processed. This relies on the fact
<br>
that the Javadoc tool will only process source files whose
name, when stripped of the &quot;.java&quot; suffix, is
actually a legal class name (see Identifiers @ <br>

http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/lexical.doc.html#40625).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERATED FILES <br>
By default, javadoc uses a standard doclet that generates
HTML-formatted documentation. This doclet generates the
following kinds of files (where each HTML &quot;page&quot;
corresponds to <br>
a separate file). Note that javadoc generates files with two
types of names: those named after classes/interfaces, and
those that are not (such as package-summary.html). Files in

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Basic Content Pages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o One class or interface page
(classname.html) for each class or interface it is
documenting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o One package page
(package-summary.html) for each package it is documenting.
The Javadoc tool will include any HTML text provided in a
file named package.html or pack&acirc; <br>
age-info.java in the package directory of the source
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o One overview page
(overview-summary.html) for the entire set of packages. This
is the front page of the generated document. The Javadoc
tool will include any HTML text pro&acirc; <br>
vided in a file specified with the -overview option. Note
that this file is created only if you pass into javadoc two
or more package names. For further explanation, see <br>
HTML Frames.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cross-Reference Pages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o One class hierarchy page for
the entire set of packages (overview-tree.html). To view
this, click on &quot;Overview&quot; in the navigation bar,
then click on &quot;Tree&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o One class hierarchy page for
each package (package-tree.html) To view this, go to a
particular package, class or interface page; click
&quot;Tree&quot; to display the hierarchy for <br>
that package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o One &quot;use&quot; page for
each package (package-use.html) and a separate one for each
class and interface (class-use/classname.html). This page
describes what packages, classes, <br>
methods, constructors and fields use any part of the given
class, interface or package. Given a class or interface A,
its &quot;use&quot; page includes subclasses of A, fields
<br>
declared as A, methods that return A, and methods and
constructors with parameters of type A. You can access this
page by first going to the package, class or interface, <br>
then clicking on the &quot;Use&quot; link in the navigation
bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A deprecated API page
(deprecated-list.html) listing all deprecated names. (A
deprecated name is not recommended for use, generally due to
improvements, and a replacement <br>
name is usually given. Deprecated APIs may be removed in
future implementations.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A constant field values page
(constant-values.html) for the values of static fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A serialized form page
(serialized-form.html) for information about serializable
and externalizable classes. Each such class has a
description of its serialization fields <br>
and methods. This information is of interest to
re-implementors, not to developers using the API. While
there is no link in the navigation bar, you can get to this
informa&acirc; <br>
tion by going to any serialized class and clicking
&quot;Serialized Form&quot; in the &quot;See also&quot;
section of the class comment. The standard doclet
automatically generates a serialized <br>
form page: any class (public or non-public) that implements
Serializable is included, along with readObject and
writeObject methods, the fields that are serialized, and the
<br>
doc comments from the @serial, @serialField, and @serialData
tags. Public serializable classes can be excluded by marking
them (or their package) with @serial exclude, and <br>
package-private serializable classes can be included by
marking them (or their package) with @serial include. As of
1.4, you can generate the complete serialized form for <br>
public and private classes by running javadoc without
specifying the -private option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o An index (index-*.html) of all
class, interface, constructor, field and method names,
alphabetically arranged. This is internationalized for
Unicode and can be generated as <br>
a single file or as a separate file for each starting
character (such as A-Z for English).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support Files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A help page (help-doc.html)
that describes the navigation bar and the above pages. You
can provide your own custom help file to override the
default using -helpfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o One index.html file which
creates the HTML frames for display. This is the file you
load to display the front page with frames. This file itself
contains no text content.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Several frame files
(*-frame.html) containing lists of packages, classes and
interfaces, used when HTML frames are being displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A package list file
(package-list), used by the -link and -linkoffline options.
This is a text file, not HTML, and is not reachable through
any links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A style sheet file
(stylesheet.css) that controls a limited amount of color,
font family, font size, font style and positioning on the
generated pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A doc-files directory that
holds any image, example, source code or other files that
you want copied to the destination directory. These files
are not processed by the <br>
Javadoc tool in any manner -- that is, any javadoc tags in
them will be ignored. This directory is not generated unless
it exists in the source tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTML Frames</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Javadoc tool will generate
either two or three HTML frames, as shown in the figure
below. It creates the minimum necessary number of frames by
omitting the list of packages <br>
if there is only one package (or no packages). That is, when
you pass a single package name or source files (*.java)
belonging to a single package as arguments into the javadoc
<br>
command, it will create only one frame (C) in the left-hand
column -- the list of classes. When you pass into javadoc
two or more package names, it creates a third frame (P) <br>
listing all packages, as well as an overview page (Detail).
This overview page has the filename overview-summary.html.
Thus, this file is created only if you pass in two or more
<br>
package names. You can bypass frames by clicking on the
&quot;No Frames&quot; link or entering at
overview-summary.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are unfamiliar with HTML
frames, you should be aware that frames can have focus for
printing and scrolling. To give a frame focus, click on it.
Then on many browsers the <br>
arrow keys and page keys will scroll that frame, and the
print menu command will print it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">------------ ------------ <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Load one of the following two

HTML frames or not:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generated File Structure</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The generated class and
interface files are organized in the same directory
hierarchy that Java source files and class files are
organized. This structure is one directory per <br>
subpackage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the document
generated for the class java.applet.Applet class would be
located at java/applet/Applet.html. The file structure for
the java.applet package follows, <br>
given that the destination directory is named apidocs. All
files that contain the word &quot;frame&quot; appear in the
upper-left or lower-left frames, as noted. All other HTML
files <br>
appear in the right-hand frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE - Directories are shown in
bold. The asterisks (*) indicate the files and directories
that are omitted when the arguments to javadoc are source
filenames (*.java) rather <br>
than package names. Also when arguments are source
filenames, package-list is created but is empty. The
doc-files directory will not be created in the destination
unless it <br>
exists in the source tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a
name=&quot;generatedapideclarations&quot;/&gt; Generated API
Declarations <br>
The Javadoc tool generates a declaration at the start of
each class, interface, field, constructor, and method
description for that API item. For example, the declaration
for the <br>
Boolean class is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">public final class Boolean <br>
extends Object <br>
implements Serializable</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and the declaration for the
Boolean.valueOfmethod is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">public static Boolean
valueOf(String s)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Javadoc tool can include the
modifiers public, protected, private, abstract, final,
static, transient, and volatile, but not synchronized or
native. These last two modifiers <br>
are considered implementation detail and not part of the API
specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rather than relying on the
keyword synchronized, APIs should document their concurrency
semantics in the comment&rsquo;s main description, as in
&quot;a single Enumeration cannot be used by <br>
multiple threads concurrently&quot;. The document should not
describe how to achieve these semantics. As another example,
while Hashtable should be thread-safe, there&rsquo;s no
reason to <br>
specify that we achieve this by synchronizing all of its
exported methods. We should reserve the right to synchronize
internally at the bucket level, thus offering higher
concur&acirc; <br>
rency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOCUMENTATION COMMENTS <br>
The original &quot;Documentation Comment Specification&quot;
can be found under related documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commenting the Source Code <br>
You can include documentation comments (&quot;doc
comments&quot;) in the source code, ahead of declarations
for any class, interface, method, constructor, or field. You
can also create doc <br>
comments for each package and another one for the overview,
though their syntax is slightly different. Doc comments are
also known informally as &quot;Javadoc comments&quot; (but
this term <br>
violates its trademark usage). A doc comment consists of the
characters between the characters /** that begin the comment
and the characters */ that end it. Leading asterisks are
<br>
allowed on each line and are described further below. The
text in a comment can continue onto multiple lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/** <br>
* This is the typical format of a simple documentation
comment <br>
* that spans two lines. <br>
*/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To save space you can put a
comment on one line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/** This comment takes up only
one line. */</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Placement of comments -
Documentation comments are recognized only when placed
immediately before class, interface, constructor, method, or
field declarations -- see the class <br>
example, method example, and field example. Documentation
comments placed in the body of a method are ignored. Only
one documentation comment per declaration statement is
recog&acirc; <br>
nized by the Javadoc tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A common mistake is to put an
import statement between the class comment and the class
declaration. Avoid this, as the Javadoc tool will ignore the
class comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/** <br>
* This is the class comment for the class Whatever. <br>
*/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">import com.sun; // MISTAKE -
Important not to put import statement here</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">public class Whatever { <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A doc comment is composed of a
main description followed by a tag section - The main
description begins after the starting delimiter /** and
continues until the tag section. The <br>
tag section starts with the first block tag, which is
defined by the first @ character that begins a line
(ignoring leading asterisks, white space, and leading
separator /**). It <br>
is possible to have a comment with only a tag section and no
main description. The main description cannot continue after
the tag section begins. The argument to a tag can span <br>
multiple lines. There can be any number of tags -- some
types of tags can be repeated while others cannot. For
example, this @see starts the tag section:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/** <br>
* This sentence would hold the main description for this doc
comment. <br>
* @see java.lang.Object <br>
*/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Block tags and in-line tags - A
tag is a special keyword within a doc comment that the
Javadoc tool can process. There are two kinds of tags: block
tags, which appear as @tag <br>
(also known as &quot;standalone tags&quot;), and in-line
tags, which appear within curly braces, as {@tag}. To be
interpreted, a block tag must appear at the beginning of a
line, ignoring <br>
leading asterisks, white space, and separator (/**). This
means you can use the @ character elsewhere in the text and
it will not be interpreted as the start of a tag. If you
<br>
want to start a line with the @ character and not have it be
interpreted, use the HTML entity &amp;#064;. Each block tag
has associated text, which includes any text following the
<br>
tag up to, but not including, either the next tag, or the
end of the doc comment. This associated text can span
multiple lines. An in-line tag is allowed and interpreted
anywhere <br>
that text is allowed. The following example contains the
block tag @deprecated and in-line tag {@link}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/** <br>
* @deprecated As of JDK 1.1, replaced by {@link
#setBounds(int,int,int,int)} <br>
*/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comments are written in HTML -
The text must be written in HTML, in that they should use
HTML entities and can use HTML tags. You can use whichever
version of HTML your browser <br>
supports; we have written the standard doclet to generate
HTML 3.2-compliant code elsewhere (outside of the
documentation comments) with the inclusion of cascading
style sheets <br>
and frames. (We preface each generated file with &quot;HTML
4.0&quot; because of the frame sets.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, entities for the
less-than (&lt;) and greater-than (&gt;) symbols should be
written &lt; and &gt;. Likewise, the ampersand (&amp;)
should be written &amp;. The bold HTML tag &lt;b&gt; is <br>
shown in the following example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a doc comment:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/** <br>
* This is a &lt;b&gt;doc&lt;/b&gt; comment. <br>
* @see java.lang.Object <br>
*/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Leading asterisks - When javadoc
parses a doc comment, leading asterisk (*) characters on
each line are discarded; blanks and tabs preceding the
initial asterisk (*) characters <br>
are also discarded. Starting with 1.4, if you omit the
leading asterisk on a line, the leading white space is no
longer removed. This enables you to paste code examples
directly <br>
into a doc comment inside a &lt;PRE&gt; tag, and its
indentation will be honored. Spaces are generally
interpreted by browsers more uniformly than tabs.
Indentation is relative to the <br>
left margin (rather than the separator /** or &lt;PRE&gt;
tag).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First sentence - The first
sentence of each doc comment should be a summary sentence,
containing a concise but complete description of the
declared entity. This sentence ends at <br>
the first period that is followed by a blank, tab, or line
terminator, or at the first block tag. The Javadoc tool
copies this first sentence to the member summary at the top
of <br>
the HTML page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Declaration with multiple fields
- Java allows declaring multiple fields in a single
statement, but this statement can have only one
documentation comment, which is copied for <br>
all fields. Therefore if you want individual documentation
comments for each field, you must declare each field in a
separate statement. For example, the following documentation
<br>
comment doesn&rsquo;t make sense written as a single
declaration and would be better handled as two
declarations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/** <br>
* The horizontal and vertical distances of point (x,y) <br>
*/ <br>
public int x, y; // Avoid this</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Javadoc tool generates the
following documentation from the above code:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">public int x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The horizontal and vertical
distances of point (x,y)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">public int y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The horizontal and vertical
distances of point (x,y)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use header tags carefully - When
writing documentation comments for members, it&rsquo;s best
not to use HTML heading tags such as &lt;H1&gt; and
&lt;H2&gt;, because the Javadoc tool creates an <br>
entire structured document and these structural tags might
interfere with the formatting of the generated document.
However, it is fine to use these headings in class and
package <br>
comments to provide your own structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatic Copying of Method
Comments <br>
The Javadoc tool has the ability to copy or
&quot;inherit&quot; method comments in classes and
interfaces under the following two circumstances.
Constructors, fields and nested classes do <br>
not inherit doc comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Automatically inherit comment
to fill in missing text - When a main description, or
@return, @param or @throws tag is missing from a method
comment, the Javadoc tool copies <br>
the corresponding main description or tag comment from the
method it overrides or implements (if any), according to the
algorithm below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More specifically, when a @param
tag for a particular parameter is missing, then the comment
for that parameter is copied from the method further up the
inheritance hierarchy. <br>
When a @throws tag for a particular exception is missing,
the @throws tag is copied only if that exception is
declared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This behavior contrasts with
version 1.3 and earlier, where the presence of any main
description or tag would prevent all comments from being
inherited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Explicitly inherit comment
with {@inheritDoc} tag - Insert the inline tag {@inheritDoc}
in a method main description or @return, @param or @throws
tag comment -- the corre&acirc; <br>
sponding inherited main description or tag comment is copied
into that spot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The source file for the
inherited method need only be on the path specified by
-sourcepath for the doc comment to actually be available to
copy. Neither the class nor its package <br>
needs to be passed in on the command line. This contrasts
with 1.3.x and earlier releases, where the class had to be a
documented class</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inherit from classes and
interfaces - Inheriting of comments occurs in all three
possible cases of inheritance from classes and
interfaces:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o When a method in a class
overrides a method in a superclass</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o When a method in an interface
overrides a method in a superinterface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o When a method in a class
implements a method in an interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the first two cases, for
method overrides, the Javadoc tool generates a subheading
&quot;Overrides&quot; in the documentation for the
overriding method, with a link to the method it is <br>
overriding, whether or not the comment is inherited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the third case, when a method
in a given class implements a method in an interface, the
Javadoc tool generates a subheading &quot;Specified by&quot;
in the documentation for the over&acirc; <br>
riding method, with a link to the method it is implementing.
This happens whether or not the comment is inherited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Algorithm for Inheriting Method
Comments - If a method does not have a doc comment, or has
an {@inheritDoc} tag, the Javadoc tool searches for an
applicable comment using the <br>
following algorithm, which is designed to find the most
specific applicable doc comment, giving preference to
interfaces over superclasses:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Look in each directly
implemented (or extended) interface in the order they appear
following the word implements (or extends) in the method
declaration. Use the first doc <br>
comment found for this method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If step 1 failed to find a
doc comment, recursively apply this entire algorithm to each
directly implemented (or extended) interface, in the same
order they were examined <br>
in step 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If step 2 failed to find a
doc comment and this is a class other than Object (not an
interface):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. If the superclass has a doc
comment for this method, use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. If step 3a failed to find a
doc comment, recursively apply this entire algorithm to the
superclass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JAVADOC TAGS <br>
The Javadoc tool parses special tags when they are embedded
within a Java doc comment. These doc tags enable you to
autogenerate a complete, well-formatted API from your source
<br>
code. The tags start with an &quot;at&quot; sign (@) and are
case-sensitive -- they must be typed with the uppercase and
lowercase letters as shown. A tag must start at the
beginning of a <br>
line (after any leading spaces and an optional asterisk) or
it is treated as normal text. By convention, tags with the
same name are grouped together. For example, put all @see
<br>
tags together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tags come in two types:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Block tags - Can be placed
only in the tag section that follows the main description.
Block tags are of the form: @tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Inline tags - Can be placed
anywhere in the main description or in the comments for
block tags. Inline tags are denoted by curly braces:
{@tag}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For information about tags we
might introduce in future releases, see Proposed Tags @ <br>
http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/proposed-tags.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current tags are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For custom tags, see the -tag
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@author name-text <br>
Adds an &quot;Author&quot; entry with the specified
name-text to the generated docs when the -author option is
used. A doc comment may contain multiple @author tags. You
can specify <br>
one name per @author tag or multiple names per tag. In the
former case, the Javadoc tool inserts a comma (,) and space
between names. In the latter case, the entire text is <br>
simply copied to the generated document without being
parsed. Therefore, you can use multiple names per line if
you want a localized name separator other than comma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more details, see Where Tags
Can Be Used and writing @author tags @ <br>

http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/index.html#@author.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@deprecated deprecated-text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Starting with JDK 5.0, you
can deprecate a program element using the @Deprecated
annotation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adds a comment indicating that
this API should no longer be used (even though it may
continue to work). The Javadoc tool moves the
deprecated-text ahead of the main descrip&acirc; <br>
tion, placing it in italics and preceding it with a bold
warning: &quot;Deprecated&quot;. This tag is valid in all
doc comments: overview, package, class, interface,
constructor, method <br>
and field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first sentence of
deprecated-text should at least tell the user when the API
was deprecated and what to use as a replacement. The Javadoc
tool copies just the first sen&acirc; <br>
tence to the summary section and index. Subsequent sentences
can also explain why it has been deprecated. You should
include a {@link} tag (for Javadoc 1.2 or later) that <br>
points to the replacement API:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more details, see writing
@deprecated tags @ <br>

http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/index.html#@deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o For Javadoc 1.2 and later, use
a {@link} tag. This creates the link in-line, where you want
it. For example: <br>
/** <br>
* @deprecated As of JDK 1.1, replaced by {@link
#setBounds(int,int,int,int)} <br>
*/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o For Javadoc 1.1, the standard
format is to create a @see tag (which cannot be in-line) for
each @deprecated tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more about deprecation, see
The @deprecated tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{@code text} <br>
Equivalent to &lt;code&gt;{@literal}&lt;/code&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Displays text in code font
without interpreting the text as HTML markup or nested
javadoc tags. This enables you to use regular angle brackets
(&lt; and &gt;) instead of the HTML <br>
entities (&lt; and &gt;) in doc comments, such as in
parameter types (&lt;Object&gt;), inequalities (3 &lt; 4),
or arrows (&lt;-). For example, the doc comment text: <br>
{@code A&lt;B&gt;C} <br>
displays in the generated HTML page unchanged, as: <br>
A&lt;B&gt;C <br>
The noteworthy point is that the &lt;B&gt; is not
interpreted as bold and is in code font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want the same
functionality without the code font, use {@literal}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{@docRoot} <br>
Represents the relative path to the generated
document&rsquo;s (destination) root directory from any
generated page. It is useful when you want to include a
file, such as a copy&acirc; <br>
right page or company logo, that you want to reference from
all generated pages. Linking to the copyright page from the
bottom of each page is common.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This {@docRoot} tag can be used
both on the command line and in a doc comment: This tag is
valid in all doc comments: overview, package, class,
interface, constructor, method <br>
and field, including the text portion of any tag (such as
@return, @param and @deprecated).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. On the command line, where
the header/footer/bottom are defined: <br>
javadoc -bottom &rsquo;&lt;a
href=&quot;{@docRoot}/copyright.html&quot;&gt;Copyright&lt;/a&gt;&rsquo;
<br>
NOTE - When using {@docRoot} this way in a make file, some
makefile programs require special escaping for the brace {}
characters. For example, the Inprise MAKE version <br>
5.2 running on Windows requires double braces: {{@docRoot}}.
It also requires double (rather than single) quotes to
enclose arguments to options such as -bottom (with <br>
the quotes around the href argument omitted).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. In a doc comment: <br>
/** <br>
* See the &lt;a
href=&quot;{@docRoot}/copyright.html&quot;&gt;Copyright&lt;/a&gt;.
<br>
*/ <br>
The reason this tag is needed is because the generated docs
are in hierarchical directories, as deep as the number of
subpackages. This expression: <br>
&lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/copyright.html&quot;&gt; <br>
would resolve to: <br>
&lt;a href=&quot;../../copyright.html&quot;&gt; for
java/lang/Object.java <br>
and <br>
&lt;a href=&quot;../../../copyright.html&quot;&gt; for
java/lang/ref/Reference.java</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@exception class-name
description <br>
The @exception tag is a synonym for @throws.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{@inheritDoc} <br>
Inherits (copies) documentation from the &quot;nearest&quot;
inheritable class or implementable interface into the
current doc comment at this tag&rsquo;s location. This
allows you to <br>
write more general comments higher up the inheritance tree,
and to write around the copied text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tag is valid only in these
places in a doc comment:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o In the main description block
of a method. In this case, the main description is copied
from a class or interface up the hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o In the text arguments of the
@return, @param and @throws tags of a method. In this case,
the tag text is copied from the corresponding tag up the
hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See Automatic Copying of Method
Comments for a more precise description of how comments are
found in the inheritance hierarchy. Note that if this tag is
missing, the comment <br>
is or is not automatically inherited according to rules
described in that section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{@link package.class#member
label} <br>
Inserts an in-line link with visible text label that points
to the documentation for the specified package, class or
member name of a referenced class. This tag is valid in <br>
all doc comments: overview, package, class, interface,
constructor, method and field, including the text portion of
any tag (such as @return, @param and @deprecated).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tag is very simliar to @see
-- both require the same references and accept exactly the
same syntax for package.class#member and label. The main
difference is that {@link} <br>
generates an in-line link rather than placing the link in
the &quot;See Also&quot; section. Also, the {@link} tag
begins and ends with curly braces to separate it from the
rest of the <br>
in-line text. If you need to use &quot;}&quot; inside the
label, use the HTML entity notation &amp;#125;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no limit to the number
of {@link} tags allowed in a sentence. You can use this tag
in the main description part of any documentation comment or
in the text portion of <br>
any tag (such as @deprecated, @return or @param).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, here is a comment
that refers to the getComponentAt(int, int) method: <br>
Use the {@link #getComponentAt(int, int) getComponentAt}
method. <br>
From this, the standard doclet would generate the following
HTML (assuming it refers to another class in the same
package): <br>
Use the &lt;a href=&quot;Component.html#getComponentAt(int,
int)&quot;&gt;getComponentAt&lt;/a&gt; method. <br>
Which appears on the web page as: <br>
Use the getComponentAt method. <br>
You can extend {@link} to link to classes not being
documented by using the -link option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more details, see writing
{@link} tags @ <br>

http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/index.html#{@link}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{@linkplain package.class#member
label} <br>
Identical to {@link}, except the link&rsquo;s label is
displayed in plain text than code font. Useful when the
label is plain text. Example: <br>
Refer to {@linkplain add() the overridden method}. <br>
This would display as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Refer to the overridden
method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{@literal text} <br>
Displays text without interpreting the text as HTML markup
or nested javadoc tags. This enables you to use regular
angle brackets (&lt; and &gt;) instead of the HTML entities
(&lt; <br>
and &gt;) in doc comments, such as in parameter types
(&lt;Object&gt;), inequalities (3 &lt; 4), or arrows
(&lt;-). For example, the doc comment text: <br>
{@literal A&lt;B&gt;C} <br>
displays unchanged in the generated HTML page in your
browser, as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A&lt;B&gt;C The noteworthy point
is that the &lt;B&gt; is not interpreted as bold (and it is
not in code font).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want the same
functionality but with the text in code font, use
{@code}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@param parameter-name
description <br>
Adds a parameter with the specified parameter-name followed
by the specified description to the &quot;Parameters&quot;
section. When writing the doc comment, you may continue the
<br>
description onto multiple lines. This tag is valid only in a
doc comment for a method, constructor or class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parameter-name can be the
name of a parameter in a method or constructor, or the name
of a type parameter of a class, method or constructor. Use
angle brackets around this <br>
parameter name to specify the use of a type parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example of a type parameter of a
class: <br>
/** <br>
* @param &lt;E&gt; Type of element stored in a list <br>
*/ <br>
public interface List&lt;E&gt; extends Collection&lt;E&gt; {
<br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example of a type parameter of a
method: <br>
/** <br>
* @param string the string to be converted <br>
* @param type the type to convert the string to <br>
* @param &lt;T&gt; the type of the element <br>
* @param &lt;V&gt; the value of the element <br>
*/ <br>
&lt;T, V extends T&gt; V convert(String string,
Class&lt;T&gt; type) { <br>
} <br>
For more details, see writing @param tags @ <br>

http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/index.html#@param.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@return description <br>
Adds a &quot;Returns&quot; section with the description
text. This text should describe the return type and
permissible range of values. This tag is valid only in a doc
comment for a <br>
method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more details, see writing
@return tags @ <br>

http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/index.html#@return.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@see reference <br>
Adds a &quot;See Also&quot; heading with a link or text
entry that points to reference. A doc comment may contain
any number of @see tags, which are all grouped under the
same head&acirc; <br>
ing. The @see tag has three variations; the third form below
is the most common. This tag is valid in any doc comment:
overview, package, class, interface, constructor, <br>
method or field. For inserting an in-line link within a
sentence to a package, class or member, see {@link}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@see &quot;string&quot; <br>
Adds a text entry for string. No link is generated. The
string is a book or other reference to information not
available by URL. The Javadoc tool distinguishes this from
<br>
the previous cases by looking for a double-quote (&quot;) as
the first character. For example: <br>
@see &quot;The Java Programming Language&quot; <br>
This generates text such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See Also: <br>
&quot;The Java Programming Language&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@see &lt;a
href=&quot;URL#value&quot;&gt;label&lt;/a&gt; <br>
Adds a link as defined by URL#value. The URL#value is a
relative or absolute URL. The Javadoc tool distinguishes
this from other cases by looking for a less-than symbol <br>
(&lt;) as the first character. For example: <br>
@see &lt;a href=&quot;spec.html#section&quot;&gt;Java
Spec&lt;/a&gt; <br>
This generates a link such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See Also: <br>
Java Spec</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@see package.class#member label
<br>
Adds a link, with visible text label, that points to the
documentation for the specified name in the Java Language
that is referenced. The label is optional; if omitted, <br>
the name appears instead as the visible text, suitably
shortened -- see How a name is displayed. Use -noqualifier
to globally remove the package name from this visible <br>
text. Use the label when you want the visible text to be
different from the auto-generated visible text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only in version 1.2, just the
name but not the label would automatically appear in
&lt;code&gt; HTML tags, Starting with 1.2.2, the
&lt;code&gt; is always included around the visible <br>
text, whether or not a label is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o package.class#member is any
valid program element name that is referenced -- a package,
class, interface, constructor, method or field name --
except that the charac&acirc; <br>
ter ahead of the member name should be a hash character (#).
The class represents any top-level or nested class or
interface. The member represents any constructor, <br>
method or field (not a nested class or interface). If this
name is in the documented classes, the Javadoc tool will
automatically create a link to it. To create links <br>
to external referenced classes, use the -link option. Use
either of the other two @see forms for referring to
documentation of a name that does not belong to a
refer&acirc; <br>
enced class. This argument is described at greater length
below under Specifying a Name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o label is optional text that is
visible as the link&rsquo;s label. The label can contain
whitespace. If label is omitted, then package.class.member
will appear, suitably <br>
shortened relative to the current class and package -- see
How a name is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A space is the delimiter
between package.class#member and label. A space inside
parentheses does not indicate the start of a label, so
spaces may be used between <br>
parameters in a method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example - In this example, an
@see tag (in the Character class) refers to the equals
method in the String class. The tag includes both arguments:
the name <br>
&quot;String#equals(Object)&quot; and the label
&quot;equals&quot;. <br>
/** <br>
* @see String#equals(Object) equals <br>
*/ <br>
The standard doclet produces HTML something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;dl&gt; <br>
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;See Also:&lt;/b&gt; <br>
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a
href=&quot;../../java/lang/String#equals(java.lang.Object)&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;equals&lt;code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
<br>
&lt;/dl&gt; <br>
Which looks something like this in a browser, where the
label is the visible link text:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See Also: <br>
equals</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying a name - This
package.class#member name can be either fully-qualified,
such as java.lang.String#toUpperCase() or not, such as
String#toUpperCase() or #toUpper&acirc; <br>
Case(). If less than fully-qualified, the Javadoc tool uses
the normal Java compiler search order to find it, further
described below in Search order for @see. The name can <br>
contain whitespace within parentheses, such as between
method arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course the advantage of
providing shorter, &quot;partially-qualified&quot; names is
that they are shorter to type and there is less clutter in
the source code. The following table <br>
shows the different forms of the name, where Class can be a
class or interface, Type can be a class, interface, array,
or primitive, and method can be a method or construc&acirc;
<br>
tor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following notes apply to the
above table:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The first set of forms (with
no class or package) will cause the Javadoc tool to search
only through the current class&rsquo;s hierarchy. It will
find a member of the cur&acirc; <br>
rent class or interface, one of its superclasses or
superinterfaces, or one of its enclosing classes or
interfaces (search steps 1-3). It will not search the rest
of <br>
the current package or other packages (search steps
4-5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o If any method or constructor
is entered as a name with no parentheses, such as getValue,
and if there is no field with the same name, the Javadoc
tool will correctly <br>
create a link to it, but will print a warning message
reminding you to add the parentheses and arguments. If this
method is overloaded, the Javadoc tool will link to <br>
the first method its search encounters, which is
unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Nested classes must be
specified as outer.inner, not simply inner, for all
forms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o As stated, the hash character
(#), rather than a dot (.) separates a member from its
class. This enables the Javadoc tool to resolve ambiguities,
since the dot also <br>
separates classes, nested classes, packages, and
subpackages. However, the Javadoc tool is generally lenient
and will properly parse a dot if you know there is no <br>
ambiguity, though it will print a warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Search order for @see - the
Javadoc tool will process a @see tag that appears in a
source file (.java), package file (package.html or
package-info.java) or overview file <br>
(overview.html). In the latter two files, you must
fully-qualify the name you supply with @see. In a source
file, you can specify a name that is fully-qualified or
par&acirc; <br>
tially-qualified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the Javadoc tool encounters
a @see tag in a .java file that is not fully qualified, it
searches for the specified name in the same order as the
Java compiler would <br>
(except the Javadoc tool will not detect certain namespace
ambiguities, since it assumes the source code is free of
these errors). This search order is formally defined in <br>
Chapter 6, &quot;Names&quot; of the Java Language
Specification, Second Edition. The Javadoc tool searches for
that name through all related and imported classes and
packages. In <br>
particular, it searches in this order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. the current class or
interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. any enclosing classes and
interfaces, searching closest first</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. any superclasses and
superinterfaces, searching closest first</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. the current package</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. any imported packages,
classes and interfaces, searching in the order of the import
statement</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Javadoc tool continues to
search recursively through steps 1-3 for each class it
encounters until it finds a match. That is, after it
searches through the current class <br>
and its enclosing class E, it will search through E&rsquo;s
superclasses before E&rsquo;s enclosing classes. In steps 4
and 5, the Javadoc tool does not search classes or
interfaces <br>
within a package in any specified order (that order depends
on the particular compiler). In step 5, the Javadoc tool
looks in java.lang, since that is automatically <br>
imported by all programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Javadoc tool does not
necessarily look in subclasses, nor will it look in other
packages even if their documentation is being generated in
the same run. For example, if <br>
the @see tag is in the java.awt.event.KeyEvent class and
refers to a name in the java.awt package, javadoc does not
look in that package unless that class imports it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How a name is displayed - If
label is omitted, then package.class.member appears. In
general, it is suitably shortened relative to the current
class and package. By &quot;short&acirc; <br>
ened&quot;, we mean the Javadoc tool displays only the
minimum name necessary. For example, if the
String.toUpperCase() method contains references to a member
of the same class <br>
and to a member of a different class, the class name is
displayed only in the latter case, as shown in the following
table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -noqualifier to globally
remove the package names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples of @see <br>
The comment to the right shows how the name would be
displayed if the @see tag is in a class in another package,
such as java.applet.Applet. <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@serial field-description |
include | exclude <br>
Used in the doc comment for a default serializable
field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An optional field-description
should explain the meaning of the field and list the
acceptable values. If needed, the description can span
multiple lines. The standard doclet <br>
adds this information to the serialized form page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a serializable field was
added to a class some time after the class was made
serializable, a statement should be added to its main
description to identify at which version <br>
it was added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The include and exclude
arguments identify whether a class or package should be
included or excluded from the serialized form page. They
work as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A public or protected class
that implements Serializable is included unless that class
(or its package) is marked @serial exclude.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A private or package-private
class that implements Serializable is excluded unless that
class (or its package) is marked @serial include.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples: The javax.swing
package is marked @serial exclude (in package.html or
package-info.java). The public class
java.security.BasicPermission is marked @serial exclude.
<br>
The package-private class
java.util.PropertyPermissionCollection is marked @serial
include.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tag @serial at a class level
overrides @serial at a package level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information about how
to use these tags, along with an example, see
&quot;Documenting Serializable Fields and Data for a
Class,&quot; Section 1.6 of the Java Object Serializa&acirc;
<br>
tion Specification. Also see the Serialization FAQ @ <br>

http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/serialization/faq/#javadoc_warn_missing,
which covers common questions, such as &quot;Why do I see
javadoc warnings stating that I am missing <br>
@serial tags for private fields if I am not running javadoc
with the -private switch?&quot;. Also see Sun&rsquo;s
criteria @ <br>

for including classes in the serialized form
specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@serialField field-name
field-type field-description <br>
Documents an ObjectStreamField component of a Serializable
class&rsquo;s serialPersistentFields member. One
@serialField tag should be used for each ObjectStreamField
component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@serialData data-description
<br>
The data-description documents the types and order of data
in the serialized form. Specifically, this data includes the
optional data written by the writeObject method and <br>
all data (including base classes) written by the
Externalizable.writeExternal method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The @serialData tag can be used
in the doc comment for the writeObject, readObject,
writeExternal, readExternal, writeReplace, and readResolve
methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@since since-text <br>
Adds a &quot;Since&quot; heading with the specified
since-text to the generated documentation. The text has no
special internal structure. This tag is valid in any doc
comment: over&acirc; <br>
view, package, class, interface, constructor, method or
field. This tag means that this change or feature has
existed since the software release specified by the <br>
since-text. For example: <br>
@since 1.5 <br>
For source code in the Java platform, this tag indicates the
version of the Java platform API specification (not
necessarily when it was added to the reference
implementa&acirc; <br>
tion). Multiple @since tags are allowed and are treated like
multiple @author tags. You could use multiple tags if the
prgram element is used by more than one API.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@throws class-name description
<br>
The @throws and @exception tags are synonyms. Adds a
&quot;Throws&quot; subheading to the generated
documentation, with the class-name and description text. The
class-name is the <br>
name of the exception that may be thrown by the method. This
tag is valid only in the doc comment for a method or
constructor. If this class is not fully-specified, the <br>
Javadoc tool uses the search order to look up this class.
Multiple @throws tags can be used in a given doc comment for
the same or different exceptions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To ensure that all checked
exceptions are documented, if a @throws tag does not exist
for an exception in the throws clause, the Javadoc tool
automatically adds that exception <br>
to the HTML output (with no description) as if it were
documented with @throws tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The @throws documentation is
copied from an overridden method to a subclass only when the
exception is explicitly declared in the overridden method.
The same is true for copy&acirc; <br>
ing from an interface method to an implementing method. You
can use {@inheritDoc} to force @throws to inherit
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more details, see writing
@throws tags @ <br>

http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/index.html#@exception.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{@value package.class#field}
<br>
When {@value} is used (without any argument) in the doc
comment of a static field, it displays the value of that
constant: <br>
/** <br>
* The value of this constant is {@value}. <br>
*/ <br>
public static final String SCRIPT_START =
&quot;&lt;script&gt;&quot; <br>
When used with argument package.class#field in any doc
comment, it displays the value of the specified constant:
<br>
/** <br>
* Evaluates the script starting with {@value #SCRIPT_START}.
<br>
*/ <br>
public String evalScript(String script) { <br>
} <br>
The argument package.class#field takes a form identical to
that of the @see argument, except that the member must be a
static field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These values of these constants
are also displayed on the Constant Field Values page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@version version-text <br>
Adds a &quot;Version&quot; subheading with the specified
version-text to the generated docs when the -version option
is used. This tag is intended to hold the current version
number <br>
of the software that this code is part of (as opposed to
@since, which holds the version number where this code was
introduced). The version-text has no special internal <br>
structure. To see where the version tag can be used, see
Where Tags Can Be Used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A doc comment may contain
multiple @version tags. If it makes sense, you can specify
one version number per @version tag or multiple version
numbers per tag. In the former <br>
case, the Javadoc tool inserts a comma (,) and space between
names. In the latter case, the entire text is simply copied
to the generated document without being parsed. There&acirc;
<br>
fore, you can use multiple names per line if you want a
localized name separator other than comma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more details, see writing
@version tags @ <br>

http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/index.html#@version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where Tags Can Be Used <br>
The following sections describe where the tags can be used.
Note that these tags can be used in all doc comments: @see,
@since, @deprecated, {@link}, {@linkplain}, and {@doc&acirc;
<br>
root}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overview Documentation Tags <br>
Overview tags are tags that can appear in the documentation
comment for the overview page (which resides in the source
file typically named overview.html). Like in any other
doc&acirc; <br>
umentation comments, these tags must appear after the main
description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE - The {@link} tag has a bug
in overview documents in version 1.2 -- the text appears
properly but has no link. The {@docRoot} tag does not
currently work in overview docu&acirc; <br>
ments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Package Documentation Tags <br>
Package tags are tags that can appear in the documentation
comment for a package (which resides in the source file
named package.html or package-info.java). The @serial tag
can <br>
only be used here with the include or exclude argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Class and Interface
Documentation Tags <br>
The following are tags that can appear in the documentation
comment for a class or interface. The @serial tag can only
be used here with the include or exclude argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example of a class
comment:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/** <br>
* A class representing a window on the screen. <br>
* For example: <br>
* &lt;pre&gt; <br>
* Window win = new Window(parent); <br>
* win.show(); <br>
* &lt;/pre&gt; <br>
* <br>
* @author Sami Shaio <br>
* @version 1.13, 06/08/06 <br>
* @see java.awt.BaseWindow <br>
* @see java.awt.Button <br>
*/ <br>
class Window extends BaseWindow { <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Field Documentation Tags <br>
The following are the tags that can appear in the
documentation comment for a field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example of a field
comment:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/** <br>
* The X-coordinate of the component. <br>
* <br>
* @see #getLocation() <br>
*/ <br>
int x = 1263732;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Constructor and Method
Documentation Tags <br>
The following are the tags that can appear in the
documentation comment for a constructor or method, except
for @return, which cannot appear in a constructor, and
{@inheritDoc}, <br>
which has certain restrictions. The @serialData tag can only
be used in the doc comment for certain serialization
methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example of a method doc
comment:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/** <br>
* Returns the character at the specified index. An index
<br>
* ranges from &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to
&lt;code&gt;length() - 1&lt;/code&gt;. <br>
* <br>
* @param index the index of the desired character. <br>
* @return the desired character. <br>
* @exception StringIndexOutOfRangeException <br>
* if the index is not in the range
&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; <br>
* to &lt;code&gt;length()-1&lt;/code&gt;. <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The javadoc tool uses doclets to determine its output. The
Javadoc tool uses the default standard doclet unless a
custom doclet is specified with the -doclet option. The
Javadoc <br>
tool provides a set of command-line options that can be used
with any doclet -- these options are described below under
the sub-heading Javadoc Options. The standard doclet
pro&acirc; <br>
vides an additional set of command-line options that are
described below under the sub-heading Options Provided by
the Standard Doclet. All option names are case-insensitive,
<br>
though their arguments can be case-sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options shown in italic are the
Javadoc core options, which are provided by the front end of
the Javadoc tool and are available to all doclets. The
standard doclet itself pro&acirc; <br>
vides the non-italic options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Javadoc Options <br>
-overview path/filename <br>
Specifies that javadoc should retrieve the text for the
overview documentation from the &quot;source&quot; file
specified by path/filename and place it on the Overview page
(over&acirc; <br>
view-summary.html). The path/filename is relative to the
-sourcepath.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While you can use any name you
want for filename and place it anywhere you want for path, a
typical thing to do is to name it overview.html and place it
in the source tree at <br>
the directory that contains the topmost package directories.
In this location, no path is needed when documenting
packages, since -sourcepath will point to this file. For
<br>
example, if the source tree for the java.lang package is
/src/classes/java/lang/, then you could place the overview
file at /src/classes/overview.html. See Real World
Example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For information about the file
specified by path/filename, see overview comment file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the overview page is
created only if you pass into javadoc two or more package
names. For further explanation, see HTML Frames.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The title on the overview page
is set by -doctitle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-public <br>
Shows only public classes and members.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-protected <br>
Shows only protected and public classes and members. This is
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-package <br>
Shows only package, protected, and public classes and
members.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-private <br>
Shows all classes and members.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help <br>
Displays the online help, which lists these javadoc and
doclet command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-doclet class <br>
Specifies the class file that starts the doclet used in
generating the documentation. Use the fully-qualified name.
This doclet defines the content and formats the output. <br>
If the -doclet option is not used, javadoc uses the standard
doclet for generating the default HTML format. This class
must contain the start(Root) method. The path to this <br>
starting class is defined by the -docletpath option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to call the MIF
doclet, use: <br>
-doclet com.sun.tools.doclets.mif.MIFDoclet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For full, working examples of
running a particular doclet, see Running the MIF Doclet @
<br>

http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/mifdoclet/docs/mifdoclet.html#runningmifdoclet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-docletpath classpathlist <br>
Specifies the path to the doclet starting class file
(specified with the -doclet option) and any jar files it
depends on. If the starting class file is in a jar file,
then <br>
this specifies the path to that jar file, as shown in the
example below. You can specify an absolute path or a path
relative to the current directory. If classpathlist
con&acirc; <br>
tains multiple paths or jar files, they should be separated
with a colon (:) on Solaris and a semi-colon (;) on Windows.
This option is not necessary if the doclet starting <br>
class is already in the search path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example of path to jar file that
contains the starting doclet class file. Notice the jar
filename is included. <br>
-docletpath /home/user/mifdoclet/lib/mifdoclet.jar <br>
Example of path to starting doclet class file. Notice the
class filename is omitted. <br>
-docletpath
/home/user/mifdoclet/classes/com/sun/tools/doclets/mif/ <br>
For full, working examples of running a particular doclet,
see Running the MIF Doclet @ <br>

http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/mifdoclet/docs/mifdoclet.html#runningmifdoclet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1.1 <br>
This feature has been removed from Javadoc 1.4. There is no
replacement for it. This option created documentation with
the appearance and functionality of documentation <br>
generated by Javadoc 1.1 (it never supported nested
classes). If you need this option, use Javadoc 1.2 or 1.3
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-source release <br>
Specifies the version of source code accepted. The following
values for release are allowed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the value of release
corresponding to that used when compiling the code with
javac.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sourcepath sourcepathlist <br>
Specifies the search paths for finding source files (.java)
when passing package names or -subpackages into the javadoc
command. The sourcepathlist can contain multiple <br>
paths by separating them with a colon (:). The Javadoc tool
will search in all subdirectories of the specified paths.
Note that this option is not only used to locate the <br>
source files being documented, but also to find source files
that are not being documented but whose comments are
inherited by the source files being documented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that you can use the
-sourcepath option only when passing package names into the
javadoc command -- it will not locate .java files passed
into the javadoc command. (To <br>
locate .java files, cd to that directory or include the path
ahead of each file, as shown at Documenting One or More
Classes.) If -sourcepath is omitted, javadoc uses the <br>
class path to find the source files (see -classpath).
Therefore, the default -sourcepath is the value of class
path. If -classpath is omitted and you are passing package
names <br>
into javadoc, it looks in the current directory (and
subdirectories) for the source files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set sourcepathlist to the root
directory of the source tree for the package you are
documenting. For example, suppose you want to document a
package called com.mypackage whose <br>
source files are located at: <br>
/home/user/src/com/mypackage/*.java <br>
In this case you would specify the sourcepath to
/home/user/src, the directory that contains com/mypackage,
and then supply the package name com.mypackage: <br>
% javadoc -sourcepath /home/user/src/ com.mypackage <br>
This is easy to remember by noticing that if you concatenate
the value of sourcepath and the package name together and
change the dot to a slash &quot;/&quot;, you end up with the
full <br>
path to the package: /home/user/src/com/mypackage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To point to two source paths:
<br>
% javadoc -sourcepath /home/user1/src:/home/user2/src
com.mypackage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-classpath classpathlist <br>
Specifies the paths where javadoc will look for referenced
classes (.class files) -- these are the documented classes
plus any classes referenced by those classes. The <br>
classpathlist can contain multiple paths by separating them
with a colon (:). The Javadoc tool will search in all
subdirectories of the specified paths. Follow the
instruc&acirc; <br>
tions in class path documentation for specifying
classpathlist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -sourcepath is omitted, the
Javadoc tool uses -classpath to find the source files as
well as class files (for backward compatibility). Therefore,
if you want to search for <br>
source and class files in separate paths, use both
-sourcepath and -classpath.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if you want to
document com.mypackage, whose source files reside in the
directory /home/user/src/com/mypackage, and if this package
relies on a library in <br>
/home/user/lib, you would specify: <br>
% javadoc -classpath /home/user/lib -sourcepath
/home/user/src com.mypackage <br>
As with other tools, if you do not specify -classpath, the
Javadoc tool uses the CLASSPATH environment variable, if it
is set. If both are not set, the Javadoc tool searches <br>
for classes from the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For an in-depth description of
how the Javadoc tool uses -classpath to find user classes as
it relates to extension classes and bootstrap classes, see
How Classes Are Found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special convenience, a
class path element containing a basename of * is considered
equivalent to specifying a list of all the files in the
directory with the extension <br>
.jar or .JAR (a java program cannot tell the difference
between the two invocations). <br>
For example, if directory foo contains a.jar and b.JAR, then
the class path element foo/* is expanded to a A.jar:b.JAR,
except that the order of jar files is unspecified. All <br>
jar files in the specified directory, even hidden ones, are
included in the list. A classpath entry consisting simply of
* expands to a list of all the jar files in the cur&acirc;
<br>
rent directory. The CLASSPATH environment variable, where
defined, will be similarly expanded. Any classpath wildcard
expansion occurs before the Java virtual machine is <br>
started -- no Java program will ever see unexpanded
wildcards except by querying the environment. For example;
by invoking System.getenv(&quot;CLASSPATH&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-subpackages
package1:package2:... <br>
Generates documentation from source files in the specified
packages and recursively in their subpackages. This option
is useful when adding new subpackages to the source <br>
code, as they are automatically included. Each package
argument is any top-level subpackage (such as java) or fully
qualified package (such as javax.swing) that does not <br>
need to contain source files. Arguments are separated by
colons (on all operating systmes). Wildcards are not needed
or allowed. Use -sourcepath to specify where to find <br>
the packages. This option is smart about not processing
source files that are in the source tree but do not belong
to the packages, as described at processing of source <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example: <br>
% javadoc -d docs -sourcepath /home/user/src -subpackages
java:javax.swing <br>
This command generates documentation for packages named
&quot;java&quot; and &quot;javax.swing&quot; and all their
subpackages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use -subpackages in
conjunction with -exclude to exclude specific packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-exclude
packagename1:packagename2:... <br>
Unconditionally excludes the specified packages and their
subpackages from the list formed by -subpackages. It
excludes those packages even if they would otherwise be <br>
included by some previous or later -subpackages option. For
example: <br>
% javadoc -sourcepath /home/user/src -subpackages java
-exclude java.net:java.lang <br>
would include java.io, java.util, and java.math (among
others), but would exclude packages rooted at java.net and
java.lang. Notice this excludes java.lang.ref, a
subpack&acirc; <br>
age of java.lang).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bootclasspath classpathlist
<br>
Specifies the paths where the boot classes reside. These are
nominally the Java platform classes. The bootclasspath is
part of the search path the Javadoc tool will use to <br>
look up source and class files. See How Classes Are Found.
for more details. Separate directories in classpathlist with
colons (:).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-extdirs dirlist <br>
Specifies the directories where extension classes reside.
These are any classes that use the Java Extension mechanism.
The extdirs is part of the search path the Javadoc <br>
tool will use to look up source and class files. See
-classpath (above) for more details. Separate directories in
dirlist with colons (:).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Provides more detailed messages while javadoc is running.
Without the verbose option, messages appear for loading the
source files, generating the documentation (one mes&acirc;
<br>
sage per source file), and sorting. The verbose option
causes the printing of additional messages specifying the
number of milliseconds to parse each java source file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quiet <br>
Shuts off non-error and non-warning messages, leaving only
the warnings and errors appear, making them easier to view.
Also suppresses the version string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-breakiterator <br>
Uses the internationalized sentence boundary of
java.text.BreakIterator to determine the end of the first
sentence for English (all other locales already use
BreakItera&acirc; <br>
tor), rather than an English language, locale-specific
algorithm. By first sentence, we mean the first sentence in
the main description of a package, class or member. This
<br>
sentence is copied to the package, class or member summary,
and to the alphabetic index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From JDK 1.2 forward, the
BreakIterator class is already used to determine the end of
sentence for all languages but English. Therefore, the
-breakiterator option has no <br>
effect except for English from 1.2 forward. English has its
own default algorithm:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o English default sentence-break
algorithm - Stops at a period followed by a space or a HTML
block tag, such as &lt;P&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Breakiterator sentence-break
algorithm - In general, stops at a period, question mark or
exclamation mark followed by a space if the next word starts
with a capital let&acirc; <br>
ter. This is meant to handle most abbreviations (such as
&quot;The serial no. is valid&quot;, but won&rsquo;t handle
&quot;Mr. Smith&quot;). Doesn&rsquo;t stop at HTML tags or
sentences that begin with <br>
numbers or symbols. Stops at the last period in
&quot;../filename&quot;, even if embedded in an HTML
tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: We have removed from 1.5.0
the breakiterator warning messages that were in 1.4.x and
have left the default sentence-break algorithm unchanged.
That is, the -breakit&acirc; <br>
erator option is not the default in 1.5.0, nor do we expect
it to become the default. This is a reversal from our former
intention that the default would change in the <br>
&quot;next major release&quot; (1.5.0). This means if you
have not modified your source code to eliminate the
breakiterator warnings in 1.4.x, then you don&rsquo;t have
to do anything, and <br>
the warnings go away starting with 1.5.0. The reason for
this reversal is because any benefit to having breakiterator
become the default would be outweighed by the incom&acirc;
<br>
patible source change it would require. We regret any extra
work and confusion this has caused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-locale
language_country_variant</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Important - The -locale option
must be placed ahead (to the left) of any options provided
by the standard doclet or any other doclet. Otherwise, the
navigation bars will <br>
appear in English. This is the only command-line option that
is order-dependent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies the locale that
javadoc uses when generating documentation. The argument is
the name of the locale, as described in java.util.Locale
documentation, such as en_US <br>
(English, United States) or en_US_WIN (Windows variant).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying a locale causes
javadoc to choose the resource files of that locale for
messages (strings in the navigation bar, headings for lists
and tables, help file contents, <br>
comments in stylesheet.css, and so forth). It also specifies
the sorting order for lists sorted alphabetically, and the
sentence separator to determine the end of the first <br>
sentence. It does not determine the locale of the doc
comment text specified in the source files of the documented
classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-encoding name <br>
Specifies the encoding name of the source files, such as
EUCJIS/SJIS. If this option is not specified, the platform
default converter is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also see -docencoding and
-charset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Jflag <br>
Passes flag directly to the runtime system java that runs
javadoc. Notice there must be no space between the J and the
flag. For example, if you need to ensure that the <br>
system sets aside 32 megabytes of memory in which to process
the generated documentation, then you would call the -Xmx
option of java as follows (-Xms is optional, as it <br>
only sets the size of initial memory, which is useful if you
know the minimum amount of memory required): <br>
% javadoc -J-Xmx32m -J-Xms32m com.mypackage <br>
To tell what version of javadoc you are using, call the
&quot;-version&quot; option of java: <br>
% javadoc -J-version <br>
java version &quot;1.2&quot; <br>
Classic VM (build JDK-1.2-V, green threads, sunwjit) <br>
(The version number of the standard doclet appears in its
output stream.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options Provided by the Standard
Doclet <br>
-d directory <br>
Specifies the destination directory where javadoc saves the
generated HTML files. (The &quot;d&quot; means
&quot;destination.&quot;) Omitting this option causes the
files to be saved to the <br>
current directory. The value directory can be absolute, or
relative to the current working directory. As of 1.4, the
destination directory is automatically created when <br>
javadoc is run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the following
generates the documentation for the package com.mypackage
and saves the results in the /home/user/doc/ directory: <br>
% javadoc -d /home/user/doc com.mypackage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-use <br>
Includes one &quot;Use&quot; page for each documented class
and package. The page describes what packages, classes,
methods, constructors and fields use any API of the given
class or <br>
package. Given class C, things that use class C would
include subclasses of C, fields declared as C, methods that
return C, and methods and constructors with parameters of
<br>
type C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, let&rsquo;s look at
what might appear on the &quot;Use&quot; page for String.
The getName() method in the java.awt.Font class returns type
String. Therefore, getName() uses <br>
String, and you will find that method on the &quot;Use&quot;
page for String.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this documents only
uses of the API, not the implementation. If a method uses
String in its implementation but does not take a string as
an argument or return a <br>
string, that is not considered a &quot;use&quot; of
String.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can access the generated
&quot;Use&quot; page by first going to the class or package,
then clicking on the &quot;Use&quot; link in the navigation
bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Includes the @version text in the generated docs. This text
is omitted by default. To tell what version of the Javadoc
tool you are using, use the -J-version option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-author <br>
Includes the @author text in the generated docs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-splitindex <br>
Splits the index file into multiple files, alphabetically,
one file per letter, plus a file for any index entries that
start with non-alphabetical characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-windowtitle title <br>
Specifies the title to be placed in the HTML &lt;title&gt;
tag. This appears in the window title and in any browser
bookmarks (favorite places) that someone creates for this
<br>
page. This title should not contain any HTML tags, as the
browser will not properly interpret them. Any internal
quotation marks within title may have to be escaped. If <br>
-windowtitle is omitted, the Javadoc tool uses the value of
-doctitle for this option. <br>
% javadoc -windowtitle &quot;Java 2 Platform&quot;
com.mypackage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-doctitle title <br>
Specifies the title to be placed near the top of the
overview summary file. The title will be placed as a
centered, level-one heading directly beneath the upper
navigation <br>
bar. The title may contain html tags and white space, though
if it does, it must be enclosed in quotes. Any internal
quotation marks within title may have to be escaped. <br>
% javadoc -doctitle &quot;Java&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size=</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-title title <br>
This option no longer exists. It existed only in Beta
versions of Javadoc 1.2. It has been renamed to -doctitle.
This option is being renamed to make it clear that it <br>
defines the document title rather than the window title.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-header header <br>
Specifies the header text to be placed at the top of each
output file. The header will be placed to the right of the
upper navigation bar. header may contain HTML tags and <br>
white space, though if it does, it must be enclosed in
quotes. Any internal quotation marks within header may have
to be escaped. <br>
% javadoc -header &quot;&lt;b&gt;Java 2 Platform
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;v1.4&quot; com.mypackage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-footer footer <br>
Specifies the footer text to be placed at the bottom of each
output file. The footer will be placed to the right of the
lower navigation bar. footer may contain html tags <br>
and white space, though if it does, it must be enclosed in
quotes. Any internal quotation marks within footer may have
to be escaped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bottom text <br>
Specifies the text to be placed at the bottom of each output
file. The text will be placed at the bottom of the page,
below the lower navigation bar. The text may contain <br>
HTML tags and white space, though if it does, it must be
enclosed in quotes. Any internal quotation marks within text
may have to be escaped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-link extdocURL <br>
Creates links to existing javadoc-generated documentation of
external referenced classes. It takes one argument:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o extdocURL is the absolute or
relative URL of the directory containing the external
javadoc-generated documentation you want to link to.
Examples are shown below. The <br>
package-list file must be found in this directory
(otherwise, use -linkoffline). The Javadoc tool reads the
package names from the package-list file and then links to
<br>
those packages at that URL. When the Javadoc tool is run,
the extdocURL value is copied literally into the &lt;A
HREF&gt; links that are created. Therefore, extdocURL must
be <br>
the URL to the directory, not to a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use an absolute link for
extdocURL to enable your docs to link to a document on any
website, or can use a relative link to link only to a
relative location. If rel&acirc; <br>
ative, the value you pass in should be the relative path
from the destination directory (specified with -d) to the
directory containing the packages being linked to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When specifying an absolute link
you normally use an http: link. However, if you want to link
to a file system that has no web server, you can use a file:
link -- however, <br>
do this only if everyone wanting to access the generated
documentation shares the same file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In all cases, and on all
operating systems, you should use a forward slash as the
separator, whether the URL is absolute or relative, and
&quot;http:&quot; or &quot;file:&quot; based (as spec&acirc;
<br>
ified in the URL Memo @ <br>
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Absolute http: based link: <br>
-link
http://&lt;host&gt;/&lt;directory&gt;/&lt;directory&gt;/.../&lt;name&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Absolute file: based link: <br>
-link
file://&lt;host&gt;/&lt;directory&gt;/&lt;directory&gt;/.../&lt;name&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Relative link: <br>
-link
&lt;directory&gt;/&lt;directory&gt;/.../&lt;name&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify multiple -link
options in a given javadoc run to link to multiple
documents. Choosing between -linkoffline and -link: <br>
Use -link:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o when using a relative path to
the external API document, or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o when using an absolute URL to
the external API document, if your shell allows a program to
open a connection to that URL for reading. <br>
Use -linkoffline:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o when using an absolute URL to
the external API document, if your shell does not allow a
program to open a connection to that URL for reading. This
can occur if you are <br>
behind a firewall and the document you want to link to is on
the other side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example using absolute links to
the external docs - Let&rsquo;s say you want to link to the
java.lang, java.io and other Java 2 Platform packages at
<br>
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api @ <br>
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api, The following
command generates documentation for the package
com.mypackage with links to the Java 2 Platform packages.
The generated <br>
documentation will contain links to the Object class, for
example, in the class trees. (Other options, such as
-sourcepath and -d, are not shown.) <br>
% javadoc -link http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api
com.mypackage <br>
Example using relative links to the external docs -
Let&rsquo;s say you have two packages whose docs are
generated in different runs of the Javadoc tool, and those
docs are sepa&acirc; <br>
rated by a relative path. In this example, the packages are
com.apipackage, an API, and com.spipackage, an SPI (Service
Provide Interface). You want the documentation to <br>
reside in docs/api/com/apipackage and
docs/spi/com/spipackage. Assuming the API package
documentation is already generated, and that docs is the
current directory, you would <br>
document the SPI package with links to the API documentation
by running: <br>
% javadoc -d ./spi -link ../api com.spipackage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice the -link argument is
relative to the destination directory (docs/spi).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Details - The -link option
enables you to link to classes referenced to by your code
but not documented in the current javadoc run. For these
links to go to valid pages, you <br>
must know where those HTML pages are located, and specify
that location with extdocURL. This allows, for instance,
third party documentation to link to java.* documentation on
<br>
http://java.sun.com.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Omit the -link option for
javadoc to create links only to API within the documentation
it is generating in the current run. (Without the -link
option, the Javadoc tool does <br>
not create links to documentation for external references,
because it does not know if or where that documentation
exists.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can create links in
several places in the generated documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another use is for cross-links
between sets of packages: Execute javadoc on one set of
packages, then run javadoc again on another set of packages,
creating links both ways <br>
between both sets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How a Class Must be Referenced -
For a link to an external referenced class to actually
appear (and not just its text label), the class must be
referenced in the following <br>
way. It is not sufficient for it to be referenced in the
body of a method. It must be referenced in either an import
statement or in a declaration. Here are examples of how <br>
the class java.io.File can be referenced:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o In any kind of import
statement: by wildcard import, import explicitly by name, or
automatically import for java.lang.*. For example, this
would suffice: <br>
import java.io.*; <br>
In 1.3.x and 1.2.x, only an explicit import by name works --
a wildcard import statement does not work, nor does the
automatic import java.lang.*.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o In a declaration: <br>
void foo(File f) {} <br>
The reference and be in the return type or parameter type of
a method, constructor, field, class or interface, or in an
implements, extends or throws statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An important corollary is that
when you use the -link option, there may be many links that
unintentionally do not appear due to this constraint. (The
text would appear without <br>
a hypertext link.) You can detect these by the warnings they
emit. The most innocuous way to properly reference a class
and thereby add the link would be to import that class, <br>
as shown above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Package List - The -link option
requires that a file named package-list, which is generated
by the Javadoc tool, exist at the URL you specify with
-link. The package-list file <br>
is a simple text file that lists the names of packages
documented at that location. In the earlier example, the
Javadoc tool looks for a file named package-list at the
given <br>
URL, reads in the package names and then links to those
packages at that URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the package list
for the Java 2 Platform 5.0 API is located at
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/package-list @ <br>
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/package-list. and
starts out as follows: <br>
java.applet <br>
java.awt <br>
java.awt.color <br>
java.awt.datatransfer <br>
java.awt.dnd <br>
java.awt.event <br>
java.awt.font <br>
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When javadoc is run without the
-link option, when it encounters a name that belongs to an
external referenced class, it prints the name with no link.
However, when the -link <br>
option is used, the Javadoc tool searches the package-list
file at the specified extdocURL location for that package
name. If it finds the package name, it prefixes the name
<br>
with extdocURL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order for there to be no
broken links, all of the documentation for the external
references must exist at the specified URLs. The Javadoc
tool will not check that these <br>
pages exist -- only that the package-list exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple Links - You can supply
multiple -link options to link to any number of external
generated documents. Javadoc 1.2 has a known bug which
prevents you from supplying <br>
more than one -link command. This was fixed in 1.2.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify a different link option
for each external document to link to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% javadoc -link extdocURL1 -link
extdocURL2 ... -link extdocURLn com.mypackage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where extdocURL1, extdocURL2,
... extdocURLn point respectively to the roots of external
documents, each of which contains a file named
package-list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cross-links - Note that
&quot;bootstrapping&quot; may be required when cross-linking
two or more documents that have not previously been
generated. In other words, if package-list does <br>
not exist for either document, when you run the Javadoc tool
on the first document, the package-list will not yet exist
for the second document. Therefore, to create the <br>
external links, you must re-generate the first document
after generating the second document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case, the purpose of
first generating a document is to create its package-list
(or you can create it by hand it if you&rsquo;re certain of
the package names). Then generate <br>
the second document with its external links. The Javadoc
tool prints a warning if a needed external package-list file
does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-linkoffline extdocURL
packagelistLoc <br>
This option is a variation of -link; they both create links
to javadoc-generated documentation for external referenced
classes. Use the -linkoffline option when linking to <br>
a document on the web when the Javadoc tool itself is
&quot;offline&quot; -- that is, it cannot access the
document through a web connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More specifically, use
-linkoffline if the external document&rsquo;s package-list
file is not accessible or does not exist at the extdocURL
location but does exist at a different <br>
location, which can be specified by packageListLoc
(typically local). Thus, if extdocURL is accessible only on
the World Wide Web, -linkoffline removes the constraint that
the <br>
Javadoc tool have a web connection when generating the
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another use is as a
&quot;hack&quot; to update docs: After you have run javadoc
on a full set of packages, then you can run javadoc again on
onlya smaller set of changed packages, so <br>
that the updated files can be inserted back into the
original set. Examples are given below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -linkoffline option takes
two arguments -- the first for the string to be embedded in
the &lt;a href&gt; links, the second telling it where to
find package-list:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o extdocURL is the absolute or
relative URL of the directory containing the external
javadoc-generated documentation you want to link to. If
relative, the value should be <br>
the relative path from the destination directory (specified
with -d) to the root of the packages being linked to. For
more details, see extdocURL in the -link option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o packagelistLoc is the path or
URL to the directory containing the package-list file for
the external documentation. This can be a URL (http: or
file:) or file path, and <br>
can be absolute or relative. If relative, make it relative
to the current directory from where javadoc was run. Do not
include the package-list filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify multiple
-linkoffline options in a given javadoc run. (Prior to
1.2.2, it could be specified only once.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example using absolute links to
the external docs - Let&rsquo;s say you want to link to the
java.lang, java.io and other Java 2 Platform packages at
<br>
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api, but your shell does
not have web access. You could open the package-list file in
a browser at <br>
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/package-list @ <br>
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/package-list, save
it to a local directory, and point to this local copy with
the second argument, packagelistLoc. In this example, the
<br>
package list file has been saved to the current directory
&quot;.&quot; . The following command generates
documentation for the package com.mypackage with links to
the Java 2 Platform <br>
packages. The generated documentation will contain links to
the Object class, for example, in the class trees. (Other
necessary options, such as -sourcepath, are not shown.) <br>
% javadoc -linkoffline
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api . com.mypackage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example using relative links to
the external docs - It&rsquo;s not very common to use
-linkoffline with relative paths, for the simple reason that
-link usually suffices. When using <br>
-linkoffline, the package-list file is generally local, and
when using relative links, the file you are linking to is
also generally local. So it is usually unnecessary to <br>
give a different path for the two arguments to -linkoffline.
When the two arguments are identical, you can use -link. See
the -link relative example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Manually Creating a package-list
File - If a package-list file does not yet exist, but you
know what package names your document will link to, you can
create your own copy of <br>
this file by hand and specify its path with packagelistLoc.
An example would be the previous case where the package list
for com.spipackage did not exist when com.apipackage <br>
was first generated. This technique is useful when you need
to generate documentation that links to new external
documentation whose package names you know, but which is not
<br>
yet published. This is also a way of creating package-list
files for packages generated with Javadoc 1.0 or 1.1, where
package-list files were not generated. Likewise, two <br>
companies can share their unpublished package-list files,
enabling them to release their cross-linked documentation
simultaneously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Linking to Multiple Documents -
You can include -linkoffline once for each generated
document you want to refer to (each option is shown on a
separate line for clarity):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% javadoc -linkoffline
extdocURL1 packagelistLoc1 -linkoffline extdocURL2
packagelistLoc2 ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Updating docs - Another use for
-linkoffline option is useful if your project has dozens or
hundreds of packages, if you have already run javadoc on the
entire tree, and now, <br>
in a separate run, you want to quickly make some small
changes and re-run javadoc on just a small portion of the
source tree. This is somewhat of a hack in that it works
prop&acirc; <br>
erly only if your changes are only to doc comments and not
to declarations. If you were to add, remove or change any
declarations from the source code, then broken links could
<br>
show up in the index, package tree, inherited member lists,
use page, and other places.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, you create a new
destination directory (call it update) for this new small
run. Let&rsquo;s say the original destination directory was
named html. In the simplest example, cd <br>
to the parent of html. Set the first argument of
-linkoffline to the current directory &quot;.&quot; and set
the second argument to the relative path to html, where it
can find pack&acirc; <br>
age-list, and pass in only the package names of the packages
you want to update: <br>
% javadoc -d update -linkoffline . html com.mypackage <br>
When the Javadoc tool is done, copy these generated class
pages in update/com/package (not the overview or index),
over the original files in html/com/package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-linksource <br>
Creates an HTML version of each source file (with line
numbers) and adds links to them from the standard HTML
documentation. Links are created for classes, interfaces,
con&acirc; <br>
structors, methods and fields whose declarations are in a
source file. Otherwise, links are not created, such as for
default constructors and generated classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option exposes all private
implementation details in the included source files,
including private classes, private fields, and the bodies of
private methods, regardless <br>
of the -public, -package, -protected and -private options.
Unless you also use the -private option, not all private
classes or interfaces will necessarily be accessible via
<br>
links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each link appears on the name of
the identifier in its declaration. For example, the link to
the source code of the Button class would be on the word
&quot;Button&quot;: <br>
public class Button <br>
extends Component <br>
implements Accessible <br>
and the link to the source code of the getLabel() method in
the Button class would be on the word &quot;getLabel&quot;:
<br>
public String getLabel()</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-group groupheading
packagepattern:packagepattern:... <br>
Separates packages on the overview page into whatever groups
you specify, one group per table. You specify each group
with a different -group option. The groups appear on <br>
the page in the order specified on the command line;
packages are alphabetized within a group. For a given -group
option, the packages matching the list of packagepattern
<br>
expressions appear in a table with the heading
groupheading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o groupheading can be any text,
and can include white space. This text is placed in the
table heading for the group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o packagepattern can be any
package name, or can be the start of any package name
followed by an asterisk (*). The asterisk is a wildcard
meaning &quot;match any characters&quot;. <br>
This is the only wildcard allowed. Multiple patterns can be
included in a group by separating them with colons (:).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: If using an asterisk in a
pattern or pattern list, the pattern list must be inside
quotes, such as &quot;java.lang*:java.util&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not supply any -group
option, all packages are placed in one group with the
heading &quot;Packages&quot;. If the all groups do not
include all documented packages, any left&acirc; <br>
over packages appear in a separate group with the heading
&quot;Other Packages&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the following
option separates the four documented packages into core,
extension and other packages. Notice the trailing
&quot;dot&quot; does not appear in &quot;java.lang*&quot; --
<br>
including the dot, such as &quot;java.lang.*&quot; would
omit the java.lang package. <br>
% javadoc -group &quot;Core Packages&quot;
&quot;java.lang*:java.util&quot; <br>
-group &quot;Extension Packages&quot; &quot;javax.*&quot;
<br>
java.lang java.lang.reflect java.util javax.servlet java.new
<br>
This results in the groupings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Core Packages <br>
java.lang java.lang.reflect java.util</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extension Packages <br>
javax.servlet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other Packages <br>
java.new</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nodeprecated <br>
Prevents the generation of any deprecated API at all in the
documentation. This does what -nodeprecatedlist does, plus
it does not generate any deprecated API throughout <br>
the rest of the documentation. This is useful when writing
code and you don&rsquo;t want to be distracted by the
deprecated code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nodeprecatedlist <br>
Prevents the generation of the file containing the list of
deprecated APIs (deprecated-list.html) and the link in the
navigation bar to that page. (However, javadoc contin&acirc;
<br>
ues to generate the deprecated API throughout the rest of
the document.) This is useful if your source code contains
no deprecated API, and you want to make the navigation <br>
bar cleaner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nosince <br>
Omits from the generated docs the &quot;Since&quot; sections
associated with the @since tags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-notree <br>
Omits the class/interface hierarchy pages from the generated
docs. These are the pages you reach using the
&quot;Tree&quot; button in the navigation bar. The hierarchy
is produced by <br>
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noindex <br>
Omits the index from the generated docs. The index is
produced by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nohelp <br>
Omits the HELP link in the navigation bars at the top and
bottom of each page of output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nonavbar <br>
Prevents the generation of the navigation bar, header and
footer, otherwise found at the top and bottom of the
generated pages. Has no affect on the &quot;bottom&quot;
option. The <br>
-nonavbar option is useful when you are interested only in
the content and have no need for navigation, such as
converting the files to PostScript or PDF for print
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-helpfile path/filename <br>
Specifies the path of an alternate help file path/filename
that the HELP link in the top and bottom navigation bars
link to. Without this option, the Javadoc tool
automati&acirc; <br>
cally creates a help file help-doc.html that is hard-coded
in the Javadoc tool. This option enables you to override
this default. The filename can be any name and is not <br>
restricted to help-doc.html -- the Javadoc tool will adjust
the links in the navigation bar accordingly. For example:
<br>
% javadoc -helpfile /home/user/myhelp.html java.awt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stylesheetfile path/filename
<br>
Specifies the path of an alternate HTML stylesheet file.
Without this option, the Javadoc tool automatically creates
a stylesheet file stylesheet.css that is hard-coded in <br>
the Javadoc tool. This option enables you to override this
default. The filename can be any name and is not restricted
to stylesheet.css. For example: <br>
% javadoc -stylesheetfile /home/user/mystylesheet.css
com.mypackage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-serialwarn <br>
Generates compile-time warnings for missing @serial tags. By
default, Javadoc 1.2.2 (and later versions) generates no
serial warnings. (This is a reversal from earlier ver&acirc;
<br>
sions.) Use this option to display the serial warnings,
which helps to properly document default serializable fields
and writeExternal methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-charset name <br>
Specifies the HTML character set for this document. The name
should be a preferred MIME name as given in the IANA
Registry @ <br>
http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets. For example:
<br>
% javadoc -charset &quot;iso-8859-1&quot; mypackage <br>
would insert the following line in the head of every
generated page: <br>
&lt;META http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;
content=&quot;text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1&quot;&gt; <br>
This META tag is described in the HTML standard @ <br>
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/charset.html#h-5.2.2.
(4197265 and 4137321)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also see -encoding and
-docencoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-docencoding name <br>
Specifies the encoding of the generated HTML files. The name
should be a preferred MIME name as given in the IANA
Registry @ <br>
http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets. If you omit
this option but use -encoding, then the encoding of the
generated HTML files is determined by -encoding. Exam&acirc;
<br>
ple: <br>
% javadoc -docencoding &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; mypackage <br>
Also see -encoding and -charset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keywords <br>
Adds HTML meta keyword tags to the generated file for each
class. These tags can help the page be found by search
engines that look for meta tags. (Most search engines that
<br>
search the entire Internet do not look at meta tags, because
pages can misuse them; but search engines offered by
companies that confine their search to their own website
<br>
can benefit by looking at meta tags.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The meta tags include the fully
qualified name of the class and the unqualified names of the
fields and methods. Constructors are not included because
they are identical to <br>
the class name. For example, the class String starts with
these keywords: <br>
&lt;META NAME=&quot;keywords&quot;
CONTENT=&quot;java.lang.String class&quot;&gt; <br>
&lt;META NAME=&quot;keywords&quot;
CONTENT=&quot;CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER&quot;&gt; <br>
&lt;META NAME=&quot;keywords&quot;
CONTENT=&quot;length()&quot;&gt; <br>
&lt;META NAME=&quot;keywords&quot;
CONTENT=&quot;charAt()&quot;&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tag
tagname:Xaoptcmf:&quot;taghead&quot; <br>
Enables the Javadoc tool to interpret a simple, one-argument
custom block tag @tagname in doc comments. So the Javadoc
tool can &quot;spell-check&quot; tag names, it is important
to <br>
include a -tag option for every custom tag that is present
in the source code, disabling (with X) those that are not
being output in the current run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The colon (:) is always the
separator. To use a colon in tagname, see Use of Colon in
Tag Name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -tag option outputs the
tag&rsquo;s heading taghead in bold, followed on the next
line by the text from its single argument, as shown in the
example below. Like any block tag, <br>
this argument&rsquo;s text can contain inline tags, which
are also interpreted. The output is similar to standard
one-argument tags, such as @return and @author. Omitting
taghead <br>
causes tagname to appear as the heading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Placement of tags - The Xaoptcmf
part of the argument determines where in the source code the
tag is allowed to be placed, and whether the tag can be
disabled (using X). You <br>
can supply either a, to allow the tag in all places, or any
combination of the other letters: X (disable tag) <br>
a (all) <br>
o (overview) <br>
p (packages) <br>
t (types, that is classes and interfaces) <br>
c (constructors) <br>
m (methods) <br>
f (fields)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples of single tags - An
example of a tag option for a tag that that can be used
anywhere in the source code is: <br>
-tag todo:a:&quot;To Do:&quot; <br>
If you wanted @todo to be used only with constructors,
methods and fields, you would use: <br>
-tag todo:cmf:&quot;To Do:&quot; <br>
Notice the last colon (:) above is not a parameter
separator, but is part of the heading text (as shown below).
You would use either tag option for source code that
contains <br>
the tag @todo, such as: <br>
@todo The documentation for this method needs work. <br>
Use of Colon in Tag Name - A colon can be used in a tag name
if it is escaped with a backslash. For this doc comment:
<br>
/** <br>
* @ejb:bean <br>
*/ <br>
use this tag option: <br>
-tag ejb\:bean:a:&quot;EJB Bean:&quot; <br>
Spell-checking tag names (Disabling tags) - Some developers
put custom tags in the source code that they don&rsquo;t
always want to output. In these cases, it is important to
list <br>
all tags that are present in the source code, enabling the
ones you want to output and disabling the ones you
don&rsquo;t want to output. The presence of X disables the
tag, while <br>
its absence enables the tag. This gives the Javadoc tool
enough information to know if a tag it encounters is
unknown, probably the results of a typo or a misspelling. It
<br>
prints a warning in these cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can add X to the placement
values already present, so that when you want to enable the
tag, you can simply delete the X. For example, if @todo is a
tag that you want to <br>
suppress on output, you would use: <br>
-tag todo:Xcmf:&quot;To Do:&quot; <br>
or, if you&rsquo;d rather keep it simple: <br>
-tag todo:X</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syntax -tag todo:X works
even if @todo is defined by a taglet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Order of tags - The order of the
-tag (and -taglet) options determine the order the tags are
output. You can mix the custom tags with the standard tags
to intersperse them. <br>
The tag options for standard tags are placeholders only for
determining the order -- they take only the standard
tag&rsquo;s name. (Subheadings for standard tags cannot be
altered.) <br>
This is illustrated in the following example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -tag is missing, then the
position of -taglet determines its order. If they are both
present, then whichever appears last on the command line
determines its order. (This <br>
happens because the tags and taglets are processed in the
order that they appear on the command line. For example, if
-taglet and -tag both have the name &quot;todo&quot;, the
one that <br>
appears last on the command line will determine its
order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example of a complete set of
tags - This example inserts &quot;To Do&quot; after
&quot;Parameters&quot; and before &quot;Throws&quot; in the
output. By using &quot;X&quot;, it also specifies that
@example is a tag <br>
that might be encountered in the source code that should not
be output during this run. Notice that if you use @argfile,
you can put the tags on separate lines in an argument <br>
file like this (no line continuation characters needed):
<br>
-tag param <br>
-tag return <br>
-tag todo:a:&quot;To Do:&quot; <br>
-tag throws <br>
-tag see <br>
-tag example:X</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When javadoc parses the doc
comments, any tag encountered that is neither a standard tag
nor passed in with -tag or -taglet is considered unknown,
and a warning is thrown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standard tags are initially
stored internally in a list in their default order. Whenever
-tag options are used, those tags get appended to this list
-- standard tags are <br>
moved from their default position. Therefore, if a -tag
option is omitted for a standard tag, it remains in its
default position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Avoiding Conflicts - If you want
to slice out your own namespace, you can use a dot-separated
naming convention similar to that used for packages:
com.mycompany.todo. Sun will <br>
continue to create standard tags whose names do not contain
dots. Any tag you create will override the behavior of a tag
by the same name defined by Sun. In other words, if <br>
you create a tag or taglet @todo, it will always have the
same behavior you define, even if Sun later creates a
standard tag of the same name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Annotations vs. Javadoc Tags -
In general, if the markup you want to add is intended to
affect or produce documentation, it should probably be a
javadoc tag; otherwise, it <br>
should be an annotation. See Comparing Annotations and
Javadoc Tags @ <br>

http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/index.html#annotations</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also create more complex
block tags, or custom inline tags with the -taglet
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-taglet class <br>
Specifies the class file that starts the taglet used in
generating the documentation for that tag. Use the
fully-qualified name for class. This taglet also defines the
num&acirc; <br>
ber of text arguments that the custom tag has. The taglet
accepts those arguments, processes them, and generates the
output. For extensive documentation with example <br>
taglets, see:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Taglet Overview</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Taglets are useful for block or
inline tags. They can have any number of arguments and
implement custom behavior, such as making text bold,
formatting bullets, writing out the <br>
text to a file, or starting other processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Taglets can only determine where
a tag should appear and in what form. All other decisions
are made by the doclet. So a taglet cannot do things such as
remove a class name <br>
from the list of included classes. However, it can execute
side effects, such as printing the tag&rsquo;s text to a
file or triggering another process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the -tagletpath option to
specify the path to the taglet. Here is an example that
inserts the &quot;To Do&quot; taglet after
&quot;Parameters&quot; and ahead of &quot;Throws&quot; in
the generated <br>
pages: <br>
-taglet com.sun.tools.doclets.ToDoTaglet <br>
-tagletpath /home/taglets <br>
-tag return <br>
-tag param <br>
-tag todo <br>
-tag throws <br>
-tag see</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, you can use the
-taglet option in place of its -tag option, but that may be
harder to read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tagletpath tagletpathlist <br>
Specifies the search paths for finding taglet class files
(.class). The tagletpathlist can contain multiple paths by
separating them with a colon (:). The Javadoc tool will <br>
search in all subdirectories of the specified paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-docfilessubdirs <br>
Enables deep copying of &quot;doc-files&quot; directories.
In other words, subdirectories and all contents are
recursively copied to the destination. For example, the
directory <br>
doc-files/example/images and all its contents would now be
copied. There is also an option to exclude
subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-excludedocfilessubdir
name1:name2... <br>
Excludes any &quot;doc-files&quot; subdirectories with the
given names. This prevents the copying of SCCS and other
source-code-control subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noqualifier all |
packagename1:packagename2:... <br>
Omits qualifying package name from ahead of class names in
output. The argument to -noqualifier is either
&quot;all&quot; (all package qualifiers are omitted) or a
colon-separate <br>
list of packages, with wildcards, to be removed as
qualifiers. The package name is removed from places where
class or interface names appear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example omits all
package qualifiers: <br>
-noqualifier all <br>
The following example omits &quot;java.lang&quot; and
&quot;java.io&quot; package qualifiers: <br>
-noqualifier java.lang:java.io <br>
The following example omits package qualifiers starting with
&quot;java&quot;, and &quot;com.sun&quot; subpackages (but
not &quot;javax&quot;): <br>
-noqualifier java.*:com.sun.* <br>
Where a package qualifier would appear due to the above
behavior, the name can be suitably shortened -- see How a
name is displayed. This rule is in effect whether or not
<br>
-noqualifier is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-notimestamp <br>
Suppresses the timestamp, which is hidden in an HTML comment
in the generated HTML near the top of each page. Useful when
you want to run javadoc on two source bases and <br>
diff them, as it prevents timestamps from causing a diff
(which would otherwise be a diff on every page). The
timestamp includes the javadoc version number, and currently
<br>
looks like this: <br>
&lt;!-- Generated by javadoc (build 1.5.0-internal) on Tue
Jun 22 09:57:24 PDT 2004 --&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nocomment <br>
Suppress the entire comment body, including the main
description and all tags, generating only declarations. This
option enables re-using source files originally intended
<br>
for a different purpose, to produce skeleton HTML
documentation at the early stages of a new project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE ARGUMENT FILES <br>
To shorten or simplify the javadoc command line, you can
specify one or more files that themselves contain arguments
to the javadoc command (except -J options). This enables you
<br>
to create javadoc commands of any length on any operating
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An argument file can include
javac options and source filenames in any combination. The
arguments within a file can be space-separated or
newline-separated. If a filename con&acirc; <br>
tains embedded spaces, put the whole filename in double
quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filenames within an argument
file are relative to the current directory, not the location
of the argument file. Wildcards (*) are not allowed in these
lists (such as for specify&acirc; <br>
ing *.java). Use of the &rsquo;@&rsquo; character to
recursively interpret files is not supported. The -J options
are not supported because they are passed to the launcher,
which does not <br>
support argument files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When executing javadoc, pass in
the path and name of each argument file with the
&rsquo;@&rsquo; leading character. When javadoc encounters
an argument beginning with the character &lsquo;@&rsquo;, it
<br>
expands the contents of that file into the argument
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example - Single Arg File <br>
You could use a single argument file named
&quot;argfile&quot; to hold all Javadoc arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% javadoc @argfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This argument file could contain
the contents of both files shown in the next example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example - Two Arg Files <br>
You can create two argument files -- one for the Javadoc
options and the other for the package names or source
filenames: (Notice the following lists have no
line-continuation <br>
characters.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create a file named
&quot;options&quot; containing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNNING JAVADOC <br>
Version Numbers - The version number of javadoc can be
determined using javadoc -J-version. The version number of
the standard doclet appears in its output stream. It can be
<br>
turned off with -quiet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Public programmatic interface -
To invoke the Javadoc tool from within programs written in
the Java language. This interface is in
com.sun.tools.javadoc.Main (and javadoc is <br>
re-entrant). For more details, see Standard Doclet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running Doclets - The
instructions given below are for invoking the standard HTML
doclet. To invoke a custom doclet, use the -doclet and
-docletpath options. For full, working <br>
examples of running a particular doclet, see Running the MIF
Doclet @ <br>

http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/mifdoclet/docs/mifdoclet.html#runningmifdoclet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIMPLE EXAMPLES <br>
You can run javadoc on entire packages or individual source
files. Each package name has a corresponding directory name.
In the following examples, the source files are located <br>
at /home/src/java/awt/*.java. The destination directory is
/home/html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documenting One or More Packages
<br>
To document a package, the source files (*.java) for that
package must be located in a directory having the same name
as the package. If a package name is made up of several <br>
identifiers (separated by dots, such as java.awt.color),
each subsequent identifier must correspond to a deeper
subdirectory (such as java/awt/color). You may split the
source <br>
files for a single package among two such directory trees
located at different places, as long as -sourcepath points
to them both -- for example src1/java/awt/color and <br>
src2/java/awt/color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can run javadoc either by
changing directories (with cd) or by using -sourcepath
option. The examples below illustrate both alternatives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Case 1 - Run recursively
starting from one or more packages - This example uses
-sourcepath so javadoc can be run from any directory and
-subpackages (a new 1.4 option) for <br>
recursion. It traverses the subpackages of the java
directory excluding packages rooted at java.net and
java.lang. Notice this excludes java.lang.ref, a subpackage
of <br>
java.lang). <br>
% javadoc -d /home/html -sourcepath /home/src -subpackages
java -exclude java.net:java.lang</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To also traverse down other
package trees, append their names to the -subpackages
argument, such as java:javax:org.xml.sax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Case 2 - Run on explicit
packages after changing to the &quot;root&quot; source
directory - Change to the parent directory of the
fully-qualified package. Then run javadoc, supplying <br>
names of one or more packages you want to document: <br>
% cd /home/src/ <br>
% javadoc -d /home/html java.awt java.awt.event</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Case 3 - Run from any
directory on explicit packages in a single directory tree -
In this case, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the current
directory is. Run javadoc supplying -sour&acirc; <br>
cepath with the parent directory of the top-level package,
and supplying names of one or more packages you want to
document: <br>
% javadoc -d /home/html -sourcepath /home/src java.awt
java.awt.event</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Case 4 - Run from any
directory on explicit packages in multiple directory trees -
This is the same as case 3, but for packages in separate
directory trees. Run javadoc sup&acirc; <br>
plying -sourcepath with the path to each tree&rsquo;s root
(colon-separated) and supply names of one or more packages
you want to document. All source files for a given package
do <br>
not need to be located under a single root directory -- they
just need to be found somewhere along the sourcepath. <br>
% javadoc -d /home/html -sourcepath /home/src1:/home/src2
java.awt java.awt.event</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Result: All cases generate
HTML-formatted documentation for the public and protected
classes and interfaces in packages java.awt and
java.awt.event and save the HTML files in the <br>
specified destination directory (/home/html). Because two or
more packages are being generated, the document has three
HTML frames -- for the list of packages, the list of <br>
classes, and the main class pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documenting One or More Classes
<br>
The second way to run the Javadoc tool is by passing in one
or more source files (.java). You can run javadoc either of
the following two ways -- by changing directories (with <br>
cd) or by fully-specifying the path to the .java files.
Relative paths are relative to the current directory. The
-sourcepath option is ignored when passing in source files.
You <br>
can use command line wildcards, such as asterisk (*), to
specify groups of classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Case 1 - Changing to the
source directory - Change to the directory holding the .java
files. Then run javadoc, supplying names of one or more
source files you want to docu&acirc; <br>
ment. <br>
% cd /home/src/java/awt <br>
% javadoc -d /home/html Button.java Canvas.java
Graphics*.java <br>
This example generates HTML-formatted documentation for the
classes Button, Canvas and classes beginning with Graphics.
Because source files rather than package names were <br>
passed in as arguments to javadoc, the document has two
frames -- for the list of classes and the main page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Case 2 - Changing to the
package root directory - This is useful for documenting
individual source files from different subpackages off the
same root. Change to the package <br>
root directory, and supply the source files with paths from
the root. <br>
% cd /home/src/ <br>
% javadoc -d /home/html java/awt/Button.java
java/applet/Applet.java <br>
This example generates HTML-formatted documentation for the
classes Button and Applet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Case 3 - From any directory -
In this case, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the current
directory is. Run javadoc supplying the absolute path (or
path relative to the current direc&acirc; <br>
tory) to the .java files you want to document. <br>
% javadoc -d /home/html /home/src/java/awt/Button.java
/home/src/java/awt/Graphics*.java <br>
This example generates HTML-formatted documentation for the
class Button and classes beginning with Graphics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documenting Both Packages and
Classes <br>
You can document entire packages and individual classes at
the same time. Here&rsquo;s an example that mixes two of the
previous examples. You can use -sourcepath for the path to
the <br>
packages but not for the path to the individual classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% javadoc -d /home/html
-sourcepath /home/src java.awt
/home/src/java/applet/Applet.java</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example generates
HTML-formatted documentation for the package java.awt and
class Applet. (The Javadoc tool determines the package name
for Applet from the package declara&acirc; <br>
tion, if any, in the Applet.java source file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REAL WORLD EXAMPLE <br>
The Javadoc tool has many useful options, some of which are
more commonly used than others. Here is effectively the
command we use to run the Javadoc tool on the Java platform
<br>
API. We use 180MB of memory to generate the documentation
for the 1500 (approx.) public and protected classes in the
Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition, v1.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same example is shown twice
-- first as executed on the command line, then as executed
from a makefile. It uses absolute paths in the option
arguments, which enables the same <br>
javadoc command to be run from any directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command Line Example <br>
This command line example is over 900 characters, which is
too long for some shells, such as DOS. You can use a command
line argument file (or write a shell script) to workaround
<br>
this limitation.</p>

numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Documents only legal classes -
When documenting a package, javadoc only reads files whose
names are composed of legal class names. You can prevent
javadoc from parsing a <br>
file by including, for example, a hyphen &quot;-&quot; in
its filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Errors and Warnings <br>
Error and warning messages contain the filename and line
number to the declaration line rather than to the particular
line in the doc comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o &quot;error: cannot read:
Class1.java&quot; the Javadoc tool is trying to load the
class Class1.java in the current directory. The class name
is shown with its path (absolute or rela&acirc; <br>
tive), which in this case is the same as ./Class1.java.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
CLASSPATH <br>
Environment variable that provides the path which javadoc
uses to find user class files. This environment variable is
overridden by the -classpath option. Separate directo&acirc;
<br>
ries with a colon, for example:</p>
