<p>PROOFSERV(1) General Commands Manual PROOFSERV(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
proofserv - PROOF (The Parallel ROOT Facility)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Using PROOF (The Parallel ROOT Facility) one can analyze
trees in parallel on a cluster of computers. The PROOF
system consists of the proofd(1) from-end program which is
started <br>
via inetd(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">proofd takes care of user
authentication and overlays itself then with the desired
version of the proofserv(1) executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The proofserv(1) is a basically
the same as the ROOT interactive module root(1), except that
it reads its commands from a socket instead of from the
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since it is a remote server it
will not do graphics and therefore is not linked with any
graphics libraries (Motif, X11, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">proofserv is started by the
daemon proofd(1) on request by the user. It is not a command
to be executed by the user directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, that if proofserv is
passed any arguments, it will use the libProofx interface,
rather than the standard libProof interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
