tex2lyx - translate well-behaved LaTeX into LyX
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
The simplest way to use <b>tex2lyx</b> is via the File-&gt;Import-&gt;LaTeX
  (plain) menu item in LyX. That runs <b>tex2lyx</b> on the given file and loads
  the resulting file into LyX. You should try that first, and call it from the
  command line only if you need to use more complicated options.

      (something like /usr/local/share/lyx/layouts/foo.layout OR

<b>tex2lyx</b> will create a LyX file with the specified name (or
  <i>dir/foo.lyx</i> if no name was given) from the LaTeX file
  <i>dir/foo.tex</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Suffixes .tex, .ltx and .latex are supported. If <i>inputfile</i> does not exist
  and does not have one of these suffixes, <b>tex2lyx</b> will try to translate
  <i>inputfile.tex</i>. (This is similar to the behavior of LaTeX.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The purpose of <b>tex2lyx</b> is to translate <i>well-behaved</i> LaTeX2e into
  LyX. If your LaTeX file doesn't compile---or if you do weird things, like
  redefining standard LaTeX commands---it may choke. LaTeX209 will often be
  translated correctly, but it's not guaranteed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>tex2lyx</b> lacks a few features. However, its main goals are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Get through a well-behaved LaTeX2e file without
    crashing</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Translate a lot of that file.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">Localize the parts that can't be translated and copy them

</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It achieves these main goals pretty well on most files.

<b>tex2lyx</b> will copy any preamble commands (i.e., anything before

  Files</a></h2>
<b>tex2lyx</b> reads a LyX layout file to know how to handle LaTeX environments
  and commands which get translated to LyX layouts. This file will include all
  &#x201C;normal&#x201D; non-math environments (i.e., including quote and
  itemize, but not tabular, minipage, and some other fancy environments), and
  commands like \section and \title. If you want to tex2lyx a class that doesn't
  have an existing layout file, then you'll have to create a layout file. But
  you have to do this anyway, in order to LyX the file, since LyX depends on
  layout files to know how to display and process its files. Check the LyX
  documentation for help with this task (which can be hard or easy, depending on
  the class you want to create a layout file for.) If your class is quite
  similar to a class that has a layout file, then consider using the <b>-c</b>
  option.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Syntax_Files"><a class="selflink" href="#Syntax_Files">Syntax
  Files</a></h2>
<b>tex2lyx</b> always reads at least one syntax file, called the default syntax
  file. <b>tex2lyx</b> will read your personal syntax file if it exists;
  otherwise it will read the system-wide file. <b>tex2lyx</b> will read
  additional syntax files if you specify them with the <b>-s</b> option. (These
  extra files should have the same format as the default file, but will tend to
  be shorter, since they only have to specify extra commands not found in the
  default file.) A syntax file tells <b>tex2lyx</b> a few things.
<div class="Pp"></div>
First, it describes the syntax of each command, that is, how many required
  arguments and how many optional arguments the command takes. Knowing this
  makes it easier for <b>tex2lyx</b> to copy (in TeX mode) commands that it
  doesn't know how to translate. The syntax file simply has a command, followed
  by braces or brackets describing its arguments in the correct order. For
  example, a syntax file entry \bibitem[]{} means that the \bibitem command
  takes an optional argument followed by a required one, while the entry \bf
  means that the \bf command takes no arguments at all. When <b>tex2lyx</b>
  encounters a token that it doesn't know how to translate into LyX, it will
  copy the token---along with the correct number of arguments---exactly. If the
  token is not in the syntax file, then <b>tex2lyx</b> just copies as many
  arguments as it finds. This means that it may copy too much. But since the
  user can specify additional syntax files, that shouldn't happen often.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some commands that cannot be translated to LyX, like \mbox, have as one of their
  arguments regular LaTeX text. If the string &#x201C;translate&#x201D; is put
  into an argument of an (untranslatable) command in the syntax file, then
  <b>tex2lyx</b> will translate that argument instead of copying it verbatim.
  So, for example, the default syntax file has \raisebox{}[][]{translate}. This
  means that the \raisebox command and the first argument (and optional
  arguments if they exist) are copied in TeX mode, but the last argument (which
  may contain math, complicated LaTeX, other untranslatable commands, etc.) will
  be translated into LyX. You can't use &#x201C;translate&#x201D; on optional
  arguments.
<div class="Pp"></div>
User-defined syntax files are allowed to define new commands and their syntax,
  or override the number of arguments for a command given in the default syntax
  file. (E.g., if you're using a style that gives an extra argument to some
  command...) However, this will only be useful for commands copied in TeX mode.
  Commands which are actually translated by <b>tex2lyx</b> (like \item) have
  their argument syntax hard-coded. The hard-coded commands are identified in
  the default syntax file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Second, the syntax file describes any &#x201C;regular environments&#x201D;.
  Usually, an entire unknown environment will be copied in TeX mode. If you
  define a regular environment &#x201C;foo&#x201D;, though, then only the
  \begin{foo} and \end{foo} commands will be copied in TeX mode; the text within
  the environment will be treated (i.e., translated) by <b>tex2lyx</b> as
  regular LaTeX, rather than being copied into TeX mode. Don't try to declare
  &#x201C;tabbing&#x201D; and &#x201C;picture&#x201D; as regular environments,
  as the text within those environments will confuse <b>tex2lyx</b>; use this
  capability for new environments you create that have plain text or math or
  simple commands in them. You also can't declare unknown math environments
  (like equation*) as regular environments, either, since the LyX math editor
  won't understand them. The names of regular environments appear,
  whitespace-separated, between \begin{tex2lyxre} and \end{tex2lyxre} statements
  in the syntax file. (If you have a regular environment which you won't use
  very often, you can use the <b>-r</b> option rather than writing a syntax
  file.)

Always keep a copy of your original LaTeX files either under a different name or
  in a different directory. There are a couple ways in which using LyX could
  lead to overwriting the original LaTeX file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you import foo.tex to create foo.lyx, then edit foo.lyx and want to re-export
  it, note that it will overwrite the original foo.tex. (LyX will ask you if you
  want to overwrite it.)

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>LYX_DIR_22x</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">can be used to specify which system directory to use.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The system directory is determined by searching for the file
  &quot;chkconfig.ltx&quot;. Directories are searched in this order:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
1) -sysdir command line parameter
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
2) LYX_DIR_22x environment variable
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
3) Maybe &lt;path of binary&gt;/TOP_SRCDIR/lib
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
4) &lt;path of binary&gt;/../share/&lt;name of binary&gt;/
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
5) hardcoded lyx_dir (at build time: /usr/share/lyx)
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>LYX_USERDIR_22x</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">can be used to specify which user directory to use.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The user directory is, in order of precedence:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
1) -userdir command line parameter
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
2) LYX_USERDIR_22x environment variable
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
3) $HOME/.&lt;name of binary&gt; if no explicit setting is made
