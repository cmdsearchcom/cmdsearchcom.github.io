<p>TEX2LYX(1) tex2lyx 2.2.2 TEX2LYX(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tex2lyx - translate well-behaved LaTeX into LyX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
The simplest way to use tex2lyx is via the
File-&gt;Import-&gt;LaTeX (plain) menu item in LyX. That
runs tex2lyx on the given file and loads the resulting file
into LyX. You should try <br>
that first, and call it from the command line only if you
need to use more complicated options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tex2lyx [ -userdir userdir ] [
-systemdir systemdir ] [ -f ] [ -n ] [ -c textclass ] [ -e
encoding ] [ -fixedenc encoding ] [ -m module1[,module2...]]
[ -s sfile1[,sfile2...]] [ <br>
-skipchildren ] [ -roundtrip ] [ -copyfiles ] inputfile [
outputfile ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c Class. By default, when tex2lyx sees a ocumentclass{foo}
command, it creates a file of textclass &acirc;foo&acirc;
and reads the LyX layout file for that class (something like
<br>
/usr/local/share/lyx/layouts/foo.layout OR
HOME/.lyx/layouts/foo.layout). Use -c to declare a different
textclass (and read a different layout file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is needed if the
input file is a LaTeX g i n { fragment, with no preamble
matter or dnt} command. LyX files o c u m created by tex2lyx
from partial files can be <br>
included in an existing LyX file using the &acirc;Include
LyX File&acirc; command from LyX&rsquo;s Insert menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Module. Load the given
modules. This is useful if tex2lyx does not automatically
detect a given module, but you know the modules that provide
some commands or environments <br>
that are used in the imported file. The modules are loaded
in the given order. If a module foo depends on a module bar,
bar must be given before foo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Force. tex2lyx will not run
if the .lyx file it would generate already exists. Use the
-f option (carefully) to clobber any existing files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Specify the default encoding
using the LaTeX name as defined in the encodings file.
tex2lyx will use this encoding, but switch if it finds any
encoding changing commands <br>
in the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fixedenc <br>
Specify the encoding using the LaTeX name as defined in the
encodings file. tex2lyx will ignore any encoding changing
commands in the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Noweb. Translate a noweb (aka
literate programming) file. This should be (almost?)
equivalent to running &acirc;noweb2lyx foo.tex
foo.lyx&acirc;. This option requires the -c option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-skipchildren <br>
Do not translate child documents included via include and
input. This option is useful if the child documents are
generated files and/or contain many commands that <br>
tex2lyx does not understand yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Syntax files. Input (one or
more quoted, comma-separated) syntax files to read in
addition to the default. (see the section on Syntax Files
for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sysdir <br>
Specify a system directory. Normally, you shouldn&rsquo;t
need this. Your LyX system directory is chosen. Cf. the
section FILES for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-userdir <br>
Specify a user directory. Normally, you shouldn&rsquo;t need
this. Your LyX user directory is chosen. Cf. the section
FILES for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-roundtrip <br>
Call LyX to re-export the created output file to LaTeX. If
the output file name is not given it is determined
automatically to avoid over-writing the input file by
acci&acirc; <br>
dent: If the input file is named foo.tex the output file
will be named foo.lyx.lyx, and the re-exported file will be
named foo.lyx.tex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-copyfiles <br>
Copy all included files tex2lyx is aware of to the output
directory if the output file is located in a different
directory than the input file. This is useful if you want
<br>
to ensure that no included file is overwritten (either in
roundtrip mode or by a later export from LyX). Please note
that the resulting document may be uncompilable. This <br>
happens if it needs files that tex2lyx does not know about
and therefore does not copy to the output directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help Help. Print out usage
information and quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Print out the version number and build information and
quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Introduction <br>
tex2lyx will create a LyX file with the specified name (or
dir/foo.lyx if no name was given) from the LaTeX file
dir/foo.tex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suffixes .tex, .ltx and .latex
are supported. If inputfile does not exist and does not have
one of these suffixes, tex2lyx will try to translate
inputfile.tex. (This is similar <br>
to the behavior of LaTeX.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The purpose of tex2lyx is to
translate well-behaved LaTeX2e into LyX. If your LaTeX file
doesn&rsquo;t compile---or if you do weird things, like
redefining standard LaTeX commands---it <br>
may choke. LaTeX209 will often be translated correctly, but
it&rsquo;s not guaranteed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tex2lyx lacks a few features.
However, its main goals are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Get through a
well-behaved LaTeX2e file without crashing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Translate a lot
of that file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Localize the
parts that can&rsquo;t be translated and copy them in TeX
mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It achieves these main goals
pretty well on most files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usage <br>
Here&rsquo;s a more lengthy description of what you should
do to translate a LaTeX document into LyX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Run tex2lyx.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tex2lyx will inform you of its
progress and give any warnings to stderr, so if you
don&rsquo;t want any output at all, try (in csh)
&lsquo;tex2lyx foo.tex &gt;&amp; /dev/null&rsquo;. You
should NOT <br>
redirect standard output to foo.lyx.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Run LyX (version
2.1 or later) on the resulting .lyx file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In theory, most of the file will
have been translated, and anything that&rsquo;s
untranslatable will be transferred to TeX code (ERT in
LyX-speak). In theory, LyX will be able to <br>
read in the file, and to create printed documents from it,
because all that untranslated ERT stuff will be passed
directly back to LaTeX, which LyX uses as a backend.
Unfor&acirc; <br>
tunately, reality doesn&rsquo;t always reflect theory. If
tex2lyx crashes, or LyX cannot read the generated LyX file,
see the BUGS section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Transform things
have been inserted as TeX code manually to LyX features, if
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As mentioned above, you should
be able to print out the LyX file even without doing this.
However, changing a command in TeX code to the corresponding
LyX object will allow <br>
you to take advantage of LyX&rsquo;s WYSIWYM editing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tex2lyx is not guaranteed to
create a LyX file which generates exactly the same output as
the LaTeX file, although its goal is to achieve this.
tex2lyx will generally err on <br>
the side of translating less to ensure that the resulting
output files are accurate, even though this leads to more
TeX code and less WYSIWYM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; PROOFREAD THE
DOCUMENT!!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I&rsquo;m sure you were planning
on doing this anyway, but it&rsquo;s particularly important
after translating a LaTeX document. tex2lyx is better at
&acirc;macro-translating&acirc; (translating the <br>
whole document) than &acirc;micro-translating&acirc;
(translating every little detail). For example, you may see
extra spaces or deleted spaces. Space handling has improved,
but it&rsquo;s not <br>
perfect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What tex2lyx Can Handle <br>
tex2lyx understands many LaTeX commands. It will
translate:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; regular text,
including mini-commands like ~, &lsquo;&rsquo;, @, TeX, as
well as accented characters like &acute;{a}, and the special
cases ?&lsquo; and !&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; title commands
like uthor, ate, itle, hanks and the abstract
environment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; heading commands
like tion including starred commands (tion*)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Environments:
quote, quotation, and verse; center, flushright, and
flushleft</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; itemize,
enumerate, and description environments, and their item
commands. Also, well-behaved nested lists ef, ageref,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
cross-referencing commands: el, and <br>
&Acirc;&middot; otnote and rgin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; font-changing
commands including \m, \mph, extit, and corresponding
commands to change family, size, series, and shape</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; input{foo} (or
input{foo.blah}) and include{foo}. Plain TeX input command
&acirc;input foo.tex&acirc; is also supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; tabular
environment, and commands that go inside it like ne, <br>
&Acirc;&middot; float environments table and table*, as well
as <br>
&Acirc;&middot; float environments figure and figure*, as
well as graphics inclusion commands \psf, \psffile, \psfbox,
\psfxsize, \psfig, sfig, and includegraphics. Both the
graph&acirc; <br>
ics and graphicx forms of includegraphics are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; thebibliography
environment and btem command, as wellb b as BibTeX&rsquo;s
lography and lographystyle commands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; miscellaneous
commands: ll, \, 0indent, ts...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
documentclass-specific environments (and some commands)
which can be translated to LyX layouts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; arguments to
certain untranslatable commands (e.g. ox)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of this support may not be
100% yet. See below for details</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tex2lyx copies math (almost)
verbatim from your LaTeX file. Luckily, LyX reads in LaTeX
math, so (almost) any math which is supported by LyX should
work just fine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tex2lyx will copy any preamble
commands (i.e., anything g i n { before dnt}) verbatim.
Fancy stuff you&rsquo;ve got in your preamble o c u m should
thus be conserved in printed documents, <br>
although it will not of course show up in the LyX window.
Check Document-&gt;Settings-&gt;LaTeX Preamble to see the
result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What tex2lyx Can&rsquo;t Handle
--- But it&rsquo;s OK <br>
&Acirc;&middot; some spacing commands (ace, agebreak and
ebreak)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; <br>
&Acirc;&middot; b and verbatim environment. tex2lyx is
careful to copy exactly in this case, including comments and
whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; unknown (e.g.,
user-defined) environments and commands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tex2lyx copies unknown commands,
along with their g i n { f arguments, verbatim into the LyX
file. Also, if it sees a ore it o } w h doesn&rsquo;t
recognize the &acirc;foo&acirc; environment, it will <br>
copy verbatim until it sees \nd{foo} (unless you use the -r
option). Most of these unknown commands won&rsquo;t cause
tex2lyx to break; they&rsquo;ll merely require you to do
some editing <br>
once you&rsquo;ve loaded the file up in LyX. That should be
less painful than editing either the .tex or the .lyx file
using a text editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What tex2lyx Handles Badly ---
aka BUGS <br>
Since tex2lyx is relatively new, it&rsquo;s got a number of
problems. As it matures, these bugs will be squished.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&acirc;Exact&acirc; copying of unknown environments and
commands isn&rsquo;t quite exact. This will yield ugly LyX,
but in almost all cases the output will be the same.
However, most parts <br>
of the file will be copied perfectly, including whitespace
and comments. This includes: the LaTeX preamble, verbatim
environments as well as b commands, and skip blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; tex2lyx
translates only a subset of the document class options to
native features. Other options are placed in the
&acirc;options&acirc; field in the Document-&gt;Settings
popup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More importantly, tex2lyx
doesn&rsquo;t translate 0wcommands, unknown sepackage
commands and other unknown code in the preamble. It simply
copies that into the LaTeX preamble. <br>
If you use special commands, e.g. to specify the text layout
in a way that that is not understood by LyX, tex2lyx
won&rsquo;t recognize it. Note that these settings will be
over&acirc; <br>
written if you modify the text layout in LyX&rsquo;s
document settings. Better remove these special options from
the LaTeX preamble (Document-&gt;Settings-&gt;LaTeX
Preamble) and use the <br>
corresponding LyX document settings, if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The foil
document class has a couple of bugs. tex2lyx may do weird
things with optional arguments to ilhead commands. g i n { d
i n g l Also, it may handle ictly s t } i n c o r r <br>
(although the stuff in the environment should translate
normally).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All known bugs of tex2lyx can be
found on http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tex2lyx is rather robust. As
mentioned above, it may not translate your file perfectly,
but the result should be usable and it shouldn&rsquo;t
crash. If you encounter problems---and <br>
the problem is not one of those mentioned above or on
http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome---please report
the issue as described in the section on Bug Reports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What LyX Can&rsquo;t Handle <br>
LyX itself is missing a couple of features, such that even
if tex2lyx translates things perfectly, LyX may still have
trouble reading it. If you really need these features, you
<br>
can export your final document as LaTeX, and put them back
in. See BUGS for more details on these bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; For a number of
commands (such as \), LyX does not support the optional
argument. tex2lyx will automatically discard the optional
arguments with a warning to stdout. LyX <br>
also ignores the width argument for the thebibliography
environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; LyX support for
tables isn&rsquo;t perfect. For complicated tables, use a
&acirc;skip&acirc; block, so that they will be copied in TeX
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; LyX allows
figures to have sizes in the units known to TeX, such as in,
cm, etc. It also translates percentages of extwidth,
extheight, (e.g. if you wanted to scale a figure to size
opmargin for some reason). tex2lyx will copy figures with
untranslatable sizes in TeX mode. Again, you might be able
to fix <br>
that within LyX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
tex2lyx -f -r &acirc;myenv&acirc; foo.tex</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above will create a file
foo.lyx from foo.tex, g i n overwriting if necessary. When
it finds a {nv} ... \nd{myenv} m y block, it will translate
the stuff within the block, g i n a n d \ n d c <br>
but copy the oX mode. m m a n d s i n T</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tex2lyx -n -c
&acirc;literate-article&acirc; foo.tex</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above will change a noweb
document into a LyX literate-article document. A user would
do this if the noweb document had documentclass article.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Bug Reports <br>
Bugs should be reported to the LyX bug tracker at
http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome. Additionally,
you can post a message to the LyX developers&rsquo; mailing
list. Its <br>
address is currently lyx-devel@lists.lyx.org. If your
message bounces, you can check the LyX home page,
http://www.lyx.org/. If you are running tex2lyx on a huge
file, please do <br>
not send all of the output in your bug report. Just include
the last ten or twenty lines of output, along with the piece
of the LaTeX file it crashed on. Or, even better, attach
<br>
a small but complete file which causes the same problem as
your original file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Layout Files <br>
tex2lyx reads a LyX layout file to know how to handle LaTeX
environments and commands which get translated to LyX
layouts. This file will include all &acirc;normal&acirc;
non-math environ&acirc; <br>
ments (i.e., including quote and itemize, but not tabular,
minipage, and some other fancy environments), and commands
like tion and itle. If you want to tex2lyx a class <br>
that doesn&rsquo;t have an existing layout file, then
you&rsquo;ll have to create a layout file. But you have to
do this anyway, in order to LyX the file, since LyX depends
on layout files <br>
to know how to display and process its files. Check the LyX
documentation for help with this task (which can be hard or
easy, depending on the class you want to create a layout
<br>
file for.) If your class is quite similar to a class that
has a layout file, then consider using the -c option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Syntax Files <br>
tex2lyx always reads at least one syntax file, called the
default syntax file. tex2lyx will read your personal syntax
file if it exists; otherwise it will read the system-wide
<br>
file. tex2lyx will read additional syntax files if you
specify them with the -s option. (These extra files should
have the same format as the default file, but will tend to
be <br>
shorter, since they only have to specify extra commands not
found in the default file.) A syntax file tells tex2lyx a
few things.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, it describes the syntax
of each command, that is, how many required arguments and
how many optional arguments the command takes. Knowing this
makes it easier for tex2lyx <br>
to copy (in TeX mode) commands that it doesn&rsquo;t know
how to translate. The syntax file simply has a command,
followed by braces or brackets describing its arguments in
the correct <br>
order. For example, a syntax file entry btem[]{} means that
the btem command takes an optional argument followed by a m
e a n s t required one, while the entry h a t t h e <br>
command takes no arguments at all. When tex2lyx encounters a
token that it doesn&rsquo;t know how to translate into LyX,
it will copy the token---along with the correct number of
<br>
arguments---exactly. If the token is not in the syntax file,
then tex2lyx just copies as many arguments as it finds. This
means that it may copy too much. But since the user <br>
can specify additional syntax files, that shouldn&rsquo;t
happen often.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some commands that cannot be
translated to LyX, like ox, have as one of their arguments
regular LaTeX text. If the string &acirc;translate&acirc; is
put into an argument of an (untrans&acirc; <br>
latable) command in the syntax file, then tex2lyx will
translate that argument instead of copying it verbatim. So,
foraisebox{}[][]{trans&acirc; example, the default syntax
file hasaisebox command and the first <br>
late}. This means that the argument (and optional arguments
if they exist) are copied in TeX mode, but the last argument
(which may contain math, <br>
complicated LaTeX, other untranslatable commands, etc.) will
be translated into LyX. You can&rsquo;t use
&acirc;translate&acirc; on optional arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User-defined syntax files are
allowed to define new commands and their syntax, or override
the number of arguments for a command given in the default
syntax file. (E.g., if <br>
you&rsquo;re using a style that gives an extra argument to
some command...) However, this will only be useful for
commands copied in TeX mode. Commands which are actually
translated by <br>
tex2lyx (like item) have their argument syntax hard-coded.
The hard-coded commands are identified in the default syntax
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Second, the syntax file
describes any &acirc;regular environments&acirc;. Usually,
an entire unknown environment will be copied in TeX mode. If
you define a regular environment &acirc;foo&acirc;, g i n {
f o o } a n d \ n d { f <br>
though, then only the o copied in TeX mode; the text o } c o
m m a n d s w i l l b within the environment will be treated
(i.e., translated) by tex2lyx as regular <br>
LaTeX, rather than being copied into TeX mode. Don&rsquo;t
try to declare &acirc;tabbing&acirc; and
&acirc;picture&acirc; as regular environments, as the text
within those environments will confuse tex2lyx; <br>
use this capability for new environments you create that
have plain text or math or simple commands in them. You also
can&rsquo;t declare unknown math environments (like
equation*) as <br>
regular environments, either, since the LyX math editor
won&rsquo;t understand them. The names of regular
environments g i appear, whitespace-separated, between
nx2lyxre} and { t <br>
\nd{tex2lyxre} statements in the syntax file. (If you have a
regular environment which you won&rsquo;t use very often,
you can use the -r option rather than writing a syntax
file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNINGS <br>
Always keep a copy of your original LaTeX files either under
a different name or in a different directory. There are a
couple ways in which using LyX could lead to overwriting
<br>
the original LaTeX file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you import foo.tex to create
foo.lyx, then edit foo.lyx and want to re-export it, note
that it will overwrite the original foo.tex. (LyX will ask
you if you want to overwrite <br>
it.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
LYX_DIR_22x <br>
can be used to specify which system directory to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The system directory is
determined by searching for the file
&quot;chkconfig.ltx&quot;. Directories are searched in this
order: <br>
1) -sysdir command line parameter <br>
2) LYX_DIR_22x environment variable <br>
3) Maybe &lt;path of binary&gt;/TOP_SRCDIR/lib <br>
4) &lt;path of binary&gt;/../share/&lt;name of binary&gt;/
<br>
5) hardcoded lyx_dir (at build time: /usr/share/lyx)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LYX_USERDIR_22x <br>
can be used to specify which user directory to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user directory is, in order
of precedence: <br>
1) -userdir command line parameter <br>
2) LYX_USERDIR_22x environment variable <br>
3) $HOME/.&lt;name of binary&gt; if no explicit setting is
made</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
If LIBDIR is the system-wide LyX directory and MY_LYXDIR is
your personal LyX directory, then the following files are
read by tex2lyx:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MY_LYXDIR/layouts/*.layout <br>
User&rsquo;s personal layout files for document classes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MY_LYXDIR/syntax.default <br>
User&rsquo;s personal syntax file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MY_LYXDIR/encodings <br>
User&rsquo;s personal encoding definition file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIBDIR/layouts/*.layout <br>
System-wide layout files for document classes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIBDIR/lib/syntax.default <br>
System-wide LaTeX syntax file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIBDIR/lib/encodings <br>
