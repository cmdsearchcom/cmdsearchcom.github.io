<p>CVS-INJECT(1) Debian GNU/Linux manual CVS-INJECT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cvs-inject - inject a debian source package into a CVS
repository</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cvs-inject [options] &lt;package&gt;.dsc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page explains the Debian cvs-inject utility,
which is used to inject or import Debian source packages
into a CVS repository. It handles Debian-only packages
(which do <br>
not have diff files) as well as normal packages from
upstream sources converted to Debian use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The upstream sources are
imported to the vendor branch and tagged
upstream_version_&lt;upstream version&gt; with all dots
translated to under scores. The debianized sources, if
differ&acirc; <br>
ent, are put on the main branch, and tagged
debian_version_&lt;upstream version&gt;-&lt;debian
revision&gt; with all dots translated to under scores.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sole argument is a debian
source .dsc file, which is parsed to get the package name
and version. cvs-inject reads the same config file
/etc/cvsdeb.conf as the the other <br>
cvs-* utilities do. People may use of the dry-run option to
inspect the steps this utility takes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Combined with the companion
utilities cvs-buildpackage and cvs-upgrade, this provides an
infrastructure to facilitate the use of CVS by Debian
maintainers. This allows one to <br>
keep separate CVS branches of a package for stable,
unstable, and possibly experimental distributions, along
with the other benefits of a version control system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility can be used to
generate a unified CVS source tree, for example, with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find
/var/spool/mirror/debian/hamm/hamm/source -type f -name dsc
| while read i; <br>
do <br>
j=$(dirname $i | sed -e s:source/:: -e
s:/var/spool/mirror/debian/:: ) <br>
cvs-inject -x$j $i <br>
done</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Which happily gobbled up the
sources and created a CVS repository on my machine until the
partition filled up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
Please note that the current behaviour of cvs-inject is to
ignore files that match the default list of file name
patterns to be ignored (this is built into cvs); and that
any <br>
.cvsignore files in the upstream sources shall be honoured.
This should be fine as long as upstream sources do not
include files that match cvs ignore patterns and yet should
be <br>
in the sources. The current list of ignored file name
patterns is: <br>
RCS SCCS CVS CVS.adm RCSLOG cvslog.* tags TAGS .make.state
.nse_depinfo *~ #* .#* ,* _$* *$ *.old *.bak *.BAK *.orig
*.rej .del-* *.a *.olb *.o *.obj *.so *.exe *.Z *.elc <br>
*.ln core</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish to modify this
behaviour, there are ways to do this (you should see CVS
documentation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o) The per-repository list in
&lsquo;$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvsignore&rsquo; is appended to the
list, if that file exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o) The per-user list in
&lsquo;.cvsignore&rsquo; in your home directory is appended
to the list, if it exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o) Any entries in the
environment variable $CVSIGNORE is appended to the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In any of the places listed
above, a single exclamation mark (&lsquo;!&rsquo;) clears
the ignore list. This can be used if you want to store any
file which normally is ignored by CVS. <br>
Also, any .cvsignore file found in the source directory is
also honoured. If you wish to specify your own list on the
command line, you may use the environment variable
CVS&acirc; <br>
DEB_IMPORTSUBSTMODE (for example,
CVSDEB_IMPORTSUBSTMODE=&quot;! -I blah -ko -d ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Print out a usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m If present, this option
directs this program to include the latest debian changelog,
if any, into the commit message. This overrides the
environment variable <br>
CVSDEB_USE_CHANGELOG</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M&lt;module&gt; The name of the
CVS module. This argument overrides the settings in the
environment variable CVSDEB_MODULE. There is no
corresponding config file variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F There are two things CVS may
choke on symbolic links and CVS directories in the source
tree. Also, there are times when one may not want to honour
the <br>
upstream .cvsignore files. Without this option, the
cvs-inject program shall exit with an error message. This
option causes cvs-inject to ask whether you want <br>
to delete the offending files. If you answer y, it removes
them and continues; else it shall exit with an error
message. This argument overrides the settings <br>
in the environment variable CVSDEB_FORCECLEAN, which in turn
overrides the setting in the configuration file,
conf_forceclean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T&lt;tag&gt; The CVS tag to use
for exporting sources, rather than constructing one from the
version. This assumes you know what you are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U&lt;tag&gt; The CVS tag to use
for the upstream tag, rather than constructing one from the
upstream version. This assumes you know what you are
doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x&lt;prefix&gt; The name of the
default CVS prefix (that is, this is appended to CVSROOT
when looking for the repository). This argument overrides
the settings in the envi&acirc; <br>
ronment variable CVSDEB_PREFIX, which in turn overrides the
setting in the configuration file, conf_prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R&lt;root directory&gt; Root of
the original sources archive. If the cvs-buildpackage work
directory is set anywhere, (command line, configuration
file, environment variable), the <br>
root directory value is ignored, since we only need the root
directory to set defaults for the work directory. This
argument overrides the settings in the <br>
environment variable CVSDEB_ROOTDIR, and the configuration
file variable conf_rootdir. Please note that the
cvs-buildpackage work directory referred to here <br>
is the scratch directory where this program works, not the
directory that the human uses to work in. This should
probably not be a sub dir of CVSROOT, since <br>
cvs shall refuse to export packages there, and the script
shall fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W&lt;work directory&gt; The
full path name for the cvs-buildpackage working directory.
Setting this variable overrides the settings for the root
directory. This argument also over&acirc; <br>
rides the settings in the environment variable
CVSDEB_WORKDIR, and in the configuration file variable
conf_workdir.. Please note that the cvs-buildpackage <br>
work directory referred to here is the scratch directory
where this program works, not the directory that the human
uses to work in, and needs to be the full <br>
(absolute) path name. This should probably not be a sub dir
of CVSROOT, since cvs shall refuse to export packages there,
and the script shall fail. The <br>
default is /usr/local/src/Packages/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d&lt;number&gt; Turn on
debugging output. This lists the version numbers, the
cvs-buildpackage work and root directories, as well as the
CVS tag used to export the sources. <br>
This over-rides the DEBUG variable in the configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ctp Include package_ at the
start of the CVS tag. This overrides the CVSDEB_PACKAGEINTAG
environment variable and the conf_forcetag configuration
file option. <br>
The default is not to include the prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n The no exec (or dry-run)
option, causing cvs-inject to print out all actions that
would be taken without actually executing them..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Make the utility more
verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVSDEB_IMPORTSUBSTMODE <br>
You are also allowed to specify an environment variable,
CVSDEB_IMPORTSUBSTMODE, that overrides the default
substitution option of -ko. This is useful when <br>
you want to import a package that has a bunch of binary
files in the source tree (like emacs or rscheme).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Apart from the runtime options, cvs-inject also looks for
site-wide defaults in the file /etc/cvsdeb.conf. After that,
it looks for and reads ~/.cvsdeb.conf The default
configu&acirc; <br>
ration allows there to be a site wide override for the root
or the cvs-buildpackage working directories on the site, but
the cvsdeb.conf files are actually Bourne shell snippets,
<br>
and any legal shell directives may be included in there.
Note: Caution is urged with this file, since you can totally
change the way that the script behaves by suitable editing
<br>
this file.</p>
