<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
devdump, isoinfo, isovfy, isodump - Utility programs for
dumping and verifying iso9660 images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
devdump isoimage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">isodump isoimage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">isoinfo [ -d ] [ -h ] [ -R ] [
-J ] [ -j charset ] [ -f ] [ -l ] [ -p ] [ -T sector ] [ -N
sector ] [ -i isoimage ] [ -x path ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">isovfy isoimage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
devdump is a crude utility to interactively display the
contents of device or filesystem images. The initial screen
is a display of the first 256 bytes of the first 2048 byte
<br>
sector. The commands are the same as with isodump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">isodump is a crude utility to
interactively display the contents of iso9660 images in
order to verify directory integrity. The initial screen is a
display of the first part of <br>
the root directory, and the prompt shows you the extent
number and offset in the extent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the &rsquo;a&rsquo;
and &rsquo;b&rsquo; commands to move backwards and forwards
within the image. The &rsquo;g&rsquo; command allows you to
goto an arbitrary extent, and the &rsquo;f&rsquo; command
specifies <br>
a search string to be used. The &rsquo;+&rsquo; command
searches forward for the next instance of the search string,
and the &rsquo;q&rsquo; command exits devdump or
isodump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">isoinfo is a utility to perform
directory like listings of iso9660 images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">isovfy is a utility to verify
the integrity of an iso9660 image. Most of the tests in
isovfy were added after bugs were discovered in early
versions of genisoimage. It isn&rsquo;t all <br>
that clear how useful this is anymore, but it doesn&rsquo;t
hurt to have this around.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The options common to all programs are -help,-h,-version,
i=name,dev=name. The isoinfo program has additional command
line options. The options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h print a summary of all
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Print information from the
primary volume descriptor (PVD) of the iso9660 image. This
includes information about Rock Ridge, Joliet extensions and
Eltorito boot informa&acirc; <br>
tion if present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f generate output as if a
&rsquo;find . -print&rsquo; command had been run on the
iso9660 image. You should not use the -l image with the -f
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i iso_image <br>
Specifies the path of the iso9660 image that we wish to
examine. The options -i and dev=target are mutual
exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dev=target <br>
Sets the SCSI target for the drive, see notes above. A
typical device specification is dev=6,0 . If a filename must
be provided together with the numerical target speci&acirc;
<br>
fication, the filename is implementation specific. The
correct filename in this case can be found in the system
specific manuals of the target operating system. On a <br>
FreeBSD system without CAM support, you need to use the
control device (e.g. /dev/rcd0.ctl). A correct device
specification in this case may be dev=/dev/rcd0.ctl:@ .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Linux, drives connected to a
parallel port adapter are mapped to a virtual SCSI bus.
Different adapters are mapped to different targets on this
virtual SCSI bus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no dev option is present, the
program will try to get the device from the CDR_DEVICE
environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the argument to the dev=
option does not contain the characters &rsquo;,&rsquo;,
&rsquo;/&rsquo;, &rsquo;@&rsquo; or &rsquo;:&rsquo;, it is
interpreted as an label name that may be found in the file
/etc/wodim.conf <br>
(see FILES section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options -i and dev=target
are mutual exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l generate output as if a
&rsquo;ls -lR&rsquo; command had been run on the iso9660
image. You should not use the -f image with the -l
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N sector <br>
Quick hack to help examine single session disc files that
are to be written to a multi-session disc. The sector number
specified is the sector number at which the iso9660 <br>
image should be written when send to the cd-writer. Not used
for the first session on the disc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Print path table
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Extract information from Rock
Ridge extensions (if present) for permissions, file names
and ownerships.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J Extract information from
Joliet extensions (if present) for file names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j charset <br>
Convert Joliet file names (if present) to the supplied
charset. See genisoimage(8) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T sector <br>
Quick hack to help examine multi-session images that have
already been burned to a multi-session disc. The sector
number specified is the sector number for the start of <br>
the session we wish to display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x pathname <br>
Extract specified file to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
The author of the original sources (1993 ... 1998) is Eric
Youngdale &lt;ericy@gnu.ai.mit.edu&gt; or
&lt;eric@andante.jic.com&gt; is to blame for these shoddy
hacks. Joerg Schilling wrote <br>
the SCSI transport library and its adaptation layer to the
programs and newer parts (starting from 1999) of the
utilities, this makes them Copyright (C) 1999-2004 Joerg

Schilling. Patches to improve general usability would be
gladly accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manpage describes the
program implementation of isoinfo as shipped by the cdrkit
distribution. See http://alioth.debian.org/projects/debburn/
for details. It is a spinoff <br>
from the original program distributed in the cdrtools
package [1]. However, the cdrtools developers are not
involved in the development of this spinoff and therefore
shall not be <br>
made responsible for any problem caused by it. Do not try to
get support for this program by contacting the original
author(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have support questions,
send them to</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">debburn-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have definitely found a
bug, send a mail to this list or to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">submit@bugs.debian.org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">writing at least a short
description into the Subject and &quot;Package: cdrkit&quot;
into the first line of the mail body.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The user interface really sucks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS <br>
These utilities are really quick hacks, which are very
useful for debugging problems in genisoimage or in an
iso9660 filesystem. In the long run, it would be nice to
have a dae&acirc; <br>
mon that would NFS export a iso9660 image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The isoinfo program is probably
the program that is of the most use to the general user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVAILABILITY <br>
These utilities come with the cdrkit package, and the
primary download site is http://debburn.alioth.debian.org/
and FTP mirrors of distributions. Despite the name, the
software <br>
is not beta.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
CDR_DEVICE <br>
This may either hold a device identifier that is suitable to
the open call of the SCSI transport library or a label in
the file /etc/wodim.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RSH If the RSH environment is
present, the remote connection will not be created via
rcmd(3) but by calling the program pointed to by RSH. Use
e.g. RSH=/usr/bin/ssh to cre&acirc; <br>
ate a secure shell connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this forces the
program to create a pipe to the rsh(1) program and disallows
the program to directly access the network socket to the
remote server. This makes <br>
it impossible to set up performance parameters and slows
down the connection compared to a root initiated rcmd(3)
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RSCSI If the RSCSI environment
is present, the remote SCSI server will not be the program
/opt/schily/sbin/rscsi but the program pointed to by RSCSI.
Note that the remote SCSI <br>
server program name will be ignored if you log in using an
account that has been created with a remote SCSI server
program as login shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/wodim.conf <br>
Default values can be set for the following options in
/etc/wodim.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CDR_DEVICE <br>
This may either hold a device identifier that is suitable to
the open call of the SCSI transport library or a label in
the file /etc/wodim.conf that allows to iden&acirc; <br>
tify a specific drive on the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other label <br>
is an identifier for a specific drive on the system. Such an
identifier may not contain the characters &rsquo;,&rsquo;,
&rsquo;/&rsquo;, &rsquo;@&rsquo; or &rsquo;:&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each line that follows a label
contains a TAB separated list of items. Currently, four
items are recognized: the SCSI ID of the drive, the default
speed that <br>
should be used for this drive, the default FIFO size that
should be used for this drive and drive specific options.
The values for speed and fifosize may be set to <br>
-1 to tell the program to use the global defaults. The value
for driveropts may be set to &quot;&quot; if no driveropts
are used. A typical line may look this way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">teac1= 0,5,0 4 8m
&quot;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yamaha= 1,6,0 -1 -1 burnfree</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tells the program that a
drive named teac1 is at scsibus 0, target 5, lun 0 and
should be used with speed 4 and a FIFO size of 8 MB. A
second drive may be <br>
found at scsibus 1, target 6, lun 0 and uses the default
speed and the default FIFO size.</p>
