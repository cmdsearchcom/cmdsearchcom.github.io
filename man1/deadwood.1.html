<p>DEADWOOD(1) Deadwood reference DEADWOOD(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
deadwood - A fully recursive caching DNS resolver</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Deadwood is a fully recursive DNS cache. This is a DNS
server with the following features:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Full support for both DNS
recursion and DNS forwarding caching</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Small size and memory
footprint suitable for embedded systems</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Simple and clean codebase</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Secure design</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Spoof protection: Strong
cryptography used to determine the Query ID and source
port</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Ability to read and write the
cache to a file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Dynamic cache that deletes
entries not recently used</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Ability to use expired entries
in the cache when it is impossible to contact upstream DNS
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* IPv6 support can be compiled
in if desired</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Both DNS-over-UDP and
DNS-over-TCP are handled by the same daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Built-in dnswall
functionality</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS <br>
Deadwood has a single optional command line argument: The
location of the configuration file that Deadwood uses,
specified with the &quot;-f&quot; flag. If this is not
defined, Deadwood <br>
uses the file &quot;/etc/maradns/deadwood/dwood3rc&quot; as
the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In other words, invoking
Deadwood as deadwood will cause Deadwood to use
/etc/maradns/deadwood/dwood3rc as the configuration file;
invoking Deadwood as deadwood -f foobar will <br>
cause Deadwood to use the file &quot;foobar&quot; in the
current working directory (the directory one is in when
starting Deadwood) as the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT <br>
The Deadwood configuration file is modeled after Python
2&rsquo;s syntax. Any valid Deadwood configuration file
should also correctly parse in both Python 2.4.3 and Python
2.6.6. If <br>
any configuration file does correctly parse in Deadwood but
raises a syntax error in Python, this is a bug that should
be fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This in mind, whitespace is
significant; Deadwood parameters must be in the leftmost
column with no leading whitespace. This is a valid line (as
long as there are no spaces to <br>
its left):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recursive_acl =
&quot;127.0.0.1/16&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following line, however,
will raise a parse error:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recursive_acl =
&quot;127.0.0.1/16&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Observe the space to the left of
the &quot;recusive_acl&quot; string in the incorrectly
formatted line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETER TYPES <br>
Deadwood has three different parameter types:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Numeric parameters. Numeric
parameters must not be surrounded by quotes, such as this
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filter_rfc1918 = 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a numeric parameter is
surrounded by quotes, the error message &quot;Unknown
dwood3rc string parameter&quot; will appear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* String parameters. String
parameters must be surrounded by quotes, such as in this
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind_address =
&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Dictionary parameters. All
dictionary parameters must be initialized before use, and
dictionary parameters must have both the dictionary index
and the value for said index <br>
surrounded by quotes, such as in this example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upstream_servers = {} <br>
upstream_servers[&quot;.&quot;]=&quot;8.8.8.8,
8.8.4.4&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All dwood3rc parameters except
the following are numeric parameters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* bind_address (string)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* cache_file (string)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* chroot_dir (string)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* ip_blacklist (string)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* ipv4_bind_addresses
(string)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* random_seed_file (string)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* recursive_acl (string)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* root_servers (dictionary)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* upstream_servers
(dictionary)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED PARAMETERS <br>
The Deadwood configuration file supports the following
parameters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind_address</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the IP (or possibly
IPv6) address we bind to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cache_file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the filename of the file
used for reading and writing the cache to disk; this string
can have lowercase letters, the &rsquo;-&rsquo; symbol, the
&rsquo;_&rsquo; symbol, and the &rsquo;/&rsquo; symbol (for
<br>
putting the cache in a subdirectory). All other symbols
become a &rsquo;_&rsquo; symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This file is read and written as
the user Deadwood runs as.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chroot_dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the directory the
program will run from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deliver_all</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This affects behavior in
Deadwood 2.3, but has no effect in Deadwood 3. This variable
is only here so Deadwood 2 rc files can run in Deadwood
3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dns_port</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the port Deadwood binds
to and listens on for incoming connections. The default
value for this is the standard DNS port: port 53</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filter_rfc1918</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this has a value of 1, a
number of different IP ranges are not allowed to be in DNS A
replies:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* 192.168.x.x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* 172.[16-31].x.x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* 10.x.x.x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* 127.x.x.x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* 169.254.x.x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* 224.x.x.x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* 0.0.x.x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one of the above IPs is
detected in a DNS reply, and filter_rfc1918 has a value of
1, Deadwood will return a synthetic &quot;this host does not
reply&quot; response (a SOA record in the <br>
NS section) instead of the A record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reason for this is to
provide a &quot;dnswall&quot; that protects users for some
kinds of attacks, as described at
http://crypto.stanford.edu/dns/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that Deadwood only
provides IPv4 &quot;dnswall&quot; functionality and does not
help protect against IPv6 answers. If protection against
certain IPv6 AAAA records is needed, <br>
either disable all AAAA answers by setting reject_aaaa to
have a value of 1, or use an external program to filter
undesired IPv4 answers (such as the dnswall program).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value for this is
1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">handle_noreply</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this is set to 0, Deadwood
sends no reply back to the client (when the client is a TCP
client, Deadwood closes the TCP connection) when a UDP query
is sent upstream and the <br>
upstream DNS never sends a reply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this is set to 1, Deadwood
sends a SERVER FAIL back to the client when a UDP query is
sent upstream and the upstream DNS never sends a reply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value for this is
1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">handle_overload</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this has a value of 0,
Deadwood sends no reply when a UDP query is sent and the
server is overloaded (has too many pending connections);
when it has a value of 1, Deadwood <br>
sends a SERVER FAIL packet back to the sender of the UDP
query. The default value for this is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hash_magic_number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This used to be used for
Deadwood&rsquo;s internal hash generator to keep the hash
generator somewhat random and immune to certain types of
attacks. In Deadwood 3.0, entropy for the <br>
hash function is created by looking at the contents of
/dev/urandom (secret.txt on Windows machines) and the
current timestamp. This parameter is only here so older
configuration <br>
files do not break in Deadwood 3.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip_blacklist</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a list of IPs that we do
not allow to be in the answer to a DNS request. The reason
for this is to counteract the practice some ISPs have of
converting a &quot;this site does <br>
not exist&quot; DNS answer in to a page controlled by the
ISP; this results in possible security issues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This parameter only accepts
individual IPs, and does not use netmasks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maradns_uid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user-id Deadwood runs as.
This can be any number between 10 and 65535; the default
value is 99 (nobody on RedHat-derived Linux distributions).
This value is not used on <br>
Windows systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maradns_gid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The group-id Deadwood runs as.
This can be any number between 10 and 65535; the default
value is 99. This value is not used on Windows systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max_ar_chain</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whether resource record rotation
is enabled. If this has a value of 1, resource record
rotation is enabled, otherwise resource record rotation is
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resource record rotation is
usually desirable, since it allows DNS to act like a crude
load balancer. However, on heavily loaded systems it may be
desirable to disable it to <br>
reduce CPU usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reason for the unusual name
for this variable is to retain compatibility with MaraDNS
mararc files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value is 1: Resource
record rotation enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max_inflights</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The maximum number of
simultaneous clients we process at the same time for the
same query.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If, while processing a query
for, say, &quot;example.com.&quot;, another DNS client sends
to Deadwood another query for example.com, instead of
creating a new query to process example.com, <br>
Deadwood will attach the new client to the same query that
is already &quot;in flight&quot;, and send a reply to both
clients once we have an answer for example.com.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the number of
simultaneous clients a given query can have. If this limit
is exceeded, subsequents clients with the same query are
refused until an answer is found. If <br>
this has a value of 1, we do not merge multiple requests for
the same query, but give each request its own
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value is 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max_ttl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The maximum amount of time we
will keep an entry in the cache, in seconds (also called
&quot;Maximum TTL&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the longest we will keep
an entry cached. The default value for this parameter is
86400 (one day); the minimum value is 300 (5 minutes) and
the maximum value this can <br>
have is 7776000 (90 days).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reason why this parameter is
here is to protect Deadwood from attacks which exploit there
being stale data in the cache, such as the &quot;Ghost
Domain Names&quot; attack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maximum_cache_elements</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The maximum number of elements
our cache is allowed to have. This is a number between 32
and 16,777,216; the default value for this is 1024. Note
that, if writing the cache to <br>
disk or reading the cache from disk, higher values of this
will slow down cache reading/writing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The amount of memory each cache
entry uses is variable depending on the operating system
used and the size of memory allocation pages assigned. In
Windows XP, for example, each <br>
entry uses approximately four kilobytes of memory and
Deadwood has an overhead of approximately 512 kilobytes. So,
if there are 512 cache elements, Deadwood uses approximately
<br>
2.5 megabytes of memory, and if there are 1024 cache
elements, Deadwood uses approximately 4.5 megabytes of
memory. Again, these numbers are for Windows XP and other
operating <br>
systems will have different memory allocation numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that each
root_servers and upstream_servers entry takes up space in
Deadwood&rsquo;s cache and that maximum_cache_elements will
need to be increased to store a large number <br>
of these entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxprocs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the maximum number of
pending remote UDP connections Deadwood can have. The
default value for this is 1024.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max_tcp_procs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the number of allowed
open TCP connections. Default value: 8</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">num_retries</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of times we retry to
send a query upstream before giving up. If this is 0, we
only try once; if this is 1, we try twice, and so on, up to
32 retries. Note that each <br>
retry takes timeout_seconds seconds before we retry again.
Default value: 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ns_glueless_type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The RR type we send to resolve
glueless records. This should be 1 (A) when mainly using
IPv4 to resolve records. If glueless NS records have AAAA
but not A records, and IPv6 is <br>
enabled, it may make sense to give this a value of 255
(ANY). If IPv4 ever stops being used on a large scale, it
may eventually become possible to make this have a value of
28 <br>
(AAAA).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value is 1: An A
(IPv4 IP) record. This parameter has not been tested; use at
your own risk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">random_seed_file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a file that contains
random numbers, and is used as a seed for the
cryptographically strong random number generator. Deadwood
will try to read 256 bytes from this file <br>
(the RNG Deadwood uses can accept a stream of any arbitrary
length).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the hash compression
function obtains some of its entropy before parsing the
mararc file, and is hard-coded to get entropy from
/dev/urandom (secret.txt on Windows <br>
systems). Most other entropy used by Deadwood comes from the
file pointed to by random_seed_file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recurse_min_bind_port</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The lowest numbered port
Deadwood is allowed to bind to; this is a random port number
used for the source port of outgoing queries, and is not 53
(see dns_port above). This is a <br>
number between 1025 and 32767, and has a default value of
15000. This is used to make DNS spoofing attacks more
difficult.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recurse_number_ports</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of ports Deadwood
binds to for the source port for outgoing connections; this
is a power of 2 between 256 and 32768. This is used to make
DNS spoofing attacks more <br>
difficult. The default value is 4096.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recursive_acl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a list of who is allowed
to use Deadwood to perform DNS recursion, in
&quot;ip/mask&quot; format. Mask must be a number between 0
and 32 (for IPv6, between 0 and 128). For example, <br>
&quot;127.0.0.1/8&quot; allows local connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reject_aaaa</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this has a value of 1, a
bogus SOA &quot;not there&quot; reply is sent whenever an
AAAA query is sent to Deadwood. In other words, every time a
program asks Deadwood for an IPv6 IP <br>
address, instead of trying to process the request, when this
is set to 1, Deadwood pretends the host name in question
does not have an IPv6 address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is useful for people who
aren&rsquo;t using IPv6 but use applications (usually *NIX
command like applications like &quot;telnet&quot;) which
slow things down trying to find an IPv6 address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This has a default value of 0.
In other words, AAAA queries are processed normally unless
this is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reject_mx</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this has the default value
of 1, MX queries are silently dropped with their IP logged.
A MX query is a query that is only done by a machine if it
wishes to be its own mail <br>
server sending mail to machines on the internet. This is a
query an average desktop machine (including one that uses
Outlook or another mail user agent to read and send email)
<br>
will never make.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most likely, if a machine is
trying to make a MX query, the machine is being controlled
by a remote source to send out undesired &quot;spam&quot;
email. This in mind, Deadwood will not <br>
allow MX queries to be made unless reject_mx is explicitly
set with a value of 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before disabling this, please
keep in mind that Deadwood is optimized to be used for web
surfing, not as a DNS server for a mail hub. In particular,
the IPs for MX records are <br>
removed from Deadwood&rsquo;s replies and Deadwood needs to
perform additional DNS queries to get the IPs corresponding
to MX records, and Deadwood&rsquo;s testing is more geared
for web <br>
surfing (almost 100% A record lookup) and not for mail
delivery (extensive MX record lookup).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reject_ptr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this has a value of 1, a
bogus SOA &quot;not there&quot; reply is sent whenever a PTR
query is sent to Deadwood. In other words, every time a
program asks Deadwood for &quot;reverse DNS <br>
lookup&quot; -- the hostname for a given IP address --
instead of trying to process the request, when this is set
to 1, Deadwood pretends the IP address in question does not
have a <br>
hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is useful for people who
are getting slow DNS timeouts when trying to perform a
reverse DNS lookups on IPs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This has a default value of 0.
In other words, PTR queries are processed normally unless
this is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resurrections</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this is set to 1, Deadwood
will try to send an expired record to the user before giving
up. If it is 0, we don&rsquo;t. Default value: 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">root_servers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a list of root servers;
its syntax is identical to upstream_servers (see below).
This is the type of DNS service ICANN, for example, runs.
These are servers used that do <br>
not give us complete answers to DNS questions, but merely
tell us which DNS servers to connect to to get an answer
closer to our desired answer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that each
root_servers entry takes up space in Deadwood&rsquo;s cache
and that maximum_cache_elements will need to be increased to
store a large number of these entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_listen</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to enable DNS-over-TCP,
this variable must be set and have a value of 1. Default
value: 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeout_seconds</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is how long Deadwood will
wait before giving up and discarding a pending UDP DNS
reply. The default value for this is 1, as in 1 second,
unless Deadwood was compiled with <br>
FALLBACK_TIME enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeout_seconds_tcp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How long to wait on an idle TCP
connection before dropping it. The default value for this is
4, as in 4 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ttl_age</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whether TTL aging is enabled;
whether entries in the cache have their TTLs set to be the
amount of time the entries have left in the cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this has a value of 1, TTL
entries are aged. Otherwise, they are not. The default value
for this is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upstream_port</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the port Deadwood uses
to connect or send packets to the upstream servers. The
default value for this is 53; the standard DNS port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upstream_servers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a list of DNS servers
that the load balancer will try to contact. This is a
dictionary variable (array indexed by a string instead of by
a number) instead of a simple <br>
variable. Since upstream_servers is a dictionary variable,
it needs to be initialized before being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deadwood will look at the name
of the host that it is trying to find the upstream server
for, and will match against the longest suffix it can
find.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if someone sends a
query for &quot;www.foo.example.com&quot; to Deadwood,
Deadwood will first see if there is an upstream_servers
variable for &quot;www.foo.example.com.&quot;, then <br>
look for &quot;foo.example.com.&quot;, then look for
&quot;example.com.&quot;, then &quot;com.&quot;, and finally
&quot;.&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an example of
upstream_servers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upstream_servers = {} #
Initialize dictionary variable <br>
upstream_servers[&quot;foo.example.com.&quot;] =
&quot;192.168.42.1&quot; <br>
upstream_servers[&quot;example.com.&quot;] =
&quot;192.168.99.254&quot; <br>
upstream_servers[&quot;.&quot;] = &quot;10.1.2.3,
10.1.2.4&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, anything ending
in &quot;foo.example.com&quot; is resolved by the DNS server
at 192.168.42.1; anything else ending in
&quot;example.com&quot; is resolved by 192.168.99.254; and
<br>
anything not ending in &quot;example.com&quot; is resolved
by either 10.1.2.3 or 10.1.2.4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Important: the domain name
upstream_servers points to must end in a &quot;.&quot;
character. This is OK:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">upstream_servers[&quot;example.com.&quot;]
= &quot;192.168.42.1&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But this is not OK:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">upstream_servers[&quot;example.com&quot;]
= &quot;192.168.42.1&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reason for this is because
BIND engages in unexpected behavior when a host name
doesn&rsquo;t end in a dot, and by forcing a dot at the end
of a hostname, Deadwood doesn&rsquo;t have to <br>
guess whether the user wants BIND&rsquo;s behavior or the
&quot;normal&quot; behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither root_servers nor
upstream_servers are set, Deadwood sets root_servers to use
the default ICANN root servers, as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">198.41.0.4 a.root-servers.net

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This list is current as of
February 9, 2015, and was last changed on January 3,
2013.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that each
upstream_servers entry takes up space in Deadwood&rsquo;s
cache and that maximum_cache_elements will need to be
increased to store a large number of these <br>
entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbose_level</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This determines how many
messages are logged on standard output; larger values log
more messages. The default value for this is 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip/mask format of IPs <br>
Deadwood uses a standard ip/netmask formats to specify IPs.
An ip is in dotted-decimal format, e.g. &quot;10.1.2.3&quot;
(or in IPv6 format when IPv6 support is compiled in).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The netmask is used to specify a
range of IPs. The netmask is a single number between 1 and
32 (128 when IPv6 support is compiled in), which indicates
the number of leading &quot;1&quot; <br>
bits in the netmask.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10.1.1.1/24 indicates that any
ip from 10.1.1.0 to 10.1.1.255 will match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10.2.3.4/16 indicates that any
ip from 10.2.0.0 to 10.2.255.255 will match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">127.0.0.0/8 indicates that any
ip with &quot;127&quot; as the first octet (number) will
match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The netmask is optional, and, if
not present, indicates that only a single IP will match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DNS over TCP <br>
DNS-over-TCP needs to be explicitly enabled by setting
tcp_listen to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deadwood extracts useful
information from UDP DNS packets marked truncated which
almost always removes the need to have DNS-over-TCP.
However, Deadwood does not cache DNS packets <br>
larger than 512 bytes in size that need to be sent using
TCP. In addition, DNS-over-TCP packets which are
&quot;incomplete&quot; DNS replies (replies which a stub
resolver can not use, <br>
which can be either a NS referral or an incomplete CNAME
reply) are not handled correctly by Deadwood.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deadwood has support for both
DNS-over-UDP and DNS-over-TCP; the same daemon listens on
both the UDP and TCP DNS port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only UDP DNS queries are cached.
Deadwood does not support caching over TCP; it handles TCP
to resolve the rare truncated reply without any useful
information or to work with <br>
very uncommon non-RFC-compliant TCP-only DNS resolvers. In
the real world, DNS-over-TCP is almost never used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parsing other files <br>
It is possible to have Deadwood, while parsing the dwood3rc
file, read other files and parse them as if they were
dwood3rc files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is done using execfile. To
use execfile, place a line like this in the dwood3rc
file:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">execfile(&quot;path/to/filename&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where path/to/filename is the
path to the file to be parsed like a dwood3rc file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All files must be in or under
the directory /etc/maradns/deadwood/execfile. Filenames can
only have lower-case letters and the underscore character
(&quot;_&quot;). Absolute paths are not <br>
allowed as the argument to execfile; the filename can not
start with a slash (&quot;/&quot;) character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is a parse error in the
file pointed to by execfile, Deadwood will report the error
as being on the line with the execfile command in the main
dwood3rc file. To find <br>
where a parse error is in the sub-file, use something like
&quot;Deadwood -f
/etc/maradns/deadwood/execfile/filename&quot; to find the
parse error in the offending file, where
&quot;filename&quot; <br>
is the file to to parsed via execfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPV6 support <br>
This server can also be optionally compiled to have IPv6
support. In order to enable IPv6 support, add
&rsquo;-DIPV6&rsquo; to the compile-time flags. For example,
to compile this to make a <br>
small binary, and to have IPv6 support:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export FLAGS=&rsquo;-Os
-DIPV6&rsquo; <br>
make</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
Deadwood is a program written with security in mind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to use a
buffer-overflow resistant string library and a coding style
and SQA process that checks for buffer overflows and memory
leaks, Deadwood uses a strong <br>
pseudo-random number generator (The 32-bit version of
RadioGatun) to generate both the query ID and source port.
For the random number generator to be secure, Deadwood needs
a <br>
good source of entropy; by default Deadwood will use
/dev/urandom to get this entropy. If you are on a system
without /dev/urandom support, it is important to make sure
that <br>
Deadwood has a good source of entropy so that the query ID
and source port are hard to guess (otherwise it is possible
to forge DNS packets).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Windows port of Deadwood
includes a program called &quot;mkSecretTxt.exe&quot; that
creates a 64-byte (512 bit) random file called
&quot;secret.txt&quot; that can be used by Deadwood (via the
<br>
&quot;random_seed_file&quot; parameter); Deadwood also gets
entropy from the timestamp when Deadwood is started and
Deadwood&rsquo;s process ID number, so it is same to use the
same static <br>
secret.txt file as the random_seed_file for multiple
invocations of Deadwood.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that Deadwood is not
protected from someone on the same network viewing packets
sent by Deadwood and sending forged packets as a reply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To protect Deadwood from certain
possible denial-of-service attacks, it is best if
Deadwood&rsquo;s prime number used for hashing elements in
the cache is a random 31-bit prime number. <br>
The program RandomPrime.c generates a random prime that is
placed in the file DwRandPrime.h that is regenerated
whenever either the program is compiled or things are
cleaned up <br>
with make clean. This program uses /dev/urandom for its
entropy; the file DwRandPrime.h will not be regenerated on
systems without /dev/urandom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems without direct
/dev/urandom support, it is suggested to see if there is a
possible way to give the system a working /dev/urandom. This
way, when Deadwood is compiled, <br>
the hash magic number will be suitably random.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If using a precompiled binary of
Deadwood, please ensure that the system has /dev/urandom
support (on Windows system, please ensure that the file with
the name secret.txt is <br>
generated by the included mkSecretTxt.exe program);
Deadwood, at runtime, uses /dev/urandom (secret.txt in
Windows) as a hardcoded path to get entropy (along with the
timestamp) <br>
for the hash algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DAEMONIZATION <br>
Deadwood does not have any built-in daemonization
facilities; this is handled by the external program Duende
or any other daemonizer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example configuration file <br>
Here is an example dwood3rc configuration file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># This is an example deadwood rc

Deadwood <br>
# to resolve names on an internal network, uncomment the
<br>
# following line: <br>
#filter_rfc1918 = 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Deadwood does not follow RFC2181&rsquo;s advice to ignore
DNS responses with the TC (truncated) bit set, but instead
extracts the first RR. If this is not desired, set the
undocumented <br>
parameter truncation_hack to 0 (but read the DNS over TCP
section of this man page).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deadwood can not process DNS
resource record types with numbers between 65392 and 65407.
These RR types are marked by the IANA for &quot;private
use&quot;; Deadwood reserves these record <br>
types for internal use. This is only 16 record types out of
the 65536 possible DNS record types (only 71 have actually
been assigned by IANA, so this is a non-issue in the real
<br>
world).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not clear whether the DNS
RFCs allow ASCII control characters in DNS names. Even if
they were, Deadwood does not allow ASCII control characters
(bytes with a value less <br>
then 32) in DNS names. Other characters (UTF-8, etc.) are
allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Combining a CNAME record with
other records is prohibited in RFC1034 section 3.6.2 and
RFC1912 section 2.4; it makes an answer ambiguous. Deadwood
handles this ambiguity <br>
differently than some other DNS servers.</p>
