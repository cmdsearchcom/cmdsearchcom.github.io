<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS"><a class="selflink" href="#COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS">COMMAND
  LINE ARGUMENTS</a></h1>
Deadwood has a single optional command line argument: The location of the
  configuration file that Deadwood uses, specified with the &quot;-f&quot; flag.
  If this is not defined, Deadwood uses the file
  &quot;/etc/maradns/deadwood/dwood3rc&quot; as the configuration file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In other words, invoking Deadwood as <b>deadwood</b> will cause Deadwood to use
  /etc/maradns/deadwood/dwood3rc as the configuration file; invoking Deadwood as
  <b>deadwood -f foobar</b> will cause Deadwood to use the file
  &quot;foobar&quot; in the current working directory (the directory one is in
  when starting Deadwood) as the configuration file.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_FILE_FORMAT"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION_FILE_FORMAT">CONFIGURATION
  FILE FORMAT</a></h1>
The Deadwood configuration file is modeled after Python 2's syntax. Any valid
  Deadwood configuration file should also correctly parse in both Python 2.4.3
  and Python 2.6.6. If any configuration file does correctly parse in Deadwood
  but raises a syntax error in Python, this is a bug that should be fixed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This in mind, whitespace is significant; Deadwood parameters must be in the
  leftmost column with no leading whitespace. This is a valid line (as long as
  there are no spaces to its left):
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
recursive_acl = &quot;127.0.0.1/16&quot;
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The following line, however, will raise a parse error:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
 recursive_acl = &quot;127.0.0.1/16&quot;
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Observe the space to the left of the &quot;recusive_acl&quot; string in the
  incorrectly formatted line.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PARAMETER_TYPES"><a class="selflink" href="#PARAMETER_TYPES">PARAMETER
  TYPES</a></h1>
Deadwood has three different parameter types:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">*</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Numeric parameters. Numeric parameters must not be
      surrounded by quotes, such as this example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
filter_rfc1918 = 0
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If a numeric parameter is surrounded by quotes, the error message
      &quot;Unknown dwood3rc string parameter&quot; will appear.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">*</dt>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SUPPORTED_PARAMETERS"><a class="selflink" href="#SUPPORTED_PARAMETERS">SUPPORTED
  PARAMETERS</a></h1>
The Deadwood configuration file supports the following parameters:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>bind_address</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is the IP (or possibly IPv6) address we bind to.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>cache_file</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is the filename of the file used for reading and writing the cache to disk;
  this string can have lowercase letters, the '-' symbol, the '_' symbol, and
  the '/' symbol (for putting the cache in a subdirectory). All other symbols
  become a '_' symbol.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This file is read and written as the user Deadwood runs as.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>chroot_dir</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is the directory the program will run from.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>deliver_all</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This affects behavior in Deadwood 2.3, but has no effect in Deadwood 3. This
  variable is only here so Deadwood 2 rc files can run in Deadwood 3.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>dns_port</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is the port Deadwood binds to and listens on for incoming connections. The
  default value for this is the standard DNS port: port 53
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>filter_rfc1918</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When this has a value of 1, a number of different IP ranges are not allowed to
  be in DNS A replies:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">*</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">192.168.x.x</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">*</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">172.[16-31].x.x</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">*</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">10.x.x.x</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">*</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">127.x.x.x</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">*</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">169.254.x.x</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">*</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">224.x.x.x</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">*</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">0.0.x.x</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If one of the above IPs is detected in a DNS reply, and filter_rfc1918 has a
  value of 1, Deadwood will return a synthetic &quot;this host does not
  reply&quot; response (a SOA record in the NS section) instead of the A record.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The reason for this is to provide a &quot;dnswall&quot; that protects users for
  some kinds of attacks, as described at http://crypto.stanford.edu/dns/
<div class="Pp"></div>
Please note that Deadwood only provides IPv4 &quot;dnswall&quot; functionality
  and does not help protect against IPv6 answers. If protection against certain
  IPv6 AAAA records is needed, either disable all AAAA answers by setting
  reject_aaaa to have a value of 1, or use an external program to filter
  undesired IPv4 answers (such as the dnswall program).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default value for this is 1
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>handle_noreply</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When this is set to 0, Deadwood sends no reply back to the client (when the
  client is a TCP client, Deadwood closes the TCP connection) when a UDP query
  is sent upstream and the upstream DNS never sends a reply.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When this is set to 1, Deadwood sends a SERVER FAIL back to the client when a
  UDP query is sent upstream and the upstream DNS never sends a reply.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default value for this is 1
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>handle_overload</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When this has a value of 0, Deadwood sends no reply when a UDP query is sent and
  the server is overloaded (has too many pending connections); when it has a
  value of 1, Deadwood sends a SERVER FAIL packet back to the sender of the UDP
  query. The default value for this is 1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>hash_magic_number</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This used to be used for Deadwood's internal hash generator to keep the hash
  generator somewhat random and immune to certain types of attacks. In Deadwood
  3.0, entropy for the hash function is created by looking at the contents of
  /dev/urandom (secret.txt on Windows machines) and the current timestamp. This
  parameter is only here so older configuration files do not break in Deadwood
  3.0.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>ip_blacklist</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is a list of IPs that we do not allow to be in the answer to a DNS request.
  The reason for this is to counteract the practice some ISPs have of converting
  a &quot;this site does not exist&quot; DNS answer in to a page controlled by
  the ISP; this results in possible security issues.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This parameter only accepts individual IPs, and does not use netmasks.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>maradns_uid</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The user-id Deadwood runs as. This can be any number between 10 and 65535; the
  default value is 99 (nobody on RedHat-derived Linux distributions). This value
  is not used on Windows systems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>maradns_gid</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The group-id Deadwood runs as. This can be any number between 10 and 65535; the
  default value is 99. This value is not used on Windows systems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>max_ar_chain</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Whether resource record rotation is enabled. If this has a value of 1, resource
  record rotation is enabled, otherwise resource record rotation is disabled.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Resource record rotation is usually desirable, since it allows DNS to act like a
  crude load balancer. However, on heavily loaded systems it may be desirable to
  disable it to reduce CPU usage.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The reason for the unusual name for this variable is to retain compatibility
  with MaraDNS mararc files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default value is 1: Resource record rotation enabled.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>max_inflights</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The maximum number of simultaneous clients we process at the same time for the
  same query.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If, while processing a query for, say, &quot;example.com.&quot;, another DNS
  client sends to Deadwood another query for example.com, instead of creating a
  new query to process example.com, Deadwood will attach the new client to the
  same query that is already &quot;in flight&quot;, and send a reply to both
  clients once we have an answer for example.com.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is the number of simultaneous clients a given query can have. If this limit
  is exceeded, subsequents clients with the same query are refused until an
  answer is found. If this has a value of 1, we do not merge multiple requests
  for the same query, but give each request its own connection.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default value is 8.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>max_ttl</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The maximum amount of time we will keep an entry in the cache, in seconds (also
  called &quot;Maximum TTL&quot;).
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is the longest we will keep an entry cached. The default value for this
  parameter is 86400 (one day); the minimum value is 300 (5 minutes) and the
  maximum value this can have is 7776000 (90 days).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The reason why this parameter is here is to protect Deadwood from attacks which
  exploit there being stale data in the cache, such as the &quot;Ghost Domain
  Names&quot; attack.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>maximum_cache_elements</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The maximum number of elements our cache is allowed to have. This is a number
  between 32 and 16,777,216; the default value for this is 1024. Note that, if
  writing the cache to disk or reading the cache from disk, higher values of
  this will slow down cache reading/writing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The amount of memory each cache entry uses is variable depending on the
  operating system used and the size of memory allocation pages assigned. In
  Windows XP, for example, each entry uses approximately four kilobytes of
  memory and Deadwood has an overhead of approximately 512 kilobytes. So, if
  there are 512 cache elements, Deadwood uses approximately 2.5 megabytes of
  memory, and if there are 1024 cache elements, Deadwood uses approximately 4.5
  megabytes of memory. Again, these numbers are for Windows XP and other
  operating systems will have different memory allocation numbers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Please note that each root_servers and upstream_servers entry takes up space in
  Deadwood's cache and that maximum_cache_elements will need to be increased to
  store a large number of these entries.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>maxprocs</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is the maximum number of pending remote UDP connections Deadwood can have.
  The default value for this is 1024.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>max_tcp_procs</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is the number of allowed open TCP connections. Default value: 8
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>num_retries</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The number of times we retry to send a query upstream before giving up. If this
  is 0, we only try once; if this is 1, we try twice, and so on, up to 32
  retries. Note that each retry takes timeout_seconds seconds before we retry
  again. Default value: 5
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>ns_glueless_type</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The RR type we send to resolve glueless records. This should be 1 (A) when
  mainly using IPv4 to resolve records. If glueless NS records have AAAA but not
  A records, and IPv6 is enabled, it may make sense to give this a value of 255
  (ANY). If IPv4 ever stops being used on a large scale, it may eventually
  become possible to make this have a value of 28 (AAAA).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default value is 1: An A (IPv4 IP) record. This parameter has <b>not</b>
  been tested; use at your own risk.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>random_seed_file</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is a file that contains random numbers, and is used as a seed for the
  cryptographically strong random number generator. Deadwood will try to read
  256 bytes from this file (the RNG Deadwood uses can accept a stream of any
  arbitrary length).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the hash compression function obtains some of its entropy before
  parsing the mararc file, and is hard-coded to get entropy from /dev/urandom
  (secret.txt on Windows systems). Most other entropy used by Deadwood comes
  from the file pointed to by random_seed_file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>recurse_min_bind_port</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The lowest numbered port Deadwood is allowed to bind to; this is a random port
  number used for the source port of outgoing queries, and is not 53 (see
  dns_port above). This is a number between 1025 and 32767, and has a default
  value of 15000. This is used to make DNS spoofing attacks more difficult.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>recurse_number_ports</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The number of ports Deadwood binds to for the source port for outgoing
  connections; this is a power of 2 between 256 and 32768. This is used to make
  DNS spoofing attacks more difficult. The default value is 4096.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>recursive_acl</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is a list of who is allowed to use Deadwood to perform DNS recursion, in
  &quot;ip/mask&quot; format. Mask must be a number between 0 and 32 (for IPv6,
  between 0 and 128). For example, &quot;127.0.0.1/8&quot; allows local
  connections.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>reject_aaaa</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If this has a value of 1, a bogus SOA &quot;not there&quot; reply is sent
  whenever an AAAA query is sent to Deadwood. In other words, every time a
  program asks Deadwood for an IPv6 IP address, instead of trying to process the
  request, when this is set to 1, Deadwood pretends the host name in question
  does not have an IPv6 address.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is useful for people who aren't using IPv6 but use applications (usually
  *NIX command like applications like &quot;telnet&quot;) which slow things down
  trying to find an IPv6 address.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This has a default value of 0. In other words, AAAA queries are processed
  normally unless this is set.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>reject_mx</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When this has the default value of 1, MX queries are silently dropped with their
  IP logged. A MX query is a query that is only done by a machine if it wishes
  to be its own mail server sending mail to machines on the internet. This is a
  query an average desktop machine (including one that uses Outlook or another
  mail user agent to read and send email) will never make.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most likely, if a machine is trying to make a MX query, the machine is being
  controlled by a remote source to send out undesired &quot;spam&quot; email.
  This in mind, Deadwood will not allow MX queries to be made unless reject_mx
  is explicitly set with a value of 0.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before disabling this, please keep in mind that Deadwood is optimized to be used
  for web surfing, not as a DNS server for a mail hub. In particular, the IPs
  for MX records are removed from Deadwood's replies and Deadwood needs to
  perform additional DNS queries to get the IPs corresponding to MX records, and
  Deadwood's testing is more geared for web surfing (almost 100% A record
  lookup) and not for mail delivery (extensive MX record lookup).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>reject_ptr</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If this has a value of 1, a bogus SOA &quot;not there&quot; reply is sent
  whenever a PTR query is sent to Deadwood. In other words, every time a program
  asks Deadwood for &quot;reverse DNS lookup&quot; -- the hostname for a given
  IP address -- instead of trying to process the request, when this is set to 1,
  Deadwood pretends the IP address in question does not have a hostname.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is useful for people who are getting slow DNS timeouts when trying to
  perform a reverse DNS lookups on IPs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This has a default value of 0. In other words, PTR queries are processed
  normally unless this is set.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>resurrections</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If this is set to 1, Deadwood will try to send an expired record to the user
  before giving up. If it is 0, we don't. Default value: 1
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>root_servers</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is a list of root servers; its syntax is identical to upstream_servers (see
  below). This is the type of DNS service ICANN, for example, runs. These are
  servers used that do not give us complete answers to DNS questions, but merely
  tell us which DNS servers to connect to to get an answer closer to our desired
  answer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Please note that each root_servers entry takes up space in Deadwood's cache and
  that maximum_cache_elements will need to be increased to store a large number
  of these entries.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>tcp_listen</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to enable DNS-over-TCP, this variable must be set and have a value of
  1. Default value: 0
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>timeout_seconds</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is how long Deadwood will wait before giving up and discarding a pending
  UDP DNS reply. The default value for this is 1, as in 1 second, unless
  Deadwood was compiled with FALLBACK_TIME enabled.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>timeout_seconds_tcp</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
How long to wait on an idle TCP connection before dropping it. The default value
  for this is 4, as in 4 seconds.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>ttl_age</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Whether TTL aging is enabled; whether entries in the cache have their TTLs set
  to be the amount of time the entries have left in the cache.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If this has a value of 1, TTL entries are aged. Otherwise, they are not. The
  default value for this is 1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>upstream_port</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is the port Deadwood uses to connect or send packets to the upstream
  servers. The default value for this is 53; the standard DNS port.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>upstream_servers</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is a list of DNS servers that the load balancer will try to contact. This
  is a <i>dictionary variable</i> (array indexed by a string instead of by a
  number) instead of a simple variable. Since upstream_servers is a dictionary
  variable, it needs to be initialized before being used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Deadwood will look at the name of the host that it is trying to find the
  upstream server for, and will match against the longest suffix it can find.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, if someone sends a query for &quot;www.foo.example.com&quot; to
  Deadwood, Deadwood will first see if there is an upstream_servers variable for
  &quot;www.foo.example.com.&quot;, then look for &quot;foo.example.com.&quot;,
  then look for &quot;example.com.&quot;, then &quot;com.&quot;, and finally
  &quot;.&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here is an example of upstream_servers:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
upstream_servers = {} # Initialize dictionary variable
upstream_servers[&quot;foo.example.com.&quot;] = &quot;192.168.42.1&quot;
upstream_servers[&quot;example.com.&quot;] = &quot;192.168.99.254&quot;

</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In this example, anything ending in &quot;foo.example.com&quot; is resolved by
  the DNS server at 192.168.42.1; anything else ending in
  &quot;example.com&quot; is resolved by 192.168.99.254; and anything not ending
  in &quot;example.com&quot; is resolved by either 10.1.2.3 or 10.1.2.4.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Important:</b> the domain name upstream_servers points to must end in a
  &quot;.&quot; character. This is OK:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
upstream_servers[&quot;example.com.&quot;] = &quot;192.168.42.1&quot;
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
But this is <b>not</b> OK:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
upstream_servers[&quot;example.com&quot;] = &quot;192.168.42.1&quot;
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The reason for this is because BIND engages in unexpected behavior when a host
  name doesn't end in a dot, and by forcing a dot at the end of a hostname,
  Deadwood doesn't have to guess whether the user wants BIND's behavior or the
  &quot;normal&quot; behavior.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If neither root_servers nor upstream_servers are set, Deadwood sets root_servers
  to use the default ICANN root servers, as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
198.41.0.4      a.root-servers.net (VeriSign) 
192.228.79.201  b.root-servers.net (ISI)

  2013.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Please note that each upstream_servers entry takes up space in Deadwood's cache
  and that maximum_cache_elements will need to be increased to store a large
  number of these entries.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<b>verbose_level</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This determines how many messages are logged on standard output; larger values
  log more messages. The default value for this is 3.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ip/mask_format_of_IPs"><a class="selflink" href="#ip/mask_format_of_IPs">ip/mask
  format of IPs</a></h1>
Deadwood uses a standard ip/netmask formats to specify IPs. An ip is in
  dotted-decimal format, e.g. &quot;10.1.2.3&quot; (or in IPv6 format when IPv6
  support is compiled in).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The netmask is used to specify a range of IPs. The netmask is a single number
  between 1 and 32 (128 when IPv6 support is compiled in), which indicates the
  number of leading &quot;1&quot; bits in the netmask.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>10.1.1.1/24</b> indicates that any ip from 10.1.1.0 to 10.1.1.255 will match.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>10.2.3.4/16</b> indicates that any ip from 10.2.0.0 to 10.2.255.255 will
  match.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>127.0.0.0/8</b> indicates that any ip with &quot;127&quot; as the first octet
  (number) will match.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The netmask is optional, and, if not present, indicates that only a single IP
  will match.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DNS_over_TCP"><a class="selflink" href="#DNS_over_TCP">DNS
  over TCP</a></h1>
DNS-over-TCP needs to be explicitly enabled by setting tcp_listen to 1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Deadwood extracts useful information from UDP DNS packets marked truncated which
  almost always removes the need to have DNS-over-TCP. However, Deadwood does
  not cache DNS packets larger than 512 bytes in size that need to be sent using
  TCP. In addition, DNS-over-TCP packets which are &quot;incomplete&quot; DNS
  replies (replies which a stub resolver can not use, which can be either a NS
  referral or an incomplete CNAME reply) are not handled correctly by Deadwood.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Deadwood has support for both DNS-over-UDP and DNS-over-TCP; the same daemon
  listens on both the UDP and TCP DNS port.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Only UDP DNS queries are cached. Deadwood does not support caching over TCP; it
  handles TCP to resolve the rare truncated reply without any useful information
  or to work with very uncommon non-RFC-compliant TCP-only DNS resolvers. In the
  real world, DNS-over-TCP is almost never used.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Parsing_other_files"><a class="selflink" href="#Parsing_other_files">Parsing
  other files</a></h1>
It is possible to have Deadwood, while parsing the dwood3rc file, read other
  files and parse them as if they were dwood3rc files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is done using <b>execfile</b>. To use execfile, place a line like this in
  the dwood3rc file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
execfile(&quot;path/to/filename&quot;)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Where path/to/filename is the path to the file to be parsed like a dwood3rc
  file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All files must be in or under the directory /etc/maradns/deadwood/execfile.
  Filenames can only have lower-case letters and the underscore character
  (&quot;_&quot;). Absolute paths are not allowed as the argument to execfile;
  the filename can not start with a slash (&quot;/&quot;) character.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If there is a parse error in the file pointed to by execfile, Deadwood will
  report the error as being on the line with the execfile command in the main
  dwood3rc file. To find where a parse error is in the sub-file, use something
  like &quot;Deadwood -f /etc/maradns/deadwood/execfile/filename&quot; to find
  the parse error in the offending file, where &quot;filename&quot; is the file
  to to parsed via execfile.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="IPV6_support"><a class="selflink" href="#IPV6_support">IPV6
  support</a></h1>
This server can also be optionally compiled to have IPv6 support. In order to
  enable IPv6 support, add '-DIPV6' to the compile-time flags. For example, to
  compile this to make a small binary, and to have IPv6 support:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
	export FLAGS='-Os -DIPV6'
	make
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SECURITY"><a class="selflink" href="#SECURITY">SECURITY</a></h1>
Deadwood is a program written with security in mind.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition to use a buffer-overflow resistant string library and a coding style
  and SQA process that checks for buffer overflows and memory leaks, Deadwood
  uses a strong pseudo-random number generator (The 32-bit version of
  RadioGatun) to generate both the query ID and source port. For the random
  number generator to be secure, Deadwood needs a good source of entropy; by
  default Deadwood will use /dev/urandom to get this entropy. If you are on a
  system without /dev/urandom support, it is important to make sure that
  Deadwood has a good source of entropy so that the query ID and source port are
  hard to guess (otherwise it is possible to forge DNS packets).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Windows port of Deadwood includes a program called
  &quot;mkSecretTxt.exe&quot; that creates a 64-byte (512 bit) random file
  called &quot;secret.txt&quot; that can be used by Deadwood (via the
  &quot;random_seed_file&quot; parameter); Deadwood also gets entropy from the
  timestamp when Deadwood is started and Deadwood's process ID number, so it is
  same to use the same static secret.txt file as the random_seed_file for
  multiple invocations of Deadwood.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that Deadwood is not protected from someone on the same network viewing
  packets sent by Deadwood and sending forged packets as a reply.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To protect Deadwood from certain possible denial-of-service attacks, it is best
  if Deadwood's prime number used for hashing elements in the cache is a random
  31-bit prime number. The program RandomPrime.c generates a random prime that
  is placed in the file DwRandPrime.h that is regenerated whenever either the
  program is compiled or things are cleaned up with make clean. This program
  uses /dev/urandom for its entropy; the file DwRandPrime.h will not be
  regenerated on systems without /dev/urandom.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On systems without direct /dev/urandom support, it is suggested to see if there
  is a possible way to give the system a working /dev/urandom. This way, when
  Deadwood is compiled, the hash magic number will be suitably random.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If using a precompiled binary of Deadwood, please ensure that the system has
  /dev/urandom support (on Windows system, please ensure that the file with the
  name secret.txt is generated by the included mkSecretTxt.exe program);
  Deadwood, at runtime, uses /dev/urandom (secret.txt in Windows) as a hardcoded
  path to get entropy (along with the timestamp) for the hash algorithm.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DAEMONIZATION"><a class="selflink" href="#DAEMONIZATION">DAEMONIZATION</a></h1>
Deadwood does not have any built-in daemonization facilities; this is handled by
  the external program Duende or any other daemonizer.

#cache_file = &quot;dw_cache&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
# If your upstream DNS server converts &quot;not there&quot; DNS replies
# in to IPs, this parameter allows Deadwood to convert any reply

#ip_blacklist = &quot;10.222.33.44, 10.222.3.55&quot;

# 169.254.x.x, 224.x.x.x, or 0.0.x.x range.  If using Deadwood 
# to resolve names on an internal network, uncomment the 
# following line:
#filter_rfc1918 = 0
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Deadwood does not follow RFC2181's advice to ignore DNS responses with the TC
  (truncated) bit set, but instead extracts the first RR. If this is not
  desired, set the undocumented parameter truncation_hack to 0 (but read the DNS
  over TCP section of this man page).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Deadwood can not process DNS resource record types with numbers between 65392
  and 65407. These RR types are marked by the IANA for &quot;private use&quot;;
  Deadwood reserves these record types for internal use. This is only 16 record
  types out of the 65536 possible DNS record types (only 71 have actually been
  assigned by IANA, so this is a non-issue in the real world).
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is not clear whether the DNS RFCs allow ASCII control characters in DNS
  names. Even if they were, Deadwood does not allow ASCII control characters
  (bytes with a value less then 32) in DNS names. Other characters (UTF-8, etc.)
  are allowed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Combining a CNAME record with other records is prohibited in RFC1034 section
  3.6.2 and RFC1912 section 2.4; it makes an answer ambiguous. Deadwood handles
  this ambiguity differently than some other DNS servers.
