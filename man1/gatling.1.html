<p>gatling(1) General Commands Manual gatling(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gatling - high performance file server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gatling [-hnvVtdDfFUlaEe] [-i bind-to-ip] [-p bind-to-port]
[-T seconds] <br>
[-u uid] [-c dir] [-w workgroup] [-P bytes] [-O
[f/]ip/port/regex] <br>
[-r redir-url] [-X timeout,sshd]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gatling is a HTTP and FTP server. It will export the current
working directory to the world.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -i 127.0.0.1 to only bind to
a certain IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -p 81 to bind HTTP to a
different TCP port than 80. Use -f -p 2100 to bind FTP to a
different TCP port than 21. When running as non-root, the
default ports are 8000 and <br>
2121, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -u nobody to run under a
different UID than root. This is done after binding the
server ports, so it is safe to use -u and still bind to port
80 -- in fact, it is recom&acirc; <br>
mended not to run gatling as superuser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -c /home/www to chdir and
chroot to another directory than the current working
directory. It is recommended to run gatling in a chroot
environment to lessen the impact of <br>
possible future security problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -P 2M to activate
prefetching mode. Gatling will then make sure this much data
is prefetched. This can reduce disk activity and improve
throughput dramatically if your OS <br>
I/O scheduler is not state of the art and you are serving
several large files from the same hard disk to different
downloaders. Without prefetching, the disk will otherwise
<br>
waste time moving the disk head between the two large
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -f to enable anonymous FTP
(default) or -F to disable it. Use -U to disable uploads
altogether (normally gatling will allow file uploads).
Gatling only allows uploads to <br>
world writable directories to prevent accidental upload
permission, and the files will not be world readable (use -a
if you want them world readable). Gatling will only allow
<br>
downloads of world readable files, that&rsquo;s why this
switch is important. These options are only available if
gatling is compiled with SUPPORT_FTP defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -e to enable encryption
support (https) or -E to disable it. These options are only
available if gatling is compiled with SUPPORT_HTTPS
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -l to make gatling always
ask for FTP passwords. Normally gatling does not, which
confuses some stupid clients. This option makes gatling ask
for (and ignore) a password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -d to enable directory index
generation for HTTP (listing directories is always possible
in FTP), -D to disable. It is harder to accidentally publish
a document if the <br>
attacker can not find out the file name through directory
listings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -t to enable transparent
proxy mode. Normally, gatling will replace the port in Host:
HTTP headers and FTP virtual host names with the actual port
the connection arrived at. <br>
This is important for security (in case you have a secret
intranet web site on port 81, which is blocked at the
firewall). However, when using a firewall to redirect
connections <br>
to gatling, it may make more sense to keep the ports from
the HTTP Host: headers for virtual hosting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -v to enable virtual hosting
mode, -V to disable it. Normally, when a HTTP connection
asks for /foo.html and carries a &quot;Host:
www.fefe.de:80&quot; header, gatling will chdir to <br>
&quot;www.fefe.de:80&quot;. If &quot;www.fefe.de:80&quot;
does not exist, gatling will chdir to &quot;default&quot;.
If this also does not exist, and neither -v or -V are given,
gatling will serve <br>
&quot;foo.html&quot; from the current working directory.
Specifying -v will make sure that no file is ever served
from the current working directory, only from the virtual
host directo&acirc; <br>
ries or from default. Specifying -V means that gatling will
not try to chdir at all and always serve from the current
working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -T 600 to set the timeout
for HTTP and FTP data connections to 10 minutes (600
seconds, default is 23 seconds). Use -f -T 600 to set the
timeout for FTP control connections <br>
(default is 600 seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use -r
http://master.example.com/ on mirror.example.com, and
someone asks for a file that does not exist, gatling will
not create a 404 error but a redirect to the same <br>
file on master.example.com.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -X timeout,sshd to enable
SSH passthrough mode. If someone connects on the SSL socket,
but does not say anything for timeout (sane value: 2-10)
seconds, then gatling will <br>
run an sshd in inetd mode with that socket. sshd is the full
path name to sshd, plus the command line you want to give
it, if any. gatling automatically appends -i, so use this
<br>
for example for -u0 to disable DNS lookups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -O [flag/]ip/port/regex to
enable proxy mode, also used for SCGI and FastCGI. To use
the proxy mode, there has to be a &quot;.proxy&quot; file in
the root of the virtual host it is <br>
meant for. Specify ip and port to point to your app server,
and give a regex to match the URI. Note: the regex needs to
match the full file name, so use the extension for <br>
matching. If no flags are given, HTTP proxying is used.
Otherwise, flags specifies the proxying mode: Use S for SCGI
and F for FastCGI mode. See README.php for an example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also possible to specify a
Unix Domain socket, using the syntax --O
[flag/]|filename|regex. Remember to put the argument in
quotes when typing it in the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gatling will not serve or list
dotfiles unless they are aliased with :dotfile, e.g. to
enable serving .dotfile, you have to ln -s .dotfile
&quot;:dotfile&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
Sending gatling SIGHUP will make it close all the server
sockets (so you can start a new gatling process with
different options on the same ports). The old gatling
process will <br>
continue serving the established connections until they are
all finished.</p>
