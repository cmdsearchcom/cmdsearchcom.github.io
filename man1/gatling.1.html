gatling is a HTTP and FTP server. It will export the current working directory
  to the world.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Use <b>-i 127.0.0.1</b> to only bind to a certain IP address.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Use <b>-p 81</b> to bind HTTP to a different TCP port than 80. Use <b>-f</b>
  <b>-p 2100</b> to bind FTP to a different TCP port than 21. When running as
  non-root, the default ports are 8000 and 2121, respectively.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Use <b>-u nobody</b> to run under a different UID than root. This is done after
  binding the server ports, so it is safe to use -u and still bind to port 80 --
  in fact, it is recommended not to run gatling as superuser.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Use <b>-c /home/www</b> to chdir and chroot to another directory than the
  current working directory. It is recommended to run gatling in a chroot
  environment to lessen the impact of possible future security problems.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Use <b>-P 2M</b> to activate prefetching mode. Gatling will then make sure this
  much data is prefetched. This can reduce disk activity and improve throughput
  dramatically if your OS I/O scheduler is not state of the art and you are
  serving several large files from the same hard disk to different downloaders.
  Without prefetching, the disk will otherwise waste time moving the disk head
  between the two large files.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Use <b>-f</b> to enable anonymous FTP (default) or <b>-F</b> to disable it. Use
  <b>-U</b> to disable uploads altogether (normally gatling will allow file
  uploads). Gatling only allows uploads to world writable directories to prevent
  accidental upload permission, and the files will not be world readable (use
  <b>-a</b> if you want them world readable). Gatling will only allow downloads
  of world readable files, that's why this switch is important. These options
  are only available if gatling is compiled with SUPPORT_FTP defined.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Use <b>-e</b> to enable encryption support (https) or <b>-E</b> to disable it.
  These options are only available if gatling is compiled with SUPPORT_HTTPS
  defined.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Use <b>-l</b> to make gatling always ask for FTP passwords. Normally gatling
  does not, which confuses some stupid clients. This option makes gatling ask
  for (and ignore) a password.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Use <b>-d</b> to enable directory index generation for HTTP (listing directories
  is always possible in FTP), <b>-D</b> to disable. It is harder to accidentally
  publish a document if the attacker can not find out the file name through
  directory listings.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Use <b>-t</b> to enable transparent proxy mode. Normally, gatling will replace
  the port in Host: HTTP headers and FTP virtual host names with the actual port
  the connection arrived at. This is important for security (in case you have a
  secret intranet web site on port 81, which is blocked at the firewall).
  However, when using a firewall to redirect connections to gatling, it may make
  more sense to keep the ports from the HTTP Host: headers for virtual hosting.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Use <b>-v</b> to enable virtual hosting mode, -V to disable it. Normally, when a
  HTTP connection asks for /foo.html and carries a &quot;Host:
  www.fefe.de:80&quot; header, gatling will chdir to &quot;www.fefe.de:80&quot;.
  If &quot;www.fefe.de:80&quot; does not exist, gatling will chdir to
  &quot;default&quot;. If this also does not exist, and neither -v or -V are
  given, gatling will serve &quot;foo.html&quot; from the current working
  directory. Specifying -v will make sure that no file is ever served from the
  current working directory, only from the virtual host directories or from
  default. Specifying -V means that gatling will not try to chdir at all and
  always serve from the current working directory.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Use <b>-T 600</b> to set the timeout for HTTP and FTP data connections to 10
  minutes (600 seconds, default is 23 seconds). Use <b>-f -T 600</b> to set the
  timeout for FTP control connections (default is 600 seconds).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you use <b>-r http://master.example.com/</b> on mirror.example.com, and
  someone asks for a file that does not exist, gatling will not create a 404
  error but a redirect to the same file on master.example.com.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Use <b>-X timeout,sshd</b> to enable SSH passthrough mode. If someone connects
  on the SSL socket, but does not say anything for <b>timeout</b> (sane value:
  2-10) seconds, then gatling will run an sshd in inetd mode with that socket.
  <b>sshd</b> is the full path name to sshd, plus the command line you want to
  give it, if any. gatling automatically appends -i, so use this for example for
  -u0 to disable DNS lookups.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Use <b>-O [flag/]ip/port/regex</b> to enable proxy mode, also used for SCGI and
  FastCGI. To use the proxy mode, there has to be a &quot;.proxy&quot; file in
  the root of the virtual host it is meant for. Specify ip and port to point to
  your app server, and give a regex to match the URI. Note: the regex needs to
  match the full file name, so use the extension for matching. If no flags are
  given, HTTP proxying is used. Otherwise, flags specifies the proxying mode:
  Use S for SCGI and F for FastCGI mode. See README.php for an example.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
It is also possible to specify a Unix Domain socket, using the syntax - <b>-O
  [flag/]|filename|regex</b>. Remember to put the argument in quotes when typing
  it in the shell.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Gatling will not serve or list dotfiles unless they are aliased with :dotfile,
  e.g. to enable serving .dotfile, you have to ln -s .dotfile
  &quot;:dotfile&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SIGNALS"><a class="selflink" href="#SIGNALS">SIGNALS</a></h1>
Sending gatling SIGHUP will make it close all the server sockets (so you can
  start a new gatling process with different options on the same ports). The old
  gatling process will continue serving the established connections until they
  are all finished.
