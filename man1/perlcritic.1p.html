<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
&quot;perlcritic&quot; is a Perl source code analyzer. It is
the executable front-end to the Perl::Critic engine, which
attempts to identify awkward, hard to read, error-prone, or
<br>
unconventional constructs in your code. Most of the rules
are based on Damian Conway&rsquo;s book Perl Best Practices.
However, &quot;perlcritic&quot; is not limited to enforcing
PBP, and it <br>
will even support rules that contradict Conway. All rules
can easily be configured or disabled to your liking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This documentation only covers
how to drive this command. For all other information, such
as API reference and alternative interfaces, please see the
documentation for <br>
Perl::Critic itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE EXAMPLES <br>
Before getting into all the gory details, here are some
basic usage examples to help get you started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Report only most severe
violations (severity = 5) <br>
perlcritic YourModule.pm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Same as above, but read input
from STDIN <br>
perlcritic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Recursively process all Perl
files beneath directory <br>
perlcritic /some/directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Report slightly less severe
violations too (severity &gt;= 4) <br>
perlcritic -4 YourModule.pm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Same as above, but using named
severity level <br>
perlcritic --stern YourModule.pm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Report all violations,
regardless of severity (severity &gt;= 1) <br>
perlcritic -1 YourModule.pm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Same as above, but using named
severity level <br>
perlcritic --brutal YourModule.pm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Report only violations of
things from &quot;Perl Best Practices&quot; <br>
perlcritic --theme pbp YourModule.pm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Report top 20 most severe
violations (severity &gt;= 1) <br>
perlcritic --top YourModule.pm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Report additional violations
of Policies that match m/variables/xms <br>
perlcritic --include variables YourModule.pm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Use defaults from somewhere
other than ~/.perlcriticrc <br>
perlcriticrc --profile project/specific/perlcriticrc
YourModule.pm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
The arguments are paths to the files you wish to analyze.
You may specify multiple files. If an argument is a
directory, &quot;perlcritic&quot; will analyze all Perl
files below the <br>
directory. If no arguments are specified, then input is read
from STDIN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Option names can be abbreviated to uniqueness and can be
stated with singe or double dashes, and option values can be
separated from the option name by a space or &rsquo;=&rsquo;
(as with <br>
Getopt::Long). Option names are also case-sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--profile FILE&quot; or
&quot;-p FILE&quot; <br>
Directs &quot;perlcritic&quot; to use a profile named by
FILE rather than looking for the default .perlcriticrc file
in the current directory or your home directory. See <br>
&quot;CONFIGURATION&quot; in Perl::Critic for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--noprofile&quot; <br>
Directs &quot;perlcritic&quot; not to load any configuration
file, thus reverting to the default configuration for all
Policies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--severity N&quot; <br>
Directs &quot;perlcritic&quot; to only apply Policies with a
severity greater than &quot;N&quot;. Severity values are
integers ranging from 1 (least severe) to 5 (most severe).
The default is <br>
5. For a given &quot;--profile&quot;, decreasing the
&quot;--severity&quot; will usually produce more violations.
You can set the default value for this option in your
.perlcriticrc file. You <br>
can also redefine the &quot;severity&quot; for any Policy in
your .perlcriticrc file. See &quot;CONFIGURATION&quot; for
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;-5 | -4 | -3 | -2 |
-1&quot; <br>
These are numeric shortcuts for setting the
&quot;--severity&quot; option. For example, &quot;-4&quot;
is equivalent to &quot;--severity 4&quot;. If multiple
shortcuts are specified, then the most <br>
restrictive one wins. If an explicit &quot;--severity&quot;
option is also given, then all shortcut options are silently
ignored. NOTE: Be careful not to put one of the number <br>
severity shortcut options immediately after the
&quot;--top&quot; flag or &quot;perlcritic&quot; will
interpret it as the number of violations to report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--severity NAME&quot; <br>
If it is difficult for you to remember whether severity
&quot;5&quot; is the most or least restrictive level, then
you can use one of these named values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEVERITY NAME ...is equivalent
to... SEVERITY NUMBER <br>
--------------------------------------------------------
<br>
--severity gentle --severity 5 <br>
--severity stern --severity 4 <br>
--severity harsh --severity 3 <br>
--severity cruel --severity 2 <br>
--severity brutal --severity 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--gentle | --stern |
--harsh | --cruel | --brutal&quot; <br>
These are named shortcuts for setting the
&quot;--severity&quot; option. For example,
&quot;--cruel&quot; is equivalent to &quot;--severity
2&quot;. If multiple shortcuts are specified, then the most
<br>
restrictive one wins. If an explicit &quot;--severity&quot;
option is also given, then all shortcut options are silently
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--theme RULE&quot; <br>
Directs &quot;perlcritic&quot; to apply only Policies with
themes that satisfy the &quot;RULE&quot;. Themes are
arbitrary names for groups of related policies. You can
combine theme names with <br>
boolean operators to create an arbitrarily complex
&quot;RULE&quot;. For example, the following would apply
only Policies that have a &rsquo;bugs&rsquo; AND
&rsquo;pbp&rsquo; theme:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$&gt; perlcritic
--theme=&rsquo;bugs &amp;&amp; pbp&rsquo; MyModule.pm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless the
&quot;--severity&quot; option is explicitly given, setting
&quot;--theme&quot; silently causes the
&quot;--severity&quot; to be set to 1. You can set the
default value for this option in your <br>
.perlcriticrc file. See &quot;POLICY THEMES&quot; in
Perl::Critic for more information about themes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--include PATTERN&quot;
<br>
Directs &quot;perlcritic&quot; to apply additional Policies
that match the regex &quot;/PATTERN/imx&quot;. Use this
option to temporarily override your profile and/or the
severity settings at <br>
the command-line. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlcritic --include=layout
my_file.pl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This would cause
&quot;perlcritic&quot; to apply all the
&quot;CodeLayout::*&quot; policies even if they have a
severity level that is less than the default level of 5, or
have been disabled in <br>
your .perlcriticrc file. You can specify multiple
&quot;--include&quot; options and you can use it in
conjunction with the &quot;--exclude&quot; option. Note that
&quot;--exclude&quot; takes precedence <br>
over &quot;--include&quot; when a Policy matches both
patterns. You can set the default value for this option in
your .perlcriticrc file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--exclude PATTERN&quot;
<br>
Directs &quot;perlcritic&quot; to not apply any Policy that
matches the regex &quot;/PATTERN/imx&quot;. Use this option
to temporarily override your profile and/or the severity
settings at the <br>
command-line. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlcritic --exclude=strict
my_file.pl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This would cause
&quot;perlcritic&quot; to not apply the
&quot;RequireUseStrict&quot; and
&quot;ProhibitNoStrict&quot; Policies even though they have
the highest severity level. You can specify multiple <br>
&quot;--exclude&quot; options and you can use it in
conjunction with the &quot;--include&quot; option. Note that
&quot;--exclude&quot; takes precedence over
&quot;--include&quot; when a Policy matches both <br>
patterns. You can set the default value for this option in
your .perlcriticrc file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--single-policy
PATTERN&quot; or &quot;-s PATTERN&quot; <br>
Directs &quot;perlcritic&quot; to apply just one Policy
module matching the regex &quot;/PATTERN/ixms&quot;, and
exclude all other Policies. This option has precedence over
the &quot;--severity&quot;, <br>
&quot;--theme&quot;, &quot;--include&quot;,
&quot;--exclude&quot;, and &quot;--only&quot; options. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlcritic
--single-policy=nowarnings my_file.pl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This would cause
&quot;perlcritic&quot; to apply just the
&quot;ProhibitNoWarnings&quot; Policy, regardless of the
severity level setting. No other Policies would be
applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to what one
might intend by...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlcritic --exclude=.
--include=nowarnings my_file.pl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">... but this won&rsquo;t work
because the &quot;--exclude&quot; option overrides the
&quot;--include&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The equivalent of this option
can be accomplished by creating a custom profile containing
only the desired policy and then running...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlcritic
--profile=customprofile --only my_file.pl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--top [ N ]&quot; <br>
Directs &quot;perlcritic&quot; to report only the top
&quot;N&quot; Policy violations in each file, ranked by
their severity. If &quot;N&quot; is not specified, it
defaults to 20. If the &quot;--severity&quot; <br>
option (or one of the shortcuts) is not explicitly given,
the &quot;--top&quot; option implies that the minimum
severity level is &quot;1&quot; (i.e. &quot;brutal&quot;).
Users can redefine the severity <br>
for any Policy in their .perlcriticrc file. See
&quot;CONFIGURATION&quot; for more information. You can set
the default value for this option in your .perlcriticrc
file. NOTE: Be <br>
careful not to put one of the severity shortcut options
immediately after the &quot;--top&quot; flag or
&quot;perlcritic&quot; will interpret it as the number of
violations to report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--force&quot; <br>
Directs &quot;perlcritic&quot; to ignore the magical
&quot;## no critic&quot; annotations in the source code. See
&quot;BENDING THE RULES&quot; for more information. You can
set the default value for <br>
this option in your .perlcriticrc file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--statistics&quot; <br>
Causes several statistics about the code being scanned and
the violations found to be reported after any other
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--statistics-only&quot;
<br>
Like the &quot;--statistics&quot; option, but suppresses
normal output and only shows the statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--verbose N | FORMAT&quot;
<br>
Sets the verbosity level or format for reporting violations.
If given a number (&quot;N&quot;), &quot;perlcritic&quot;
reports violations using one of the predefined formats
described below. <br>
If given a string (&quot;FORMAT&quot;), it is interpreted to
be an actual format specification. If the
&quot;--verbose&quot; option is not specified, it defaults
to either 4 or 5, depending on <br>
whether multiple files were given as arguments to
&quot;perlcritic&quot;. You can set the default value for
this option in your .perlcriticrc file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verbosity Format Specification
<br>
-----------
------------------------------------------------------- <br>
1 &quot;%f:%l:%c:%m0, <br>
2 &quot;%f: (%l:%c) %m0, <br>
3 &quot;%m at %f line %l0, <br>
4 &quot;%m at line %l, column %c. %e. (Severity: %s)0, <br>
5 &quot;%f: %m at line %l, column %c. %e. (Severity: %s)0,
<br>
6 &quot;%m at line %l, near &rsquo;%r&rsquo;. (Severity:
%s)0, <br>
7 &quot;%f: %m at line %l near &rsquo;%r&rsquo;. (Severity:
%s)0, <br>
8 &quot;[%p] %m at line %l, column %c. (Severity: %s)0, <br>
9 &quot;[%p] %m at line %l, near &rsquo;%r&rsquo;.
(Severity: %s)0, <br>
10 &quot;%m at line %l, column %c. %p (Severity: %s)1d0,
<br>
11 &quot;%m at line %l, near &rsquo;%r&rsquo;. %p (Severity:
%s)1d0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Formats are a combination of
literal and escape characters similar to the way
&quot;sprintf&quot; works. See String::Format for a full
explanation of the formatting capabilities. <br>
Valid escape characters are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Escape Meaning <br>
-------
------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
%c Column number where the violation occurred <br>
%d Full diagnostic discussion of the violation <br>
%e Explanation of violation or page numbers in PBP <br>
%F Just the name of the file where the violation occurred.
<br>
%f Path to the file where the violation occurred. <br>
%l Line number where the violation occurred <br>
%m Brief description of the violation <br>
%P Full name of the Policy module that created the violation
<br>
%p Name of the Policy without the Perl::Critic::Policy::
prefix <br>
%r The string of source code that caused the violation <br>
%C The class of the PPI::Element that caused the violation
<br>
%s The severity level of the violation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The purpose of these formats is
to provide some compatibility with text editors that have an
interface for parsing certain kinds of input. See
&quot;EDITOR INTEGRATION&quot; for more <br>
information about that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--list&quot; <br>
Displays a condensed listing of all the Perl::Critic::Policy
modules that are found on this machine. This option lists
all Policies, regardless of your .perlcriticrc or <br>
command line options. For each Policy, the name, default
severity and default themes are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--list-enabled&quot; <br>
Displays a condensed listing of all the Perl::Critic::Policy
modules that would be enforced, if you were actually going
to critique a file with this command. This is useful <br>
when you&rsquo;ve constructed a complicated command or
modified your .perlcriticrc file and you want to see exactly
which Policies are going to be enforced (or not enforced, as
the <br>
case may be). For each Policy, the name, default severity
and default themes are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--list-themes&quot; <br>
Displays a list of all the themes of the
Perl::Critic::Policy modules that are found on this
machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--profile-proto&quot; <br>
Displays an expanded listing of all the Perl::Critic::Policy
modules that are found on this machine. For each Policy, the
name, default severity and default themes are <br>
shown, as well as the name of any additional parameters that
the Policy supports. The format is suitable as a prototype
for your .perlcriticrc file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--only&quot; <br>
Directs perlcritic to apply only Policies that are
explicitly mentioned in your .perlcriticrc file. This is
useful if you want to use just a small subset of Policies
without <br>
having to disable all the others. You can set the default
value for this option in your .perlcriticrc file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--profile-strictness
{warn|fatal|quiet}&quot; <br>
Directs perlcritic how to treat certain recoverable problems
found in a .perlcriticrc or file specified via the
&quot;--profile&quot; option. Valid values are
&quot;warn&quot; (the default), <br>
&quot;fatal&quot;, and &quot;quiet&quot;. For example,
perlcritic normally only warns about profiles referring to
non-existent Policies, but this option can make this
situation fatal. You can <br>
set the default value for this option in your .perlcriticrc
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--count&quot; <br>
&quot;-C&quot; <br>
Display only the number of violations for each file. Use
this feature to get a quick handle on where a large pile of
code might need the most attention.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--Safari&quot; <br>
Report &quot;Perl Best Practice&quot; citations as section
numbers from &lt;http://safari.oreilly.com&gt; instead of
page numbers from the actual book. NOTE: This feature is not
implemented <br>
yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--color&quot; =item
&quot;--colour&quot; <br>
This option is on when outputting to a tty. When set,
Severity 5 and 4 are colored red and yellow, respectively.
Colorization only happens if Term::ANSIColor is installed
<br>
and it only works on non-Windows environments. Negate this
switch to disable color. You can set the default value for
this option in your .perlcriticrc file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--pager
PAGER_COMMAND_STRING&quot; <br>
If set, perlcritic will pipe it&rsquo;s output to the given
PAGER_COMMAND_STRING. You can set the default value for this
option in your .perlcriticrc file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting a pager turns off color
by default. You will have to turn color on explicitly. If
you want color, you&rsquo;ll probably also want to tell your
pager to display raw <br>
characters. For &quot;less&quot; and &quot;more&quot;, use
the -R switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--color-severity-highest
COLOR_SPECIFICATION&quot; <br>
Specifies the color to be used for highest severity
violations, as a Term::ANSIColor color specification. Can
also be specified as &quot;--colour- severity-highest&quot;,
<br>
&quot;--color-severity-5&quot;, or
&quot;--colour-severity-5&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--color-severity-high
COLOR_SPECIFICATION&quot; <br>
Specifies the color to be used for high severity violations,
as a Term::ANSIColor color specification. Can also be
specified as &quot;--colour- severity-high&quot;, <br>
&quot;--color-severity-4&quot;, or
&quot;--colour-severity-4&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--color-severity-medium
COLOR_SPECIFICATION&quot; <br>
Specifies the color to be used for medium severity
violations, as a Term::ANSIColor color specification. Can
also be specified as &quot;--colour- severity-medium&quot;,
<br>
&quot;--color-severity-3&quot;, or
&quot;--colour-severity-3&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--color-severity-low
COLOR_SPECIFICATION&quot; <br>
Specifies the color to be used for low severity violations,
as a Term::ANSIColor color specification. Can also be
specified as &quot;--colour- severity-low&quot;,
&quot;--color-severity-2&quot;, <br>
or &quot;--colour-severity-2&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--color-severity-lowest
COLOR_SPECIFICATION&quot; <br>
Specifies the color to be used for lowest severity
violations, as a Term::ANSIColor color specification. Can
also be specified as &quot;--colour- severity-lowest&quot;,
<br>
&quot;--color-severity-1&quot;, or
&quot;--colour-severity-1&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--files-with-violations&quot;
<br>
Display only the names of files with violations. Use this
feature with --single-policy to find files that contain
violations of a given policy. Can also be specified as <br>
&quot;--l&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--files-without-violations&quot;
<br>
Display only the names of files without violations. Use this
feature with --single-policy to find files that do not
contain violations of a given policy. Can also be <br>
specified as &quot;--L&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--program-extensions
file_name_extension&quot; <br>
Tell &quot;perlcritic&quot; to treat files whose names end
in the given file name extension as programs, not as
modules. If a leading &rsquo;.&rsquo; is desired it must be
explicitly specified, <br>
e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--program-extensions .pl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The matching is case-sensitive,
and the option may be specified as many times as desired,
e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--program-extensions .pl
--program-extensions .cgi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above can also be done by
quoting the file name extensions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--program-extensions &rsquo;.pl
.cgi&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files whose name ends in
&rsquo;.PL&rsquo; will always be considered programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--doc PATTERN&quot; <br>
Displays the perldoc for all Perl::Critic::Policy modules
that match &quot;m/PATTERN/ixms&quot;. Since Policy modules
tend to have rather long names, this just provides a more
<br>
convenient way to say something like: &quot;perldoc
Perl::Critic::Policy::ValuesAndExpressions::RequireUpperCaseH
eredocTerminator&quot; at the command prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--allow-unsafe&quot; <br>
This option directs &quot;perlcritic&quot; to allow the use
of Policies that have been marked as &quot;unsafe&quot;.
Unsafe Policies may result in risky operations by compiling
and executing <br>
the code they analyze. All the Policies that ship in the
core Perl::Critic distribution are safe. However, third-
party Policies, such as those in the Perl::Critic::Dynamic
<br>
distribution are not safe. Note that &quot;safety&quot; is
honorary -- if a Policy author marks a Policy as safe, it is
not a guarantee that it won&rsquo;t do nasty things. If you
don&rsquo;t <br>
trust your Policies and the code you are analyzing, then do
not use this switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--quiet&quot; <br>
Suppress the &quot;source OK&quot; message when no
violations are found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--help&quot; <br>
&quot;-?&quot; <br>
&quot;-H&quot; <br>
Displays a brief summary of options and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--options&quot; <br>
Displays the descriptions of the options and exits. While
this output is long, it it nowhere near the length of the
output of &quot;--man&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--man&quot; <br>
Displays the complete &quot;perlcritic&quot; manual and
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--version&quot; <br>
&quot;-V&quot; <br>
Displays the version number of &quot;perlcritic&quot; and
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
Most of the settings for Perl::Critic and each of the Policy
modules can be controlled by a configuration file. The
default configuration file is called .perlcriticrc. <br>
&quot;perlcritic&quot; will look for this file in the
current directory first, and then in your home directory.
Alternatively, you can set the &quot;PERLCRITIC&quot;
environment variable to <br>
explicitly point to a different file in another location. If
none of these files exist, and the &quot;--profile&quot;
option is not given on the command-line, then all Policies
will be <br>
loaded with their default configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the configuration
file is a series of INI-style blocks that contain key-value
pairs separated by &quot;=&quot;. Comments should start with
&quot;#&quot; and can be placed on a separate <br>
line or after the name-value pairs if you desire.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default settings for perlcritic
itself can be set before the first named block. For example,
putting any or all of these at the top of your .perlcriticrc
file will set the <br>
default value for the corresponding command-line
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">severity = 3 #Integer or named
level <br>
only = 1 #Zero or One <br>
force = 0 #Zero or One <br>
verbose = 4 #Integer or format spec <br>
top = 50 #A positive integer <br>
theme = (pbp + security) * bugs #A theme expression <br>
include = NamingConventions ClassHierarchies
#Space-delimited list <br>
exclude = Variables Modules::RequirePackage #Space-delimited
list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remainder of the
configuration file is a series of blocks like this:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Perl::Critic::Policy::Category::PolicyName]
<br>
severity = 1 <br>
set_themes = foo bar <br>
add_themes = baz <br>
arg1 = value1 <br>
arg2 = value2</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Perl::Critic::Policy::Category::PolicyName&quot;
is the full name of a module that implements the policy. The
Policy modules distributed with Perl::Critic have been
grouped into <br>
categories according to the table of contents in Damian
Conway&rsquo;s book Perl Best Practices. For brevity, you
can omit the &rsquo;Perl::Critic::Policy&rsquo; part of the
module name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;severity&quot; is the
level of importance you wish to assign to the Policy. All
Policy modules are defined with a default severity value
ranging from 1 (least severe) to 5 (most <br>
severe). However, you may disagree with the default severity
and choose to give it a higher or lower severity, based on
your own coding philosophy. You can set the
&quot;severity&quot; <br>
to an integer from 1 to 5, or use one of the equivalent
names:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEVERITY NAME ...is equivalent
to... SEVERITY NUMBER <br>
---------------------------------------------------- <br>
gentle 5 <br>
stern 4 <br>
harsh 3 <br>
cruel 2 <br>
brutal 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;set_themes&quot; sets the
theme for the Policy and overrides its default theme. The
argument is a string of one or more whitespace-delimited
alphanumeric words. Themes are case- <br>
insensitive. See &quot;POLICY THEMES&quot; for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;add_themes&quot; appends
to the default themes for this Policy. The argument is a
string of one or more whitespace-delimited words. Themes are
case- insensitive. See &quot;POLICY <br>
THEMES&quot; for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remaining key-value pairs
are configuration parameters that will be passed into the
constructor of that Policy. The constructors for most Policy
modules do not support <br>
arguments, and those that do should have reasonable
defaults. See the documentation on the appropriate Policy
module for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of redefining the
severity for a given Policy, you can completely disable a
Policy by prepending a &rsquo;-&rsquo; to the name of the
module in your configuration file. In this <br>
manner, the Policy will never be loaded, regardless of the
&quot;--severity&quot; given on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A simple configuration might
look like this:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">#--------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
# I think these are really important, so always load
them</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">[TestingAndDebugging::RequireUseStrict]
<br>
severity = 5</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">[TestingAndDebugging::RequireUseWarnings]
<br>
severity = 5</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">#--------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
# I think these are less important, so only load when
asked</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Variables::ProhibitPackageVars]
<br>
severity = 2</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ControlStructures::ProhibitPostfixControls]
<br>
allow = if unless # My custom configuration <br>
severity = cruel # Same as &quot;severity = 2&quot;</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">#--------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
# Give these policies a custom theme. I can activate just
<br>
# these policies by saying &quot;perlcritic --theme
&rsquo;larry || curly&rsquo;&quot;</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Modules::RequireFilenameMatchesPackage]
<br>
add_themes = larry</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">[TestingAndDebugging::RequireTestLabels]
<br>
add_themes = curly moe</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">#--------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
# I do not agree with these at all, so never load them</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-NamingConventions::Capitalization]
<br>
[-ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitMagicNumbers]</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">#--------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
# For all other Policies, I accept the default severity,
<br>
# so no additional configuration is required for them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that all policies included
with the Perl::Critic distribution that have integer
parameters accept underscores (&quot;_&quot;) in their
values, as with Perl numeric literals. For <br>
example,</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ValuesAndExpressions::RequireNumberSeparators]
<br>
min_value = 1_000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For additional configuration
examples, see the perlcriticrc file that is included in this
examples directory of this distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Damian Conway&rsquo;s own
Perl::Critic configuration is also included in this
distribution as examples/perlcriticrc-conway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE POLICIES <br>
A large number of Policy modules are distributed with
Perl::Critic. They are described briefly in the companion
document Perl::Critic::PolicySummary and in more detail in
the <br>
individual modules themselves. Say &quot;perlcritic --doc
PATTERN&quot; to see the perldoc for all Policy modules that
match the regex &quot;m/PATTERN/ixms&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a number of
distributions of additional policies on CPAN. If
Perl::Critic doesn&rsquo;t contain a policy that you want,
some one may have already written it. See &quot;SEE
ALSO&quot; <br>
in Perl::Critic for a list of some of these
distributions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POLICY THEMES <br>
Each Policy is defined with one or more &quot;themes&quot;.
Themes can be used to create arbitrary groups of Policies.
They are intended to provide an alternative mechanism for
selecting <br>
your preferred set of Policies. For example, you may wish
disable a certain set of Policies when analyzing test
programs. Conversely, you may wish to enable only a specific
<br>
subset of Policies when analyzing modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Policies that ship with
Perl::Critic are have been divided into the following
themes. This is just our attempt to provide some basic
logical groupings. You are free to <br>
invent new themes that suit your needs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THEME DESCRIPTION <br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
core All policies that ship with Perl::Critic <br>
pbp Policies that come directly from &quot;Perl Best
Practices&quot; <br>
bugs Policies that that prevent or reveal bugs <br>
certrec Policies that CERT recommends <br>
certrule Policies that CERT considers rules <br>
maintenance Policies that affect the long-term health of the
code <br>
cosmetic Policies that only have a superficial effect <br>
complexity Policies that specificaly relate to code
complexity <br>
security Policies that relate to security issues <br>
tests Policies that are specific to test programs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Say &quot;perlcritic
--list&quot; to get a listing of all available policies and
the themes that are associated with each one. You can also
change the theme for any Policy in your <br>
.perlcriticrc file. See the &quot;CONFIGURATION&quot;
section for more information about that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the &quot;--theme&quot;
command-line option, you can create an arbitrarily complex
rule that determines which Policies to apply. Precedence is
the same as regular Perl code, and you <br>
can use parentheses to enforce precedence as well. Supported
operators are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operator Altertative Example
<br>

-----------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
&amp;&amp; and &rsquo;pbp &amp;&amp; core&rsquo; <br>
|| or &rsquo;pbp || (bugs &amp;&amp; security)&rsquo; <br>
! not &rsquo;pbp &amp;&amp; ! (portability ||
complexity)&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Theme names are
case-insensitive. If the &quot;--theme&quot; is set to an
empty string, then it evaluates as true all Policies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BENDING THE RULES <br>
Perl::Critic takes a hard-line approach to your code: either
you comply or you don&rsquo;t. In the real world, it is not
always practical (or even possible) to fully comply with
<br>
coding standards. In such cases, it is wise to show that you
are knowingly violating the standards and that you have a
Damn Good Reason (DGR) for doing so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To help with those situations,
you can direct Perl::Critic to ignore certain lines or
blocks of code by using annotations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require
&rsquo;LegacyLibaray1.pl&rsquo;; ## no critic <br>
require &rsquo;LegacyLibrary2.pl&rsquo;; ## no critic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for my $element (@list) {</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">## no critic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$foo = &quot;&quot;; #Violates
&rsquo;ProhibitEmptyQuotes&rsquo; <br>
$barf = bar() if $foo; #Violates
&rsquo;ProhibitPostfixControls&rsquo; <br>
#Some more evil code...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">## use critic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#Some good code... <br>
do_something($_); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;## no critic&quot;
annotations direct Perl::Critic to ignore the remaining
lines of code until a &quot;## use critic&quot; annotation
is found. If the &quot;## no critic&quot; annotation is on
the <br>
same line as a code statement, then only that line of code
is overlooked. To direct perlcritic to ignore the &quot;##
no critic&quot; annotations, use the &quot;--force&quot;
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A bare &quot;## no critic&quot;
annotation disables all the active Policies. If you wish to
disable only specific Policies, add a list of Policy names
as arguments just as you would for <br>
the &quot;no strict&quot; or &quot;no warnings&quot; pragma.
For example, this would disable the
&quot;ProhibitEmptyQuotes&quot; and
&quot;ProhibitPostfixControls&quot; policies until the end
of the block or until the <br>
next &quot;## use critic&quot; annotation (whichever comes
first):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">## no critic (EmptyQuotes,
PostfixControls);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Now exempt from
ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitEmptyQuotes <br>
$foo = &quot;&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Now exempt
ControlStructures::ProhibitPostfixControls <br>
$barf = bar() if $foo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Still subject to
ValuesAndExpression::RequireNumberSeparators <br>
$long_int = 10000000000;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the Policy names are
matched against the &quot;## no critic&quot; arguments as
regular expressions, you can abbreviate the Policy names or
disable an entire family of Policies in one <br>
shot like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">## no critic
(NamingConventions)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Now exempt from
NamingConventions::Capitalization <br>
my $camelHumpVar = &rsquo;foo&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Now exempt from
NamingConventions::Capitalization <br>
sub camelHumpSub {}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument list must be
enclosed in parentheses and must contain one or more
comma-separated barewords (i.e. don&rsquo;t use quotes). The
&quot;## no critic&quot; annotations can be nested, <br>
and Policies named by an inner annotation will be disabled
along with those already disabled an outer annotation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some Policies like
&quot;Subroutines::ProhibitExcessComplexity&quot; apply to
an entire block of code. In those cases, &quot;## no
critic&quot; must appear on the line where the violation is
<br>
reported. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub complicated_function { ## no
critic (ProhibitExcessComplexity) <br>
# Your code here... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some Policies like
&quot;Documentation::RequirePodSections&quot; apply to the
entire document, in which case violations are reported at
line 1. But if the file requires a shebang line, it <br>
is impossible to put &quot;## no critic&quot; on the first
line of the file. This is a known limitation and it will be
addressed in a future release. As a workaround, you can
disable the <br>
affected policies at the command-line or in your
.perlcriticrc file. But beware that this will affect the
analysis of all files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this feature wisely.
&quot;## no critic&quot; should be used in the smallest
possible scope, or only on individual lines of code. And you
should always be as specific as possible <br>
about which policies you want to disable (i.e. never use a
bare &quot;## no critic&quot;). If Perl::Critic complains
about your code, try and find a compliant solution before
resorting to <br>
this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EDITOR INTEGRATION <br>
For ease-of-use, &quot;perlcritic&quot; can be integrated
with your favorite text editor. The output-formatting
capabilities of &quot;perlcritic&quot; are specifically
intended for use with the <br>
&quot;grep&quot; or &quot;compile&quot; modes available in
editors like &quot;emacs&quot; and &quot;vim&quot;. In these
modes, you can run an arbitrary command and the editor will
parse the output into an interactive <br>
buffer that you can click on and jump to the relevant line
of code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Perl::Critic team thanks
everyone who has helped integrate Perl-Critic with their
favorite editor. Your contributions in particular have made
Perl- Critic a convenient and <br>
user-friendly tool for Perl developers of all stripes. We
sincerely appreciate your hard work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EMACS <br>
Joshua ben Jore has authored a minor-mode for emacs that
allows you to run perlcritic on the current region or
buffer. You can run it on demand, or configure it to run
<br>
automatically when you save the buffer. The output appears
in a hot-linked compiler buffer. The code and installation
instructions can be found in the extras directory inside
<br>
this distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VIM <br>
Scott Peshak has published perlchecker.vim, which is
available at
&lt;http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1731&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gVIM <br>
Fritz Mehner recently added support for
&quot;perlcritic&quot; to his fantastic gVIM plugin. In
addition to providing a very Perlish IDE, Fritz&rsquo;s
plugin enables one-click access to <br>
&quot;perlcritic&quot; and many other very useful utilities.
And all is seamlessly integrated into the editor. See
&quot;/lug.fh-swf.de/vim /vim-perl/screenshots-en.html&quot;
in http: for complete <br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EPIC <br>
EPIC is an open source Perl IDE based on the Eclipse
platform. Features include syntax highlighting, on-the-fly
syntax check, content assist, code completion, perldoc
support, <br>
source formatting with Perl::Tidy, code templates, a regular
expression editing tool, and integration with the Perl
debugger. Recent versions of EPIC also have built-in support
<br>
for Perl::Critic. At least one Perl::Critic contributor
swears by EPIC. Go to &lt;http://e-p-i-c.sourceforge.net&gt;
for more information about EPIC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BBEdit <br>
Josh Clark has produced an excellent Perl-Critic plugin for
BBEdit. See
&lt;http://globalmoxie.com/projects/bbedit-perl-critic/index.shtml&gt;
for download, installation, and usage <br>
instructions. Apple users rejoice!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Komodo <br>
Komodo is a proprietary IDE for Perl and several other
dynamic languages. Starting in version 5.1.1, Komodo has
built-in support for Perl-Critic, if you have the
Perl::Critic <br>
and criticism modules installed. Free trial copies of Komodo
can be obtained from the ActiveState website at
&lt;http://www.activestate.com&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ActivePerl <br>
ActivePerl includes a very slick graphical interface for
configuring and running Perl-Critic called
&quot;perlcritic-gui&quot;. A free community edition of
ActivePerl can be obtained from <br>
the ActiveState website at
&lt;http://www.activestate.com&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
If &quot;perlcritic&quot; has any errors itself, exits with
status == 1. If there are no errors, but
&quot;perlcritic&quot; finds Policy violations in your
source code, exits with status == 2. If <br>
there were no errors and no violations were found, exits
with status == 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE Perl::Critic PHILOSOPHY <br>
Coding standards are deeply personal and highly subjective.
The goal of Perl::Critic is to help you write code that
conforms with a set of best practices. Our primary goal <br>
is not to dictate what those practices are, but rather, to
implement the practices discovered by others. Ultimately,
you make the rules -- Perl::Critic is merely a tool for <br>
encouraging consistency. If there is a policy that you think
is important or that we have overlooked, we would be very
grateful for contributions, or you can simply load <br>
your own private set of policies into Perl::Critic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDING THE CRITIC <br>
The modular design of Perl::Critic is intended to facilitate
the addition of new Policies. You&rsquo;ll need to have some
understanding of PPI, but most Policy modules are pretty
<br>
straightforward and only require about 20 lines of code.
Please see the Perl::Critic::DEVELOPER file included in this
distribution for a step-by-step demonstration of how to <br>
create new Policy modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you develop any new Policy
modules, feel free to send them to
&quot;&lt;team@perlcritic.com&gt;&quot; and I&rsquo;ll be
happy to consider putting them into the Perl::Critic
distribution. Or if you <br>
would like to work on the Perl::Critic project directly, you
can fork our repository at &quot;/github.com/Perl-
Critic/Perl- Critic.git&quot; in http:.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Perl::Critic team is also
available for hire. If your organization has its own coding
standards, we can create custom Policies to enforce your
local guidelines. Or if your <br>
code base is prone to a particular defect pattern, we can
design Policies that will help you catch those costly
defects before they go into production. To discuss your
needs with <br>
the Perl::Critic team, just contact
&quot;&lt;team@perlcritic.com&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTACTING THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM
