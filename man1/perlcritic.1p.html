<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
&quot;perlcritic&quot; is a Perl source code analyzer. It is the executable
  front-end to the Perl::Critic engine, which attempts to identify awkward, hard
  to read, error-prone, or unconventional constructs in your code. Most of the
  rules are based on Damian Conway's book <b>Perl Best Practices</b>. However,
  &quot;perlcritic&quot; is <b>not</b> limited to enforcing PBP, and it will
  even support rules that contradict Conway. All rules can easily be configured
  or disabled to your liking.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This documentation only covers how to drive this command. For all other
  information, such as API reference and alternative interfaces, please see the
  documentation for Perl::Critic itself.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USAGE_EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#USAGE_EXAMPLES">USAGE
  EXAMPLES</a></h1>
Before getting into all the gory details, here are some basic usage examples to
  help get you started.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Report only most severe violations (severity = 5)
    perlcritic YourModule.pm
    # Same as above, but read input from STDIN
    perlcritic
    # Recursively process all Perl files beneath directory
    perlcritic /some/directory
    # Report slightly less severe violations too (severity &gt;= 4)
    perlcritic -4 YourModule.pm
    # Same as above, but using named severity level
    perlcritic --stern YourModule.pm
    # Report all violations, regardless of severity (severity &gt;= 1)
    perlcritic -1 YourModule.pm
    # Same as above, but using named severity level
    perlcritic --brutal YourModule.pm
    # Report only violations of things from &quot;Perl Best Practices&quot;
    perlcritic --theme pbp YourModule.pm
    # Report top 20 most severe violations (severity &gt;= 1)
    perlcritic --top YourModule.pm
    # Report additional violations of Policies that match m/variables/xms
    perlcritic --include variables YourModule.pm
    # Use defaults from somewhere other than ~/.perlcriticrc
    perlcriticrc --profile project/specific/perlcriticrc YourModule.pm
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ARGUMENTS"><a class="selflink" href="#ARGUMENTS">ARGUMENTS</a></h1>
The arguments are paths to the files you wish to analyze. You may specify
  multiple files. If an argument is a directory, &quot;perlcritic&quot; will
  analyze all Perl files below the directory. If no arguments are specified,
  then input is read from STDIN.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
Option names can be abbreviated to uniqueness and can be stated with singe or
  double dashes, and option values can be separated from the option name by a
  space or '=' (as with Getopt::Long). Option names are also case-sensitive.

      given &quot;--profile&quot;, decreasing the &quot;--severity&quot; will
      usually produce more violations. You can set the default value for this
      option in your <i>.perlcriticrc</i> file. You can also redefine the

  <dd class="It-tag">Directs &quot;perlcritic&quot; to apply only Policies with
      themes that satisfy the &quot;RULE&quot;. Themes are arbitrary names for
      groups of related policies. You can combine theme names with boolean
      operators to create an arbitrarily complex &quot;RULE&quot;. For example,
      the following would apply only Policies that have a 'bugs' AND 'pbp'
      theme:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $&gt; perlcritic --theme='bugs &amp;&amp; pbp' MyModule.pm
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Unless the &quot;--severity&quot; option is explicitly given, setting
      &quot;--theme&quot; silently causes the &quot;--severity&quot; to be set
      to 1. You can set the default value for this option in your
      <i>.perlcriticrc</i> file. See &quot;POLICY THEMES&quot; in Perl::Critic
      for more information about themes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">Directs &quot;perlcritic&quot; to apply additional Policies
      that match the regex &quot;/PATTERN/imx&quot;. Use this option to
      temporarily override your profile and/or the severity settings at the
      command-line. For example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    perlcritic --include=layout my_file.pl
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This would cause &quot;perlcritic&quot; to apply all the
      &quot;CodeLayout::*&quot; policies even if they have a severity level that
      is less than the default level of 5, or have been disabled in your
      <i>.perlcriticrc</i> file. You can specify multiple &quot;--include&quot;
      options and you can use it in conjunction with the &quot;--exclude&quot;
      option. Note that &quot;--exclude&quot; takes precedence over
      &quot;--include&quot; when a Policy matches both patterns. You can set the
      default value for this option in your <i>.perlcriticrc</i> file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&quot;--exclude PATTERN&quot;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Directs &quot;perlcritic&quot; to not apply any Policy that
      matches the regex &quot;/PATTERN/imx&quot;. Use this option to temporarily

      For example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    perlcritic --exclude=strict my_file.pl
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This would cause &quot;perlcritic&quot; to not apply the
      &quot;RequireUseStrict&quot; and &quot;ProhibitNoStrict&quot; Policies
      even though they have the highest severity level. You can specify multiple
      &quot;--exclude&quot; options and you can use it in conjunction with the
      &quot;--include&quot; option. Note that &quot;--exclude&quot; takes
      precedence over &quot;--include&quot; when a Policy matches both patterns.
      You can set the default value for this option in your <i>.perlcriticrc</i>
      file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&quot;--single-policy PATTERN&quot; or &quot;-s
    PATTERN&quot;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Directs &quot;perlcritic&quot; to apply just one Policy
      module matching the regex &quot;/PATTERN/ixms&quot;, and exclude all other
      Policies. This option has precedence over the &quot;--severity&quot;,
      &quot;--theme&quot;, &quot;--include&quot;, &quot;--exclude&quot;, and
      &quot;--only&quot; options. For example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    perlcritic --single-policy=nowarnings my_file.pl
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This would cause &quot;perlcritic&quot; to apply just the
      &quot;ProhibitNoWarnings&quot; Policy, regardless of the severity level
      setting. No other Policies would be applied.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This is equivalent to what one might intend by...
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    perlcritic --exclude=. --include=nowarnings my_file.pl
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    ... but this won't work because the &quot;--exclude&quot; option overrides
      the &quot;--include&quot; option.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The equivalent of this option can be accomplished by creating a custom
      profile containing only the desired policy and then running...
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    perlcritic --profile=customprofile --only my_file.pl
    </pre>

      &quot;N&quot; Policy violations in each file, ranked by their severity. If
      &quot;N&quot; is not specified, it defaults to 20. If the
      &quot;--severity&quot; option (or one of the shortcuts) is not explicitly
      given, the &quot;--top&quot; option implies that the minimum severity
      level is &quot;1&quot; (i.e. &quot;brutal&quot;). Users can redefine the
      severity for any Policy in their <i>.perlcriticrc</i> file. See
      &quot;CONFIGURATION&quot; for more information. You can set the default
      value for this option in your <i>.perlcriticrc</i> file. NOTE: Be careful
      not to put one of the severity shortcut options immediately after the

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
Most of the settings for Perl::Critic and each of the Policy modules can be
  controlled by a configuration file. The default configuration file is called
  <i>.perlcriticrc</i>. &quot;perlcritic&quot; will look for this file in the
  current directory first, and then in your home directory. Alternatively, you
  can set the &quot;PERLCRITIC&quot; environment variable to explicitly point to
  a different file in another location. If none of these files exist, and the
  &quot;--profile&quot; option is not given on the command-line, then all
  Policies will be loaded with their default configuration.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The format of the configuration file is a series of INI-style blocks that
  contain key-value pairs separated by &quot;=&quot;. Comments should start with
  &quot;#&quot; and can be placed on a separate line or after the name-value
  pairs if you desire.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Default settings for perlcritic itself can be set <b>before the first named</b>
  <b>block.</b> For example, putting any or all of these at the top of your
  <i>.perlcriticrc</i> file will set the default value for the corresponding
  command-line argument.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    severity  = 3                                     #Integer or named level
    only      = 1                                     #Zero or One
    force     = 0                                     #Zero or One
    verbose   = 4                                     #Integer or format spec
    top       = 50                                    #A positive integer
    theme     = (pbp + security) * bugs               #A theme expression
    include   = NamingConventions ClassHierarchies    #Space-delimited list
    exclude   = Variables  Modules::RequirePackage    #Space-delimited list
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The remainder of the configuration file is a series of blocks like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    [Perl::Critic::Policy::Category::PolicyName]
    severity = 1
    set_themes = foo bar
    add_themes = baz
    arg1 = value1
    arg2 = value2
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;Perl::Critic::Policy::Category::PolicyName&quot; is the full name of a
  module that implements the policy. The Policy modules distributed with
  Perl::Critic have been grouped into categories according to the table of
  contents in Damian Conway's book <b>Perl Best Practices</b>. For brevity, you
  can omit the 'Perl::Critic::Policy' part of the module name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;severity&quot; is the level of importance you wish to assign to the
  Policy. All Policy modules are defined with a default severity value ranging
  from 1 (least severe) to 5 (most severe). However, you may disagree with the
  default severity and choose to give it a higher or lower severity, based on
  your own coding philosophy. You can set the &quot;severity&quot; to an integer
  from 1 to 5, or use one of the equivalent names:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    SEVERITY NAME ...is equivalent to... SEVERITY NUMBER
    ----------------------------------------------------
    gentle                                             5
    stern                                              4
    harsh                                              3
    cruel                                              2
    brutal                                             1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;set_themes&quot; sets the theme for the Policy and overrides its default
  theme. The argument is a string of one or more whitespace-delimited
  alphanumeric words. Themes are case-insensitive. See &quot;POLICY THEMES&quot;
  for more information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;add_themes&quot; appends to the default themes for this Policy. The
  argument is a string of one or more whitespace-delimited words. Themes are
  case- insensitive. See &quot;POLICY THEMES&quot; for more information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The remaining key-value pairs are configuration parameters that will be passed
  into the constructor of that Policy. The constructors for most Policy modules
  do not support arguments, and those that do should have reasonable defaults.
  See the documentation on the appropriate Policy module for more details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Instead of redefining the severity for a given Policy, you can completely
  disable a Policy by prepending a '-' to the name of the module in your
  configuration file. In this manner, the Policy will never be loaded,
  regardless of the &quot;--severity&quot; given on the command line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A simple configuration might look like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    #--------------------------------------------------------------
    # I think these are really important, so always load them
    [TestingAndDebugging::RequireUseStrict]
    severity = 5
    [TestingAndDebugging::RequireUseWarnings]
    severity = 5
    #--------------------------------------------------------------
    # I think these are less important, so only load when asked
    [Variables::ProhibitPackageVars]
    severity = 2
    [ControlStructures::ProhibitPostfixControls]
    allow = if unless  # My custom configuration
    severity = cruel   # Same as &quot;severity = 2&quot;
    #--------------------------------------------------------------
    # Give these policies a custom theme.  I can activate just
    # these policies by saying &quot;perlcritic --theme 'larry || curly'&quot;
    [Modules::RequireFilenameMatchesPackage]
    add_themes = larry
    [TestingAndDebugging::RequireTestLabels]
    add_themes = curly moe
    #--------------------------------------------------------------
    # I do not agree with these at all, so never load them
    [-NamingConventions::Capitalization]
    [-ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitMagicNumbers]
    #--------------------------------------------------------------
    # For all other Policies, I accept the default severity,
    # so no additional configuration is required for them.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that all policies included with the Perl::Critic distribution that have
  integer parameters accept underscores (&quot;_&quot;) in their values, as with
  Perl numeric literals. For example,
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    [ValuesAndExpressions::RequireNumberSeparators]
    min_value = 1_000
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For additional configuration examples, see the <i>perlcriticrc</i> file that is
  included in this <i>examples</i> directory of this distribution.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Damian Conway's own Perl::Critic configuration is also included in this
  distribution as <i>examples/perlcriticrc-conway</i>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_POLICIES"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_POLICIES">THE
  POLICIES</a></h1>
A large number of Policy modules are distributed with Perl::Critic. They are
  described briefly in the companion document Perl::Critic::PolicySummary and in
  more detail in the individual modules themselves. Say &quot;perlcritic --doc
  PATTERN&quot; to see the perldoc for all Policy modules that match the regex
  &quot;m/PATTERN/ixms&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are a number of distributions of additional policies on CPAN. If
  Perl::Critic doesn't contain a policy that you want, some one may have already
  written it. See &quot;SEE ALSO&quot; in Perl::Critic for a list of some of
  these distributions.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="POLICY_THEMES"><a class="selflink" href="#POLICY_THEMES">POLICY
  THEMES</a></h1>
Each Policy is defined with one or more &quot;themes&quot;. Themes can be used
  to create arbitrary groups of Policies. They are intended to provide an
  alternative mechanism for selecting your preferred set of Policies. For
  example, you may wish disable a certain set of Policies when analyzing test
  programs. Conversely, you may wish to enable only a specific subset of
  Policies when analyzing modules.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Policies that ship with Perl::Critic are have been divided into the
  following themes. This is just our attempt to provide some basic logical
  groupings. You are free to invent new themes that suit your needs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    THEME             DESCRIPTION
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    core              All policies that ship with Perl::Critic
    pbp               Policies that come directly from &quot;Perl Best Practices&quot;
    bugs              Policies that that prevent or reveal bugs
    certrec           Policies that CERT recommends
    certrule          Policies that CERT considers rules
    maintenance       Policies that affect the long-term health of the code
    cosmetic          Policies that only have a superficial effect
    complexity        Policies that specificaly relate to code complexity
    security          Policies that relate to security issues
    tests             Policies that are specific to test programs
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Say &quot;perlcritic --list&quot; to get a listing of all available policies and
  the themes that are associated with each one. You can also change the theme
  for any Policy in your <i>.perlcriticrc</i> file. See the
  &quot;CONFIGURATION&quot; section for more information about that.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Using the &quot;--theme&quot; command-line option, you can create an arbitrarily
  complex rule that determines which Policies to apply. Precedence is the same
  as regular Perl code, and you can use parentheses to enforce precedence as
  well. Supported operators are:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    Operator    Altertative    Example
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    &amp;&amp;          and            'pbp &amp;&amp; core'
    ||          or             'pbp || (bugs &amp;&amp; security)'
    !           not            'pbp &amp;&amp; ! (portability || complexity)'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Theme names are case-insensitive. If the &quot;--theme&quot; is set to an empty
  string, then it evaluates as true all Policies.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BENDING_THE_RULES"><a class="selflink" href="#BENDING_THE_RULES">BENDING
  THE RULES</a></h1>
Perl::Critic takes a hard-line approach to your code: either you comply or you
  don't. In the real world, it is not always practical (or even possible) to
  fully comply with coding standards. In such cases, it is wise to show that you
  are knowingly violating the standards and that you have a Damn Good Reason
  (DGR) for doing so.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To help with those situations, you can direct Perl::Critic to ignore certain
  lines or blocks of code by using annotations:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  require 'LegacyLibaray1.pl';  ## no critic
  require 'LegacyLibrary2.pl';  ## no critic
  for my $element (@list) {
      ## no critic
      $foo = &quot;&quot;;               #Violates 'ProhibitEmptyQuotes'
      $barf = bar() if $foo;   #Violates 'ProhibitPostfixControls'
      #Some more evil code...
      ## use critic
      #Some good code...
      do_something($_);
  }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;## no critic&quot; annotations direct Perl::Critic to ignore the
  remaining lines of code until a &quot;## use critic&quot; annotation is found.
  If the &quot;## no critic&quot; annotation is on the same line as a code
  statement, then only that line of code is overlooked. To direct perlcritic to
  ignore the &quot;## no critic&quot; annotations, use the &quot;--force&quot;
  option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A bare &quot;## no critic&quot; annotation disables all the active Policies. If
  you wish to disable only specific Policies, add a list of Policy names as
  arguments just as you would for the &quot;no strict&quot; or &quot;no
  warnings&quot; pragma. For example, this would disable the
  &quot;ProhibitEmptyQuotes&quot; and &quot;ProhibitPostfixControls&quot;
  policies until the end of the block or until the next &quot;## use
  critic&quot; annotation (whichever comes first):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    ## no critic (EmptyQuotes, PostfixControls);
    # Now exempt from ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitEmptyQuotes
    $foo = &quot;&quot;;
    # Now exempt ControlStructures::ProhibitPostfixControls
    $barf = bar() if $foo;
    # Still subject to ValuesAndExpression::RequireNumberSeparators
    $long_int = 10000000000;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since the Policy names are matched against the &quot;## no critic&quot;
  arguments as regular expressions, you can abbreviate the Policy names or
  disable an entire family of Policies in one shot like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    ## no critic (NamingConventions)
    # Now exempt from NamingConventions::Capitalization
    my $camelHumpVar = 'foo';
    # Now exempt from NamingConventions::Capitalization
    sub camelHumpSub {}
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The argument list must be enclosed in parentheses and must contain one or more
  comma-separated barewords (i.e. don't use quotes). The &quot;## no
  critic&quot; annotations can be nested, and Policies named by an inner
  annotation will be disabled along with those already disabled an outer
  annotation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some Policies like &quot;Subroutines::ProhibitExcessComplexity&quot; apply to an
  entire block of code. In those cases, &quot;## no critic&quot; must appear on
  the line where the violation is reported. For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    sub complicated_function {  ## no critic (ProhibitExcessComplexity)
        # Your code here...
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some Policies like &quot;Documentation::RequirePodSections&quot; apply to the
  entire document, in which case violations are reported at line 1. But if the
  file requires a shebang line, it is impossible to put &quot;## no critic&quot;
  on the first line of the file. This is a known limitation and it will be
  addressed in a future release. As a workaround, you can disable the affected
  policies at the command-line or in your <i>.perlcriticrc</i> file. But beware
  that this will affect the analysis of <b>all</b> files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Use this feature wisely. &quot;## no critic&quot; should be used in the smallest
  possible scope, or only on individual lines of code. And you should always be
  as specific as possible about which policies you want to disable (i.e. never
  use a bare &quot;## no critic&quot;). If Perl::Critic complains about your
  code, try and find a compliant solution before resorting to this feature.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EDITOR_INTEGRATION"><a class="selflink" href="#EDITOR_INTEGRATION">EDITOR
  INTEGRATION</a></h1>
For ease-of-use, &quot;perlcritic&quot; can be integrated with your favorite
  text editor. The output-formatting capabilities of &quot;perlcritic&quot; are
  specifically intended for use with the &quot;grep&quot; or &quot;compile&quot;
  modes available in editors like &quot;emacs&quot; and &quot;vim&quot;. In
  these modes, you can run an arbitrary command and the editor will parse the
  output into an interactive buffer that you can click on and jump to the
  relevant line of code.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Perl::Critic team thanks everyone who has helped integrate Perl-Critic with
  their favorite editor. Your contributions in particular have made Perl- Critic
  a convenient and user-friendly tool for Perl developers of all stripes. We
  sincerely appreciate your hard work.

If &quot;perlcritic&quot; has any errors itself, exits with status == 1. If
  there are no errors, but &quot;perlcritic&quot; finds Policy violations in
  your source code, exits with status == 2. If there were no errors and no
  violations were found, exits with status == 0.

  Perl::Critic PHILOSOPHY</a></h1>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Coding standards are deeply personal and
  highly subjective. The goal of Perl::Critic is to help you write code that
  conforms with a set of best practices. Our primary goal is not to dictate what
  those practices are, but rather, to implement the practices discovered by
  others. Ultimately, you make the rules -- Perl::Critic is merely a tool for
  encouraging consistency. If there is a policy that you think is important or
  that we have overlooked, we would be very grateful for contributions, or you
  can simply load your own private set of policies into Perl::Critic.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXTENDING_THE_CRITIC"><a class="selflink" href="#EXTENDING_THE_CRITIC">EXTENDING
  THE CRITIC</a></h1>
The modular design of Perl::Critic is intended to facilitate the addition of new
  Policies. You'll need to have some understanding of PPI, but most Policy
  modules are pretty straightforward and only require about 20 lines of code.
  Please see the Perl::Critic::DEVELOPER file included in this distribution for
  a step-by-step demonstration of how to create new Policy modules.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you develop any new Policy modules, feel free to send them to
  &quot;&lt;team@perlcritic.com&gt;&quot; and I'll be happy to consider putting
  them into the Perl::Critic distribution. Or if you would like to work on the
  Perl::Critic project directly, you can fork our repository at
  &quot;/github.com/Perl- Critic/Perl- Critic.git&quot; in http:.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Perl::Critic team is also available for hire. If your organization has its
  own coding standards, we can create custom Policies to enforce your local
  guidelines. Or if your code base is prone to a particular defect pattern, we
  can design Policies that will help you catch those costly defects
  <b>before</b> they go into production. To discuss your needs with the
  Perl::Critic team, just contact &quot;&lt;team@perlcritic.com&gt;&quot;.

Scrutinizing Perl code is hard for humans, let alone machines. If you find any
  bugs, particularly false-positives or false-negatives from a
  Perl::Critic::Policy, please submit them at &quot;/github.com/Perl-Critic
  /Perl-Critic/issues&quot; in https:. Thanks.
