<p>PLAINBOX-TRUSTED-LAUNCHER-1(1) Plainbox
PLAINBOX-TRUSTED-LAUNCHER-1(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
plainbox-trusted-launcher-1 - execute job command as another
user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
plainbox-trusted-launcher-1 [-h] (-w | -t CHECKSUM) <br>
[-T NAME=VALUE [NAME=VALUE ...]] [-g CHECKSUM] <br>
[-G NAME=VALUE [NAME=VALUE ...]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Security elevation mechanism for plainbox</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is a part of the
implementation of plainbox. It is not intended to be invoked
directly and the command line arguments and behavior may
freely change between ver&acirc; <br>
sions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Technically this program is used
to run a command associated with a job definition as another
user (typically as root). The existing technologies such as
sudo (8) and pkexec (1) <br>
don&rsquo;t have enough granularity to still restrict
arbitrary commands but allow the commands that are inside
system-wide installed locations (thus safe as one needs root
access to <br>
install those in the first place). One additional
restriction is that some commands are themselves generated
by other jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Execution <br>
Warm-up Mode <br>
If the --warmup option is specified then nothing more
happens and the program exists immediately. This is intended
to &rsquo;warm-up&rsquo; the tool that executes
plainbox-trusted-launcher-1 <br>
itself (typically pkexec or sudo)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normal Execution <br>
In normal execution mode, the launcher looks up the job with
the checksum specified by --target and executes the command
embedded inside. Environment passed via
--target-environ&acirc; <br>
ment is appended to the environment variables inherited from
the parent process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard output, standard error
and exit code of plainbox-trusted-launcher-1 is exactly as
the values from the commands embedded into the selected job
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Indirect Execution <br>
In indirect execution mode, the launcher first looks up the
job with the checksum specified by --generator, executes it,
discarding stderr and re-interpreting stdout as a set of
<br>
job definitions. Environment passed via the
--generator-environment is appended (but just to the
generator job, the --target job has independent
environment). All of the addi&acirc; <br>
tional job definitions are added to the global pool of jobs
the launcher knows about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After that the launcher
continues as with normal execution, returning the same
stdout, stderr and exit code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Optional arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --warmup <br>
return immediately, only useful when used with pkexec(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --target <br>
run a job with this checksum</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --target-environment <br>
environment passed to the target job</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --generator <br>
also run a job with this checksum (assuming it is a local
job)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G, --generator-environment <br>
environment passed to the generator job</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables DO NOT affect
plainbox-trusted-launcher-1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROVIDERPATH <br>
For plainbox this would affect the set of directories where
Plainbox looks for provider definitions. The trusted
launcher has a fixed list of directories that cannot be <br>
extended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fixed list is composed of
two system-wide locations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
/usr/local/share/plainbox-providers-1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
/usr/share/plainbox-providers-1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the other environment
variables mentioned in plainbox work the same way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Currently it is impossible to use
plainbox-trusted-launcher-1 with a local job needs to run as
root, that generates another local job that needs to run as
root, to generate any <br>
additional jobs that also need to run as root. In other
words, only one-level job generation is supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The launcher is somewhat
inefficient, in that it has to re-run all of the
dependencies of the local job over and over. Ideally those
would be cached, per-session, but that would <br>
significantly increase the complexity of the code running as
root.</p>
