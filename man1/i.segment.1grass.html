<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Image segmentation or object recognition is the process of
grouping similar pixels into unique segments, also referred
to as objects. Boundary and region based algorithms are <br>
described in the literature, currently a region growing and
merging algorithm is implemented. Each object found during
the segmentation process is given a unique ID and is a
col&acirc; <br>
lection of contiguous pixels meeting some criteria. Note the
contrast with image classification where all pixels similar
to each other are assigned to the same class and do not <br>
need to be contiguous. The image segmentation results can be
useful on their own, or used as a preprocessing step for
image classification. The segmentation preprocessing step
<br>
can reduce noise and speed up the classification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Region Growing and Merging <br>
This segmentation algorithm sequentially examines all
current segments in the raster map. The similarity between
the current segment and each of its neighbors is calculated
<br>
according to the given distance formula. Segments will be
merged if they meet a number of criteria, including:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 The pair is mutually most
similar to each other (the similarity distance will be
smaller than to any other neighbor), and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 The similarity must be lower
than the input threshold. The process is repeated until no
merges are made during a complete pass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarity and Threshold <br>
The similarity between segments and unmerged objects is used
to determine which objects are merged. Smaller distance
values indicate a closer match, with a similarity score of
<br>
zero for identical pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During normal processing, merges
are only allowed when the similarity between two segments is
lower than the given threshold value. During the final pass,
however, if a minimum <br>
segment size of 2 or larger is given with the minsize
parameter, segments with a smaller pixel count will be
merged with their most similar neighbor even if the
similarity is <br>
greater than the threshold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The threshold must be larger
than 0.0 and smaller than 1.0. A threshold of 0 would allow
only identical valued pixels to be merged, while a threshold
of 1 would allow everything <br>
to be merged. Initial empirical tests indicate threshold
values of 0.01 to 0.05 are reasonable values to start. It is
recommended to start with a low value, e.g. 0.01, and then
<br>
perform hierarchical segmentation by using the output of the
last run as seeds for the next run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Calculation Formulas <br>
Both Euclidean and Manhattan distances use the normal
definition, considering each raster in the image group as a
dimension. In future, the distance calculation will also
take <br>
into account the shape characteristics of the segments. The
normal distances are then multiplied by the input
radiometric weight. Next an additional contribution is
added: <br>
(1-radioweight) * {smoothness * smoothness weight +
compactness * (1-smoothness weight)}, where compactness =
Perimeter Length / sqrt( Area ) and smoothness = Perimeter
Length / <br>
Bounding Box. The perimeter length is estimated as the
number of pixel sides the segment has.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Seeds <br>
The seeds map can be used to provide either seed pixels
(random or selected points from which to start the
segmentation process) or seed segments. If the seeds are the
results of <br>
a previous segmentation with lower threshold, hierarchical
segmentation can be performed. The different approaches are
automatically detected by the program: any pixels that have
<br>
identical seed values and are contiguous will be assigned a
unique segment ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is expected that the minsize
will be set to 1 if a seed map is used, but the program will
allow other values to be used. If both options are used, the
final iteration that <br>
ignores the threshold will also ignore the seed map and
force merges for all pixels (not just segments that have
grown/merged from the seeds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Maximum number of starting
segments <br>
For the region growing algorithm without starting seeds,
each pixel is sequentially numbered. The current limit with
CELL storage is 2 billion starting segment IDs. If the
ini&acirc; <br>
tial map has a larger number of non-null pixels, there are
two workarounds:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Use starting seed pixels.
(Maximum 2 billion pixels can be labeled with positive
integers.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Use starting seed segments.
(By initial classification or other methods.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Boundary Constraints <br>
Boundary constraints limit the adjacency of pixels and
segments. Each unique value present in the bounds raster are
considered as a MASK. Thus no segments in the final
segmen&acirc; <br>
tated map will cross a boundary, even if their spectral data
is very similar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimum Segment Size <br>
To reduce the salt and pepper affect, a minsize greater than
1 will add one additional pass to the processing. During the
final pass, the threshold is ignored for any segments <br>
smaller then the set size, thus forcing very small segments
to merge with their most similar neighbor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Goodness of Fit <br>
The goodness of fit for each pixel is calculated as 1 -
distance of the pixel to the object it belongs to. The
distance is calculated with the selected similarity method.
A value <br>
of 1 means identical values, perfect fit, and a value of 0
means maximum possible distance, worst possible fit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Segmentation of RGB orthophoto <br>
This example uses the ortho photograph included in the NC
Sample Dataset. Set up an imagery group: <br>
i.group group=ortho_group
input=ortho_2001_t792_1m@PERMANENT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the region to a smaller test
region (resolution taken from input ortho photograph). <br>
g.region -p raster=ortho_2001_t792_1m n=220446 s=220075
e=639151 w=638592 <br>
Try out a low threshold and check the results. <br>
i.segment group=ortho_group output=ortho_segs_l1
threshold=0.02</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From a visual inspection, it
seems this results in too many segments. Increasing the
threshold, using the previous results as seeds, and setting
a minimum size of 2: <br>
i.segment group=ortho_group output=ortho_segs_l2
threshold=0.05 seeds=ortho_segs_l1 min=2 <br>
i.segment group=ortho_group output=ortho_segs_l3
threshold=0.1 seeds=ortho_segs_l2 <br>
i.segment group=ortho_group output=ortho_segs_l4
threshold=0.2 seeds=ortho_segs_l3 <br>
i.segment group=ortho_group output=ortho_segs_l5
threshold=0.3 seeds=ortho_segs_l4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output ortho_segs_l4 with
threshold=0.2 still has too many segments, but the output
with threshold=0.3 has too few segments. A threshold value
of 0.25 seems to be a good <br>
choice. There is also some noise in the image, lets next
force all segments smaller than 10 pixels to be merged into
their most similar neighbor (even if they are less similar
<br>
than required by our threshold):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the region to match the
entire map(s) in the group. <br>
g.region -p raster=ortho_2001_t792_1m@PERMANENT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run i.segment on the full map:
<br>
i.segment group=ortho_group output=ortho_segs_final
threshold=0.25 min=10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Processing the entire ortho
image with nearly 10 million pixels took about 450 times
more then for the final run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Segmentation of panchromatic
channel <br>
This example uses the panchromatic channel of the Landsat7
scene included in the North Carolina sample dataset: <br>
# create group with single channel <br>
i.group group=singleband input=lsat7_2002_80 <br>
# set computational region to Landsat7 PAN band <br>
g.region raster=lsat7_2002_80 -p <br>
# perform segmentation with minsize=5 <br>
i.segment group=singleband threshold=0.05 minsize=5
output=lsat7_2002_80_segmented_min5
goodness=lsat7_2002_80_goodness_min5 <br>
# perform segmentation with minsize=100 <br>
i.segment group=singleband threshold=0.05 minsize=100 <br>
output=lsat7_2002_80_segmented_min100
goodness=lsat7_2002_80_goodness_min100</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Original panchromatic channel of
the Landsat7 scene</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Segmented panchromatic channel,
