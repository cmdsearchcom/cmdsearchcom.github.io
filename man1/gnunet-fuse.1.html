<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gnunet-fuse - mount directories shared on gnunet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gnunet-fuse [OPTIONS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gnunet-fuse is a tool to mount directories that have been
published via GNUnet&rsquo;s file-sharing applications. With
gnunet-fuse, directories that have been published on GNUnet
can <br>
be mounted as read-only file systems and the accessed using
normal file operations. In contrast to downloading the
directory recursively via gnunet-download, this has the
advan&acirc; <br>
tage that files are downloaded on-demand. Only those files
(or directories) that you access will be downloaded.
Furthermore, in the case of larger files, only those blocks
that <br>
an application actually reads will be downloaded. Naturally,
operations on the file system will block until the download
has succeeded, which can theoretically mean that they <br>
never terminate and must be aborted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gnunet-fuse will store all
downloaded files in a temporary directory on disk. This
cache will be purged when gnunet-fuse exits normally (which
happens when the file-system is <br>
unmounted). As mounting a file system is a priviledged
operation, gnunet-fuse must be run by root. If root is not
in the &rsquo;gnunet&rsquo; group, access to the shared
directory will <br>
likely fail as the gnunet-service-fs will likely refuse
access to root. This can be solved either by adding root to
the &rsquo;gnunet&rsquo; group, or by disabling the access
control <br>
options for gnunet-service-fs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c FILENAME, --config=FILENAME
<br>
configuration file to use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d ATH, --directory=PATH <br>
PATH specifies the mountpoint that gnunet-fuse should use as
the destination for mounting the file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
print help page</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L LOGLEVEL, --loglevel=LOGLEVEL
<br>
Change the loglevel. Possible values for LOGLEVEL are ERROR,
WARNING, INFO and DEBUG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s URI, --source=URI <br>
URI is the file-sharing URI of the directory that is to be
mounted. It must be either of type CHK or of type LOC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --single-threaded <br>
in this mode, gnunet-fuse will run in &quot;debug&quot; mode
and disable FUSE concurrency (and add some additional
logging). Normally, gnunet-fuse will download multiple files
in <br>
parallel if multiple IO requests are queued with the file
system at the same time. In debug mode, all requests are
processed sequentially. Note that gnunet-fuse will <br>
still fork a helper process to perform the actual
interaction with the GNUnet file-sharing service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
print the version number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
gnunet-fuse currently only supports read-only operations on
the file system. All files will be owned by root and will be
world-readable.</p>
