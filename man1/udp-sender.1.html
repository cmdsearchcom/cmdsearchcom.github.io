<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
&quot;Udp-sender&quot; is used to broadcast a file (for
instance a disk image) to multiple &quot;udp-receivers&quot;
on the local LAN. In order to do this, it uses Ethernet
multicast or broadcast, <br>
so that all receivers profit from the same physical
datastream. Thus, sending to 10 destinations does not take
more time than it would take to send just 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Basic options <br>
--file file <br>
Reads data to be transmitted from file. If this parameter is
not supplied, data to be transmitted is read from stdin
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pipe command <br>
Sends data through pipe before transmitting it. This is
useful for compressing/decompressing it, or for stripping
out unused blocks. The command gets a direct handle on the
<br>
input file or device, and thus may seek inside it, if
needed. &quot;Udpcast&quot; itself also keeps a handle on
the file, which is used for an informal progress display.
The command&rsquo;s <br>
stdout is a pipe to udpcast.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--autostart n <br>
Starts transmission after n retransmissions of hello packet,
without waiting for a key stroke. Useful for unattended
operation, where udp-sender is started from a cron-job <br>
for a broadcast/multicast at a scheduled time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Networking options <br>
The following networking options should be supplied both on
the sender and the receivers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--portbase portbase <br>
Default ports to use for udpcast. Two ports are used:
portbase and portbase+1 . Thus, Portbase must be even.
Default is 9000. The same portbase must be specified for
both <br>
&quot;udp-sender&quot; and &quot;udp-receiver&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--interface interface <br>
Network interface used to send out the data. Default is
&quot;eth0&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ttl time to live <br>
Sets the time-to-live parameter for the multicast packets.
Should theoretically allow to use UDPCast beyond the local
network, but not tested for lack of a multicast router.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mcast-rdv-address address <br>
Uses a non-standard multicast address for the control
(rendez-vous) connection. This address is used by the sender
and receivers to &quot;find&quot; each other. This is not
the address <br>
that is used to transfer the actual data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default
&quot;mcast-rdv-address&quot; is the Ethernet broadcast
address if &quot;ttl&quot; is 1, and 224.0.0.1 otherwise.
This setting should not be used except in very special
situations, <br>
such as when 224.0.0.1 cannot be used for policy
reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following networking options
should be supplied only on the sender:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mcast-data-address address
<br>
Uses the given address for multicasting the data. If not
specified, the program will automatically derive a multicast
address from its own IP (by keeping the last 27 bits of <br>
the IP and then prepending 232).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pointopoint <br>
Point-to-point mode. Only a single receiver is allowed, but
the data will be directly send to this receiver (in unicast
mode), rather than multicast/broadcast all over the <br>
place. If no async mode is chosen, and there happens to be
only one receiver, point-to-point is activated
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nopointopoint <br>
Don&rsquo;t use point-to-point, even if there is only one
single receiver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--full-duplex <br>
Use this option if you use a full-duplex network. T-base-10
or 100 is full duplex if equipped with a switch. Hub based
networks, or T-base-2 networks (coaxial cable) are only <br>
half-duplex and you should not use this option with these
networks, or else you may experience a 10% performance
hit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N.B. On high-latency WAN links,
the full-duplex option can lead to substantial performance
improvements, because it allows udp-sender to send more data
while it is still <br>
waiting for the previous batch to get acknowledged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--half-duplex <br>
Use half duplex mode (needed for Hub based or T-base-2
networks). This is the default behavior in this version of
udpcast.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--broadcast <br>
Use Ethernet broadcast, rather than multicast. Useful if you
have Ethernet cards which don&rsquo;t support multicast.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, &quot;udpcast&quot;
uses multicast. This allows sending the data only to those
receivers that requested it. Ethernet cards of machines
which don&rsquo;t participate in the <br>
transmission automatically block out the packets at the
hardware level. Moreover, network switches are able to
selectively transmit the packets only to those network ports
to <br>
which receivers are connected. Both features thus allow a
much more efficient operation than broadcast. This option
should only be supplied on the sender.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b blocksize <br>
Choses the packet size. Default (and also maximum) is
1456.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unidirectional mode (without
return channel) <br>
The options described below are useful in situations where
no &quot;return channel&quot; is available, or where such a
channel is impractical due to high latency. In an
unidirectional <br>
setup (i.e. without return channel), the sender only sends
data but doesn&rsquo;t expect any reply from the
receiver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unidirectional options must be
used together, or else the transfer will not work correctly.
You may for example use the following command line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;udp-sender --async
--max-bitrate 10m --fec 8x8&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--async <br>
Asynchronous mode. Do not request confirmations from the
receiver. Best used together with forward error correction
and bandwidth limitation, or else the receiver will abort
<br>
the reception as soon as it misses a packet. When the
receiver aborts the reception in such a way, it will print a
list of packets lost in the slice causing the problem. You
<br>
can use this list to tune the forward error correction
parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-bitrate bitrate <br>
Limits bandwidth used by udpcast. Useful in asynchronous
mode, or else the sender may send too fast for the switch
and/or receiver to keep up. Bitrate may be expressed in <br>
bits per second (--bitrate 5000000), kilobits per second
(&quot;--bitrate 5000k&quot;) or megabits per second
(&quot;--bitrate 5m&quot;). This is the raw bitrate,
including packet headers, <br>
forward error correction, retransmissions, etc. Actual
payload bitrate will be lower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fec
interleave&quot;x&quot;redundancy&quot;/&quot;stripesize
<br>
Enables forward error correction. The goal of forward error
correction is to transmit redundant data, in order to make
up for packets lost in transit. Indeed, in <br>
unidirectional mode, the receivers have no way of requesting
retransmission of lost packets, thus the only way to address
packet loss is to include redundant information to <br>
begin with. The algorithm is designed in such a way that if
r redundant packets are transmitted, that those can be used
to compensate for the loss of any r packets in the <br>
same FEC group (stripe).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to increase robustness
of the FEC algorithm against burst packet losses, each slice
is divided in interleave stripes. Each stripe has stripesize
blocks (if not <br>
specified, stripesize is calculated by diving slice-size by
interleave). For each stripe, redundancy FEC packets are
added. Stripes are organized in such a fashion that <br>
consecutive packets belong to different stripes. This way,
we ensure that burst losses affect different stripes, rather
than using all FEC packets of a single stripe. <br>
Example: &quot;--fec 8x8/128&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rate-governor
module.so:key1=value1,key2=value2 <br>
Applies a dynamically loadable rate governor. module.so is
the name of the preloadable module, which is followed by a
number of property assignments (key1=value1). The rate <br>
governor controls the transmission rate according to various
criteria, such as congestion information received from a
routing or encapsulating device. See comments in <br>
&quot;/usr/include/udpcast/rateGovernor.h&quot; and example
in &quot;examples/rateGovernor&quot; for more details</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rexmit-hello-interval timeout
<br>
If set, rebroadcasts the HELLO packet used for initiating
the casting each timeout milliseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is useful together
with asyc mode, because with async mode the receiver
won&rsquo;t send a connection request to the sender (and
hence won&rsquo;t get a connection reply). In <br>
async mode, the receivers get all needed information from
the hello packet instead, and are thus particularly
dependant on the reception of this packet, makeing <br>
retransmission useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is also useful on
networks where packet loss is so high that even with
connection requests, sender and receiver would not find each
other otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--retries-until-drop retries
<br>
How many time to send a REQACK until dropping a receiver.
Lower retrycounts make &quot;udp-sender&quot; faster to
react to crashed receivers, but they also increase the
probability of <br>
false alerts (dropping receivers that are not actually
crashed, but merely slow to respond for whatever reason)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--streaming <br>
Allows receivers to join an ongoing transmission mid
through</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keyboardless mode <br>
The options below help to run a sender in unattended
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--min-receivers n <br>
Automatically start as soon as a minimal number of receivers
have connected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--min-wait t <br>
Even when the necessary amount of receivers do have
connected, still wait until t seconds since first receiver
connection have passed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-wait t <br>
When not enough receivers have connected (but at least one),
start anyways when t seconds since first receiver connection
have pased.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nokbd <br>
Do not read start signal from keyboard, and do not display
any message telling the user to press any key to start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--start-timeout sec <br>
sender aborts at start if it doesn&rsquo;t see a receiver
within this many seconds. Furthermore, transmission of data
needs to start within this delay. Once transmission is <br>
started, the timeout no longer applies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--daemon-mode <br>
Do not exit when done, but instead wait for the next batch
of receivers. If this option is given twice, udp-sender puts
itself into the background, closes its standard file <br>
descriptors, and acts as a real daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pid-file file <br>
Allow to specify a pid file. If given together with
&quot;--daemon-mode&quot;, udp-sender will write its pid
into this file. If given together with &quot;--kill&quot;,
the process with the given <br>
pid will be killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--kill <br>
Shuts down the udp-sender identified by the pid file (which
also must be specified). Kill does not interrupt an ongoing
transmission, but instead waits until it is finished.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;udp-sender -f zozo
--min-receivers 5 --min-wait 20 --max-wait 80&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If one receiver
connects at 18h00.00, and 4 more within the next 5 minutes,
start at 18h00.20. (5 receivers connected, but min-wait not
yet pased)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If one receiver
connects at 18h00.00, and 3 more within the next 5 minutes,
then a last one at 18h00.25, start right after.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If one receiver
connects at 18h00.00, then 3 more within the next 15
minutes, then no one, start at 18h01.20. (not enough
receivers, but we start anyways after max-wait).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logging and statistics options
<br>
The options instruct &quot;udp-sender&quot; to log some
additional statistics to a file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stat-period seconds <br>
Every so much milliseconds, print some statistics to stderr:
how much bytes sent so far log, position in uncompressed
file (if applicable), retransmit count... By default, <br>
this is printed every half second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--print-uncompressed-position
flag <br>
By default, udp-sender only prints the position in
uncompressed file if the 2 following conditions are met:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Input is piped
via a compressor (&quot;-p &quot; option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The primary
input is seekable (file or device)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the
&quot;--print-uncompressed-position&quot;, options, you can
change this behavior:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If flag is 0,
uncompressed position will never be printed, even if above
conditions are met</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If flag is 1,
uncompressed position will always be printed, even if above
conditions are not met</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log file <br>
Logs some stuff into file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-progress <br>
Do not display progress statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bw-period seconds <br>
Every so much seconds, log instantenous bandwidth seen
during that period. Note: this is different from the
bandwidth displayed to stderr of the receiver, which is the
<br>
average since start of transmission.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tuning options (sender) <br>
The following tuning options are all about slice size.
Udpcast groups its data in slices, which are a series of
blocks (UDP packets). These groups are relevant for</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; data
retransmission: after each slice, the server asks the
receivers whether they have received all blocks, and if
needed retransmits what has been missing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; forward error
correction: each slice has its set of data blocks, and
matching FEC blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--min-slice-size size <br>
minimum slice size (expressed in blocks). Default is 16.
When dynamically adjusting slice size (only in non-duplex
mode), never use smaller slices than this. Ignored in <br>
duplex mode (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-slice-size size <br>
maximum slice size (expressed in blocks). Default is 1024.
When dynamically adjusting slice size (only in non-duplex
mode), never use larger slices than this. Ignored in <br>
duplex mode (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default-slice-size size <br>
Slice size used (starting slice size in half-duplex
mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rehello-offset offs <br>
in streaming mode, how many packets before end of slice the
hello packet will be transferred (default 50). Chose larger
values if you notice that receivers are excessively <br>
slow to pick up running transmission</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tuning the forward error
correction <br>
There are three parameters on which to act:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">redundancy <br>
This influences how much extra packets are included per
stripe. The higher this is, the more redundancy there is,
which means that the transmission becomes more robust <br>
against loss. However, CPU time necessary is also
proportional to redundancy (a factor to consider on slow
PC&rsquo;s), and of course, a higher redundancy augments the
amount of <br>
data to be transmitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interleave <br>
This influences among how many stripes the data is divided.
Higher interleave improves robustness against burst loss
(for example, 64 packets in a row...). It doesn&rsquo;t <br>
increase robustness against randomly spread packet loss.
Note: interleave bigger than 8 will force a smaller
stripesize, due to the fact that slicesize is limited to
1024.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stripesize <br>
How many data blocks there are in a stripe. Due to the
algorithm used, this cannot be more than 128. Reducing
stripe size is an indirect way of augmenting (relative) <br>
redundancy, without incurring the CPU penalty of larger
(absolute) redundancy. However, a larger absolute redundancy
is still preferable over a smaller stripesize, because it
<br>
improves robustness against clustered losses. For instance,
if 8/128 is preferable over 4/64, because with 8/128 the 8
FEC packets can be used to compensate for the loss of <br>
any of the 128 data packets, whereas with 4/64, each group
of 4 FEC packets can only be used against its own set of 64
data packets. If for instance the first 8 packets were <br>
lost, they would be recoverable with 8/128, but not with
4/64.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Considering these, change
parameters as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you observe
long stretches of lost packets, increase interleave</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you observe
that transfer is slowed down by CPU saturation, decrease
redundancy and stripesize proportionnally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you observe
big variations in packet loss rate, increase redundancy and
stripesize proportionnally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you just
observe high loss, but not necessarily clustered in any
special way, increase redundancy or decrease stripesize</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Be aware that
network equipment or the receiver may be dropping packets
because of a bandwidth which is too high. Try limiting it
using &quot;max-bitrate&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The receiver may
also be dropping packets because it cannot write the data to
disk fast enough. Use hdparm to optimize disk access on the
receiver. Try playing with the <br>
settings in &quot;/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default&quot; and
&quot;/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max&quot;, i.e. setting them
to a higher value.</p>
