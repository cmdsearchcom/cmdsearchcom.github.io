&quot;Udp-sender&quot; is used to broadcast a file (for instance a disk image)
  to multiple &quot;udp-receivers&quot; on the local LAN. In order to do this,
  it uses Ethernet multicast or broadcast, so that all receivers profit from the
  same physical datastream. Thus, sending to 10 destinations does not take more
  time than it would take to send just 2.

      T-base-2 networks (coaxial cable) are only <b>half-duplex</b> and you
      should not use this option with these networks, or else you may experience
      a 10% performance hit.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    N.B. On high-latency WAN links, the full-duplex option can lead to

    By default, &quot;udpcast&quot; uses multicast. This allows sending the data
      only to those receivers that requested it. Ethernet cards of machines
      which <i>don't</i> participate in the transmission automatically block out
      the packets at the hardware level. Moreover, network switches are able to
      selectively transmit the packets only to those network ports to which
      receivers are connected. Both features thus allow a much more efficient
      operation than broadcast. This option should only be supplied on the

The options described below are useful in situations where no &quot;return
  channel&quot; is available, or where such a channel is impractical due to high
  latency. In an unidirectional setup (i.e. without return channel), the sender
  only sends data but doesn't expect any reply from the receiver.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Unidirectional options must be used together, or else the transfer will not work
  correctly. You may for example use the following command line:
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;udp-sender --async --max-bitrate 10m --fec 8x8&quot;
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--async</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Asynchronous mode. Do not request confirmations from the
      receiver. Best used together with forward error correction and bandwidth
      limitation, or else the receiver will abort the reception as soon as it
      misses a packet. When the receiver aborts the reception in such a way, it
      will print a list of packets lost in the slice causing the problem. You
      can use this list to tune the forward error correction parameters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--max-bitrate <i>bitrate</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Limits bandwidth used by udpcast. Useful in asynchronous
      mode, or else the sender may send too fast for the switch and/or receiver
      to keep up. Bitrate may be expressed in bits per second (--bitrate
      5000000), kilobits per second (&quot;--bitrate 5000k&quot;) or megabits
      per second (&quot;--bitrate 5m&quot;). This is the raw bitrate, including
      packet headers, forward error correction, retransmissions, etc. Actual
      payload bitrate will be lower.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--fec
    <i>interleave</i><i>&quot;x&quot;</i><i>redundancy</i>
    <i>&quot;/&quot;</i><i>stripesize</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Enables forward error correction. The goal of forward error
      correction is to transmit redundant data, in order to make up for packets
      lost in transit. Indeed, in unidirectional mode, the receivers have no way
      of requesting retransmission of lost packets, thus the only way to address
      packet loss is to include redundant information to begin with. The
      algorithm is designed in such a way that if <i>r</i> redundant packets are
      transmitted, that those can be used to compensate for the loss of
      <i>any</i> r packets in the same FEC group (stripe).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In order to increase robustness of the FEC algorithm against burst packet
      losses, each <i>slice</i> is divided in <i>interleave</i> stripes. Each
      stripe has <i>stripesize</i> blocks (if not specified, stripesize is
      calculated by diving <i>slice-size</i> by <i>interleave</i>). For each
      stripe, <i>redundancy</i> FEC packets are added. Stripes are organized in
      such a fashion that consecutive packets belong to different stripes. This
      way, we ensure that burst losses affect different stripes, rather than
      using all FEC packets of a single stripe. Example: &quot;--fec
      8x8/128&quot;</dd>

      <i>module.so</i> is the name of the preloadable module, which is followed
      by a number of property assignments ( <i>key1=value1</i>). The rate
      governor controls the transmission rate according to various criteria,
      such as congestion information received from a routing or encapsulating
      device. See comments in &quot;/usr/include/udpcast/rateGovernor.h&quot;

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This option is useful together with <i>asyc mode</i>, because with async
      mode the receiver won't send a connection request to the sender (and hence
      won't get a connection reply). In <i>async mode</i>, the receivers get all
      needed information from the <i>hello</i> packet instead, and are thus
      particularly dependant on the reception of this packet, makeing
      retransmission useful.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This option is also useful on networks where packet loss is so high that

There are three parameters on which to act:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">redundancy</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This influences how much extra packets are included per
      stripe. The higher this is, the more redundancy there is, which means that
      the transmission becomes more robust against loss. However, CPU time
      necessary is also proportional to redundancy (a factor to consider on slow
      PC's), and of course, a higher redundancy augments the amount of data to
      be transmitted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">interleave</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This influences among how many stripes the data is divided.
      Higher interleave improves robustness against burst loss (for example, 64
      packets in a row...). It doesn't increase robustness against randomly
      spread packet loss. <b>Note</b>: interleave bigger than 8 will force a
      smaller stripesize, due to the fact that slicesize is limited to
    1024.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">stripesize</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">How many data blocks there are in a stripe. Due to the
      algorithm used, this cannot be more than 128. Reducing stripe size is an
      indirect way of augmenting (relative) redundancy, without incurring the
      CPU penalty of larger (absolute) redundancy. However, a larger absolute
      redundancy is still preferable over a smaller stripesize, because it
      improves robustness against clustered losses. For instance, if 8/128 is
      preferable over 4/64, because with 8/128 the 8 FEC packets can be used to
      compensate for the loss of any of the 128 data packets, whereas with 4/64,
      each group of 4 FEC packets can only be used against its own set of 64
      data packets. If for instance the first 8 packets were lost, they would be
      recoverable with 8/128, but not with 4/64.</dd>
