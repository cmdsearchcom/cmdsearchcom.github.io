<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-bisect - Find by binary search the change that
introduced a bug</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git bisect &lt;subcommand&gt; &lt;options&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The command takes various subcommands, and different options
depending on the subcommand:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git bisect help <br>
git bisect start [--no-checkout] [&lt;bad&gt;
[&lt;good&gt;...]] [--] [&lt;paths&gt;...] <br>
git bisect bad [&lt;rev&gt;] <br>
git bisect good [&lt;rev&gt;...] <br>
git bisect skip [(&lt;rev&gt;|&lt;range&gt;)...] <br>
git bisect reset [&lt;commit&gt;] <br>
git bisect visualize <br>
git bisect replay &lt;logfile&gt; <br>
git bisect log <br>
git bisect run &lt;cmd&gt;...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command uses git rev-list
--bisect to help drive the binary search process to find
which change introduced a bug, given an old &quot;good&quot;
commit object name and a later &quot;bad&quot; <br>
commit object name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Getting help <br>
Use &quot;git bisect&quot; to get a short usage description,
and &quot;git bisect help&quot; or &quot;git bisect -h&quot;
to get a long usage description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Basic bisect commands: start,
bad, good <br>
Using the Linux kernel tree as an example, basic use of the
bisect command is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bisect start <br>
$ git bisect bad # Current version is bad <br>
$ git bisect good v2.6.13-rc2 # v2.6.13-rc2 was the last
version <br>
# tested that was good</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you have specified at least
one bad and one good version, the command bisects the
revision tree and outputs something similar to the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bisecting: 675 revisions left to
test after this</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The state in the middle of the
set of revisions is then checked out. You would now compile
that kernel and boot it. If the booted kernel works
correctly, you would then issue the <br>
following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bisect good # this one is
good</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output of this command would
be something similar to the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bisecting: 337 revisions left to
test after this</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You keep repeating this process,
compiling the tree, testing it, and depending on whether it
is good or bad issuing the command &quot;git bisect
good&quot; or &quot;git bisect bad&quot; to ask for <br>
the next bisection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Eventually there will be no more
revisions left to bisect, and you will have been left with
the first bad kernel revision in
&quot;refs/bisect/bad&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bisect reset <br>
After a bisect session, to clean up the bisection state and
return to the original HEAD (i.e., to quit bisecting), issue
the following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bisect reset</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, this will return
your tree to the commit that was checked out before git
bisect start. (A new git bisect start will also do that, as
it cleans up the old bisection <br>
state.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With an optional argument, you
can return to a different commit instead:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bisect reset
&lt;commit&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, git bisect reset
HEAD will leave you on the current bisection commit and
avoid switching commits at all, while git bisect reset
bisect/bad will check out the first <br>
bad revision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bisect visualize <br>
To see the currently remaining suspects in gitk, issue the
following command during the bisection process:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bisect visualize</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">view may also be used as a
synonym for visualize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the DISPLAY environment
variable is not set, git log is used instead. You can also
give command line options such as -p and --stat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bisect view --stat</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bisect log and bisect replay
<br>
After having marked revisions as good or bad, issue the
following command to show what has been done so far:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bisect log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you discover that you made a
mistake in specifying the status of a revision, you can save
the output of this command to a file, edit it to remove the
incorrect entries, and <br>
then issue the following commands to return to a corrected
state:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bisect reset <br>
$ git bisect replay that-file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Avoiding testing a commit <br>
If, in the middle of a bisect session, you know that the
next suggested revision is not a good one to test (e.g. the
change the commit introduces is known not to work in your
<br>
environment and you know it does not have anything to do
with the bug you are chasing), you may want to find a nearby
commit and try that instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bisect good/bad # previous
round was good or bad. <br>
Bisecting: 337 revisions left to test after this <br>
$ git bisect visualize # oops, that is uninteresting. <br>
$ git reset --hard HEAD~3 # try 3 revisions before what <br>
# was suggested</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then compile and test the chosen
revision, and afterwards mark the revision as good or bad in
the usual manner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bisect skip <br>
Instead of choosing by yourself a nearby commit, you can ask
Git to do it for you by issuing the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bisect skip # Current
version cannot be tested</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But Git may eventually be unable
to tell the first bad commit among a bad commit and one or
more skipped commits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can even skip a range of
commits, instead of just one commit, using the
&quot;&lt;commit1&gt;..&lt;commit2&gt;&quot; notation. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bisect skip v2.5..v2.6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tells the bisect process
that no commit after v2.5, up to and including v2.6, should
be tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if you also want to
skip the first commit of the range you would issue the
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bisect skip v2.5
v2.5..v2.6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tells the bisect process
that the commits between v2.5 included and v2.6 included
should be skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cutting down bisection by giving
more parameters to bisect start <br>
You can further cut down the number of trials, if you know
what part of the tree is involved in the problem you are
tracking down, by specifying path parameters when issuing
the <br>
bisect start command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bisect start -- arch/i386
include/asm-i386</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you know beforehand more than
one good commit, you can narrow the bisect space down by
specifying all of the good commits immediately after the bad
commit when issuing the <br>
bisect start command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bisect start v2.6.20-rc6
v2.6.20-rc4 v2.6.20-rc1 -- <br>
# v2.6.20-rc6 is bad <br>
# v2.6.20-rc4 and v2.6.20-rc1 are good</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bisect run <br>
If you have a script that can tell if the current source
code is good or bad, you can bisect by issuing the
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bisect run my_script
arguments</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the script (my_script
in the above example) should exit with code 0 if the current
source code is good, and exit with a code between 1 and 127
(inclusive), except 125, <br>
if the current source code is bad.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other exit code will abort
the bisect process. It should be noted that a program that
terminates via &quot;exit(-1)&quot; leaves $? = 255, (see
the exit(3) manual page), as the value <br>
is chopped with &quot;&amp; 0377&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special exit code 125 should
be used when the current source code cannot be tested. If
the script exits with this code, the current revision will
be skipped (see git bisect <br>
skip above). 125 was chosen as the highest sensible value to
use for this purpose, because 126 and 127 are used by POSIX
shells to signal specific error status (127 is for <br>
command not found, 126 is for command found but not
executable---these details do not matter, as they are normal
errors in the script, as far as &quot;bisect run&quot; is
concerned).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may often find that during a
bisect session you want to have temporary modifications
(e.g. s/#define DEBUG 0/#define DEBUG 1/ in a header file,
or &quot;revision that does not <br>
have this commit needs this patch applied to work around
another problem this bisection is not interested in&quot;)
applied to the revision being tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To cope with such a situation,
after the inner git bisect finds the next revision to test,
the script can apply the patch before compiling, run the
real test, and afterwards <br>
decide if the revision (possibly with the needed patch)
passed the test and then rewind the tree to the pristine
state. Finally the script should exit with the status of the
real <br>
test to let the &quot;git bisect run&quot; command loop
determine the eventual outcome of the bisect session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--no-checkout <br>
Do not checkout the new working tree at each iteration of
the bisection process. Instead just update a special
reference named BISECT_HEAD to make it point to the commit
that <br>
should be tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option may be useful when
the test you would perform in each step does not require a
checked out tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the repository is bare,
--no-checkout is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Automatically bisect a broken build between
v1.2 and HEAD:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bisect start HEAD v1.2 --
# HEAD is bad, v1.2 is good <br>
$ git bisect run make # &quot;make&quot; builds the app <br>
$ git bisect reset # quit the bisect session</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Automatically
bisect a test failure between origin and HEAD:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bisect start HEAD origin
-- # HEAD is bad, origin is good <br>
$ git bisect run make test # &quot;make test&quot; builds
and tests <br>
$ git bisect reset # quit the bisect session</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Automatically
bisect a broken test case:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ cat ~/test.sh <br>
#!/bin/sh <br>
make || exit 125 # this skips broken builds <br>
~/check_test_case.sh # does the test case pass? <br>
$ git bisect start HEAD HEAD~10 -- # culprit is among the
last 10 <br>
$ git bisect run ~/test.sh <br>
$ git bisect reset # quit the bisect session</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here we use a
&quot;test.sh&quot; custom script. In this script, if
&quot;make&quot; fails, we skip the current commit.
&quot;check_test_case.sh&quot; should &quot;exit 0&quot; if
the test case passes, and &quot;exit 1&quot; <br>
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is safer if both
&quot;test.sh&quot; and &quot;check_test_case.sh&quot; are
outside the repository to prevent interactions between the
bisect, make and test processes and the scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Automatically
bisect with temporary modifications (hot-fix):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ cat ~/test.sh <br>
#!/bin/sh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># tweak the working tree by
merging the hot-fix branch <br>
# and then attempt a build <br>
if git merge --no-commit hot-fix &amp;&amp; <br>
make <br>
then <br>
# run project specific test and report its status <br>
~/check_test_case.sh <br>
status=$? <br>
else <br>
# tell the caller this is untestable <br>
status=125 <br>
fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># undo the tweak to allow clean
flipping to the next commit <br>
git reset --hard</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># return control <br>
exit $status</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This applies modifications from
a hot-fix branch before each test run, e.g. in case your
build or test environment changed so that older revisions
may need a fix which newer <br>
ones have already. (Make sure the hot-fix branch is based
off a commit which is contained in all revisions which you
are bisecting, so that the merge does not pull in too <br>
much, or use git cherry-pick instead of git merge.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Automatically
bisect a broken test case:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bisect start HEAD HEAD~10
-- # culprit is among the last 10 <br>
$ git bisect run sh -c &quot;make || exit 125;
~/check_test_case.sh&quot; <br>
$ git bisect reset # quit the bisect session</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This shows that you can do
without a run script if you write the test on a single
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Locate a good
region of the object graph in a damaged repository</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bisect start HEAD
&lt;known-good-commit&gt; [ &lt;boundary-commit&gt; ... ]
--no-checkout <br>
$ git bisect run sh -c &rsquo; <br>
GOOD=$(git for-each-ref &quot;--format=%(objectname)&quot;
refs/bisect/good-*) &amp;&amp; <br>
git rev-list --objects BISECT_HEAD --not $GOOD &gt;tmp.$$
&amp;&amp; <br>
git pack-objects --stdout &gt;/dev/null &lt;tmp.$$ <br>
rc=$? <br>
rm -f tmp.$$ <br>
test $rc = 0&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git bisect reset # quit the
bisect session</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case, when git bisect
run finishes, bisect/bad will refer to a commit that has at
least one parent whose reachable graph is fully traversable
in the sense required by <br>
git pack objects.</p>
