<p>ecasound(1) Multimedia software ecasound(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ecasound - sample editor, multitrack recorder, fx-processor,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ecasound [ general_options ] { [ chain_setup ] [
effect_setup ] [ input_setup ] [ output_setup ] }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ecasound is a software package designed for multitrack audio
processing. It can be used for simple tasks like audio
playback, recording and format conversions, as well as for
<br>
multitrack effect processing, mixing, recording and signal
recycling. Ecasound supports a wide range of audio inputs,
outputs and effect algorithms. Effects and audio objects
<br>
can be combined in various ways, and their parameters can be
controlled by operator objects like oscillators and
MIDI-CCs. A versatile console mode user-interface is
included in <br>
the package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Note! All options except those mentioned in ecasound options
and Global options, can be used in ecasound chainsetup files
(.ecs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ECASOUND OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are parsed and
handled by the ecasound frontend binary and are not passed
to backend library. This means that these options may not
work in other applica&acirc; <br>
tions that use ecasound libraries for their
functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Starts ecasound in
interactive mode. In interactive mode you can control
ecasound with simple commands (&quot;start&quot;,
&quot;stop&quot;, &quot;pause&quot;, etc.). See ecasound-iam
.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Disables ecasound&acirc;s
interactive mode (see &acirc;-c&acirc; and
&acirc;-K&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Print all debug information
to stderr (unbuffered, plain output without ncurses).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s[:]chainsetup-file <br>
Create a new chainsetup from file
&acirc;chainsetup-file&acirc; and add it to the current
session. Chainsetup files commonly have a filename ending to
the &acirc;.ecs&acirc; extension. A chain&acirc; <br>
setup can contain inputs, outputs, chains, effects,
controllers -- i.e. objects one one specific configuration
of audio processing elements. A session, on the other hand,
<br>
is a collection of one or more chainsetups. Only one of the
chainsetups may be connected (i.e. it can be run/processed).
But it is possible to have another chainsetup <br>
select (i.e. can be configured) while other one is current
connteced (i.e. running).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E &quot;cmd1 [[args] ; cmd2
args ; ... ; cmdN]&quot; <br>
Execute a set of Ecasound Interactive mode (EIAM) commands
at launch. These commands are executed immediately after
ecasound is started. If the command line contains suf&acirc;
<br>
ficient options to create a valid chainsetup that will be
executed, the launch commands are executed after the other
command line options are parsed, but before the pro&acirc;
<br>
cessing engine is started. Note that this command is a
feature of the ecasound frontend binary and not supported by
the library backend. This means that other clients may <br>
not support the &acirc;-E&acirc; option, and also that the
launch commands are not saved as part of chainsetup or
session state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--server <br>
Enables the so called NetECI mode, in which ecasound can be
controlled remotely over a socket connection. When
activated, clients can connect to the running ecasound
ses&acirc; <br>
sion, and use interactive mode commands to control and
observe ecasound processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The NetECI protocol is defined
in Ecasound&acirc;s Programmer Guide</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One example client using this
feature is ecamonitor(1). This utility is included in the
Ecasound distribution package (requires a working Python
environment).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning! If the machine running
ecasound, is connected to a public network, be sure to block
ecasound&acirc;s port in your firewall! As there is no
access control implemented <br>
for incoming connections, anyone can otherwise connect,
control and observe your ecasound sessions. This option
replaces &acirc;--daemon&acirc; (deprecated in 2.6.0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--server-tcp-port=NNN <br>
Set the TCP port used by the daemon mode. By default
ecasound will use port number 2868. This option replaces
&acirc;--daemon-port&acirc; (deprecated in 2.6.0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-server <br>
Disable ecasound&acirc;s daemon mode. This is the default.
This option replaces &acirc;--nodaemon&acirc; (deprecated in
2.6.0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--osc-udp-port=NNN <br>
Enables support for Open Source Control (OSC). Ecasound will
listen for incoming OSC messages on UDP port NNN.
Ecasound&acirc;s OSC interface is documented at:
&lt;http://eca&acirc; <br>

sound.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=ecasound/ecasound;a=blob;f=Documentation/ecasound_osc_interface.txt;hb=HEAD&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that OSC support is still
experimental and the interface might change in later
versions of Ecasound.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was added to
ecasound 2.7.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keep-running,-K <br>
Do not exit when processing is finished/stopped. Only
affects non-interactive operating mode (see -c/-C). Option
added to ecasound 2.4.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help,-h <br>
Show this help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print version info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLOBAL OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, -dd, -ddd <br>
Increase the amount of printed debug messages. -d adds some
verbosity, while -ddd results in very detailed output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d:debug_level <br>
Set the debug level mask to &acirc;debug_level&acirc;. This
a bitmasked value with the following classes: errors (1),
info (2), subsystems (4), module_names (8), user_objects
(16), <br>
system_objects 32, functions (64), continuous (128) and
eiam_return_values (256). Default is 271 (1+2+4+8+256). See
sourcode documentation for the ECA_LOGGER class for <br>
more detailed information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R[:]path-to-file <br>
Use ecasound resource file (see ecasoundrc man page)
&acirc;path-to-file&acirc; as the only source of setting
resource value. Specifying this option will disable the
normal policy of <br>
querying both global and user (if exists) resource
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet mode, no output. Same
as -d:0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL CHAINSETUP OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a:chainname1, chainname2, ...
<br>
Selects active signal chains. All inputs and outputs
following this &acirc;-a&acirc; option are assigned to
selected chains (until a new -a option is specified). When
adding effects, <br>
controllers and other chain operators, only one chain can be
selected at a time. If no -a option has been given, chain
&acirc;default&acirc; is used instead when adding objects.
<br>
Chain name &acirc;all&acirc; is also reserved. It will cause
all existing chains to be selected. By giving multiple -a
options, you can control to which chains effects, inputs and
<br>
outputs are assigned to. Look at the EXAMPLES section for
more detailed info about the usage of this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n:name <br>
Sets the name of chainsetup to &acirc;name&acirc;. If not
specified, defaults either to &quot;command-line-setup&quot;
or to the file name from which chainsetup was loaded.
Whitespaces are not <br>
allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Truncate outputs. All output
object are opened in overwrite mode. Any existing files will
be truncated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X Open outputs for updating.
Ecasound opens all outputs - if target format allows it - in
readwrite mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z:feature <br>
Enables &acirc;feature&acirc;. Most features can be disabled
using notation -z:nofeature. &acirc;-z:db,dbsize&acirc;
enables double-buffering for audio objects that support it
(dbsize=0 for <br>
default, otherwise buffer size in sample frames).
&acirc;-z:nodb&acirc; disables double-buffering.
&acirc;-z:intbuf&acirc; and &acirc;-z:nointbuf&acirc;
control whether extra internal buffering is allowed <br>
for realtime devices. Disabling this can reduce latency
times in some situations. With &acirc;-z:xruns&acirc;,
processing will be halted if an under/overrun occurs.
&acirc;-z:multitrack&acirc; <br>
and &acirc;z:nomultitrack&acirc; can be used to force
ecasound to enable or disable multitrack-mode. In rare cases
you may want to explicitly specify the recording offset with
<br>
&acirc;-z:multitrack,offset-in-samples&acirc;. The offset is
the amount of samples skipped when recording from real-time
inputs. &acirc;-z:psr&acirc; enables the
precise-sample-rates mode for <br>
OSS-devices. &acirc;-z:mixmode,sum&acirc; enables mixing
mode where channels are mixed by summing all channels. The
default is &acirc;-z:mixmode,avg&acirc;, in which channels
are mixed by averag&acirc; <br>
ing. Mixmode selection was first added to ecasound 2.4.0.
See ecasoundrc man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHAINSETUP BUFFERING AND
PERFORMANCE OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B:buffering_mode <br>
Selects the default buffering mode. Mode is one of:
&acirc;auto&acirc; (default), &acirc;nonrt&acirc;,
&acirc;rt&acirc;, &acirc;rtlowlatency&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b:buffer_size <br>
Sets the processing engine buffer size in samples. The size
must be an exponent of 2, and it is independent of channel
count (e.g. -b:1024 at 48kHz will result in 21.333ms <br>
buffer length whether input is mono, stereo or 5.1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is an important option as
this defines the length of one processing engine iteration
and affects ecasound behaviour in many ways. If not
explicitly specified, eca&acirc; <br>
sound will try to choose an optimal value based on current
buffering mode (see -B option). For real-time processing,
you can try to set this as low as possible to reduce <br>
the processing delay. Some machines can handle buffer values
as low as 64 and 128. In some circumstances (for instance
when using oscillator envelopes) small buffer sizes <br>
will make envelopes act more smoothly. When not processing
in real-time (all inputs and outputs are normal files),
larger values may help to avoid buffer overruns, lower <br>
CPU usage and/or otherwise improve performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that when any JACK
input/outputs are used, the buffer size setting is
overridden and set to period/buffer size reported by JACK
server (e.g. jackd&acirc;s &acirc;-p&acirc; option). It <br>
is not possible to turn off this behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If not explicitly specified, the
default buffer size is chosen based on current buffering
mode (see -B).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r:sched_priority <br>
Use realtime scheduling policy (SCHED_FIFO). This is
impossible if ecasound doesn&acirc;t have root priviledges.
Beware! This gives better performance, but can cause total
<br>
lock-ups if something goes wrong. The
&acirc;sched_priority&acirc; can be omitted (0=omitted). If
given, this is the static priority to the highest priority
ecasound thread. Other <br>
ecasound threads run with priority
&acirc;sched_priority-1...n&acirc;. Value &acirc;-1&acirc;
can be used to disable raised-priority mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z:feature <br>
Relevant features are -z:db,xxx (-z:nodb) and -z:intbuf
(-z:nointbuf). See section General chainsetup options for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROCESSING CONTROL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t:seconds <br>
Sets processing time in seconds (doesn&acirc;t have to be an
integer value). If processing time isn&acirc;t set, engine
stops when all inputs are finished. This option is
equivalent <br>
to the &acirc;cs-set-length&acirc; EIAM command. A
special-case value of &acirc;-1&acirc; will set the
chainsetup length according to the longest input object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tl Enables looping. When
processing is finished, engine will start again from
beginning. This option is equivalent to the
&acirc;cs-loop&acirc; EIAM command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT/OUTPUT SETUP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See ecasound user&acirc;s guide
for more detailed documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G:mgrtype,optstring <br>
Sets options for audio object manager type
&acirc;mgrtype&acirc;. For available options, see
&quot;OBJECT TYPE SPECIFIC NOTES&quot; below.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f:sample_format,channel,sample-rate,interleaving
<br>
Sets the audio stream parameters for subsequent audio
objects. To set different parameters for different audio
objects, multiple &acirc;-f&acirc; options have to be
specified (note <br>
the ordering, the &acirc;-f&acirc; options should precede
the audio objects for them to have any effect). See
documentation for &acirc;-i&acirc; and &acirc;-o&acirc;
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an audio object is opened
(e.g. a file or sound device is opened, or connection is
made to a sound server), the audio stream parameters are
passed to the object. It <br>
should be noted that not all audio objects allow one to set
any or all of the parameters. For instance when opening
existing audio files, many file formats have a header <br>
describing the file audio parameters. In these cases the
audio file header overrides the parameters passed with
&acirc;-f&acirc; option. Similarly when creating JACK inputs
and out&acirc; <br>
puts, the JACK server mandates the sampling rate and sample
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no &acirc;-f&acirc; option is
specified, or some of the argument fields are left empty
(e.g. &acirc;-f:,2,44100&acirc;), ecasound will use default
values. These default values are defined in <br>
ecasoundrc configuration file. See ecasoundrc(5) manual
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that ecasound opens out
files by default in update mode. Unless option
&acirc;-x&acirc; (overwrite outputs) option is given, audio
parameters of an existing audio file take <br>
preference over the params set with &acirc;-f&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sample format is given as a
formatted string. The first letter is either &quot;u&quot;,
&quot;s&quot; and &quot;f&quot; (unsigned, signed, floating
point). The following number specifies sample size in <br>
bits. If sample is little endian, &quot;_le&quot; is added
to the end. Similarly if big endian, &quot;_be&quot; is
added. If endianness is not specified, host byte-order is
used. Currently <br>
supported formats are &quot;u8&quot; (same as
&quot;8&quot;), &quot;s16_le&quot; (same as &quot;16&quot;),
&quot;s16_be&quot;, &quot;s24_le&quot;, &quot;s24_be&quot;,
&quot;s32_le&quot;, &quot;s32_be&quot;, &quot;f32_le&quot;
and &quot;f32_be&quot;. An empty string &quot;&quot; picks
the <br>
system default sample format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The 4th parameter defines the
channel layout. The available options are &acirc;i&acirc;
(interleaved&acirc; and &acirc;n&acirc; (noninterleaved).
With the noninterleaved setting, ecasound will process <br>
samples one channel at a time, and the blocksize is set with
&acirc;-b&acirc;. The default setting is
&acirc;i&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y:seconds <br>
Sets starting position for last specified input/output. If
you need more flexible control over audio objects, you
should use the .ewf format.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i[:]input-file-or-device[,params]
<br>
Specifies a new input source that is connected to all
selected chains (chains are selected with
&acirc;-a:...&acirc;). Connecting multiple inputs to the
same chain is not possible, <br>
but one input can be connected to multiple chains. Input can
be a a file, device or some other audio object (see below).
If the input is a file, its type is determined <br>
using the file name extension. If the object name contains
any commas, the name must be enclosed in backquotes to avoid
confusing the parser. Currently supported formats <br>
are RIFF WAVE files (.wav), audio-cd tracks (.cdr), ecasound
EWF files (.ewf), RAW audio data (.raw) and MPEG audio files
(.mp2,.mp3). More audio formats are supported via <br>
libaudiofile and libsndfile libraries (see documentation
below). MikMod is also supported (.xm, .mod, .s3m, .it,
etc). MIDI files (.mid) are supported using Timidity++. <br>
Similarly Ogg Vorbis (.ogg) can be read, and written if
ogg123 and vorbize tools are installed; FLAC files (.flac)
with flac command-line tools or using libsndfile; and <br>
AAC files (.aac/.m4a/.mp4) with faad2/faac tools. Supported
realtime devices are OSS audio devices (/dev/dsp*), ALSA
audio and loopback devices and JACK audio subsystem. <br>
If no inputs are specified, the first non-option
(doesn&acirc;t start with &acirc;-&acirc;) command line
argument is considered to be an input.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o[:]output-file-or-device[,params]
<br>
Works in the same way as the -i option. If no outputs are
specified, the default output device is used (see
~/.ecasoundrc). If the object name contains any commas, the
<br>
name must be enclosed in backquotes to avoid confusing the
parser. Note, many object types do not support output (e.g.
MikMod, MIDI and many others).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OBJECT TYPE SPECIFIC NOTES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALSA devices -
&acirc;alsa&acirc; <br>
When using ALSA drivers, instead of a device filename, you
need to use the following option syntax:
-i[:]alsa,pcm_device_name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALSA direct-hw and plugin access
- &acirc;alsahw&acirc;, &acirc;alsaplugin&acirc; <br>
It&acirc;s also possible to use a specific card and device
combination using the following notation:
-i[:]alsahw,card_number,device_number,subdevice_number.
Another option is <br>
the ALSA PCM plugin layer. It works just like the normal
ALSA pcm-devices, but with automatic channel count and
sample format conversions. Option syntax is
-i[:]alsaplu&acirc; <br>
gin,card_number,device_number,subdevice_number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aRts input/output -
&acirc;arts&acirc; <br>
If enabled at compile-time, ecasound supports audio input
and output using aRts audio server. Option syntax is
-i:arts, -o:arts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Audio file sequencing -
&acirc;audioloop&acirc;, &acirc;select&acirc;,
&acirc;playat&acirc; <br>
Ecasound provides a set of special audio object types that
can be used for temporal sequencing of audio files - i.e.
looping, playing only a select portion of a file, <br>
playing file at a spefific time, and other such
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Looping is possible with
-i:audioloop,file.ext,params. The file name (or any object
type understood by Ecasound) given as the second parameter
is played back continuously <br>
looping back to the beginning when the end of file is
reached. Any additional parameters given are passed
unaltered to the file object. Parameters 3...N are passed as
is <br>
to the child object (i.e. &quot;-i
audioloop,foo.wav,bar1,bar2&quot; will pass parameters
&quot;bar1,bar2&quot; to the &quot;foo.wav&quot; object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To select and use only a
specific segment of an audio object, the
-i:select,start-time,duration,file.ext,params can be used.
This will play &quot;duration&quot; of &quot;file.ext&quot;,
<br>
starting at &quot;start-time&quot;. The time values should
be given as seconds (e.g. &quot;2.25&quot;, or as samples
(e.g. &quot;25000sa&quot;). Parameters 4...N are passed as
is to the child object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To play an audio object at a
given moment in time, the
-i:playat,play-at-time,file.ext,params can be used. This
will play &quot;file.ext&quot; after position reaches
&quot;play-at-time&quot;. <br>
The time values should be given as seconds (e.g.
&quot;2.25&quot;, or as samples (e.g. &quot;25000sa&quot;).
Parameters 2...N are passed as is to the child object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ecasound Wave Files (EWF) -
&acirc;*.ewf&acirc; <br>
A special file format that allows one to slice and loop full
(or segments) of audio files. This format is specific to
Ecasound. See ecasound user&acirc;s guide for more <br>
detailed information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also audio object types
&acirc;audioloop&acirc;, &acirc;select&acirc; and
&acirc;playat&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JACK input/outputs - Overview
<br>
JACK is a low-latency audio server that can be used to
connect multiple independent audio application to each
other. It is different from other audio server efforts in
<br>
that it has been designed from the ground up to be suitable
for low-latency professional audio work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JACK input/outputs -
&acirc;jack&acirc; <br>
Ecasound provides multiple ways to communicate with JACK
servers. To create a JACK input or output object, one should
use -i jack and -o jack. These create JACK client <br>
ports &quot;ecasound:in_N&quot; and
&quot;ecasound:out_n&quot; respectively (&acirc;N&acirc; is
replaced by the channel number). Ecasound automatically
creates one JACK port for each channel (number of <br>
channels is set with -f:bits,channels,rate option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important to note that by
default JACK ports are not connected anywhere (e.g. to
soundcard input/outputs, or to other apps). One thus has to
connect the ports with <br>
an external program (e.g. &quot;QJackCtl&quot; or
&quot;jack_connect&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JACK input/outputs -
&acirc;jack,clientname,portprefix&acirc; <br>
&quot;jack,clientname&quot; For simple use scanerios,
ecasound provides a way to autoconnect the ecasound ports.
This can be done with by giving the peer client name as the
second <br>
parameter to the &quot;jack&quot; object, e.g. -o
jack,clientname. As an example, -o jack,system will create
an output that is automatically connected to outputs of the
default <br>
system soundcard. The client parameter can be omitted, in
which case no automatic connections are made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one needs to change the port
prefix (e.g. &quot;in&quot; in client name
&quot;ecasound:in_N&quot;), the prefix can be specified as
the third parameter to &quot;jack&quot; object, e.g. -o <br>
jack,,fxout. Also the third parameter can be omitted, in
which case the default prefixes &quot;in&quot; and
&quot;out&quot; are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JACK input/outputs -
&acirc;jack_multi&acirc; <br>
A variant of &acirc;jack&acirc; object type is
&acirc;jack_multi&acirc;. The full object syntax is
jack_multi,destport1,...,destportN. When a
&acirc;jack_multi&acirc; object is connected to a JACK
server, <br>
first channel of the object is connected to JACK port
&acirc;destport1&acirc;, second to &acirc;destport2&acirc;
and so forth. For instance &quot;-f:32,2,44100 -o
jack_multi,foo:in,bar:in&quot; creates a <br>
stereo ecasound output object, with its left and right
channels routed to two difference JACK clients. The
destination ports must be active when the ecasound engine is
<br>
launched, or otherwise the connections cannot be
established. If destination ports are not specified for all
channels, or zero length strings are given, those ports are
<br>
not connected at launch by ecasound.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JACK input/outputs -
&acirc;jack_alsa&acirc;, &acirc;jack_auto&acirc;,
&acirc;jack_generic&acirc; (**deprecated since 2.6.0**) <br>
Ecasound 2.5 and older supported &quot;jack_alsa&quot;,
&quot;jack_auto&quot; and &quot;jack_generic&quot; object
types, but these are now replaced by a more generic
&quot;jack&quot; interface, and thus are now <br>
deprecated (they work but are no longer documented).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JACK input/outputs - client
options <br>
Additionally global JACK options can be set using
-G:jack,client_name,operation_mode option.
&acirc;client_name&acirc; is the name used when registering
ecasound to the JACK system. <br>
If &acirc;operation_mode&acirc; is &quot;notransport&quot;,
ecasound will ignore any transport state changes in the
JACK-system; in mode &quot;send&quot; it will send all
start, stop and position-change <br>
events to other JACK clients; in mode &quot;recv&quot;
ecasound will follow JACK start, stop and position-change
events; and mode &quot;sendrecv&quot; which is a combination
of the two previ&acirc; <br>
ous modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If not explicitly set, in
interactive mode (&acirc;-c&acirc; option), the default mode
is &quot;sendrecv&quot;, while in batchmode default is
&quot;notransport&quot;. In both cases the mode can be <br>
changed with -G option as described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More details about
ecasound&acirc;s JACK support can be found from Ecasound
User&acirc;s Guide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Libaudiofile -
&acirc;audiofile&acirc; <br>
If libaudiofile support was enabled at compile-time, this
option allows you to force Ecasound to use libaudiofile for
reading/writing a certain audio file. Option syntax <br>
is -i:audiofile,foobar.ext (same for -o).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Libsndfile -
&acirc;sndfile&acirc; <br>
If libsndfile support was enabled at compile-time, this
option allows you to force Ecasound to use libsndfile for
reading/writing a certain audio file. Option syntax is <br>
-i:sndfile,foobar.ext[,.format-ext] (same for -o). The
optional third parameter &quot;format&quot; can be used to
override the audio format (for example you can create an
AIFF file <br>
with filename &quot;foo.wav&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Loop device - &acirc;loop&acirc;
<br>
Loop devices make it possible to route (loop back) data
between chains. Option syntax is -[io][:]loop,tag. If you
add a loop output with tag &acirc;1&acirc;, all data written
to this <br>
output is routed to any loop input with tag &acirc;1&acirc;.
The tag can be either numerical (e.g.
&acirc;-i:loop,1&acirc;) or a string (e.g.
&quot;-i:loop,vocals&quot;). Like with other input/output
<br>
objects, you can attach the same loop device to multiple
chains and this way split/mix the signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: this &acirc;loop&acirc;
device is different from &acirc;audioloop&acirc; (latter
added to ecasound v2.5.0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mikmod - &acirc;mikmod&acirc;
<br>
If mikmod support was enabled at compile-time, this option
allows you to force Ecasound to use Mikmod for
reading/writing a certain module file. Option syntax is
-i:mik&acirc; <br>
mod,foobar.ext.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Null inputs/outputs -
&acirc;null&acirc; <br>
If you specify &quot;null&quot; or &quot;/dev/null&quot; as
the input or output, a null audio device is created. This is
useful if you just want to analyze sample data without
writing it to a <br>
file. There&acirc;s also a realtime variant,
&quot;rtnull&quot;, which behaves just like &quot;null&quot;
objects, except all i/o is done at realtime speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resample -
&acirc;resample&acirc; <br>
Object type &acirc;resample&acirc; can be used to resample
audio object&acirc;s audio data to match the sampling rate
used in the active chainsetup. For example, ecasound
-f:16,2,44100 -i <br>
resample,22050,foo.wav -o /dev/dsp, will resample file from
22.05kHz to 44.1kHz and write the result to the soundcard
device. Child sampling rate can be replaced with key&acirc;
<br>
word &acirc;auto&acirc;. In this case ecasound will try to
query the child object for its sampling rate. This works
with files formats such as .wav which store meta information
about <br>
the audio file format. To use &acirc;auto&acirc; in the
previous example, ecasound -f:16,2,44100 -i
resample,auto,foo.wav -o /dev/dsp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parameters 4...N are passed as
is to the child object (i.e. &quot;-i
resample,22050,foo.wav,bar1,bar2&quot; will pass parameters
&quot;bar1,bar2&quot; to the &quot;foo.wav&quot; object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If ecasound was compiled with
support for libsamplerate, you can use
&acirc;resample-hq&acirc; to use the highest quality
resampling algorithm available. To force ecasound to use the
<br>
internal resampler, &acirc;resampler-lq&acirc; (low-quality)
can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reverse - &acirc;reverse&acirc;
<br>
Object type &acirc;reverse&acirc; can be used to reverse
audio data coming from an audio object. As an example,
ecasound -i reverse,foo.wav -o /dev/dsp will play
&acirc;foo.wav&acirc; backwards. <br>
Reversing output objects is not supported. Note! Trying to
reverse audio object types with really slow seek operation
(like mp3), works extremely badly. Try converting to <br>
an uncompressed format (wav or raw) first, and then do
reversation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parameters 3...N are passed as
is to the child object (i.e. &quot;-i
reverse,foo.wav,bar1,bar2&quot; will pass parameters
&quot;bar1,bar2&quot; to the &quot;foo.wav&quot; object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">System standard streams and
named pipes - &acirc;stdin&acirc;, &acirc;stdout&acirc; <br>
You can use standard streams (stdin and stdout) by giving
stdin or stdout as the file name. Audio data is assumed to
be in raw/headerless (.raw) format. If you want to use <br>
named pipes, create them with the proper file name extension
before use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tone generator -
&acirc;tone&acirc; <br>
To generate a test tone, input
-i:tone,type,freq,duration-secs can be used. Parameter
&acirc;type&acirc; specifies the tone type: currently only
&acirc;sine&acirc; is supported. The &acirc;freq&acirc;
param&acirc; <br>
eter sets the frequency of the generated tone and
&acirc;duration-secs&acirc; the length of the generated
stream. Specifying zero, or a negative value, as the
duration will produce an <br>
infinite stream. This feature was first added to Ecasound
2.4.7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typeselect -
&acirc;typeselect&acirc; <br>
The special &acirc;typeselect&acirc; object type can be used
to override how ecasound maps filename extensions and object
types. For instance ecasound -i typese&acirc; <br>
lect,.mp3,an_mp3_file.wav -o /dev/dsp. would play the file
&acirc;an_mp3_file.wav&acirc; as an mp3-file and not as an
wav-file as would happen without typeselect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parameters 4...N are passed as
is to the child object (i.e. &quot;-i
typeselect,.au,foo.wav,bar1,bar2&quot; will pass parameters
&quot;bar1,bar2&quot; to the &quot;foo.wav&quot; object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIDI SETUP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIDI I/O devices - general <br>
If no MIDI-device is specified, the default MIDI-device is
used (see ecasoundrc(5)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Md:rawmidi,device_name <br>
Add a rawmidi MIDI I/O device to the setup.
&acirc;device_name&acirc; can be anything that can be
accessed using the normal UNIX file operations and produces
raw MIDI bytes. Valid <br>
devices are for example OSS rawmidi devices (/dev/midi00),
ALSA rawmidi devices (/dev/snd/midiC2D0), named pipes (see
mkfifo man page), and normal files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Md:alsaseq,sequencer-port <br>
Adds a ALSA MIDI sequencer port to the setup.
&acirc;sequencer-port&acirc; identifies a port to connect
to. It can be numerical (e.g. 128:1), or a client name (e.g.
&quot;KMidimon&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Mms:device_id <br>
Sends MMC start (&quot;Deferred Play&quot;) and stop
(&quot;Stop&quot;) with device ID
&acirc;device_id&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While Ecasound does not directly
support syncing transport state to incoming MMC messages,
this can be achieved by connecting Ecasound to JACK
input/outputs, and using a <br>
tool such as JackMMC and JackCtlMMC ( see
&lt;http://jackctlmmc.sourceforge.net/&gt;) to convert MMC
messages into JACK transport change events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Mss Sends MIDI-sync (i.e.
&quot;MIDI Start&quot; and &quot;MIDI Stop&quot; system
realtime messages) .to the selected MIDI-device. Notice that
as Ecasound will not send MIDI-clock, but only the <br>
start and stop messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EFFECT SETUP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRESETS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ecasound has a powerful effect
preset system that allows you create new effects by
combining basic effects and controllers. See ecasound
user&acirc;s guide for more detailed informa&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pf:preset_file.eep <br>
Uses the first preset found from file
&acirc;preset_file.eep&acirc; as a chain operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pn:preset_name <br>
Find preset &acirc;preset_name&acirc; from global preset
database and use it as a chain operator. See ecasoundrc man
page for info about the preset database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNAL ANALYSIS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ev Analyzes sample data to find
out how much the signal can be amplified without clipping.
The resulting percent value can be used as a parameter to
&acirc;-ea&acirc; (amplify). A sta&acirc; <br>
tistical summary, containing info about the stereo-image and
distribution of sample values, is printed out at the end of
processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-evp Peak amplitude watcher.
Maintains peak information for each processed channels. Peak
information is resetted on every read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ezf Finds the optimal value for
DC-adjusting. You can use the result as a parameter to -ezx
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL SIGNAL PROCESSING
ALGORITHMS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-eS:stamp-id <br>
Audio stamp. Takes a snapshot of passing audio data and
stores it using id &acirc;stamp-id&acirc; (integer number).
This data can later be used by controllers and other
operators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ea:amplify% <br>
Adjusts the signal amplitude to &acirc;amplify%&acirc;
percent (linear scale, i.e. individual samples are
multiplied by &acirc;amplify%/100&acirc;). See also
&acirc;-eadb&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-eac:amplify%,channel <br>
Amplifies signal of channel &acirc;channel&acirc; by
amplify-% percent (linear scale, i.e. individual samples are
multiplied by &acirc;amplify%/100&acirc;).
&acirc;channel&acirc; ranges from 1...n where n <br>
is the total number of channels. See also
&acirc;-eadb&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-eadb:gain-dB[,channel] <br>
Adjusts signal level by &acirc;gain-dB&acirc;, with a gain
of 0dB having no effect to the signal, negative gains
attenuating the signal and positive gain values amplifying
it. The <br>
&acirc;channel&acirc; parameter (1...n) is optional. If
&acirc;channel&acirc; parameter is specified, and its value
is nonzero, gain is only applied to the given channel
(1...n).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-eaw:amplify%,max-clipped-samples
<br>
Amplifies signal by amplify-% percent (linear scale, i.e.
individual samples are multiplied by
&acirc;amplify%/100&acirc;). If number of consecutive
clipped samples (resulting sample <br>
value is outside the nominal [-1,1] range), a warning will
be issued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-eal:limit-% <br>
Limiter effect. Limits audio level to &acirc;limit-%&acirc;
(linear scale) with values equal or greater than 100%
resulting in no change to the signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ec:rate,threshold-% <br>
Compressor (a simple one). &acirc;rate&acirc; is the
compression rate in decibels (&acirc;rate&acirc; dB change
in input signal causes 1dB change in output).
&acirc;threshold&acirc; varies between 0.0 <br>
(silence) and 1.0 (max amplitude).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-eca:peak-level-%,
release-time-sec, fast-crate, crate <br>
A more advanced compressor (original algorithm by John S.
Dyson). If you give a value of 0 to any parameter, the
default is used. &acirc;peak-level-%&acirc; essentially
specifies <br>
how hard the peak limiter is pushed. The default of 69% is
good. &acirc;release_time&acirc; is given in seconds. This
compressor is very sophisticated, and actually the release
time <br>
is complex. This is one of the dominant release time
controls, but the actual release time is dependent on a lot
of factors regarding the dynamics of the audio in.
&acirc;fas&acirc; <br>
trate&acirc; is the compression ratio for the fast
compressor. This is not really the compression ratio. Value
of 1.0 is infinity to one, while the default 0.50 is 2:1.
<br>
Another really good value is special cased in the code: 0.25
is somewhat less than 2:1, and sounds super smooth.
&acirc;rate&acirc; is the compression ratio for the entire
compressor <br>
chain. The default is 1.0, and holds the volume very
constant without many nasty side effects. However the
dynamics in music are severely restricted, and a value of
0.5 <br>
might keep the music more intact.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-enm:threshold-level-%,pre-hold-time-msec,attack-time-msec,post-hold-time-msec,release-time-msec
<br>
Noise gate. Supports multichannel processing (each channel
processed separately). When signal amplitude falls below
&acirc;threshold_level_%&acirc; percent (100% means maximum
ampli&acirc; <br>
tude), gate is activated. If the signal stays below the
threshold for &acirc;th_time&acirc; ms, it&acirc;s faded out
during the attack phase of &acirc;attack&acirc; ms. If the
signal raises above the <br>
&acirc;threshold_level&acirc; and stays there over
&acirc;hold&acirc; ms the gate is released during
&acirc;release&acirc; ms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ei:pitch-shift-% <br>
Pitch shifter. Modifies audio pitch by altering its
length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-epp:right-% <br>
Stereo panner. Changes the relative balance between the
first two channels. When &acirc;right-%&acirc; is 0, only
signal on the left (1st) channel is passed through.
Similarly if it <br>
is &acirc;100&acirc;, only right (2nd) channel is let
through.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ezx:channel-count,delta-ch1,...,delta-chN
<br>
Adjusts the signal DC by &acirc;delta-chX&acirc;, where X is
the channel number. Use -ezf to find the optimal delta
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVELOPE MODULATION</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-eemb:bpm,on-time-% <br>
Pulse gate (pulse frequency given as beats-per-minute).</p>

Pulse gate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-eemt:bpm,depth-% <br>
Tremolo effect (tremolo speed given as
beats-per-minute).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILTER EFFECTS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ef1:center_freq, width <br>
Resonant bandpass filter. &acirc;center_freq&acirc; is the
center frequency. Width is specified in Hz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ef3:cutoff_freq, reso, gain
<br>
Resonant lowpass filter. &acirc;cutoffr_freq&acirc; is the
filter cutoff frequency. &acirc;reso&acirc; means resonance.
Usually the best values for resonance are between 1.0 and
2.0, but you can <br>
use even bigger values. &acirc;gain&acirc; is the overall
gain-factor. It&acirc;s a simple multiplier (1.0 is the
normal level). With high resonance values it often is useful
to reduce the <br>
gain value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ef4:cutoff, resonance <br>
Resonant lowpass filter (3rd-order, 36dB, original algorithm
by Stefan M. Fendt). Simulates an analog active RC-lowpass
design. Cutoff is a value between [0,1], while res&acirc;
<br>
onance is between [0,infinity).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-efa:delay-samples,feedback-%
<br>
Allpass filter. Passes all frequencies with no change in
amplitude. However, at the same time it imposes a
frequency-dependent phase-shift.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-efc:delay-samples,radius <br>
Comb filter. Allows the spikes of the comb to pass through.
Value of &acirc;radius&acirc; should be between [0,
1.0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-efb:center-freq,width <br>
Bandpass filter. &acirc;center_freq&acirc; is the center
frequency. Width is specified in Hz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-efh:cutoff-freq <br>
Highpass filter. Only frequencies above
&acirc;cutoff_freq&acirc; are passed through.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-efi:delay-samples,radius <br>
Inverse comb filter. Filters out the spikes of the comb.
There are &acirc;delay_in_samples-2&acirc; spikes. Value of
&acirc;radius&acirc; should be between [0, 1.0). The closer
it is to the maxi&acirc; <br>
mum value, the deeper the dips of the comb are.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-efl:cutoff-freq <br>
Lowpass filter. Only frequencies below
&acirc;cutoff_freq&acirc; are passed through.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-efr:center-freq,width <br>
Bandreject filter. &acirc;center_freq&acirc; is the center
frequency. Width is specified in Hz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-efs:center-freq,width <br>
Resonator. &acirc;center_freq&acirc; is the center
frequency. Width is specified in Hz. Basically just another
resonating bandpass filter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHANNEL MIXING / ROUTING</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-chcopy:from-channel, to-channel
<br>
Copy channel &acirc;from_channel&acirc; to
&acirc;to_channel&acirc;. If &acirc;to_channel&acirc;
doesn&acirc;t exist, it is created. Channel indexing starts
from 1. Option added to ecasound 2.4.5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-chmove:from-channel, to-channel
<br>
Copy channel &acirc;from_channel&acirc; to
&acirc;to_channel&acirc;, and mutes the source channel
&acirc;from_channel&acirc;. Channel indexing starts from 1.
Option added to ecasound 2.4.5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-chorder:ch1,...,chN <br>
Reorder, omit and/r duplicate chain channels. The resulting
audio stream has total of &acirc;N&acirc; channels. Each
parameter specifies the source channel to use for given
output <br>
channel. As an example, &acirc;-chorder:2,1&acirc; would
reverse the channels of a stereo stream
(&acirc;out1,out2&acirc; = &acirc;in2,in1&acirc;).
Specifying the same source channel multiple times is <br>
allowed. For example, &acirc;-chorder:2,2&acirc; would route
the second channel to both two output channels
(&acirc;out1,out2&acirc; = &acirc;in2,in2&acirc;). If
&acirc;chX&acirc; is zero, the given channel &acirc;X&acirc;
will be <br>
muted in the output stream. Option added to ecasound
2.7.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-chmix:to-channel <br>
Mix all source channels to channel &acirc;to_channel&acirc;.
If &acirc;to_channel&acirc; doesn&acirc;t exist, it is
created. Channel indexing starts from 1. Option added to
ecasound 2.4.5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-chmute:channel <br>

<br>
Chorus.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-etd:delay-time-msec,surround-mode,number-of-delays,mix-%,feedback-%
<br>
Delay effect. &acirc;delay time&acirc; is the delay time in
milliseconds. &acirc;surround-mode&acirc; is a integer with
following meanings: 0 = normal, 1 = surround, 2 =
stereo-spread. &acirc;num&acirc; <br>
ber_of_delays&acirc; should be obvious. Beware that large
number of delays and huge delay times need a lot of CPU
power. &acirc;mix-%&acirc; expresses the mix balance between
the original <br>
and delayed signal, with 0 meaning no delayed signal, 100
meaning no original signal, and 50 (the default) achieving
an equal balance. &acirc;feedback-%&acirc; represents how
much of <br>
the signal is recycled in each delay or, if you prefer, at
what rate the repeated snippet of delayed audio fades. Note
that sufficiently low feedback values may result in <br>
a number of audible repetitions lesser than what you have
specified for &acirc;number_of_delays&acirc;, especially if
you have set a low value for &acirc;mix-%&acirc;. By default
the value for <br>
this parameter is 100% (No signal loss.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ete:room_size,feedback-%,wet-%
<br>
A more advanced reverb effect (original algorithm by Stefan
M. Fendt). &acirc;room_size&acirc; is given in meters,
&acirc;feedback-%&acirc; is the feedback level given in
percents and &acirc;wet-%&acirc; is <br>
the amount of reverbed signal added to the original
signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-etf:delay-time-msec <br>
Fake-stereo effect. The input signal is summed to mono. The
original signal goes to the left channels while a delayed
version (with delay of &acirc;delay time&acirc;
milliseconds) is <br>
goes to the right. With a delay time of 1-40 milliseconds
this adds a stereo-feel to mono-signals.</p>

&acirc;start-time&acirc; seconds has elapsed, gate opens and
remains open for &acirc;len&acirc; seconds. When closed,
passing audio buffers are <br>
trucated to zero length.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ge:open-threshold-%,close-thold-%,volume-mode,reopen-count
<br>
Threshold gate. Initially gate is closed. It is opened when
volume goes over &acirc;othreshold&acirc; percent. After
this, if volume drops below &acirc;cthold&acirc; percent,
gate is closed and <br>
won&acirc;t be opened again, unless the
&acirc;reopen-count&acirc; is set to anything other than
zero. If &acirc;value_mode&acirc; is &acirc;rms&acirc;,
average RMS volume is used. Otherwise peak average is used.
<br>
When closed, passing audio buffers are trucated to zero
length. If the &acirc;reopen-count&acirc; is set to a
positive number, then the gate will restart its operation
that many <br>
times. So for example, a reopen count of 1 will cause up to
2 openings of the gate. A negative value for
&acirc;reopen-count&acirc; will result in the gate reopening
indefinitely. The <br>
&acirc;reopen-count&acirc; is invaluable in recording vinyl
and tapes, where you can set things up and then recording
starts whenever the needle is on the vinyl, and stops when
it&acirc;s <br>
off. As many sides as you like can be recorded in one
session. You will need to experiment with buffer lengths and
start/stop levels to get reliable settings for your <br>
equipment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gm:state <br>
Manual gate. If &acirc;state&acirc; is 1, gate is open and
all samples are passed through. If &acirc;state&acirc; is
zero, gate is closed an no samples are let through. This
chain operator is <br>
useful when writing to an output needs to be stopped
dynamically (without stopping the whole engine).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTROL ENVELOPE SETUP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controllers can be used to
dynamically change effect parameters during processing. All
controllers are attached to the selected (=usually the last
specified effect/con&acirc; <br>
troller) effect. The first three parameters are common for
all controllers. &acirc;fx_param&acirc; specifies the
parameter to be controlled. Value &acirc;1&acirc; means the
first parameter, &acirc;2&acirc; <br>
the second and so on. &acirc;start_value&acirc; and
&acirc;end_value&acirc; set the value range. For examples,
look at the the EXAMPLES section.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kos:fx-param,start-value,end-value,freq,i-phase
<br>
Sine oscillator with frequency of &acirc;freq&acirc; Hz and
initial phase of &acirc;i_phase&acirc; times pi.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kog:fx-param,start-value,end-value,freq,mode,point-pairs,first-value,last-value,pos1,value1,...
<br>
Generic oscillator. Frequency &acirc;freq&acirc; Hz, mode
either &acirc;0&acirc; for static values or &acirc;1&acirc;
for linear interpolation. &acirc;point-pairs&acirc;
specifies the number of &acirc;posN&acirc; -
&acirc;valueN&acirc; pairs <br>
to include. &acirc;first-value&acirc; and
&acirc;last-value&acirc; are used as border values (values
for position 0.0/first and position 1.0/last). All
&acirc;posN&acirc; and &acirc;valueN&acirc; must be between
0.0 <br>
and 1.0. Also, for all &acirc;posN&acirc; values &acirc;pos1
&lt; pos2 &lt; ... &lt; posN&acirc; must be true.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kf:fx-param,start-value,end-value,freq,mode,genosc-number
<br>
Generic oscillator. &acirc;genosc_number&acirc; is the
number of the oscillator preset to be loaded. Mode is either
&acirc;0&acirc; for static values or &acirc;1&acirc; for
linear interpolation. The location <br>
for the preset file is taken from ./ecasoundrc (see
ecasoundrc man page).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kl:fx-param,start-value,end-value,time-seconds
<br>
Linear envelope that starts from &acirc;start_value&acirc;
and linearly changes to &acirc;end_value&acirc; during
&acirc;time_in_seconds&acirc;. Can be used for fadeins and
fadeouts.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kl2:fx-param,start-value,end-value,1st-stage-length-sec,2nd-stage-length-sec
<br>
Two-stage linear envelope, a more versatile tool for doing
fade-ins and fade-outs. Stays at &acirc;start_value&acirc;
for &acirc;1st_stage_length&acirc; seconds and then linearly
changes towards <br>
&acirc;end_value&acirc; during
&acirc;2nd_stage_length&acirc; seconds.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-klg:fx-param,low-value,high-value,point_count,pos1,value1,...,posN,valueN
<br>
Generic linear envelope. This controller source can be used
to map custom envelopes to chain operator parameters. Number
of envelope points is specified in
&acirc;point_count&acirc;. <br>
Each envelope point consists of a position and a matching
value. Number of pairs must match &acirc;point_count&acirc;
(i.e. &acirc;N==point_count&acirc;). The &acirc;posX&acirc;
parameters are given as sec&acirc; <br>
onds (from start of the stream). The envelope points are
specified as float values in range &acirc;[0,1]&acirc;.
Before envelope values are mapped to operator parameters,
they are <br>
mapped to the target range of
&acirc;[low-value,high-value]&acirc;. E.g. a value of
&acirc;0&acirc; will set operator parameter to
&acirc;low-value&acirc; and a value of &acirc;1&acirc; will
set it to &acirc;high-value&acirc;. For <br>
the initial segment &acirc;[0,pos1]&acirc;, the envelope
will output value of &acirc;value1&acirc; (e.g.
&acirc;low-value&acirc;).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-km:fx-param,start-value,end-value,controller,channel
<br>
MIDI continuous controller (control change messages).
Messages on the MIDI-channel &acirc;channel&acirc; that are
coming from controller number &acirc;controller&acirc; are
used as the con&acirc; <br>
troller source. As recommended by the MIDI-specification,
channel numbering goes from 1 to 16. Possible controller
numbers are values from 0 to 127. The MIDI-device where <br>
bytes are read from can be specified using -Md option.
Otherwise the default MIDI-device is used as specified in
~ecasound/ecasoundrc (see ecasoundrc man page). Defaults
<br>
to /dev/midi.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ksv:fx-param,start-value,end-value,stamp-id,rms-toggle
<br>
Volume analyze controller. Analyzes the audio stored in
stamp &acirc;stamp-id&acirc; (see &acirc;-eS:id&acirc;
docs), and creates control data based on the results. If
&acirc;rms-toggle&acirc; is non-zero, <br>
RMS-volume is used to calculate the control value. Otherwise
average peak-amplitude is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kx This is a special switch
that can be used when you need to control controller
parameters with another controller. When you specify -kx,
the last specified controller will <br>
be set as the control target. Then you just add another
controller as usual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERACTIVE MODE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See ecasound-iam(1) man
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
ECASOUND <br>
If defined, some utility programs and scripts will use the
ECASOUND environment as the default path to ecasound
executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ECASOUND_LOGFILE <br>
Output all debugging messages to a separate log file. If
defined, ECASOUND_LOGFILE defines the logfile path. This is
a good tool for debugging ECI/EIAM scripts and appli&acirc;
<br>
cations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ECASOUND_LOGLEVEL <br>
Select which messages are written to the logfile defined by
ECASOUND_LOGFILE. The syntax for -d:level is used. If not
defined, all messages are written. Defaults to -d:319 <br>
(everything else but &acirc;functions (64)&acirc; and
&acirc;continuous (128)&acirc; class messages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLUMNS <br>
Ecasound honors the COLUMNS environment variable when
formatting printed trace messages. If COLUMNS is not set, a
default of 74 is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR Some functions of
Ecasound (e.g. &quot;cs-edit&quot; interactive command)
require creation of temporary files. By default, these files
are created under &quot;/tmp&quot;, but this can be <br>
overridden by setting the TMPDIR environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
In interactive mode, ecasound always returns zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In non-interactive (batch) mode,
a non-zero value is returned for the following errors:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Unable to create a valid
chainsetup with the given parameters. Can be caused by
invalid option syntax, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Unable to start processing.
This can be caused by insufficient file permissions,
inability to access some system resources, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Error during processing.
Possible causes: output object has run out of free disk
space, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 Error during process
termination and/or cleanup. See section on
&acirc;SIGNALS&acirc; for further details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
When ecasound receives any of the POSIX signals SIGINT
(ctrl-c), SIGHUP, SIGTERM or SIGQUIT, normal cleanup and
exit procedure is initiated. Here normal exit means that
e.g. file <br>
headers are updated before closing, helper processes are
terminated in normal way, and so forth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If, while doing the cleanup
described above, ecasound receives another signal (of the
same set of POSIX signals), ecasound will skip the normal
cleanup procedure, and terminate <br>
immediately. Any remaining cleanup tasks will be skipped.
Depending on the runtime state and configuration, this brute
force exit may have some side-effects. Ecasound will <br>
return exit code of &acirc;4&acirc; if normal cleanup was
skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special case handling is applied
to the SIGINT (ctrl-c) signal. If a SIGINT signal is
received during the cleanup procedure, ecasound will ignore
the signal once, and emit a <br>
notice to &acirc;stderr&acirc; that cleanup is already in
progress. Any subsequent SIGINT signals will no longer get
special handling, and instead process will terminate
immediately (and <br>
possibly without proper cleanup).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.ecasound The default directory for ecasound user resource
files. See the ecasoundrc (5) man page man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*.ecs Ecasound Chainsetup files.
Syntax is more or less the same as with command-line
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*.ecp Ecasound Chain Preset
files. Used for storing effect and chain operator presets.
See ecasound user&acirc;s guide for more better
documentation.</p>
