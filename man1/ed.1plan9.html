<i>Ed</i> is a venerable text editor.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a <i>file</i> argument is given, <i>ed</i> simulates an command (see below)
  on that file: it is read into <i>ed's</i> buffer so that it can be edited. The
  options are
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Suppress the printing of character counts by and commands
      and of the confirming by commands.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-o</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(for output piping) Write all output to the standard error
      file except writing by commands. If no <i>file</i> is given, make
      <b>/dev/stdout</b> the remembered file; see the command below.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Ed</i> operates on a `buffer', a copy of the file it is editing; changes made
  in the buffer have no effect on the file until a (write) command is given. The
  copy of the text being edited resides in a temporary file called the
  <i>buffer</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Commands to <i>ed</i> have a simple and regular structure: zero, one, or two
  <i>addresses</i> followed by a single character <i>command</i>, possibly
  followed by parameters to the command. These addresses specify one or more
  lines in the buffer. Missing addresses are supplied by default.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In general, only one command may appear on a line. Certain commands allow the
  addition of text to the buffer. While <i>ed</i> is accepting text, it is said
  to be in <i>input mode.</i> In this mode, no commands are recognized; all
  input is merely collected. Input mode is left by typing a period alone at the
  beginning of a line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Ed</i> supports the <i>regular expression</i> notation described in
  <i>regexp</i>(7). Regular expressions are used in addresses to specify lines
  and in one command (see <i>s</i> below) to specify a portion of a line which
  is to be replaced. If it is desired to use one of the regular expression
  metacharacters as an ordinary character, that character may be preceded by
  `<b>\</b>'. This also applies to the character bounding the regular expression
  (often and to itself.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To understand addressing in <i>ed</i> it is necessary to know that at any time
  there is a <i>current line.</i> Generally, the current line is the last line
  affected by a command; however, the exact effect on the current line is
  discussed under the description of each command. Addresses are constructed as
  follows.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The character customarily called `dot', addresses the
      current line.</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The character addresses the last line of the buffer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A decimal number <i>n</i> addresses the <i>n</i>-th line of
      the buffer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">4.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>&#x00B4;x</b> addresses the line marked with the name
      <i>x</i>, which must be a lower-case letter. Lines are marked with the
      command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">5.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A regular expression enclosed in slashes ( addresses the
      line found by searching forward from the current line and stopping at the
      first line containing a string that matches the regular expression. If
      necessary the search wraps around to the beginning of the buffer.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">6.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A regular expression enclosed in queries addresses the line
      found by searching backward from the current line and stopping at the

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">7.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">An address followed by a plus sign or a minus sign followed

<div class="Pp"></div>
Commands may require zero, one, or two addresses. Commands which require no
  addresses regard the presence of an address as an error. Commands which accept
  one or two addresses assume default addresses when insufficient are given. If
  more addresses are given than a command requires, the last one or two
  (depending on what is accepted) are used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Addresses are separated from each other typically by a comma They may also be
  separated by a semicolon In this case the current line is set to the previous
  address before the next address is interpreted. If no address precedes a comma
  or semicolon, line 1 is assumed; if no address follows, the last line of the
  buffer is assumed. The second address of any two-address sequence must
  correspond to a line following the line corresponding to the first address.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the following list of <i>ed</i> commands, the default addresses are shown in
  parentheses. The parentheses are not part of the address, but are used to show
  that the given addresses are the default. `Dot' means the current line.
