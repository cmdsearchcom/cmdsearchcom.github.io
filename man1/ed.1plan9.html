<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ed - text editor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ed [ - ] [ -o ] [ file ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ed is a venerable text editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a file argument is given, ed
simulates an command (see below) on that file: it is read
into ed&rsquo;s buffer so that it can be edited. The options
are</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Suppress the printing of
character counts by and commands and of the confirming by
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o (for output piping) Write all
output to the standard error file except writing by
commands. If no file is given, make /dev/stdout the
remembered file; see the command <br>
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ed operates on a
&lsquo;buffer&rsquo;, a copy of the file it is editing;
changes made in the buffer have no effect on the file until
a (write) command is given. The copy of the text being <br>
edited resides in a temporary file called the buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands to ed have a simple and
regular structure: zero, one, or two addresses followed by a
single character command, possibly followed by parameters to
the command. These <br>
addresses specify one or more lines in the buffer. Missing
addresses are supplied by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, only one command may
appear on a line. Certain commands allow the addition of
text to the buffer. While ed is accepting text, it is said
to be in input mode. In <br>
this mode, no commands are recognized; all input is merely
collected. Input mode is left by typing a period alone at
the beginning of a line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ed supports the regular
expression notation described in regexp(7). Regular
expressions are used in addresses to specify lines and in
one command (see s below) to specify a por&acirc; <br>
tion of a line which is to be replaced. If it is desired to
use one of the regular expression metacharacters as an
ordinary character, that character may be preceded by
&lsquo;&acute;. <br>
This also applies to the character bounding the regular
expression (often and to itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To understand addressing in ed
it is necessary to know that at any time there is a current
line. Generally, the current line is the last line affected
by a command; however, the <br>
exact effect on the current line is discussed under the
description of each command. Addresses are constructed as
follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The character customarily
called &lsquo;dot&rsquo;, addresses the current line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The character addresses the
last line of the buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. A decimal number n addresses
the n-th line of the buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. &Acirc;&acute;x addresses the
line marked with the name x, which must be a lower-case
letter. Lines are marked with the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. A regular expression enclosed
in slashes ( addresses the line found by searching forward
from the current line and stopping at the first line
containing a string that <br>
matches the regular expression. If necessary the search
wraps around to the beginning of the buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. A regular expression enclosed
in queries addresses the line found by searching backward
from the current line and stopping at the first line
containing a string that <br>
matches the regular expression. If necessary the search
wraps around to the end of the buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. An address followed by a plus
sign or a minus sign followed by a decimal number specifies
that address plus (resp. minus) the indicated number of
lines. The plus sign may <br>
be omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. An address followed by (or
followed by a regular expression enclosed in slashes
specifies the first matching line following (or preceding)
that address. The search wraps <br>
around if necessary. The may be omitted, so addresses the
first line in the buffer with an Enclosing the regular
expression in reverses the search direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9. If an address begins with or
the addition or subtraction is taken with respect to the
current line; e.g. is understood to mean</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10. If an address ends with or
then 1 is added (resp. subtracted). As a consequence of this
rule and rule 9, the address refers to the line before the
current line. More&acirc; <br>
over, trailing and characters have cumulative effect, so
refers to the current line less 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">11. To maintain compatibility
with earlier versions of the editor, the character in
addresses is equivalent to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands may require zero, one,
or two addresses. Commands which require no addresses regard
the presence of an address as an error. Commands which
accept one or two addresses <br>
assume default addresses when insufficient are given. If
more addresses are given than a command requires, the last
one or two (depending on what is accepted) are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Addresses are separated from
each other typically by a comma They may also be separated
by a semicolon In this case the current line is set to the
previous address before the <br>
next address is interpreted. If no address precedes a comma
or semicolon, line 1 is assumed; if no address follows, the
last line of the buffer is assumed. The second address <br>
of any two-address sequence must correspond to a line
following the line corresponding to the first address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following list of ed
commands, the default addresses are shown in parentheses.
The parentheses are not part of the address, but are used to
show that the given addresses <br>
are the default. &lsquo;Dot&rsquo; means the current
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(.)a <br>
&lt;text&gt; <br>
. Read the given text and append it after the addressed
line. Dot is left on the last line input, if there were any,
otherwise at the addressed line. Address is legal for <br>
this command; text is placed at the beginning of the
buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(.,.)b[+-][pagesize][pln] <br>
Browse. Print a &lsquo;page&rsquo;, normally 20 lines. The
optional (default) or specifies whether the next or previous
page is to be printed. The optional pagesize is the number
<br>
of lines in a page. The optional or causes printing in the
specified format, initially Pagesize and format are
remembered between commands. Dot is left at the last line
<br>
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(.,.)c <br>
&lt;text&gt; <br>
. Change. Delete the addressed lines, then accept input text
to replace these lines. Dot is left at the last line input;
if there were none, it is left at the line preced&acirc;
<br>
ing the deleted lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(.,.)d Delete the addressed
lines from the buffer. Dot is set to the line following the
last line deleted, or to the last line of the buffer if the
deleted lines had no succes&acirc; <br>
sor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e filename <br>
Edit. Delete the entire contents of the buffer; then read
the named file into the buffer. Dot is set to the last line
of the buffer. The number of characters read is <br>
typed. The file name is remembered for possible use in later
or commands. If filename is missing, the remembered name is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E filename <br>
Unconditional see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f filename <br>
Print the currently remembered file name. If filename is
given, the currently remembered file name is first changed
to filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(1,$)g/regular
expression/command list <br>
(1,$)g/regular expression/ <br>
(1,$)g/regular expression <br>
Global. First mark every line which matches the given
regularexpression. Then for every such line, execute the
command list with dot initially set to that line. A
sin&acirc; <br>
gle command or the first of multiple commands appears on the
same line with the global command. All lines of a multi-line
list except the last line must end with The &lsquo;.&rsquo;
<br>
terminating input mode for an command may be omitted if it
would be on the last line of the command list. The commands
and are not permitted in the command list. Any <br>
character other than space or newline may be used instead of
to delimit the regular expression. The second and third
forms mean g/regular expression/p.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(.)i <br>
&lt;text&gt; <br>
. Insert the given text before the addressed line. Dot is
left at the last line input, or, if there were none, at the
line before the addressed line. This command differs <br>
from the a command only in the placement of the text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(.,.+1)j <br>
Join the addressed lines into a single line; intermediate
newlines are deleted. Dot is left at the resulting line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(.)kx Mark the addressed line
with name x, which must be a lower-case letter. The address
form &Acirc;&acute;x then addresses this line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(.,.)l List. Print the addressed
lines in an unambiguous way: a tab is printed as a backspace
as backslashes as and non-printing characters as a
backslash, an and four hexadeci&acirc; <br>
mal digits. Long lines are folded, with the second and
subsequent sub-lines indented one tab stop. If the last
character in the line is a blank, it is followed by An may
<br>
be appended, like to any non-I/O command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(.,.)ma <br>
Move. Reposition the addressed lines after the line
addressed by a. Dot is left at the last moved line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(.,.)n Number. Perform prefixing
each line with its line number and a tab. An may be
appended, like to any non-I/O command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(.,.)p Print the addressed
lines. Dot is left at the last line printed. A appended to
any non-I/O command causes the then current line to be
printed after the command is exe&acirc; <br>
cuted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(.,.)P This command is a synonym
for</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q Quit the editor. No automatic
write of a file is done. A or command is considered to be in
error if the buffer has been modified since the last or
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q Quit unconditionally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">($)r filename <br>
Read in the given file after the addressed line. If no
filename is given, the remembered file name is used. The
file name is remembered if there were no remembered file
<br>
name already. If the read is successful, the number of
characters read is printed. Dot is left at the last line
read from the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(.,.)sn/regular
expression/replacement/ <br>
(.,.)sn/regular expression/replacement/g <br>
(.,.)sn/regular expression/replacement <br>
Substitute. Search each addressed line for an occurrence of
the specified regular expression. On each line in which n
matches are found (n defaults to 1 if missing), the <br>
nth matched string is replaced by the replacement specified.
If the global replacement indicator appears after the
command, all subsequent matches on the line are also <br>
replaced. It is an error for the substitution to fail on all
addressed lines. Any character other than space or newline
may be used instead of to delimit the regular <br>
expression and the replacement. Dot is left at the last line
substituted. The third form means sn/regular
expression/replacement/p. The second may be omitted if the
<br>
replacement is empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An ampersand appearing in the
replacement is replaced by the string matching the regular
expression. The characters 0 where n is a digit, are
replaced by the text <br>
matched by the n-th regular subexpression enclosed between
and When nested parenthesized subexpressions are present, n
is determined by counting occurrences of starting <br>
from the left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A literal or newline may be
included in a replacement by prefixing it with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(.,.)ta <br>
Transfer. Copy the addressed lines after the line addressed
by a. Dot is left at the last line of the copy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(.,.)u Undo. Restore the
preceding contents of the first addressed line (sic), which
must be the last line in which a substitution was made
(double sic).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(1,$)v/regular
expression/command list <br>
This command is the same as the global command except that
the command list is executed with dot initially set to every
line except those matching the regular expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(1,$)w filename <br>
Write the addressed lines to the given file. If the file
does not exist, it is created with mode 666 (readable and
writable by everyone). If no filename is given, the <br>
remembered file name, if any, is used. The file name is
remembered if there were no remembered file name already.
Dot is unchanged. If the write is successful, the num&acirc;
<br>
ber of characters written is printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(1,$)W filename <br>
Perform but append to, instead of overwriting, any existing
file contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">($)= Print the line number of
the addressed line. Dot is unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!shell command <br>
Send the remainder of the line after the to rc(1) to be
interpreted as a command. Dot is unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(.+1)&lt;newline&gt; <br>
An address without a command is taken as a command. A
terminal may be omitted from the address. A blank line alone
is equivalent to it is useful for stepping through <br>
text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an interrupt signal (DEL) is
sent, ed prints a and returns to its command level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When reading a file, ed discards
NUL characters and all characters after the last
newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
