<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlport - Writing portable Perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Perl runs on numerous operating systems. While most of them
share much in common, they also have their own unique
features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This document is meant to help
you to find out what constitutes portable Perl code. That
way once you make a decision to write portably, you know
where the lines are drawn, and <br>
you can stay within them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a tradeoff between
taking full advantage of one particular type of computer and
taking advantage of a full range of them. Naturally, as you
broaden your range and <br>
become more diverse, the common factors drop, and you are
left with an increasingly smaller area of common ground in
which you can operate to accomplish a particular task. Thus,
<br>
when you begin attacking a problem, it is important to
consider under which part of the tradeoff curve you want to
operate. Specifically, you must decide whether it is
important <br>
that the task that you are coding have the full generality
of being portable, or whether to just get the job done right
now. This is the hardest choice to be made. The rest is <br>
easy, because Perl provides many choices, whichever way you
want to approach your problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Looking at it another way,
writing portable code is usually about willfully limiting
your available choices. Naturally, it takes discipline and
sacrifice to do that. The <br>
product of portability and convenience may be a constant.
You have been warned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be aware of two important
points:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not all Perl programs have to be
portable <br>
There is no reason you should not use Perl as a language to
glue Unix tools together, or to prototype a Macintosh
application, or to manage the Windows registry. If it makes
<br>
no sense to aim for portability for one reason or another in
a given program, then don&rsquo;t bother.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nearly all of Perl already is
portable <br>
Don&rsquo;t be fooled into thinking that it is hard to
create portable Perl code. It isn&rsquo;t. Perl tries its
level-best to bridge the gaps between what&rsquo;s available
on different <br>
platforms, and all the means available to use those
features. Thus almost all Perl code runs on any machine
without modification. But there are some significant issues
in <br>
writing portable code, and this document is entirely about
those issues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s the general rule:
When you approach a task commonly done using a whole range
of platforms, think about writing portable code. That way,
you don&rsquo;t sacrifice much by way of <br>
the implementation choices you can avail yourself of, and at
the same time you can give your users lots of platform
choices. On the other hand, when you have to take advantage
<br>
of some unique feature of a particular platform, as is often
the case with systems programming (whether for Unix,
Windows, VMS, etc.), consider writing platform-specific
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the code will run on only
two or three operating systems, you may need to consider
only the differences of those particular systems. The
important thing is to decide where <br>
the code will run and to be deliberate in your decision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The material below is separated
into three main sections: main issues of portability
(&quot;ISSUES&quot;), platform-specific issues
(&quot;PLATFORMS&quot;), and built-in perl functions that
behave <br>
differently on various ports (&quot;FUNCTION
IMPLEMENTATIONS&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This information should not be
considered complete; it includes possibly transient
information about idiosyncrasies of some of the ports,
almost all of which are in a state of <br>
constant evolution. Thus, this material should be considered
a perpetual work in progress (&quot;&lt;IMG
SRC=&quot;yellow_sign.gif&quot; ALT=&quot;Under
Construction&quot;&gt;&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ISSUES <br>
Newlines <br>
In most operating systems, lines in files are terminated by
newlines. Just what is used as a newline may vary from OS to
OS. Unix traditionally uses &quot; 12&quot;, one type of
DOSish <br>
I/O uses &quot; 15 12&quot;, and Mac OS uses &quot;
15&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl uses &quot;0 to represent
the &quot;logical&quot; newline, where what is logical may
depend on the platform in use. In MacPerl, &quot;0 always
means &quot; 15&quot;. In DOSish perls, &quot;0 usually <br>
means &quot; 12&quot;, but when accessing a file in
&quot;text&quot; mode, perl uses the &quot;:crlf&quot; layer
that translates it to (or from) &quot; 15 12&quot;,
depending on whether you&rsquo;re reading or writing. <br>
Unix does the same thing on ttys in canonical mode. &quot;
15 12&quot; is commonly referred to as CRLF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To trim trailing newlines from
text lines use chomp(). With default settings that function
looks for a trailing &quot;0 character and thus trims in a
portable way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When dealing with binary files
(or text files in binary mode) be sure to explicitly set $/
to the appropriate value for your file format before using
chomp().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because of the &quot;text&quot;
mode translation, DOSish perls have limitations in using
&quot;seek&quot; and &quot;tell&quot; on a file accessed in
&quot;text&quot; mode. Stick to &quot;seek&quot;-ing to
locations you got from <br>
&quot;tell&quot; (and no others), and you are usually free
to use &quot;seek&quot; and &quot;tell&quot; even in
&quot;text&quot; mode. Using &quot;seek&quot; or
&quot;tell&quot; or other file operations may be
non-portable. If you use <br>
&quot;binmode&quot; on a file, however, you can usually
&quot;seek&quot; and &quot;tell&quot; with arbitrary values
in safety.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A common misconception in socket
programming is that &quot;0 eq &quot; 12&quot; everywhere.
When using protocols such as common Internet protocols,
&quot; 12&quot; and &quot; 15&quot; are called for &quot;
<br>
specifically, and the values of the logical &quot;0 and
&quot; (carriage return) are not reliable. 0; # WRONG</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print SOCKET &quot;Hi there,
client! <br>
print SOCKET &quot;Hi there, client! 15 12&quot;; #
RIGHT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, using &quot; 15
12&quot; (or &quot; Right Thing for those who want it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Socket qw(:DEFAULT :crlf);
<br>
print SOCKET &quot;Hi there, client!$CRLF&quot; # RIGHT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When reading from a socket,
remember that the default input record separator $/ is
&quot;0, but robust socket code will recognize as either
&quot; 12&quot; or &quot; 15 12&quot; as end of line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while (&lt;SOCKET&gt;) { <br>
# ... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because both CRLF and LF end in
LF, the input record separator can be set to LF and any CR
stripped later. Better to write:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Socket qw(:DEFAULT :crlf);
<br>
local($/) = LF; # not needed if $/ is already 12</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while (&lt;SOCKET&gt;) { <br>
s/$CR?$LF/0; # not sure if socket uses LF or CRLF, OK <br>
# s/ 15? 12/0; # same thing <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example is preferred over
the previous one--even for Unix platforms--because now any
&quot; 15&quot;&rsquo;s (&quot; <br>
Similarly, functions that return text data--such as a
function that fetches a web page--should sometimes translate
newlines before returning the data, if they&rsquo;ve not yet
been <br>
translated to the local newline representation. A single
line of code will often suffice:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$data =~ s/ 15? 12/0g; <br>
return $data;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of this may be confusing.
Here&rsquo;s a handy reference to the ASCII CR and LF
characters. You can print it out and stick it in your
wallet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LF eq 12 eq A eq CR eq 15 eq D
eq <br>
| Unix | DOS | Mac | <br>
--------------------------- <br>
| LF | LF | CR | <br>
| CR | CR | LF | <br>
* | LF | CRLF | CR | <br>
* | CR | CR | LF | <br>
--------------------------- <br>
* text-mode STDIO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Unix column assumes that you
are not accessing a serial line (like a tty) in canonical
mode. If you are, then CR on input becomes &quot;0, and
&quot;0 on output becomes CRLF. &quot; in</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are just the most common
definitions of &quot;0 and &quot; Perl. There may well be
others. For example, on an EBCDIC implementation such as
z/OS (OS/390) or OS/400 (using <br>
the ILE, the PASE is ASCII-based) the above material is
similar to &quot;Unix&quot; but the code numbers change:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LF eq 25 eq 5 eq LF eq 45 eq 5
eq chr(37) eq CP-0037 37 <br>
CR eq 15 eq D eq CR eq 15 eq D eq <br>
| z/OS | OS/400 | <br>
---------------------- <br>
| LF | LF | <br>
| CR | CR | <br>
* | LF | LF | <br>
* | CR | CR | <br>
---------------------- <br>
* text-mode STDIO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Numbers endianness and Width
<br>
Different CPUs store integers and floating point numbers in
different orders (called endianness) and widths (32-bit and
64-bit being the most common today). This affects your <br>
programs when they attempt to transfer numbers in binary
format from one CPU architecture to another, usually either
&quot;live&quot; via network connection, or by storing the
numbers to <br>
secondary storage such as a disk file or tape.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conflicting storage orders make
utter mess out of the numbers. If a little-endian host
(Intel, VAX) stores 0x12345678 (305419896 in decimal), a
big-endian host (Motorola, Sparc, <br>
PA) reads it as 0x78563412 (2018915346 in decimal). Alpha
and MIPS can be either: Digital/Compaq used/uses them in
little-endian mode; SGI/Cray uses them in big-endian mode.
To <br>
avoid this problem in network (socket) connections use the
&quot;pack&quot; and &quot;unpack&quot; formats
&quot;n&quot; and &quot;N&quot;, the &quot;network&quot;
orders. These are guaranteed to be portable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of perl 5.9.2, you can also
use the &quot;&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;&quot; modifiers to
force big- or little-endian byte-order. This is useful if
you want to store signed integers or 64-bit integers, <br>
for example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can explore the endianness
of your platform by unpacking a data structure packed in
native format such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print unpack(&quot;h*&quot;,
pack(&quot;s2&quot;, 1, 2)), &quot;0; <br>
# &rsquo;10002000&rsquo; on e.g. Intel x86 or Alpha 21064 in
little-endian mode <br>
# &rsquo;00100020&rsquo; on e.g. Motorola 68040</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need to distinguish
between endian architectures you could use either of the
variables set like so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$is_big_endian =
unpack(&quot;h*&quot;, pack(&quot;s&quot;, 1)) =~ /01/; <br>
$is_little_endian = unpack(&quot;h*&quot;,
pack(&quot;s&quot;, 1)) =~ /^1/;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Differing widths can cause
truncation even between platforms of equal endianness. The
platform of shorter width loses the upper parts of the
number. There is no good solution <br>
for this problem except to avoid transferring or storing raw
binary numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One can circumnavigate both
these problems in two ways. Either transfer and store
numbers always in text format, instead of raw binary, or
else consider using modules like <br>
Data::Dumper (included in the standard distribution as of
Perl 5.005) and Storable (included as of perl 5.8). Keeping
all data as text significantly simplifies matters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The v-strings are portable only
up to v2147483647 (0x7FFFFFFF), that&rsquo;s how far EBCDIC,
or more precisely UTF-EBCDIC will go.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files and Filesystems <br>
Most platforms these days structure files in a hierarchical
fashion. So, it is reasonably safe to assume that all
platforms support the notion of a &quot;path&quot; to
uniquely identify a <br>
file on the system. How that path is really written, though,
differs considerably.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although similar, file path
specifications differ between Unix, Windows, Mac OS, OS/2,
VMS, VOS, RISC OS, and probably others. Unix, for example,
is one of the few OSes that has <br>
the elegant idea of a single root directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOS, OS/2, VMS, VOS, and Windows
can work similarly to Unix with &quot;/&quot; as path
separator, or in their own idiosyncratic ways (such as
having several root directories and various <br>
&quot;unrooted&quot; device files such NIL: and LPT:).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mac OS 9 and earlier used
&quot;:&quot; as a path separator instead of
&quot;/&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filesystem may support
neither hard links (&quot;link&quot;) nor symbolic links
(&quot;symlink&quot;, &quot;readlink&quot;,
&quot;lstat&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filesystem may support
neither access timestamp nor change timestamp (meaning that
about the only portable timestamp is the modification
timestamp), or one second granularity <br>
of any timestamps (e.g. the FAT filesystem limits the time
granularity to two seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;inode change
timestamp&quot; (the &quot;-C&quot; filetest) may really be
the &quot;creation timestamp&quot; (which it is not in
Unix).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VOS perl can emulate Unix
filenames with &quot;/&quot; as path separator. The native
pathname characters greater-than, less-than, number-sign,
and percent-sign are always accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RISC OS perl can emulate Unix
filenames with &quot;/&quot; as path separator, or go native
and use &quot;.&quot; for path separator and &quot;:&quot;
to signal filesystems and disk names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t assume Unix
filesystem access semantics: that read, write, and execute
are all the permissions there are, and even if they exist,
that their semantics (for example what do <br>
r, w, and x mean on a directory) are the Unix ones. The
various Unix/POSIX compatibility layers usually try to make
interfaces like chmod() work, but sometimes there simply is
<br>
no good mapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If all this is intimidating,
have no (well, maybe only a little) fear. There are modules
that can help. The File::Spec modules provide methods to do
the Right Thing on whatever <br>
platform happens to be running the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use File::Spec::Functions; <br>
chdir(updir()); # go up one directory <br>
my $file = catfile(curdir(), &rsquo;temp&rsquo;,
&rsquo;file.txt&rsquo;); <br>
# on Unix and Win32, &rsquo;./temp/file.txt&rsquo; <br>
# on Mac OS Classic, &rsquo;:temp:file.txt&rsquo; <br>
# on VMS, &rsquo;[.temp]file.txt&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File::Spec is available in the
standard distribution as of version 5.004_05.
File::Spec::Functions is only in File::Spec 0.7 and later,
and some versions of perl come with <br>
version 0.6. If File::Spec is not updated to 0.7 or later,
you must use the object-oriented interface from File::Spec
(or upgrade File::Spec).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, production code
should not have file paths hardcoded. Making them
user-supplied or read from a configuration file is better,
keeping in mind that file path syntax <br>
varies on different machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is especially noticeable in
scripts like Makefiles and test suites, which often assume
&quot;/&quot; as a path separator for subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also of use is File::Basename
from the standard distribution, which splits a pathname into
pieces (base filename, full path to directory, and file
suffix).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even when on a single platform
(if you can call Unix a single platform), remember not to
count on the existence or the contents of particular
system-specific files or <br>
directories, like /etc/passwd, /etc/sendmail.conf,
/etc/resolv.conf, or even /tmp/. For example, /etc/passwd
may exist but not contain the encrypted passwords, because
the <br>
system is using some form of enhanced security. Or it may
not contain all the accounts, because the system is using
NIS. If code does need to rely on such a file, include a
<br>
description of the file and its format in the code&rsquo;s
documentation, then make it easy for the user to override
the default location of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t assume a text file
will end with a newline. They should, but people forget.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not have two files or
directories of the same name with different case, like
test.pl and Test.pl, as many platforms have case-insensitive
(or at least case-forgiving) <br>
filenames. Also, try not to have non-word characters (except
for &quot;.&quot;) in the names, and keep them to the 8.3
convention, for maximum portability, onerous a burden though
this <br>
may appear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Likewise, when using the
AutoSplit module, try to keep your functions to 8.3 naming
and case-insensitive conventions; or, at the least, make it
so the resulting files have a <br>
unique (case-insensitively) first 8 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whitespace in filenames is
tolerated on most systems, but not all, and even on systems
where it might be tolerated, some utilities might become
confused by such whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many systems (DOS, VMS ODS-2)
cannot have more than one &quot;.&quot; in their
filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t assume
&quot;&gt;&quot; won&rsquo;t be the first character of a
filename. Always use &quot;&lt;&quot; explicitly to open a
file for reading, or even better, use the three-arg version
of open, unless you <br>
want the user to be able to specify a pipe open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open my $fh, &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo;,
$existing_file) or die $!;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If filenames might use strange
characters, it is safest to open it with &quot;sysopen&quot;
instead of &quot;open&quot;. &quot;open&quot; is magic and
can translate characters like &quot;&gt;&quot;,
&quot;&lt;&quot;, and &quot;|&quot;, which <br>
may be the wrong thing to do. (Sometimes, though, it&rsquo;s
the right thing.) Three-arg open can also help protect
against this translation in cases where it is
undesirable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t use &quot;:&quot; as
a part of a filename since many systems use that for their
own semantics (Mac OS Classic for separating pathname
components, many networking schemes and <br>
utilities for separating the nodename and the pathname, and
so on). For the same reasons, avoid &quot;@&quot;,
&quot;;&quot; and &quot;|&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t assume that in
pathnames you can collapse two leading slashes
&quot;//&quot; into one: some networking and clustering
filesystems have special semantics for that. Let the
operating <br>
system to sort it out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The portable filename characters
as defined by ANSI C are</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p
q r t u v w x y z <br>
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R T U V W X Y Z <br>
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 <br>
. _ -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and the &quot;-&quot;
shouldn&rsquo;t be the first character. If you want to be
hypercorrect, stay case-insensitive and within the 8.3
naming convention (all the files and directories have to
<br>
be unique within one directory if their names are lowercased
and truncated to eight characters before the &quot;.&quot;,
if any, and to three characters after the &quot;.&quot;, if
any). (And do <br>
not use &quot;.&quot;s in directory names.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">System Interaction <br>
Not all platforms provide a command line. These are usually
platforms that rely primarily on a Graphical User Interface
(GUI) for user interaction. A program requiring a <br>
command line interface might not work everywhere. This is
probably for the user of the program to deal with, so
don&rsquo;t stay up late worrying about it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some platforms can&rsquo;t
delete or rename files held open by the system, this
limitation may also apply to changing filesystem
metainformation like file permissions or owners. <br>
Remember to &quot;close&quot; files when you are done with
them. Don&rsquo;t &quot;unlink&quot; or &quot;rename&quot;
an open file. Don&rsquo;t &quot;tie&quot; or
&quot;open&quot; a file already tied or opened;
&quot;untie&quot; or &quot;close&quot; it <br>
first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t open the same file
more than once at a time for writing, as some operating
systems put mandatory locks on such files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t assume that
write/modify permission on a directory gives the right to
add or delete files/directories in that directory. That is
filesystem specific: in some filesystems <br>
you need write/modify permission also (or even just) in the
file/directory itself. In some filesystems (AFS, DFS) the
permission to add/delete directory entries is a completely
<br>
separate permission.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t assume that a single
&quot;unlink&quot; completely gets rid of the file: some
filesystems (most notably the ones in VMS) have versioned
filesystems, and unlink() removes only the <br>
most recent one (it doesn&rsquo;t remove all the versions
because by default the native tools on those platforms
remove just the most recent version, too). The portable
idiom to <br>
remove all the versions of a file is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 while unlink
&quot;file&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will terminate if the file
is undeleteable for some reason (protected, not there, and
so on).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t count on a specific
environment variable existing in %ENV. Don&rsquo;t count on
%ENV entries being case-sensitive, or even case-preserving.
Don&rsquo;t try to clear %ENV by saying <br>
&quot;%ENV = ();&quot;, or, if you really have to, make it
conditional on &quot;$^O ne &rsquo;VMS&rsquo;&quot; since in
VMS the %ENV table is much more than a per-process key-value
string table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On VMS, some entries in the %ENV
hash are dynamically created when their key is used on a
read if they did not previously exist. The values for
$ENV{HOME}, $ENV{TERM}, <br>
$ENV{HOME}, and $ENV{USER}, are known to be dynamically
generated. The specific names that are dynamically generated
may vary with the version of the C library on VMS, and more
<br>
may exist than is documented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On VMS by default, changes to
the %ENV hash are persistent after the process exits. This
can cause unintended issues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t count on signals or
%SIG for anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t count on filename
globbing. Use &quot;opendir&quot;, &quot;readdir&quot;, and
&quot;closedir&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t count on per-program
environment variables, or per-program current
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t count on specific
values of $!, neither numeric nor especially the strings
values. Users may switch their locales causing error
messages to be translated into their <br>
languages. If you can trust a POSIXish environment, you can
portably use the symbols defined by the Errno module, like
ENOENT. And don&rsquo;t trust on the values of $! at all
<br>
except immediately after a failed system call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command names versus file
pathnames <br>
Don&rsquo;t assume that the name used to invoke a command or
program with &quot;system&quot; or &quot;exec&quot; can also
be used to test for the existence of the file that holds the
executable code for <br>
that command or program. First, many systems have
&quot;internal&quot; commands that are built-in to the shell
or OS and while these commands can be invoked, there is no
corresponding <br>
file. Second, some operating systems (e.g., Cygwin, DJGPP,
OS/2, and VOS) have required suffixes for executable files;
these suffixes are generally permitted on the command name
<br>
but are not required. Thus, a command like &quot;perl&quot;
might exist in a file named &quot;perl&quot;,
&quot;perl.exe&quot;, or &quot;perl.pm&quot;, depending on
the operating system. The variable &quot;_exe&quot; in the
<br>
Config module holds the executable suffix, if any. Third,
the VMS port carefully sets up $^X and $Config{perlpath} so
that no further processing is required. This is just as <br>
well, because the matching regular expression used below
would then have to deal with a possible trailing version
number in the VMS file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To convert $^X to a file
pathname, taking account of the requirements of the various
operating system possibilities, say:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Config; <br>
my $thisperl = $^X; <br>
if ($^O ne &rsquo;VMS&rsquo;) <br>
{$thisperl .= $Config{_exe} unless $thisperl =~
m/$Config{_exe}$/i;}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To convert $Config{perlpath} to
a file pathname, say:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Config; <br>
my $thisperl = $Config{perlpath}; <br>
if ($^O ne &rsquo;VMS&rsquo;) <br>
{$thisperl .= $Config{_exe} unless $thisperl =~
m/$Config{_exe}$/i;}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Networking <br>
Don&rsquo;t assume that you can reach the public
Internet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t assume that there is
only one way to get through firewalls to the public
Internet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t assume that you can
reach outside world through any other port than 80, or some
web proxy. ftp is blocked by many firewalls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t assume that you can
send email by connecting to the local SMTP port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t assume that you can
reach yourself or any node by the name
&rsquo;localhost&rsquo;. The same goes for
&rsquo;127.0.0.1&rsquo;. You will have to try both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t assume that the host
has only one network card, or that it can&rsquo;t bind to
many virtual IP addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t assume a particular
network device name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t assume a particular
set of ioctl()s will work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t assume that you can
ping hosts and get replies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t assume that any
particular port (service) will respond.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t assume that
Sys::Hostname (or any other API or command) returns either a
fully qualified hostname or a non-qualified hostname: it all
depends on how the system had been <br>
configured. Also remember that for things such as DHCP and
NAT, the hostname you get back might not be very useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the above
&quot;don&rsquo;t&quot;:s may look daunting, and they are,
but the key is to degrade gracefully if one cannot reach the
particular network service one wants. Croaking or hanging
<br>
do not look very professional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interprocess Communication (IPC)
<br>
In general, don&rsquo;t directly access the system in code
meant to be portable. That means, no &quot;system&quot;,
&quot;exec&quot;, &quot;fork&quot;, &quot;pipe&quot;,
&quot;&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot;, &quot;qx//&quot;,
&quot;open&quot; with a &quot;|&quot;, nor any of the other
<br>
things that makes being a perl hacker worth being.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands that launch external
processes are generally supported on most platforms (though
many of them do not support any type of forking). The
problem with using them arises <br>
from what you invoke them on. External tools are often named
differently on different platforms, may not be available in
the same location, might accept different arguments, can
<br>
behave differently, and often present their results in a
platform-dependent way. Thus, you should seldom depend on
them to produce consistent results. (Then again, if
you&rsquo;re <br>
calling netstat -a, you probably don&rsquo;t expect it to
run on both Unix and CP/M.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One especially common bit of
Perl code is opening a pipe to sendmail:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(MAIL,
&rsquo;|/usr/lib/sendmail -t&rsquo;) <br>
or die &quot;cannot fork sendmail: $!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is fine for systems
programming when sendmail is known to be available. But it
is not fine for many non-Unix systems, and even some Unix
systems that may not have sendmail <br>
installed. If a portable solution is needed, see the various
distributions on CPAN that deal with it. Mail::Mailer and
Mail::Send in the MailTools distribution are commonly <br>
used, and provide several mailing methods, including mail,
sendmail, and direct SMTP (via Net::SMTP) if a mail transfer
agent is not available. Mail::Sendmail is a standalone <br>
module that provides simple, platform-independent
mailing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Unix System V IPC
(&quot;msg*(), sem*(), shm*()&quot;) is not available even
on all Unix platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not use either the bare
result of &quot;pack(&quot;N&quot;, 10, 20, 30, 40)&quot; or
bare v-strings (such as &quot;v10.20.30.40&quot;) to
represent IPv4 addresses: both forms just pack the four
bytes into <br>
network order. That this would be equal to the C language
&quot;in_addr&quot; struct (which is what the socket code
internally uses) is not guaranteed. To be portable use the
routines of <br>
the Socket extension, such as &quot;inet_aton()&quot;,
&quot;inet_ntoa()&quot;, and &quot;sockaddr_in()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rule of thumb for portable
code is: Do it all in portable Perl, or use a module (that
may internally implement it with platform-specific code, but
expose a common interface).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">External Subroutines (XS) <br>
XS code can usually be made to work with any platform, but
dependent libraries, header files, etc., might not be
readily available or portable, or the XS code itself might
be <br>
platform-specific, just as Perl code might be. If the
libraries and headers are portable, then it is normally
reasonable to make sure the XS code is portable, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A different type of portability
issue arises when writing XS code: availability of a C
compiler on the end-user&rsquo;s system. C brings with it
its own portability issues, and <br>
writing XS code will expose you to some of those. Writing
purely in Perl is an easier way to achieve portability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard Modules <br>
In general, the standard modules work across platforms.
Notable exceptions are the CPAN module (which currently
makes connections to external programs that may not be <br>
available), platform-specific modules (like
ExtUtils::MM_VMS), and DBM modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no one DBM module
available on all platforms. SDBM_File and the others are
generally available on all Unix and DOSish ports, but not in
MacPerl, where only NBDM_File <br>
and DB_File are available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The good news is that at least
some DBM module should be available, and AnyDBM_File will
use whichever module it can find. Of course, then the code
needs to be fairly strict, <br>
dropping to the greatest common factor (e.g., not exceeding
1K for each record), so that it will work with any DBM
module. See AnyDBM_File for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Time and Date <br>
The system&rsquo;s notion of time of day and calendar date
is controlled in widely different ways. Don&rsquo;t assume
the timezone is stored in $ENV{TZ}, and even if it is,
don&rsquo;t assume <br>
that you can control the timezone through that variable.
Don&rsquo;t assume anything about the three-letter timezone
abbreviations (for example that MST would be the Mountain
Standard <br>
Time, it&rsquo;s been known to stand for Moscow Standard
Time). If you need to use timezones, express them in some
unambiguous format like the exact number of minutes offset
from UTC, <br>
or the POSIX timezone format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t assume that the
epoch starts at 00:00:00, January 1, 1970, because that is
OS- and implementation-specific. It is better to store a
date in an unambiguous representation. <br>
The ISO 8601 standard defines YYYY-MM-DD as the date format,
or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS (that&rsquo;s a literal &quot;T&quot;
separating the date from the time). Please do use the ISO
8601 instead <br>
of making us guess what date 02/03/04 might be. ISO 8601
even sorts nicely as-is. A text representation (like
&quot;1987-12-18&quot;) can be easily converted into an
OS-specific value <br>
using a module like Date::Parse. An array of values, such as
those returned by &quot;localtime&quot;, can be converted to
an OS-specific representation using Time::Local.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When calculating specific times,
such as for tests in time or date modules, it may be
appropriate to calculate an offset for the epoch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require Time::Local; <br>
my $offset = Time::Local::timegm(0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 70);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value for $offset in Unix
will be 0, but in Mac OS Classic will be some large number.
$offset can then be added to a Unix time value to get what
should be the proper value <br>
on any system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character sets and character
encoding <br>
Assume very little about character sets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assume nothing about numerical
values (&quot;ord&quot;, &quot;chr&quot;) of characters. Do
not use explicit code point ranges (like -); use for example
symbolic character classes like <br>
&quot;[:print:]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not assume that the
alphabetic characters are encoded contiguously (in the
numeric sense). There may be gaps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not assume anything about the
ordering of the characters. The lowercase letters may come
before or after the uppercase letters; the lowercase and
uppercase may be interlaced <br>
so that both &quot;a&quot; and &quot;A&quot; come before
&quot;b&quot;; the accented and other international
characters may be interlaced so that ae comes before
&quot;b&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internationalisation <br>
If you may assume POSIX (a rather large assumption), you may
read more about the POSIX locale system from perllocale. The
locale system at least attempts to make things a little <br>
bit more portable, or at least more convenient and
native-friendly for non-English users. The system affects
character sets and encoding, and date and time
formatting--amongst <br>
other things.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you really want to be
international, you should consider Unicode. See perluniintro
and perlunicode for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to use non-ASCII
bytes (outside the bytes 0x00..0x7f) in the &quot;source
code&quot; of your code, to be portable you have to be
explicit about what bytes they are. Someone <br>
might for example be using your code under a UTF-8 locale,
in which case random native bytes might be illegal
(&quot;Malformed UTF-8 ...&quot;) This means that for
example embedding ISO <br>
8859-1 bytes beyond 0x7f into your strings might cause
trouble later. If the bytes are native 8-bit bytes, you can
use the &quot;bytes&quot; pragma. If the bytes are in a
string (regular <br>
expression being a curious string), you can often also use
the &quot;&quot; notation instead of embedding the bytes
as-is. (If you want to write your code in UTF-8, you can use
the <br>
&quot;utf8&quot;.) The &quot;bytes&quot; and
&quot;utf8&quot; pragmata are available since Perl
5.6.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">System Resources <br>
If your code is destined for systems with severely
constrained (or missing!) virtual memory systems then you
want to be especially mindful of avoiding wasteful
constructs such <br>
as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my @lines =
&lt;$very_large_file&gt;; # bad</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while (&lt;$fh&gt;) {$file .=
$_} # sometimes bad <br>
my $file = join(&rsquo;&rsquo;, &lt;$fh&gt;); # better</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last two constructs may
appear unintuitive to most people. The first repeatedly
grows a string, whereas the second allocates a large chunk
of memory in one go. On some <br>
systems, the second is more efficient that the first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
Most multi-user platforms provide basic levels of security,
usually implemented at the filesystem level. Some, however,
unfortunately do not. Thus the notion of user id, or <br>
&quot;home&quot; directory, or even the state of being
logged-in, may be unrecognizable on many platforms. If you
write programs that are security-conscious, it is usually
best to know <br>
what type of system you will be running under so that you
can write code explicitly for that platform (or class of
platforms).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t assume the Unix
filesystem access semantics: the operating system or the
filesystem may be using some ACL systems, which are richer
languages than the usual rwx. Even if <br>
the rwx exist, their semantics might be different.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(From security viewpoint testing
for permissions before attempting to do something is silly
anyway: if one tries this, there is potential for race
conditions. Someone or <br>
something might change the permissions between the
permissions check and the actual operation. Just try the
operation.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t assume the Unix user
and group semantics: especially, don&rsquo;t expect the
$&lt; and $&gt; (or the $( and $)) to work for switching
identities (or memberships).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t assume set-uid and
set-gid semantics. (And even if you do, think twice: set-uid
and set-gid are a known can of security worms.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style <br>
For those times when it is necessary to have
platform-specific code, consider keeping the
platform-specific code in one place, making porting to other
platforms easier. Use the <br>
Config module and the special variable $^O to differentiate
platforms, as described in &quot;PLATFORMS&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be careful in the tests you
supply with your module or programs. Module code may be
fully portable, but its tests might not be. This often
happens when tests spawn off other <br>
processes or call external programs to aid in the testing,
or when (as noted above) the tests assume certain things
about the filesystem and paths. Be careful not to depend on
a <br>
specific output style for errors, such as when checking $!
after a failed system call. Using $! for anything else than
displaying it as output is doubtful (though see the Errno
<br>
module for testing reasonably portably for error value).
Some platforms expect a certain output format, and Perl on
those platforms may have been adjusted accordingly. Most
<br>
specifically, don&rsquo;t anchor a regex when testing an
error value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPAN Testers <br>
Modules uploaded to CPAN are tested by a variety of
volunteers on different platforms. These CPAN testers are
notified by mail of each new upload, and reply to the list
with <br>
PASS, FAIL, NA (not applicable to this platform), or UNKNOWN
(unknown), along with any relevant notations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The purpose of the testing is
twofold: one, to help developers fix any problems in their
code that crop up because of lack of testing on other
platforms; two, to provide users <br>
with information about whether a given module works on a
given platform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also see:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLATFORMS <br>
As of version 5.002, Perl is built with a $^O variable that
indicates the operating system it was built on. This was
implemented to help speed up code that would otherwise have
<br>
to &quot;use Config&quot; and use the value of
$Config{osname}. Of course, to get more detailed information
about the system, looking into %Config is certainly
recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%Config cannot always be
trusted, however, because it was built at compile time. If
perl was built in one place, then transferred elsewhere,
some values may be wrong. The <br>
values may even have been edited after the fact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unix <br>
Perl works on a bewildering variety of Unix and Unix-like
platforms (see e.g. most of the files in the hints/
directory in the source code kit). On most of these systems,
the <br>
value of $^O (hence $Config{&rsquo;osname&rsquo;}, too) is
determined either by lowercasing and stripping punctuation
from the first field of the string returned by typing
&quot;uname -a&quot; (or a <br>
similar command) at the shell prompt or by testing the file
system for the presence of uniquely named files such as a
kernel or header file. Here, for example, are a few of the
<br>
more popular Unix flavors:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uname $^O

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because the value of
$Config{archname} may depend on the hardware architecture,
it can vary more than the value of $^O.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOS and Derivatives <br>
Perl has long been ported to Intel-style microcomputers
running under systems like PC-DOS, MS-DOS, OS/2, and most
Windows platforms you can bring yourself to mention (except
for <br>
Windows CE, if you count that). Users familiar with
COMMAND.COM or CMD.EXE style shells should be aware that
each of these file specifications may have subtle
differences:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $filespec0 =
&quot;c:/foo/bar/file.txt&quot;; <br>
my $filespec1 = &quot;c:\foo\bar\file.txt&quot;; r l e .
<br>
my $filespec2 = &rsquo;c:ot x t &rsquo; ; <br>
my $filespec3 = &rsquo;c:\foo\bar\file.txt&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">System calls accept either
&quot;/&quot; or &quot; <br>
containing &quot;/&quot;. Aside from calling any external
programs, &quot;/&quot; will work just fine, and probably
better, as it is more consistent with popular usage, and
avoids the problem of <br>
remembering what to backwhack and what not to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DOS FAT filesystem can
accommodate only &quot;8.3&quot; style filenames. Under the
&quot;case-insensitive, but case-preserving&quot; HPFS
(OS/2) and NTFS (NT) filesystems you may have to be <br>
careful about case returned with functions like
&quot;readdir&quot; or used with functions like
&quot;open&quot; or &quot;opendir&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOS also treats several
filenames as special, such as AUX, PRN, NUL, CON, COM1,
LPT1, LPT2, etc. Unfortunately, sometimes these filenames
won&rsquo;t even work if you include an <br>
explicit directory prefix. It is best to avoid such
filenames, if you want your code to be portable to DOS and
its derivatives. It&rsquo;s hard to know what these all are,
<br>
unfortunately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users of these operating systems
may also wish to make use of scripts such as pl2bat.bat or
pl2cmd to put wrappers around your scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Newline (&quot;0) is translated
as &quot; 15 12&quot; by STDIO when reading from and writing
to files (see &quot;Newlines&quot;).
&quot;binmode(FILEHANDLE)&quot; will keep &quot;0 translated
as &quot; 12&quot; for that <br>
filehandle. Since it is a no-op on other systems,
&quot;binmode&quot; should be used for cross-platform code
that deals with binary data. That&rsquo;s assuming you
realize in advance that your <br>
data is in binary. General-purpose programs should often
assume nothing about their data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The $^O variable and the
$Config{archname} values for various DOSish perls are as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VMS <br>
Perl on VMS is discussed in perlvms in the perl
distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The official name of VMS as of
this writing is OpenVMS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl on VMS can accept either
VMS- or Unix-style file specifications as in either of the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ perl -ne &quot;print if
/perl_setup/i&quot; SYS$LOGIN:LOGIN.COM <br>
$ perl -ne &quot;print if /perl_setup/i&quot;
/sys$login/login.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but not a mixture of both as
in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ perl -ne &quot;print if
/perl_setup/i&quot; sys$login:/login.com <br>
Can&rsquo;t open sys$login:/login.com: file specification
syntax error</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interacting with Perl from the
Digital Command Language (DCL) shell often requires a
different set of quotation marks than Unix shells do. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ perl -e &quot;print
&quot;&quot;Hello, world.0&quot;&quot; <br>
Hello, world.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several ways to wrap
your perl scripts in DCL .COM files, if you are so inclined.
For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ write sys$output &quot;Hello
from DCL!&quot; <br>
$ if p1 .eqs. &quot;&quot; <br>
$ then perl -x &rsquo;f$environment(&quot;PROCEDURE&quot;)
<br>
$ else perl -x - &rsquo;p1 &rsquo;p2 &rsquo;p3 &rsquo;p4
&rsquo;p5 &rsquo;p6 &rsquo;p7 &rsquo;p8 <br>
$ deck/dollars=&quot;__END__&quot; <br>
#!/usr/bin/perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;Hello from
Perl!0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">__END__ <br>
$ endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do take care with &quot;$
ASSIGN/nolog/user SYS$COMMAND: SYS$INPUT&quot; if your
perl-in-DCL script expects to do things like &quot;$read =
&lt;STDIN&gt;;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The VMS operating system has two
filesystems, known as ODS-2 and ODS-5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For ODS-2, filenames are in the
format &quot;name.extension;version&quot;. The maximum
length for filenames is 39 characters, and the maximum
length for extensions is also 39 characters. <br>
Version is a number from 1 to 32767. Valid characters are
&quot;/[A-Z0-9$_-]/&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ODS-2 filesystem is
case-insensitive and does not preserve case. Perl simulates
this by converting all filenames to lowercase
internally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For ODS-5, filenames may have
almost any character in them and can include Unicode
characters. Characters that could be misinterpreted by the
DCL shell or file parsing utilities <br>
need to be prefixed with the &quot;^&quot; character, or
replaced with hexadecimal characters prefixed with the
&quot;^&quot; character. Such prefixing is only needed with
the pathnames are in VMS <br>
format in applications. Programs that can accept the Unix
format of pathnames do not need the escape characters. The
maximum length for filenames is 255 characters. The ODS-5
<br>
file system can handle both a case preserved and a case
sensitive mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ODS-5 is only available on the
OpenVMS for 64 bit platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for the extended file
specifications is being done as optional settings to
preserve backward compatibility with Perl scripts that
assume the previous VMS limitations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general routines on VMS that
get a Unix format file specification should return it in a
Unix format, and when they get a VMS format specification
they should return a VMS <br>
format unless they are documented to do a conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For routines that generate
return a file specification, VMS allows setting if the C
library which Perl is built on if it will be returned in VMS
format or in Unix format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the ODS-2 file system,
there is not much difference in syntax of filenames without
paths for VMS or Unix. With the extended character set
available with ODS-5 there can be <br>
a significant difference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because of this, existing Perl
scripts written for VMS were sometimes treating VMS and Unix
filenames interchangeably. Without the extended character
set enabled, this behavior <br>
will mostly be maintained for backwards compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When extended characters are
enabled with ODS-5, the handling of Unix formatted file
specifications is to that of a Unix system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VMS file specifications without
extensions have a trailing dot. An equivalent Unix file
specification should not show the trailing dot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The result of all of this, is
that for VMS, for portable scripts, you can not depend on
Perl to present the filenames in lowercase, to be case
sensitive, and that the filenames <br>
could be returned in either Unix or VMS format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And if a routine returns a file
specification, unless it is intended to convert it, it
should return it in the same format as it found it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;readdir&quot; by default
has traditionally returned lowercased filenames. When the
ODS-5 support is enabled, it will return the exact case of
the filename on the disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files without extensions have a
trailing period on them, so doing a &quot;readdir&quot; in
the default mode with a file named A.;5 will return a. when
VMS is (though that file could be <br>
opened with &quot;open(FH, &rsquo;A&rsquo;)&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With support for extended file
specifications and if &quot;opendir&quot; was given a Unix
format directory, a file named A.;5 will return a and
optionally in the exact case on the disk. <br>
When &quot;opendir&quot; is given a VMS format directory,
then &quot;readdir&quot; should return a., and again with
the optionally the exact case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RMS had an eight level limit on
directory depths from any rooted logical (allowing 16 levels
overall) prior to VMS 7.2, and even with versions of VMS on
VAX up through 7.3. <br>
Hence &quot;PERL_ROOT:[LIB.2.3.4.5.6.7.8]&quot; is a valid
directory specification but
&quot;PERL_ROOT:[LIB.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9]&quot; is not.
Makefile.PL authors might have to take this into account,
<br>
but at least they can refer to the former as
&quot;/PERL_ROOT/lib/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pumpkings and module integrators
can easily see whether files with too many directory levels
have snuck into the core by running the following in the
top-level source directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ perl -ne &quot;$_=~s/*//;
print if scalar(split //) &gt; 8;&quot; &lt; MANIFEST</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The VMS::Filespec module, which
gets installed as part of the build process on VMS, is a
pure Perl module that can easily be installed on non-VMS
platforms and can be helpful for <br>
conversions to and from RMS native formats. It is also now
the only way that you should check to see if VMS is in a
case sensitive mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What &quot;0 represents depends
on the type of file opened. It usually represents &quot;
12&quot; but it could also be &quot; 15&quot;, &quot;
12&quot;, &quot; 15 12&quot;, &quot; 00&quot;, &quot;
40&quot;, or nothing depending on <br>
the file organization and record format. The VMS::Stdio
module provides access to the special fopen() requirements
of files with unusual attributes on VMS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP/IP stacks are optional on
VMS, so socket routines might not be implemented. UDP
sockets may not be supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The TCP/IP library support for
all current versions of VMS is dynamically loaded if
present, so even if the routines are configured, they may
return a status indicating that they <br>
are not implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of $^O on OpenVMS is
&quot;VMS&quot;. To determine the architecture that you are
running on without resorting to loading all of %Config you
can examine the content of the @INC <br>
array like so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (grep(/VMS_AXP/, @INC)) {
<br>
print &quot;I&rsquo;m on Alpha!0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">} elsif (grep(/VMS_VAX/, @INC))
{ <br>
print &quot;I&rsquo;m on VAX!0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">} elsif (grep(/VMS_IA64/, @INC))
{ <br>
print &quot;I&rsquo;m on IA64!0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">} else { <br>
print &quot;I&rsquo;m not so sure about where $^O is...0;
<br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, the significant
differences should only be if Perl is running on VMS_VAX or
one of the 64 bit OpenVMS platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On VMS, perl determines the UTC
offset from the &quot;SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL&quot;
logical name. Although the VMS epoch began at 17-NOV-1858
00:00:00.00, calls to &quot;localtime&quot; are <br>
adjusted to count offsets from 01-JAN-1970 00:00:00.00, just
like Unix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VOS <br>
Perl on VOS (also known as OpenVOS) is discussed in
README.vos in the perl distribution (installed as perlvos).
Perl on VOS can accept either VOS- or Unix-style file <br>
specifications as in either of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ perl -ne &quot;print if
/perl_setup/i&quot; &gt;system&gt;notices <br>
$ perl -ne &quot;print if /perl_setup/i&quot;
/system/notices</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or even a mixture of both as
in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ perl -ne &quot;print if
/perl_setup/i&quot; &gt;system/notices</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even though VOS allows the slash
character to appear in object names, because the VOS port of
Perl interprets it as a pathname delimiting character, VOS
files, directories, or <br>
links whose names contain a slash character cannot be
processed. Such files must be renamed before they can be
processed by Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Older releases of VOS (prior to
OpenVOS Release 17.0) limit file names to 32 or fewer
characters, prohibit file names from starting with a
&quot;-&quot; character, and prohibit file names <br>
from containing any character matching &quot;tr/
!#%&amp;&rsquo;()*;&lt;=&gt;?//&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Newer releases of VOS (OpenVOS
Release 17.0 or later) support a feature known as extended
names. On these releases, file names can contain up to 255
characters, are prohibited <br>
from starting with a &quot;-&quot; character, and the set of
prohibited characters is reduced to any character matching
&quot;tr/#%*&lt;&gt;?//&quot;. There are restrictions
involving spaces and <br>
apostrophes: these characters must not begin or end a name,
nor can they immediately precede or follow a period.
Additionally, a space must not immediately precede another
<br>
space or hyphen. Specifically, the following character
combinations are prohibited: space-space, space-hyphen,
period-space, space-period, period-apostrophe,
apostrophe-period, <br>
leading or trailing space, and leading or trailing
apostrophe. Although an extended file name is limited to 255
characters, a path name is still limited to 256
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of $^O on VOS is
&quot;VOS&quot;. To determine the architecture that you are
running on without resorting to loading all of %Config you
can examine the content of the @INC array <br>
like so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ($^O =~ /VOS/) { <br>
print &quot;I&rsquo;m on a Stratus box!0; <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EBCDIC Platforms <br>
Recent versions of Perl have been ported to platforms such
as OS/400 on AS/400 minicomputers as well as OS/390, VM/ESA,
and BS2000 for S/390 Mainframes. Such computers use <br>
EBCDIC character sets internally (usually Character Code Set
ID 0037 for OS/400 and either 1047 or POSIX-BC for S/390
systems). On the mainframe perl currently works under the
<br>
&quot;Unix system services for OS/390&quot; (formerly known
as OpenEdition), VM/ESA OpenEdition, or the BS200 POSIX-BC
system (BS2000 is supported in perl 5.6 and greater). See
perlos390 <br>
for details. Note that for OS/400 there is also a port of
Perl 5.8.1/5.9.0 or later to the PASE which is ASCII-based
(as opposed to ILE which is EBCDIC-based), see
perlos400.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of R2.5 of USS for OS/390 and
Version 2.3 of VM/ESA these Unix sub-systems do not support
the &quot;#!&quot; shebang trick for script invocation.
Hence, on OS/390 and VM/ESA perl <br>
scripts can be executed with a header similar to the
following simple script:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">: # use perl <br>
eval &rsquo;exec /usr/local/bin/perl -S $0
${1+&quot;$@&quot;}&rsquo; <br>
if 0; <br>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl # just a comment really</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;Hello from
perl!0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OS/390 will support the
&quot;#!&quot; shebang trick in release 2.8 and beyond.
Calls to &quot;system&quot; and backticks can use POSIX
shell syntax on all S/390 systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the AS/400, if PERL5 is in
your library list, you may need to wrap your perl scripts in
a CL procedure to invoke them like so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEGIN <br>
CALL PGM(PERL5/PERL) PARM(&rsquo;/QOpenSys/hello.pl&rsquo;)
<br>
ENDPGM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will invoke the perl script
hello.pl in the root of the QOpenSys file system. On the
AS/400 calls to &quot;system&quot; or backticks must use CL
syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On these platforms, bear in mind
that the EBCDIC character set may have an effect on what
happens with some perl functions (such as &quot;chr&quot;,
&quot;pack&quot;, &quot;print&quot;, &quot;printf&quot;,
&quot;ord&quot;, <br>
&quot;sort&quot;, &quot;sprintf&quot;, &quot;unpack&quot;),
as well as bit-fiddling with ASCII constants using operators
like &quot;^&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot; and &quot;|&quot;, not
to mention dealing with socket interfaces to ASCII computers
<br>
(see &quot;Newlines&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fortunately, most web servers
for the mainframe will correctly translate the &quot;0 in
the following statement to its&quot; is the same under both
Unix and OS/390 ASCII equivalent (&quot; <br>
&amp; VM/ESA): 0r0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;Content-type:
text/html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The values of $^O on some of
these platforms includes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uname $^O
$Config{&rsquo;archname&rsquo;} <br>
-------------------------------------------- <br>
OS/390 os390 os390 <br>
OS400 os400 os400 <br>
POSIX-BC posix-bc BS2000-posix-bc <br>
VM/ESA vmesa vmesa</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some simple tricks for
determining if you are running on an EBCDIC platform could
include any of the following (perhaps all):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (&quot;&quot; eq &quot;
05&quot;) { print &quot;EBCDIC may be spoken here!0; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (ord(&rsquo;A&rsquo;) == 193)
{ print &quot;EBCDIC may be spoken here!0; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (chr(169) eq &rsquo;z&rsquo;)
{ print &quot;EBCDIC may be spoken here!0; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One thing you may not want to
rely on is the EBCDIC encoding of punctuation characters
since these may differ from code page to code page (and once
your module or script is <br>
rumoured to work with EBCDIC, folks will want it to work
with all EBCDIC character sets).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acorn RISC OS <br>
Because Acorns use ASCII with newlines (&quot;0) in text
files as &quot; 12&quot; like Unix, and because Unix
filename emulation is turned on by default, most simple
scripts will probably <br>
work &quot;out of the box&quot;. The native filesystem is
modular, and individual filesystems are free to be
case-sensitive or insensitive, and are usually
case-preserving. Some native <br>
filesystems have name length limits, which file and
directory names are silently truncated to fit. Scripts
should be aware that the standard filesystem currently has a
name <br>
length limit of 10 characters, with up to 77 items in a
directory, but other filesystems may not impose such
limitations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Native filenames are of the
form</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filesystem#Special_Field::DiskName.$.Directory.Directory.File</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special_Field is not usually
present, but may contain . and $ . <br>
Filesystem =~ m|[A-Za-z0-9_]| <br>
DsicName =~ m|[A-Za-z0-9_/]| <br>
$ represents the root directory <br>
. is the path separator <br>
@ is the current directory (per filesystem but machine
global) <br>
^ is the parent directory <br>
Directory and File =~ m|[^ - &quot;.:@\^177]+|</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default filename translation
is roughly &quot;tr|/.|./|;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that
&quot;&quot;ADFS::HardDisk.$.File&quot; ne
&rsquo;ADFS::HardDisk.$.File&rsquo;&quot; and that the
second stage of &quot;$&quot; interpolation in regular
expressions will fall foul of the $. if scripts are not <br>
careful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logical paths specified by
system variables containing comma-separated search lists are
also allowed; hence &quot;System:Modules&quot; is a valid
filename, and the filesystem will prefix <br>
&quot;Modules&quot; with each section of
&quot;System$Path&quot; until a name is made that points to
an object on disk. Writing to a new file
&quot;System:Modules&quot; would be allowed only if
&quot;System$Path&quot; <br>
contains a single item list. The filesystem will also expand
system variables in filenames if enclosed in angle brackets,
so &quot;&lt;System$Dir&gt;.Modules&quot; would look for the
file <br>
&quot;$ENV{&rsquo;System$Dir&rsquo;} .
&rsquo;Modules&rsquo;&quot;. The obvious implication of this
is that fully qualified filenames can start with
&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; and should be protected when
&quot;open&quot; is used for input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because &quot;.&quot; was in use
as a directory separator and filenames could not be assumed
to be unique after 10 characters, Acorn implemented the C
compiler to strip the trailing &quot;.c&quot; <br>
&quot;.h&quot; &quot;.s&quot; and &quot;.o&quot; suffix from
filenames specified in source code and store the respective
files in subdirectories named after the suffix. Hence files
are translated:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foo.h h.foo <br>
C:foo.h C:h.foo (logical path variable) <br>
sys/os.h sys.h.os (C compiler groks Unix-speak) <br>
10charname.c c.10charname <br>
10charname.o o.10charname <br>
11charname_.c c.11charname (assuming filesystem truncates at
10)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Unix emulation
library&rsquo;s translation of filenames to native assumes
that this sort of translation is required, and it allows a
user-defined list of known suffixes that it <br>
will transpose in this fashion. This may seem transparent,
but consider that with these rules foo/bar/baz.h and
foo/bar/h/baz both map to foo.bar.h.baz, and that
&quot;readdir&quot; and <br>
&quot;glob&quot; cannot and do not attempt to emulate the
reverse mapping. Other &quot;.&quot;&rsquo;s in filenames
are translated to &quot;/&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As implied above, the
environment accessed through %ENV is global, and the
convention is that program specific environment variables
are of the form &quot;Program$Name&quot;. Each <br>
filesystem maintains a current directory, and the current
filesystem&rsquo;s current directory is the global current
directory. Consequently, sociable programs don&rsquo;t
change the <br>
current directory but rely on full pathnames, and programs
(and Makefiles) cannot assume that they can spawn a child
process which can change the current directory without <br>
affecting its parent (and everyone else for that
matter).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because native operating system
filehandles are global and are currently allocated down from
255, with 0 being a reserved value, the Unix emulation
library emulates Unix <br>
filehandles. Consequently, you can&rsquo;t rely on passing
&quot;STDIN&quot;, &quot;STDOUT&quot;, or &quot;STDERR&quot;
to your children.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The desire of users to express
filenames of the form &quot;&lt;Foo$Dir&gt;.Bar&quot; on the
command line unquoted causes problems, too:
&quot;&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot; command output capture has to
perform a guessing <br>
game. It assumes that a string
&quot;&lt;[^&lt;&gt;]+&gt;&quot; is a reference to an
environment variable, whereas anything else involving
&quot;&lt;&quot; or &quot;&gt;&quot; is redirection, and
generally manages to <br>
be 99% right. Of course, the problem remains that scripts
cannot rely on any Unix tools being available, or that any
tools found have Unix-like command line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extensions and XS are, in
theory, buildable by anyone using free tools. In practice,
many don&rsquo;t, as users of the Acorn platform are used to
binary distributions. MakeMaker does <br>
run, but no available make currently copes with
MakeMaker&rsquo;s makefiles; even if and when this should be
fixed, the lack of a Unix-like shell will cause problems
with makefile <br>
rules, especially lines of the form &quot;cd sdbm &amp;&amp;
make all&quot;, and anything using quoting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;RISC OS&quot; is the
proper name for the operating system, but the value in $^O
is &quot;riscos&quot; (because we don&rsquo;t like
shouting).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other perls <br>
Perl has been ported to many platforms that do not fit into
any of the categories listed above. Some, such as AmigaOS,
BeOS, HP MPE/iX, QNX, Plan 9, and VOS, have been well- <br>
integrated into the standard Perl source code kit. You may
need to see the ports/ directory on CPAN for information,
and possibly binaries, for the likes of: aos, Atari ST, <br>
lynxos, riscos, Novell Netware, Tandem Guardian, etc. (Yes,
we know that some of these OSes may fall under the Unix
category, but we are not a standards body.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some approximate operating

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUNCTION IMPLEMENTATIONS <br>
Listed below are functions that are either completely
unimplemented or else have been implemented differently on
various platforms. Following each description will be, in
<br>
parentheses, a list of platforms that the description
applies to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list may well be incomplete,
or even wrong in some places. When in doubt, consult the
platform-specific README files in the Perl source
distribution, and any other <br>
documentation resources accompanying a given port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be aware, moreover, that even
among Unix-ish systems there are variations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For many functions, you can also
query %Config, exported by default from the Config module.
For example, to check whether the platform has the
&quot;lstat&quot; call, check <br>
$Config{d_lstat}. See Config for a full description of
available variables.</p>

-X &quot;-w&quot; only inspects the read-only file attribute
(FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY), which determines whether the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exit Emulates Unix exit() (which
considers &quot;exit 1&quot; to indicate an error) by
mapping the 1 to SS$_ABORT (44). This behavior may be
overridden with the pragma &quot;use vmsish <br>
&rsquo;exit&rsquo;&quot;. As with the CRTL&rsquo;s exit()
function, &quot;exit 0&quot; is also mapped to an exit
status of SS$_NORMAL (1); this mapping cannot be overridden.
Any other argument to <br>
exit() is used directly as Perl&rsquo;s exit status. On VMS,
unless the future POSIX_EXIT mode is enabled, the exit code
should always be a valid VMS exit code and not a <br>
generic number. When the POSIX_EXIT mode is enabled, a
generic number will be encoded in a method compatible with
the C library _POSIX_EXIT macro so that it can be <br>
decoded by other programs, particularly ones written in C,
like the GNV package. (VMS)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">system As an optimization, may
not call the command shell specified in $ENV{PERL5SHELL}.
&quot;system(1, @args)&quot; spawns an external process and

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) in DOS mode either the DOS or
OS/2 ports can be used <br>
2) compilers: Borland, MinGW (GCC), VC6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following platforms worked
with the previous releases (5.6 and 5.7), but we did not
manage either to fix or to test these in time for the 5.8.0
release. There is a very good <br>
chance that many of these will work fine with the 5.8.0.</p>

(but 5.6.1 and 5.7.2 can be used):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AmigaOS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following platforms have
been known to build Perl from source in the past (5.005_03
and earlier), but we haven&rsquo;t been able to verify their
status for the current release, <br>
either because the hardware/software platforms are rare or
because we don&rsquo;t have an active champion on these
platforms--or both. They used to work, though, so go ahead
and try <br>
compiling them, and let perlbug@perl.org of any trouble.</p>

always build your own Perl from the source code, both for
maximal configurability and for security, in case you are in
a hurry you can check <br>
