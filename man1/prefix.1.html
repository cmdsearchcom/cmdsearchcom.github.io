prefix - Script that allows you to reconfigure environment variables for
  multiple installations of a set of software installed on the same machine

It is assumed that the software for each installation is all under a single
  directory whose name is assigned to an environment variable called PREFIX.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This arrangement of enabling multiple installations of software on a single
  machine is useful at many times. On a single server, it can provide for
  development, test, and production installations of software. Alternatively, on
  development servers, it allows for multiple development &quot;sandboxes&quot;,
  one for each developer. On production servers, it allows for multiple versions
  of the production software to be installed. One might be the currently running
  software, one the previous software kept online as a fall-back, and one a new
  release of software wich is scheduled to be brought online soon.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are three usages of the prefix script:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(1) The interactive usage should be placed as the last line
    <br/>
     of a user's &quot;.profile&quot;. The user must be running the
    <br/>
     Korn shell (ksh) or the Bourne Again shell (bash).
    <br/>
     The user is prompted to enter one of the known PREFIX locations,
    <br/>
     specified in the $HOME/.prefixes file or the /etc/prefixes file.
    <br/>
     During configuration, the $PREFIX/.prefixrc file is sourced
    <br/>
     in order to accomplish environment-specific configurations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(2) The non-interactive user configuration does not consult
    <br/>
     $HOME/.prefixes or /etc/prefixes or prompt the user, but merely
    <br/>
     configures the environment in accordance with the cmd line argument.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(3) The batch command usage is mainly for running commands
      from
    <br/>
     cron or running commands in another environment without changing
    <br/>
     to that environment.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Usage (1): . prefix (sets up environment)
<br/>
 (2): . prefix &lt;prefix&gt; (non-interactive setup)
<br/>
 (3): prefix &lt;prefix&gt; &lt;cmd&gt; &lt;args&gt; (runs cmd configured for
  PREFIX)
