<p>CVSUTILS(1) General Commands Manual CVSUTILS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cvsutils - CVS utilities for use in working directories</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cvsu [options] <br>
cvsco [ options ] <br>
cvsdiscard [ options ] <br>
cvspurge [ options ] <br>
cvstrim [ options ] <br>
cvschroot [ options ] <br>
cvsdo [ options ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The idea of cvsutils is to facilitate working with the files
in the working directory of a developer using CVS
(Concurrent Versions System).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From the point of view of CVS,
working directories have low value, since they can easily be
recreated using the cvs checkout command. Also the cvs
update command will show the <br>
status of the files, i.e. whether they have been modified,
added or removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVS in it&rsquo;s current state
is a client-server system that does most of its work on the
server side. CVS provides only few (if any) means for
managing the working directory without <br>
communicating with the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are, however, several
reasons why such means are necessary:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* There is enough information on
the client side to create fast tools for sorting and purging
the working directory without contacting the CVS server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Checking out a big module over
a slow line can take too much time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* There should be support for
disconnected operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* CVS poses certain unnecessary
restrictions on read-only users, e.g. cvs add command
doesn&rsquo;t work for them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVSU <br>
cvsu is &quot;cvs update offline&quot;. It lists the files
found in the current directory (or in the directories which
you specify). Following is taken into account:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Attributes of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Information about the file in
CVS/Entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Timestamp of the file compared
to the timestamp stored in CVS/Entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run cvsu --help to see supported
command line options. The options can be abbreviated. This
functionality is provided by Perl, and can vary from one
machine to another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVSCO <br>
cvsco is a &quot;cruel checkout&quot;. In other words, it
removes results of compilation and discards local changes.
It deletes all the files except listed unmodified ones and
checks out <br>
everything which seems to be missing. Please note, that
cvsco doesn&rsquo;t update files which haven&rsquo;t been
modified locally. It only reloads missing files and files
which it erases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVSDISCARD <br>
cvsdiscard is &quot;discard my changes&quot;. In other
words, it discards local changes but keeps results of
compilation. It works like cvsco, but it only deletes files
which are likely to <br>
cause merge conflicts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVSPURGE <br>
cvspurge leaves all files known to CVS, but removes the
rest. Unlike cvsco, it doesn&rsquo;t remove local changes.
It is useful to test local changes in the otherwise clean
source <br>
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVSTRIM <br>
cvstrim removes files and directories unknown to CVS. Files
listed in .cvsignore are not removed. The idea is to remove
the files that are not resulted from the normal build <br>
process - backups, coredumps etc. cvstrim relies on
.cvsignore files being correct. Note that the backups for
modified files are removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVSCHROOT <br>
cvschroot makes it possible to change CVS/Root in all
subdirectories to the given value. Currently the only
argument accepted is the new CVSROOT value. Old-style
CVS/Repository <br>
files that contain the full path to the repository are
updated to reflect the change. New-style CVS/Repository
don&rsquo;t need to be changed. If the environment variable
CVSROOT is <br>
defined, it overrides the contents of CVS/Root. In other
words, it is treated as the old CVS root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVSDO <br>
cvsdo simulates some of the CVS commands (currently add,
remove and diff) without any access to the CVS server. Using
cvsdo add and cvsdo remove allows you to create diffs with
<br>
cvs diff -N, and all removed and added files will appear in
the diff correctly, as if you had used cvs add and cvs
remove respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvsdo diff tries to locate the
backup copies of the modified files. If they can be found,
they are compared with the current version using diff. Only
those backup copies are <br>
used that have the modification date equal the date listed
in CVS/Entries for the modified file. cvsdo diff patches the
diff output to make it more robust to apply. An exception
<br>
is made for files named &quot;ChangeLog&quot; - in this case
diff will be instructed to omit all context lines, so that
the patch can be applied even if other changes have been
written to <br>
the ChangeLog. Also the added files are handled properly.
The header of the diff output is patched in such way that at
least GNU patch will create a new file when the resulting
<br>
patch is applied and remove that file when the patch is
reverted.</p>
