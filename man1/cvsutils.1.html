cvsutils - CVS utilities for use in working directories

The idea of <b>cvsutils</b> is to facilitate working with the files in the
  working directory of a developer using CVS (Concurrent Versions System).
<div class="Pp"></div>
From the point of view of CVS, working directories have low value, since they
  can easily be recreated using the <b>cvs checkout</b> command. Also the <b>cvs
  update</b> command will show the status of the files, i.e. whether they have
  been modified, added or removed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
CVS in it's current state is a client-server system that does most of its work
  on the server side. CVS provides only few (if any) means for managing the
  working directory without communicating with the server.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are, however, several reasons why such means are necessary:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">*</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">There is enough information on the client side to create
      fast tools for sorting and purging the working directory without
      contacting the CVS server.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">*</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Checking out a big module over a slow line can take too
      much time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">*</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">There should be support for disconnected operations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">*</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">CVS poses certain unnecessary restrictions on read-only
      users, e.g. <b>cvs add</b> command doesn't work for them.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CVSU"><a class="selflink" href="#CVSU">CVSU</a></h1>
<b>cvsu</b> is &quot;cvs update offline&quot;. It lists the files found in the
  current directory (or in the directories which you specify). Following is
  taken into account:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">*</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Attributes of the file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">*</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Information about the file in CVS/Entries.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">*</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Timestamp of the file compared to the timestamp stored in
      CVS/Entries.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Run <b>cvsu --help</b> to see supported command line options. The options can be
  abbreviated. This functionality is provided by Perl, and can vary from one
  machine to another.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CVSCO"><a class="selflink" href="#CVSCO">CVSCO</a></h1>
<b>cvsco</b> is a &quot;cruel checkout&quot;. In other words, it removes results
  of compilation and discards local changes. It deletes all the files except
  listed unmodified ones and checks out everything which seems to be missing.
  Please note, that <b>cvsco</b> doesn't update files which haven't been
  modified locally. It only reloads missing files and files which it erases.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CVSDISCARD"><a class="selflink" href="#CVSDISCARD">CVSDISCARD</a></h1>
<b>cvsdiscard</b> is &quot;discard my changes&quot;. In other words, it discards
  local changes but keeps results of compilation. It works like <b>cvsco</b>,
  but it only deletes files which are likely to cause merge conflicts.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CVSPURGE"><a class="selflink" href="#CVSPURGE">CVSPURGE</a></h1>
<b>cvspurge</b> leaves all files known to CVS, but removes the rest. Unlike
  cvsco, it doesn't remove local changes. It is useful to test local changes in
  the otherwise clean source tree.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CVSTRIM"><a class="selflink" href="#CVSTRIM">CVSTRIM</a></h1>
<b>cvstrim</b> removes files and directories unknown to CVS. Files listed in
  <b>.cvsignore</b> are not removed. The idea is to remove the files that are
  not resulted from the normal build process - backups, coredumps etc.
  <b>cvstrim</b> relies on <b>.cvsignore</b> files being correct. Note that the
  backups for modified files are removed.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CVSCHROOT"><a class="selflink" href="#CVSCHROOT">CVSCHROOT</a></h1>
<b>cvschroot</b> makes it possible to change CVS/Root in all subdirectories to
  the given value. Currently the only argument accepted is the new CVSROOT
  value. Old-style CVS/Repository files that contain the full path to the
  repository are updated to reflect the change. New-style CVS/Repository don't
  need to be changed. If the environment variable CVSROOT is defined, it
  overrides the contents of CVS/Root. In other words, it is treated as the
  <b>old</b> CVS root.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CVSDO"><a class="selflink" href="#CVSDO">CVSDO</a></h1>
<b>cvsdo</b> simulates some of the CVS commands (currently add, remove and diff)
  without any access to the CVS server. Using <b>cvsdo add</b> and <b>cvsdo
  remove</b> allows you to create diffs with <b>cvs diff -N</b>, and all removed
  and added files will appear in the diff correctly, as if you had used <b>cvs
  add</b> and <b>cvs remove</b> respectively.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>cvsdo diff</b> tries to locate the backup copies of the modified files. If
  they can be found, they are compared with the current version using
  <b>diff</b>. Only those backup copies are used that have the modification date
  equal the date listed in CVS/Entries for the modified file. <b>cvsdo diff</b>
  patches the diff output to make it more robust to apply. An exception is made
  for files named &quot;ChangeLog&quot; - in this case <b>diff</b> will be
  instructed to omit all context lines, so that the patch can be applied even if
  other changes have been written to the ChangeLog. Also the added files are
  handled properly. The header of the <b>diff</b> output is patched in such way
  that at least GNU patch will create a new file when the resulting patch is
  applied and remove that file when the patch is reverted.
