<p>PERL5122DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL5122DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5122delta - what is new for perl v5.12.2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.12.1
release and the 5.12.2 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier major version, such as 5.10.1, first read
perl5120delta, which describes differences between 5.10.1
and 5.12.0, as well as perl5121delta, <br>
which describes earlier changes in the 5.12 stable release
series.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.12.1.
If any exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Core Enhancements <br>
Other than the bug fixes listed below, there should be no
user-visible changes to the core language in this
release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
New Modules and Pragmata <br>
This release does not introduce any new modules or
pragmata.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pragmata Changes <br>
In the previous release, &quot;no VERSION;&quot; statements
triggered a bug which could cause feature bundles to be
loaded and strict mode to be enabled unintentionally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Updated Modules <br>
&quot;Carp&quot; <br>
Upgraded from version 1.16 to 1.17.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Carp now detects incomplete
caller() overrides and avoids using bogus @DB::args. To
provide backtraces, Carp relies on particular behaviour of
the caller built-in. Carp now <br>
detects if other code has overridden this with an incomplete
implementation, and modifies its backtrace accordingly.
Previously incomplete overrides would cause incorrect <br>
values in backtraces (best case), or obscure fatal errors
(worst case)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This fixes certain cases of
&quot;Bizarre copy of ARRAY&quot; caused by modules
overriding &quot;caller()&quot; incorrectly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;CPANPLUS&quot; <br>
A patch to cpanp-run-perl has been backported from CPANPLUS
0.9004. This resolves RT #55964
&lt;http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=55964&gt;
and RT #57106 <br>

&lt;http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=57106&gt;,
both of which related to failures to install distributions
that use &quot;Module::Install::DSL&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;File::Glob&quot; <br>
A regression which caused a failure to find
&quot;CORE::GLOBAL::glob&quot; after loading
&quot;File::Glob&quot; to crash has been fixed. Now, it
correctly falls back to external globbing via <br>
&quot;pp_glob&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;File::Copy&quot; <br>
&quot;File::Copy::copy(FILE, DIR)&quot; is now
documented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;File::Spec&quot; <br>
Upgraded from version 3.31 to 3.31_01.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several portability fixes were
made in &quot;File::Spec::VMS&quot;: a colon is now
recognized as a delimiter in native filespecs; caret-escaped
delimiters are recognized for better <br>
handling of extended filespecs; &quot;catpath()&quot;
returns an empty directory rather than the current directory
if the input directory name is empty; &quot;abs2rel()&quot;
properly handles <br>
Unix-style input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Utility Changes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; perlbug now always gives the reporter a
chance to change the email address it guesses for them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; perlbug should
no longer warn about uninitialized values when using the
&quot;-d&quot; and &quot;-v&quot; options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes to Existing
Documentation <br>
&Acirc;&middot; The existing policy on
backward-compatibility and deprecation has been added to
perlpolicy, along with definitions of terms like
deprecation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;srand&quot; in perlfunc&rsquo;s usage has been
clarified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The entry for
&quot;die&quot; in perlfunc was reorganized to emphasize its
role in the exception mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl&rsquo;s
INSTALL file has been clarified to explicitly state that
Perl requires a C89 compliant ANSI C Compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
IO::Socket&rsquo;s &quot;getsockopt()&quot; and
&quot;setsockopt()&quot; have been documented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; alarm()&rsquo;s
inability to interrupt blocking IO on Windows has been
documented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
Math::TrulyRandom hasn&rsquo;t been updated since 1996 and
has been removed as a recommended solution for random number
generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; perlrun has been
updated to clarify the behaviour of octal flags to perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; To ease user
confusion, $# and $*, two special variables that were
removed in earlier versions of Perl have been
documented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The version of
perlfaq shipped with the Perl core has been updated from the
official FAQ version, which is now maintained in the
&quot;briandfoy/perlfaq&quot; branch of the Perl <br>
repository at &lt;git://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Installation and Configuration
Improvements <br>
Configuration improvements <br>
&Acirc;&middot; The &quot;d_u32align&quot; configuration
probe on ARM has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compilation improvements <br>
&Acirc;&middot; An &quot;&quot;incompatible operand
types&quot;&quot; error in ternary expressions when building
with &quot;clang&quot; has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl now skips
setuid &quot;File::Copy&quot; tests on partitions it detects
to be mounted as &quot;nosuid&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; A possible segfault in the
&quot;T_PRTOBJ&quot; default typemap has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A possible
memory leak when using caller() to set @DB::args has been
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Several memory
leaks when loading XS modules were fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;unpack()&quot; now handles scalar context correctly
for %32H and %32u, fixing a potential crash.
&quot;split()&quot; would crash because the third item on
the stack wasn&rsquo;t the regular <br>
expression it expected. &quot;unpack(&quot;%2H&quot;,
...)&quot; would return both the unpacked result and the
checksum on the stack, as would
&quot;unpack(&quot;%2u&quot;, ...)&quot;. [perl #73814] <br>

&lt;http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=73814&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl now avoids
using memory after calling &quot;free()&quot; in pp_require
when there are CODEREFs in @INC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A bug that could
cause &quot;&quot;Unknown error&quot;&quot; messages when
&quot;&quot;call_sv(code, G_EVAL)&quot;&quot; is called from
an XS destructor has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
implementation of the &quot;open $fh, &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo;
uffer&quot; feature now supports get/set magic and thus tied
buffers correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;pp_getc&quot;, &quot;pp_tell&quot;, and
&quot;pp_eof&quot; opcodes now make room on the stack for
their return values in cases where no argument was passed
in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When matching
unicode strings under some conditions inappropriate
backtracking would result in a &quot;Malformed UTF-8
character (fatal)&quot; error. This should no longer occur.
See <br>
[perl #75680]
&lt;http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=75680&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Specific Notes <br>
AIX <br>
&Acirc;&middot; README.aix has been updated with information
about the XL C/C++ V11 compiler suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windows <br>
&Acirc;&middot; When building Perl with the mingw64 x64
cross-compiler &quot;incpath&quot;, &quot;libpth&quot;,
&quot;ldflags&quot;, &quot;lddlflags&quot; and
&quot;ldflags_nolargefiles&quot; values in Config.pm and
Config_heavy.pl were not <br>
previously being set correctly because, with that compiler,
the include and lib directories are not immediately below
&quot;$(CCHOME)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VMS <br>
&Acirc;&middot; git_version.h is now installed on VMS. This
was an oversight in v5.12.0 which caused some extensions to
fail to build.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Several memory
leaks in stat() have been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A memory leak in
&quot;Perl_rename()&quot; due to a double allocation has
been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A memory leak in
&quot;vms_fid_to_name()&quot; (used by
&quot;realpath()&quot; and &quot;realname()&quot;) has been
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . <br>
There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the
Perl Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the bug you are reporting has
security implications, which make it inappropriate to send
to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to
<br>
perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the
core committers, who will be able to help assess the impact
<br>
of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the
release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use <br>
this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for
modules independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
