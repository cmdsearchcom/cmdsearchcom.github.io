mk-fifo-split - Split files and pipe lines to a fifo without really splitting.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
Usage: mk-fifo-split [options] [FILE ...]
<div class="Pp"></div>
mk-fifo-split splits FILE and pipes lines to a fifo. With no FILE, or when FILE
  is -, read standard input.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Read hugefile.txt in chunks of a million lines without physically splitting it:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 mk-fifo-split --lines 1000000 hugefile.txt
 while [ -e /tmp/mk-fifo-split ]; do cat /tmp/mk-fifo-split; done
</pre>

The following section is included to inform users about the potential risks,
  whether known or unknown, of using this tool. The two main categories of risks
  are those created by the nature of the tool (e.g. read-only tools vs.
  read-write tools) and those created by bugs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
mk-fifo-split creates and/or deletes the &quot;--fifo&quot; file. Otherwise, no
  other files are modified, and it merely reads lines from the file given on the
  command-line. It should be very low-risk.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At the time of this release, we know of no bugs that could cause serious harm to
  users.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The authoritative source for updated information is always the online issue
  tracking system. Issues that affect this tool will be marked as such. You can
  see a list of such issues at the following URL:
  &lt;http://www.maatkit.org/bugs/mk-fifo-split&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See also &quot;BUGS&quot; for more information on filing bugs and getting help.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
mk-fifo-split lets you read from a file as though it contains only some of the
  lines in the file. When you read from it again, it contains the next set of
  lines; when you have gone all the way through it, the file disappears. This
  works only on Unix-like operating systems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can specify multiple files on the command line. If you don't specify any, or
  if you use the special filename &quot;-&quot;, lines are read from standard
  input.

    Begin at the Nth line. If the argument is 0, all lines are printed to the
      fifo. If 1, then beginning at the first line, lines are printed (exactly
      the same as 0). If 2, the first line is skipped, and the 2nd and
      subsequent lines are printed to the fifo.</dd>

    Create the given PID file. The file contains the process ID of the script.
      The PID file is removed when the script exits. Before starting, the script
      checks if the PID file already exists. If it does not, then the script
      creates and writes its own PID to it. If it does, then the script checks
      the following: if the file contains a PID and a process is running with
      that PID, then the script dies; or, if there is no process running with
      that PID, then the script overwrites the file with its own PID and starts;
      else, if the file contains no PID, then the script dies.</dd>

You can download Maatkit from Google Code at
  &lt;http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/&gt;, or you can get any of the tools
  easily with a command like the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   wget http://www.maatkit.org/get/toolname
   or
   wget http://www.maatkit.org/trunk/toolname
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Where &quot;toolname&quot; can be replaced with the name (or fragment of a name)
  of any of the Maatkit tools. Once downloaded, they're ready to run; no
  installation is needed. The first URL gets the latest released version of the
  tool, and the second gets the latest trunk code from Subversion.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
The environment variable &quot;MKDEBUG&quot; enables verbose debugging output in
  all of the Maatkit tools:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   MKDEBUG=1 mk-....
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS">SYSTEM
  REQUIREMENTS</a></h1>
You need Perl, DBI, DBD::mysql, and some core packages that ought to be
  installed in any reasonably new version of Perl.

Please use Google Code Issues and Groups to report bugs or request support:
  &lt;http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/&gt;. You can also join #maatkit on
  Freenode to discuss Maatkit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Please include the complete command-line used to reproduce the problem you are
  seeing, the version of all MySQL servers involved, the complete output of the
  tool when run with &quot;--version&quot;, and if possible, debugging output
  produced by running with the &quot;MKDEBUG=1&quot; environment variable.
