<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mk-fifo-split - Split files and pipe lines to a fifo without
really splitting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Usage: mk-fifo-split [options] [FILE ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk-fifo-split splits FILE and
pipes lines to a fifo. With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read
standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Read hugefile.txt in chunks of a
million lines without physically splitting it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk-fifo-split --lines 1000000
hugefile.txt <br>
while [ -e /tmp/mk-fifo-split ]; do cat /tmp/mk-fifo-split;
done</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RISKS <br>
The following section is included to inform users about the
potential risks, whether known or unknown, of using this
tool. The two main categories of risks are those created by
<br>
the nature of the tool (e.g. read-only tools vs. read-write
tools) and those created by bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk-fifo-split creates and/or
deletes the &quot;--fifo&quot; file. Otherwise, no other
files are modified, and it merely reads lines from the file
given on the command-line. It should be <br>
very low-risk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the time of this release, we
know of no bugs that could cause serious harm to users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The authoritative source for
updated information is always the online issue tracking
system. Issues that affect this tool will be marked as such.
You can see a list of such <br>
issues at the following URL:
&lt;http://www.maatkit.org/bugs/mk-fifo-split&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also &quot;BUGS&quot; for
more information on filing bugs and getting help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mk-fifo-split lets you read from a file as though it
contains only some of the lines in the file. When you read
from it again, it contains the next set of lines; when you
have <br>
gone all the way through it, the file disappears. This works
only on Unix-like operating systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify multiple files
on the command line. If you don&rsquo;t specify any, or if
you use the special filename &quot;-&quot;, lines are read
from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
This tool accepts additional command-line arguments. Refer
to the &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot; and usage information for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config <br>
type: Array</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Read this comma-separated list
of config files; if specified, this must be the first option
on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fifo <br>
type: string; default: /tmp/mk-fifo-split</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the fifo from which
the lines can be read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force <br>
Remove the fifo if it exists already, then create it
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
Show help and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lines <br>
type: int; default: 1000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of lines to read in
each chunk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--offset <br>
type: int; default: 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Begin at the Nth line. If the
argument is 0, all lines are printed to the fifo. If 1, then
beginning at the first line, lines are printed (exactly the
same as 0). If 2, <br>
the first line is skipped, and the 2nd and subsequent lines
are printed to the fifo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pid <br>
type: string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create the given PID file. The
file contains the process ID of the script. The PID file is
removed when the script exits. Before starting, the script
checks if the PID <br>
file already exists. If it does not, then the script creates
and writes its own PID to it. If it does, then the script
checks the following: if the file contains a PID and <br>
a process is running with that PID, then the script dies;
or, if there is no process running with that PID, then the
script overwrites the file with its own PID and starts; <br>
else, if the file contains no PID, then the script dies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--statistics <br>
Print out statistics between chunks. The statistics are the
number of chunks, the number of lines, elapsed time, and
lines per second overall and during the last chunk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Show version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOWNLOADING <br>
You can download Maatkit from Google Code at
&lt;http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/&gt;, or you can get
any of the tools easily with a command like the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget
http://www.maatkit.org/get/toolname <br>
or <br>
wget http://www.maatkit.org/trunk/toolname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where &quot;toolname&quot; can
be replaced with the name (or fragment of a name) of any of
the Maatkit tools. Once downloaded, they&rsquo;re ready to
run; no installation is needed. The first <br>
URL gets the latest released version of the tool, and the
second gets the latest trunk code from Subversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The environment variable &quot;MKDEBUG&quot; enables verbose
debugging output in all of the Maatkit tools:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MKDEBUG=1 mk-....</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS <br>
You need Perl, DBI, DBD::mysql, and some core packages that
ought to be installed in any reasonably new version of
Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
For a list of known bugs see
&lt;http://www.maatkit.org/bugs/mk-fifo-split&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please use Google Code Issues
and Groups to report bugs or request support:
&lt;http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/&gt;. You can also join
#maatkit on Freenode to discuss Maatkit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please include the complete
command-line used to reproduce the problem you are seeing,
the version of all MySQL servers involved, the complete
output of the tool when run with <br>
&quot;--version&quot;, and if possible, debugging output
produced by running with the &quot;MKDEBUG=1&quot;
environment variable.</p>
