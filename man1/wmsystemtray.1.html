<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
wmsystemtray - A freedesktop.org system tray as a Window
Maker dock app</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
wmsystemtray [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
wmsystemtray is a system tray using the freedesktop.org
system tray protocol designed as a Window Maker dock app. It
has the ability to display more than one dock window to make
<br>
room for more tray icons, and the ability to scroll through
the icons if more are present than will fit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-display &lt;display name&gt; <br>
Name of display to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Display usage
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Display the version number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Print more messages to the console. May be repeated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Print fewer messages to the console. May be repeated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --small <br>
Use 16x16 tray icons, instead of 24x24. In other words, fit
9 icons instead of 4 in one dock window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w &lt;n&gt;, --windows
&lt;n&gt; <br>
Specifies the number of dock windows to open. Each dock
window is assigned a unique name (i.e. the first is
wmsystemtray.wmsystemtray0, the second
wmsystemtray.wmsystem&acirc; <br>
tray1, and so on), so they can be reliably positioned in the
dock or clip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--id-windows <br>
Print the window&rsquo;s index number on the window, to make
it easier to dock them in the right order. Note that if
there are enough tray icons active, this number may be
cov&acirc; <br>
ered up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fill-rows <br>
Normally the first dock window is completely filled before
any tray icons are placed in the second. This option fills
the top row of each dock window before placing any <br>
icons in the second row, which may make more sense if you
arrange the dock windows horizontally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--arrows &lt;place&gt; <br>
Normally, every dock window has both left and right
scrolling arrows at the bottom. Specifying --arrows
horizontal places the left arrow only on the first window
and the <br>
right arrow only on the last, which may make more sense if
the windows are arranged horizontally. --arrows vertical
places the arrows only on the last window, which may <br>
make more sense if the windows are arranged vertically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c &lt;color&gt;, --fgcolor
&lt;color&gt; <br>
Specify a color for the page indicator and --id-windows
indicators, instead of black. Colors may be specified in any
format recognized by XParseColor In short, that&rsquo;s any
<br>
color name in X&rsquo;s rgb.txt or an RGB color specified as
&quot;rgb:rr/gg/gg&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bgcolor &lt;color&gt; <br>
In non-Window Maker mode, specify the color for the window
background. The default is to shape the window to fit the
used area and to set ParentRelative, which attempts to <br>
copy whatever is behind the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--non-wmaker <br>
Activate non-Window Maker mode. This provides limited
support for using the program in window managers that
don&rsquo;t do Window Maker-style dockapps; the application
still <br>
sizes itself as a 64x64 window, however, so you might be
better served by a more traditional system tray.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAY <br>
The main portion of the dockapp has room for four 24x24 or
nine 16x16 tray icons. At the bottom are left and right
arrows for paging when more tray icons are available than
can <br>
be displayed at once, with an indicator between showing the
current &quot;page&quot; of icons and total number of pages
currently available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to left-clicking
either scrolling arrows, the mouse&rsquo;s scroll wheel may
be used on the bottom section to change pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 may be used to change pages. A program
such as xbindkeys may be used to send these signals to
wmsystemtray on appropriate key presses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The balloon message portion of the freedesktop.org protocol
is not implemented at this time. I&rsquo;ve heard that the
official Gnome system tray doesn&rsquo;t implement this
either, and <br>
most tray apps seem to directly use dbus desktop
notifications service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of the Xembed specification
is not implemented, as it is not needed here. For example,
the only point to redirecting input focus is to allow the
outer window to see input <br>
events (and then the outer window has to forward those
events to the embeds). But since we don&rsquo;t really care,
we can just let the icons get events directly. Similarly, we
don&rsquo;t <br>
take focus or activation, and we don&rsquo;t do
accellerators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSPIRATION <br>
When I finally decided to make use of some applications that
work via system tray icons, I looked around for a tray for
my preferred window manager. Some didn&rsquo;t integrate
well (I <br>
didn&rsquo;t want a bar at the top or bottom of the screen),
some dockapps couldn&rsquo;t handle more than 4 icons at
all, some could do 4 icons with paging (and much crashing if
any program <br>
was killed), some could do more than 4 icons by creating
arbitrary numbers of app icons (but undockable, because they
were created &quot;as needed&quot;). So I decided to write
my own, <br>
combining the best features into a stable app.</p>
