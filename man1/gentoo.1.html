<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
gentoo is a file manager for Linux and compatible systems. It allows you to
  interactively navigate your file system using the mouse, and also to perform
  various fairly standard operations (such as copy, move, rename, ...) on the
  files and directories contained therein.
<div class="Pp"></div>
gentoo always shows you the contents of two directories at once. Each of these
  is displayed in its own scrollable list, called a pane. At any time, exactly
  one pane is the <i>current</i> pane, and has a highlighted bar running across
  its top region. The current pane acts as the source for all file operations,
  while the other pane is the destination. You can select rows in panes using
  selection methods of varying complexity (from simply clicking a row, to
  selecting rows by name using a regular expression). Once you have a selection,
  you can click a button to perform some command on the selected files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All file operations performed by gentoo are implemented natively. When you use
  gentoo to copy a file, for example, gentoo does <i>not</i> simply execute the
  system's <b>cp</b>(1L) command. Rather, gentoo contains its own code for
  opening source and destination files, and then reading and writing the right
  amount of data between them. This way of doing things makes gentoo independent
  of the availability of shell commands to do things.
<div class="Pp"></div>
gentoo incorporates a fairly powerful, object-oriented file typing and styling
  system. It can use a variety of ways to determine the <b>type</b> of the files
  it is displaying. Each type is then linked to something called a <b>style,</b>
  which controls how rows of that type are rendered in panes. You can use this
  system to control icons, colors, and various operations on the rows. For
  example, it is easy to make gentoo display all PNG images in red, and to
  invoke <b>The GIMP</b>(1) on them when double-clicked.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A design goal with gentoo has been to provide full GUI configurability, removing
  the need to edit a configuration file by hand and restart the program to see
  the changes, as is otherwise common in many programs for Un*x. As a result of
  this, gentoo features a Configuration dialog window where you can configure
  most aspects of its operation directly, using the mouse and standard GUI
  widgets.
<div class="Pp"></div>
gentoo borrows its basic look'n'feel from the classic Amiga file manager
  Directory OPUS, but is not a &quot;clone&quot; of any kind.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
gentoo is not primarily driven by command line arguments, but the following are
  available:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--version</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Causes gentoo to print its version number (a string of the
      form MAJOR.MINOR.MICRO, like 0.20.7) to the standard output, and then exit
      successfully. Numbers having an odd MINOR component indicate development
      versions of the program. So far, all versions of gentoo have been
      classified as being development versions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--locale-info</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Makes gentoo print a couple of localization settings, and
      then exit. This is mostly useful during development and debugging, and not
      of a lot of interest when just using the application.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--root-ok</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Makes gentoo accept being run by the root user. Normally,
      this is not allowed since it is considered a big threat to system
      security. Note that gentoo has the ability to execute user-defined strings
      using the <b>execvp</b>(3) function. This is generally considered harmful.
      However, if you <b>really</b> want to run gentoo while logged on as root,
      supplying this option allows you to. It is <b>not</b> recommended,
    though.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--no-rc</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Starts up gentoo without loading any configuration file.
      This makes it run using the built-in defaults, which are <b>very</b>
      Spartan indeed. Seldom comfortable, but occasionally handy when trying to
      determine if a problem is with the configuration or with the core
    code.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--no-gtkrc</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Avoids loading the GTK+ RC file, thus disabling any widget
      customizations, and forces all widgets to use the default GTK+ look.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--no-dir-history</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Avoids loading the file that holds the history, i.e. which
      directories have been previously visited by the two panes. Very rarely
      needed, included mostly for completeness' sake.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--left, --right (or -1, -2)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Sets the initial path for the left and right pane,
      respectively. If present, the path specified with one of these options
      overrides any other path for the pane in question. See below (Initial
      Directory Paths) for details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--run ARG (or -rARG)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Runs ARG, a gentoo command. Commands specified this way are
      executed before gentoo accepts any user input through the graphical
      interface, but after the configuration file has been read in. You can use
      it many times in order to make gentoo run a whole series of commands.
      Remember that gentoo's command names are case-sensitive, and that built-in
      commands (like &quot;About&quot;) always begin with a capital letter.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any non-option command arguments will be silently ignored. If an argument
  &quot;-h&quot; or &quot;--help&quot; is given, gentoo will give a summary of
  its supported command line options and exit successfully. If an unknown option
  is given, or a option is missing a required argument, gentoo will whine and
  exit with a failure.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BASIC_USAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#BASIC_USAGE">BASIC
  USAGE</a></h1>
When gentoo starts up, it will open up its single main window, which is split
  vertically (or horizontally; it's configurable) down the middle, forming the
  two panes mentioned above. It also contains a bank of buttons along the
  bottom.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Initial_Directory_Paths"><a class="selflink" href="#Initial_Directory_Paths">Initial
  Directory Paths</a></h2>
The actual paths shown in the two panes upon start-up can be controlled in
  various ways. There are four ways of getting a path to show up in pane. In
  order of decreasing priority, they are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1. Command-line Argument</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Using the --left and --right (or their short forms, -1 and
      -2) command-line arguments overrides any other setting.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2. Configured Default Directory</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If no command-line argument is present, and the
      &quot;Default Directory&quot; configuration option is set, that directory
      is used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3. Most Recently Visited Directory</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If no default directory exists, the most recently visited
      directory is taken from the directory history for each pane. This only
      works if a directory history file has been found and loaded.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">4. Current Directory</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If all else fails, gentoo uses the current directory
      (&quot;.&quot;).</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Navigating"><a class="selflink" href="#Navigating">Navigating</a></h2>
Navigating around the file system using gentoo is very simple. The two panes act
  as independent views of the file system, and both are navigated in exactly the
  same way.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can always see which directory a pane is showing by reading its path, shown
  in the entry box below (by default--you can change the position to above) the
  pane.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To enter a directory, locate it in the pane and double click it with the left
  mouse button. gentoo will read the directory's contents, and update the
  display accordingly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are several ways of going <b>up</b> in the directory structure. To enter
  the directory containing the one currently shown (the current dir's
  <b>parent</b>), you can: click the parent button (to the left of the path
  entry box); hit <b>Backspace</b> on your keyboard; click the middle mouse
  button; select &quot;Parent&quot; from the pop-up menu on the right mouse
  button, or click the downward arrow to the right of the path box (this pops up
  the directory history menu), then select the second row from the top.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Selecting_Files"><a class="selflink" href="#Selecting_Files">Selecting
  Files</a></h2>
Before you can do anything to a file, you need to select it. All file-management
  commands in gentoo act upon the current selection (in the current pane). There
  are several ways of selecting files, but the most frequently used are
  mouse-based. Note that the word &quot;file&quot; used below really should be
  taken to mean &quot;file or directory&quot;, since selection doesn't
  distinguish between the two.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To select a file (or directory), just point the mouse at the name (anywhere in
  the row is fine), and click the left mouse button. The colors of the clicked
  row will change, indicating that it is currently selected. To select more
  rows, keep the mouse button down, and drag the mouse vertically. gentoo
  extends the selection, including all rows touched. If you drag across the top
  or bottom border, the pane will scroll, trying to keep up. This is a very
  quick and convenient way of selecting multiple files, as long as they are
  listed in succession.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you click again on an already selected file, you will unselect it. You can
  drag to unselect several files, just as when selecting.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To select a sequence of files without dragging, first click normally on the
  first file that you wish to select. Then release the mouse button, locate the
  last file in the sequence (it can be either above or below the first one),
  hold down <b>shift</b> on your keyboard, and click the wanted file. gentoo now
  adds all files between the first and the last to the current selection.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you follow the instructions given above to select a sequence, but press
  <b>control</b> rather than <b>shift</b> before clicking the second time,
  gentoo will <i>unselect</i> the range of files indicated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you click on a file with the <b>meta</b> key held down (that's actually a key
  labeled <b>Alt</b>, located to the immediate left of the space bar, on my PC
  keyboard), gentoo will do something cool: it will select (or unselect, it's a
  toggle just like ordinary selection) all files, including the clicked one,
  that have the same <b>type</b> as the one you clicked. This can be used to
  select for example all PNG image files in a directory even if you can only see
  one. Occasionally very useful.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you click on a file with both the <b>shift</b> and <b>control</b> keys held
  down, gentoo will toggle the selected state of all files having the same file
  name <i>extension</i> as the one you clicked. This can sometimes be useful to
  select files that you don't have a proper <b>type</b> defined for, as long as
  those files do share an extension, that is.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Changing_Sort_Order"><a class="selflink" href="#Changing_Sort_Order">Changing
  Sort Order</a></h2>
The files and directories listed in each of gentoo's two panes are always sorted
  on some column: typically file name. You can chose to sort on some other field
  by clicking the appropriate column title once. If you click on the field that
  is already current, the sorting will be reversed (i.e., for names it will be
  Z-A rather than A-Z).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If your display includes icons, try sorting on that column: gentoo will then
  order each row according to its File Style, grouping the rows based on their
  parent styles, all the way up to the root of the Style tree. This means that,
  for example, JPEG and PNG pictures (both having an immediate parent style of
  Image) will be shown together, and before all Text files (HTML, man pages and
  so on). It's quite cool, really. :)
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Executing_Commands"><a class="selflink" href="#Executing_Commands">Executing
  Commands</a></h2>
Commands are used to make gentoo <b>do</b> stuff. The typical command operates
  upon the set of selected files in the current pane, so it's usually a good
  idea to first select some files. See the previous subsection for details on
  how to select files. Once you have a bunch of files selected, you need to tell
  gentoo which command to execute. There are several ways of doing this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most basic file operations (e.g. copy, move, rename, and so on) are found on the
  (cleverly labeled) buttons along the bottom of gentoo's main window. To copy a
  file, just select it, then click the button labeled &quot;Copy&quot;. It's
  really that simple. Most of these built-in (or <b>native</b>) commands
  automatically operate recursively on directories, so you could copy (or move)
  a whole directory of files by just selecting it and then clicking
  &quot;Copy&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you can't see a button that does what you want to do, there's a chance that
  the command exists, but isn't bound. Click the right mouse button in a pane,
  this opens up the &quot;pane pop-up menu&quot;. Select the &quot;Run...&quot;
  item. This opens up a dialog window showing all available commands. Select a
  command, and click &quot;OK&quot; to execute it.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
gentoo is a pretty complicated program; it has a rather large amount of
  configuration data that it needs in order to be really useful. For example, my
  current personal configuration file contains well over a thousand different
  configuration values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To store this hefty amount of configuration data, gentoo uses a heavily
  structured configuration file. In fact, the file is (or at least it should be)
  legal XML!
<div class="Pp"></div>
When new features are added to gentoo, they will typically require some form of
  configuration data. This data is then simply added somewhere in the existing
  configuration file structure. Effort is made to assign reasonable built-in
  default values for all such new features, so older configuration files (that
  don't contain the values required by the new features) should still work. The
  first time you hit &quot;Save&quot; in the configuration window after changing
  your version of gentoo, your personal configuration file will be updated to
  match the version of gentoo.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Describing how to go about configuring gentoo is too big a topic for a manual
  page to cover. I'll just say that the command to open up the configuration
  window is called &quot;Configure&quot;. It is by default available on a button
  (typically the top-right one), in the pane pop-up menu, and also by pressing
  the <b>C</b> key on your keyboard.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>~/.config/gentoo/gentoorc</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A user's personal configuration file. When gentoo starts
      up, it will try to load this file. If the file isn't found, the old name
      <i>~/.gentoorc</i> is tested, and if that also fails a site-wide
      configuration (see below) will be tried instead.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>/usr/local/etc/gentoorc</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is the site-wide configuration file. If a user doesn't
      have a configuration in his/her home directory, gentoo loads this file
      instead. The actual location of this file is slightly system-dependent,
      the above is the default. As an end user, you typically won't need to
      access this file manually.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>~/.config/gentoo/dirhistory</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This file contains lists of the most recently visited
      directories, for both panes. These are the lists that appear in the
      drop-down menu when the arrow next to the path entry box is clicked. Can
      be disabled in the Dir Pane configuration.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>~/.config/gentoo/gtkrc</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This file allows you to control the look of the widgets
      used by gentoo, through the GTK+ style system. You can change the actual
      path in gentoo's Configuration window, the above is the typical default
      for a modern Linux-based system. If a file named gtkrc is not found in the
      configured path, the names <i>gentoogtkrc</i> and <i>.gentoogtkrc</i>
      (note the period), in that order, are also tested.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>/etc/passwd, /etc/group</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These two files normally hold the system's password and
      group information. These are (probably) the ones gentoo uses to map user
      IDs to login names, to do tilde-expansion (mapping of user name to
      directory path), and to map group IDs to group names. That is
      <i>probably,</i> because gentoo doesn't actually refer to these files by
      name. Instead, it uses the (BSD-style) API function calls
      <b>getpwent</b>(3) and <b>getgrent</b>(3) to access this information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>/etc/fstab, /proc/mounts, (or /etc/mtab)</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These files contain data on available and mounted file
      systems. They are read by gentoo's auto-mounting code. You can configure
      the exact file names used, on the &quot;Mounting&quot; tab in the main
      configuration window. Note that using <i>/proc/mounts</i> rather than
      <i>/etc/mtab</i> is recommended on Linux systems; they contain roughly the
      same data, but the one in /proc is always up to date, and faster to read!

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
All releases of gentoo numbered 0.x.y, where x (the so called <b>minor</b>
  version number) is odd, are to be considered <b>development</b> releases, as
  opposed to <b>stable</b> ones. This means that the software will probably
  suffer from bugs. If you find something that you suspect is indeed a bug,
  please don't hesitate to contact the author! For details on how to do this,
  see below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you're concerned about using potentially buggy and completely unwarranted
  software to manage your precious files, please feel free <b>not</b> to use
  gentoo. The world is full of alternatives.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The chances that a bug gets fixed increase greatly if you report it. When
  reporting a bug, you must describe how to reproduce it, and also try to be as
  detailed and precise as possible in your description of the actual bug. If
  possible, perhaps you should include the output of <b>gdb</b>(1) (or whatever
  your system's debugger is called). In some cases it might be helpful if you
  include the configuration file you were using when the problem occurred.
  Before reporting a bug, please make sure that you are running a reasonably
  recent version of the software, since otherwise &quot;your&quot; bug might
  already been fixed. See below for how to obtain new releases.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Also, you should locate and read through the <b>BUGS</b> file distributed with
  gentoo, so you don't go through all this hassle just to report an already
  known bug, thereby wasting everybody's time...

gentoo was written, from scratch, by Emil Brink. The first line of code was
  written on May 15th, 1998. It is my first program to use the GTK+ GUI toolkit,
  my first program to be released under the GPL, and also my first really major
  Linux application.

Some unfinished, outdated, but still pretty informative documentation is
  available, in HTML format, in the <b>docs/</b> subdirectory in the
  distribution archive. If you haven't installed gentoo from the original
  .tar.gz distribution archive, you might need to either inspect the
  distribution you <b>did</b> use (perhaps it came as some form of
  &quot;package&quot;), or contact a system administrator.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The GTK+ GUI toolkit that gentoo requires is available at
  <b>&lt;http://www.gtk.org/&gt;.</b> gentoo uses the slightly outdated stable
  series, called 1.2.x. The latest known release in that series is GTK+ 1.2.10.
  Because of severe performance problems, gentoo will probably not be ported to
  use the current (2.0.x) series of GTK+ any time soon.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The latest version of gentoo is always available on the official gentoo home
  page, at <b>&lt;http://www.obsession.se/gentoo/&gt;.</b>
