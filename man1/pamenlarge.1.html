<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pamenlarge - Enlarge a Netpbm image N times</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pamenlarge N [pnmfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamenlarge reads a Netpbm image
as input, replicates its pixels N times, and produces a
Netpbm image as output. The output is the same type of image
as the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you enlarge by a factor of 3
or more, you should probably add a pnmsmooth step;
otherwise, you can see the original pixels in the resulting
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For PBM images, pamenlarge uses
special fast algorithms for scale factors up to 10. For
larger factors, it uses a simple but slow algorithm. As a
result, you can often get a <br>
significantly faster scale by running pamenlarge multiple
times. For example, enlarging by 3 and then by 5 is faster
than enlarging once by 15. And because the algorithms are
<br>
different for the different scale factors, some faster than
others, the order matters too. For example, the following
examples all produce the same output -- an image 15 times
<br>
bigger on edge than the input -- but with at different
spees, each being faster than the one before.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pamenlarge 15 test.pbm <br>
$ pamenlarge 5 test.pbm | pamenlarge 3 <br>
$ pamenlarge 3 test.pbm | pamenlarge 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special fast cases for
factors up to 10 have existed since Release 10.50 (March
2010). The special cases for 1, 2, 3, and 5 go back to
Release 10.41 (December 2007). Before <br>
10.41, there are no special scale factors and PBM
enlargement is significantly slower than today for all scale
factors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamenlarge can enlarge only by
integer factors. The slower but more general pamscale can
enlarge or reduce by arbitrary factors. pamscale allows you
to enlarge by resampling, <br>
which gives you smoother enlargements. But it is much
slower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamstretch is another enlarging
program that enlarges by integer factors. It does a simple
kind of resampling that gives you a smoothed enlargement
with less computational cost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbmreduce can reduce by integer
factors, but only for PBM images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
pamenlarge was new in Netpbm 10.25 (October 2004). It is
designed as a replacement for pnmenlarge by Jef Poskanzer,
which was in Pbmplus as far back as 1989. The major
differ&acirc; <br>
ence is that pamenlarge can enlarge PAM format images in
addition to PNM.</p>
