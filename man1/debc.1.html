<p>DEBC(1) General Commands Manual DEBC(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
debc - view contents of a generated Debian package</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
debc [options] [changes file] [package ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
debc figures out the current version of a package and
displays information about the .deb and .udeb files which
have been generated in the current build process. If a
.changes <br>
file is specified on the command line, the filename must end
with .changes, as this is how the program distinguishes it
from package names. If not, then debc has to be called <br>
from within the source code directory tree. In this case, it
will look for the .changes file corresponding to the current
package version (by determining the name and version <br>
number from the changelog, and the architecture in the same
way as dpkg-buildpackage(1) does). It then runs dpkg-deb -I
and dpkg-deb -c on every .deb and .udeb archive listed in
<br>
the .changes file to display information about the contents
of the .deb / .udeb files. It precedes every .deb or .udeb
file with the name of the file. It assumes that all of <br>
the .deb / .udeb archives live in the same directory as the
.changes file. It is useful for ensuring that the expected
files have ended up in the Debian package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a list of packages is given
on the command line, then only those debs or udebs with
names in this list of packages will be processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Directory name checking <br>
In common with several other scripts in the devscripts
package, debc will climb the directory tree until it finds a
debian/changelog file. As a safeguard against stray files
<br>
causing potential problems, it will examine the name of the
parent directory once it finds the debian/changelog file,
and check that the directory name corresponds to the package
<br>
name. Precisely how it does this is controlled by two
configuration file variables DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL
and DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX, and their corresponding
<br>
command-line options --check-dirname-level and
--check-dirname-regex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL
can take the following values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Never check the directory
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Only check the directory name
if we have had to change directory in our search for
debian/changelog. This is the default behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Always check the directory
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directory name is checked by
testing whether the current directory name (as determined by
pwd(1)) matches the regex given by the configuration file
option <br>
DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX or by the command line option
--check-dirname-regex regex. Here regex is a Perl regex (see
perlre(3perl)), which will be anchored at the beginning <br>
and the end. If regex contains a &rsquo;/&rsquo;, then it
must match the full directory path. If not, then it must
match the full directory name. If regex contains the string
&Acirc;&acute;PACKAGE&rsquo;, <br>
this will be replaced by the source package name, as
determined from the changelog. The default value for the
regex is: &Acirc;&acute;PACKAGE(-.+)?&rsquo;, thus matching
directory names such as <br>
PACKAGE and PACKAGE-version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-adebian-architecture, -tGNU-system-type <br>
See dpkg-architecture(1) for a description of these options.
They affect the search for the .changes file. They are
provided to mimic the behaviour of dpkg-buildpackage <br>
when determining the name of the .changes file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debs-dir directory <br>
Look for the .changes, .deb and .udeb files in directory
instead of the parent of the source directory. This should
either be an absolute path or relative to the top of <br>
the source directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check-dirname-level N <br>
See the above section Directory name checking for an
explanation of this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check-dirname-regex regex <br>
See the above section Directory name checking for an
explanation of this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-debs <br>
List the filenames of the .deb packages, and do not display
their contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-conf, --noconf <br>
Do not read any configuration files. This can only be used
as the first option given on the command-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help, --version <br>
Show help message and version information respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION VARIABLES <br>
The two configuration files /etc/devscripts.conf and
~/.devscripts are sourced in that order to set configuration
variables. Command line options can be used to override
config&acirc; <br>
uration file settings. Environment variable settings are
ignored for this purpose. The currently recognised variables
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBRELEASE_DEBS_DIR <br>
This specifies the directory in which to look for the
.changes, .deb and .udeb files, and is either an absolute
path or relative to the top of the source tree. This
cor&acirc; <br>
responds to the --debs-dir command line option. This
directive could be used, for example, if you always use
pbuilder or svn-buildpackage to build your packages. Note
<br>
that it also affects debrelease(1) in the same way, hence
the strange name of the option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL,
DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX <br>
See the above section Directory name checking for an
explanation of these variables. Note that these are
package-wide configuration variables, and will therefore
affect <br>
all devscripts scripts which check their value, as described
in their respective manpages and in devscripts.conf(5).</p>
