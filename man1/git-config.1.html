<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
You can query/set/replace/unset options with this command.
The name is actually the section and the key separated by a
dot, and the value will be escaped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple lines can be added to
an option by using the --add option. If you want to update
or unset an option which can occur on multiple lines, a
POSIX regexp value_regex needs <br>
to be given. Only the existing values that match the regexp
are updated or unset. If you want to handle the lines that
do not match the regex, just prepend a single exclamation
<br>
mark in front (see also the section called
&acirc;EXAMPLES&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The type specifier can be either
--int or --bool, to make git config ensure that the
variable(s) are of the given type and convert the value to
the canonical form (simple decimal <br>
number for int, a &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;
string for bool), or --path, which does some path expansion
(see --path below). If no type specifier is passed, no
checks or transformations <br>
are performed on the value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When reading, the values are
read from the system, global and repository local
configuration files by default, and options --system,
--global, --local and --file &lt;filename&gt; can <br>
be used to tell the command to read from only that location
(see the section called &acirc;FILES&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When writing, the new value is
written to the repository local configuration file by
default, and options --system, --global, --file
&lt;filename&gt; can be used to tell the command to <br>
write to that location (you can say --local but that is the
default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command will fail with
non-zero status upon error. Some exit codes are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The config file is invalid
(ret=3),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. can not write to the config
file (ret=4),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. no section or name was
provided (ret=2),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. the section or key is invalid
(ret=1),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. you try to unset an option
which does not exist (ret=5),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. you try to unset/set an
option for which multiple lines match (ret=5), or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. you try to use an invalid
regexp (ret=6).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On success, the command returns
the exit code 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--replace-all <br>
Default behavior is to replace at most one line. This
replaces all lines matching the key (and optionally the
value_regex).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--add <br>
Adds a new line to the option without altering any existing
values. This is the same as providing ^$ as the value_regex
in --replace-all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--get <br>
Get the value for a given key (optionally filtered by a
regex matching the value). Returns error code 1 if the key
was not found and error code 2 if multiple key values were
<br>
found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--get-all <br>
Like get, but does not fail if the number of values for the
key is not exactly one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--get-regexp <br>
Like --get-all, but interprets the name as a regular
expression and writes out the key names. Regular expression
matching is currently case-sensitive and done against a <br>
canonicalized version of the key in which section and
variable names are lowercased, but subsection names are
not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--global <br>
For writing options: write to global /.gitconfig file rather
than the repository .git/config, write to
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config file if this file exists and
the/.gitconfig <br>
file doesn&acirc;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For reading options: read only
from global ~/.gitconfig and from
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config rather than from all available
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the section called
&acirc;FILES&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--system <br>
For writing options: write to system-wide
$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig rather than the repository
.git/config.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For reading options: read only
from system-wide $(prefix)/etc/gitconfig rather than from
all available files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the section called
&acirc;FILES&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f config-file, --file
config-file <br>
Use the given config file instead of the one specified by
GIT_CONFIG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remove-section <br>
Remove the given section from the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rename-section <br>
Rename the given section to a new name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unset <br>
Remove the line matching the key from config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unset-all <br>
Remove all lines matching the key from config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --list <br>
List all variables set in config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bool <br>
git config will ensure that the output is &quot;true&quot;
or &quot;false&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--int <br>
git config will ensure that the output is a simple decimal
number. An optional value suffix of k, m, or g in the config
file will cause the value to be multiplied by 1024, <br>
1048576, or 1073741824 prior to output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bool-or-int <br>
git config will ensure that the output matches the format of
either --bool or --int, as described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--path <br>
git-config will expand leading ~ to the value of $HOME, and
~user to the home directory for the specified user. This
option has no effect when setting the value (but you can
<br>
use git config bla ~/ from the command line to let your
shell do the expansion).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --null <br>
For all options that output values and/or keys, always end
values with the null character (instead of a newline). Use
newline instead as a delimiter between key and value. <br>
This allows for secure parsing of the output without getting
confused e.g. by values that contain line breaks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--get-colorbool name
[stdout-is-tty] <br>
Find the color setting for name (e.g. color.diff) and output
&quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. stdout-is-tty should
be either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, and is
taken into account when <br>
configuration says &quot;auto&quot;. If stdout-is-tty is
missing, then checks the standard output of the command
itself, and exits with status 0 if color is to be used, or
exits with <br>
status 1 otherwise. When the color setting for name is
undefined, the command uses color.ui as fallback.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--get-color name [default] <br>
Find the color configured for name (e.g. color.diff.new) and
output it as the ANSI color escape sequence to the standard
output. The optional default parameter is used <br>
instead, if there is no color configured for name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --edit <br>
Opens an editor to modify the specified config file; either
--system, --global, or repository (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no-]includes <br>
Respect include.* directives in config files when looking up
values. Defaults to on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
If not set explicitly with --file, there are four files
where git config will search for configuration options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$GIT_DIR/config <br>
Repository specific configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.gitconfig <br>
User-specific configuration file. Also called
&quot;global&quot; configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config <br>
Second user-specific configuration file. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
is not set or empty, $HOME/.config/git/config will be used.
Any single-valued variable set in this file will be <br>
overwritten by whatever is in ~/.gitconfig. It is a good
idea not to create this file if you sometimes use older
versions of Git, as support for this file was added fairly
<br>
recently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig <br>
System-wide configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no further options are given,
all reading options will read all of these files that are
available. If the global or the system-wide configuration
file are not available they <br>
will be ignored. If the repository configuration file is not
available or readable, git config will exit with a non-zero
error code. However, in neither case will an error <br>
message be issued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All writing options will per
default write to the repository specific configuration file.
Note that this also affects options like --replace-all and
--unset. git config will only <br>
ever change one file at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can override these rules
either by command line options or by environment variables.
The --global and the --system options will limit the file
used to the global or <br>
system-wide file respectively. The GIT_CONFIG environment
variable has a similar effect, but you can specify any
filename you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
GIT_CONFIG <br>
Take the configuration from the given file instead of
.git/config. Using the &quot;--global&quot; option forces
this to ~/.gitconfig. Using the &quot;--system&quot; option
forces this to <br>
$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM <br>
Whether to skip reading settings from the system-wide
$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig file. See git(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the section called
&acirc;FILES&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Given a .git/config like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># <br>
# This is the config file, and <br>
# a &rsquo;#&rsquo; or &rsquo;;&rsquo; character indicates
<br>
# a comment <br>
#</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">; core variables <br>
[core] <br>
; Don&rsquo;t trust file modes <br>
filemode = false</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">; Our diff algorithm <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">; Proxy settings <br>
[core] <br>
gitproxy=proxy-command for kernel.org <br>
gitproxy=default-proxy ; for all the rest</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">you can set the filemode to true
with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% git config core.filemode
true</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hypothetical proxy command
entries actually have a postfix to discern what URL they
apply to. Here is how to change the entry for kernel.org to
&quot;ssh&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% git config core.gitproxy
&rsquo;&quot;ssh&quot; for kernel.org&rsquo; &rsquo;for
kernel.org$&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This makes sure that only the
key/value pair for kernel.org is replaced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To delete the entry for renames,
do</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% git config --unset
diff.renames</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to delete an entry
for a multivar (like core.gitproxy above), you have to
provide a regex matching the value of exactly one line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To query the value for a given
key, do</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% git config --get
core.filemode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% git config core.filemode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or, to query a multivar:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% git config --get core.gitproxy
&quot;for kernel.org$&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to know all the
values for a multivar, do:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% git config --get-all
core.gitproxy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you like to live dangerously,
you can replace all core.gitproxy by a new one with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% git config --replace-all
core.gitproxy ssh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if you really only want
to replace the line for the default proxy, i.e. the one
without a &quot;for ...&quot; postfix, do something like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% git config core.gitproxy ssh
&rsquo;! for &rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To actually match only values
with an exclamation mark, you have to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% git config section.key value
&rsquo;[!]&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To add a new proxy, without
altering any of the existing ones, use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% git config --add core.gitproxy
&rsquo;&quot;proxy-command&quot; for example.com&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example to use customized
color from the configuration in your script:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh <br>
WS=$(git config --get-color color.diff.whitespace &quot;blue
reverse&quot;) <br>
RESET=$(git config --get-color &quot;&quot;
&quot;reset&quot;) <br>
echo &quot;${WS}your whitespace color or blue
reverse${RESET}&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
The Git configuration file contains a number of variables
that affect the Git commands&rsquo; behavior. The
.git/config file in each repository is used to store the
configuration for <br>
that repository, and $HOME/.gitconfig is used to store a
per-user configuration as fallback values for the
.git/config file. The file /etc/gitconfig can be used to
store a <br>
system-wide default configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration variables are
used by both the Git plumbing and the porcelains. The
variables are divided into sections, wherein the fully
qualified variable name of the <br>
variable itself is the last dot-separated segment and the
section name is everything before the last dot. The variable
names are case-insensitive, allow only alphanumeric <br>
characters and -, and must start with an alphabetic
character. Some variables may appear multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Syntax <br>
The syntax is fairly flexible and permissive; whitespaces
are mostly ignored. The # and ; characters begin comments to
the end of line, blank lines are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file consists of sections
and variables. A section begins with the name of the section
in square brackets and continues until the next section
begins. Section names are not <br>
case sensitive. Only alphanumeric characters, - and . are
allowed in section names. Each variable must belong to some
section, which means that there must be a section header
<br>
before the first setting of a variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sections can be further divided
into subsections. To begin a subsection put its name in
double quotes, separated by space from the section name, in
the section header, like in <br>
the example below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[section
&quot;subsection&quot;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subsection names are case
sensitive and can contain any characters except newline
(doublequote &quot; and backslash have to be escaped as <br>
cannot span multiple lines. Variables may belong directly to
a section or to a given subsection. You can have [section]
if you have [section &quot;subsection&quot;], but you
don&acirc;t need to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also a deprecated
[section.subsection] syntax. With this syntax, the
subsection name is converted to lower-case and is also
compared case sensitively. These subsection <br>
names follow the same restrictions as section names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the other lines (and the
remainder of the line after the section header) are
recognized as setting variables, in the form name = value.
If there is no equal sign on the line, <br>
the entire line is taken as name and the variable is
recognized as boolean &quot;true&quot;. The variable names
are case-insensitive, allow only alphanumeric characters and
-, and must <br>
start with an alphabetic character. There can be more than
one value for a given variable; we say then that the
variable is multivalued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Leading and trailing whitespace
in a variable value is discarded. Internal whitespace within
a variable value is retained verbatim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The values following the equals
sign in variable assign are all either a string, an integer,
or a boolean. Boolean values may be given as yes/no, 1/0,
true/false or on/off. Case <br>
is not significant in boolean values, when converting value
to the canonical form using --bool type specifier; git
config will ensure that the output is &quot;true&quot; or
&quot;false&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">String values may be entirely or
partially enclosed in double quotes. You need to enclose
variable values in double quotes if you want to preserve
leading or trailing whitespace, <br>
or if the variable value contains comment characters (i.e.
it contains # or ;). Double quote &quot; and backslash
&nbsp;characters in variable values must be escaped: use
<br>
for .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following escape sequences
(beside <br>
escape sequence, nor octal char sequences are valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable values ending in a
&nbsp;are continued on the next line in the customary UNIX
fashion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some variables may require a
special value format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Includes <br>
You can include one config file from another by setting the
special include.path variable to the name of the file to be
included. The included file is expanded immediately, as if
<br>
its contents had been found at the location of the include
directive. If the value of the include.path variable is a
relative path, the path is considered to be relative to the
<br>
configuration file in which the include directive was found.
The value of include.path is subject to tilde expansion: ~/
is expanded to the value of $HOME, and ~user/ to the <br>
specified user&acirc;s home directory. See below for
examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example <br>
# Core variables <br>

complete. For command-specific variables, you will find a
more detailed description in the appropriate manual page.

You will find a description of non-core porcelain
configuration variables in the respective porcelain
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">advice.* <br>
These variables control various optional help messages
designed to aid new users. All advice.* variables default to
true, and you can tell Git that you do not need help by <br>
setting these to false:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pushUpdateRejected <br>
Set this variable to false if you want to disable
pushNonFFCurrent, pushNonFFDefault, pushNonFFMatching,
pushAlreadyExists, pushFetchFirst, and pushNeedsForce <br>
simultaneously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pushNonFFCurrent <br>
Advice shown when git-push(1) fails due to a
non-fast-forward update to the current branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pushNonFFDefault <br>
Advice to set push.default to upstream or current when you
ran git-push(1) and pushed matching refs by default (i.e.
you did not provide an explicit refspec, and no <br>
push.default configuration was set) and it resulted in a
non-fast-forward error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pushNonFFMatching <br>
Advice shown when you ran git-push(1) and pushed matching
refs explicitly (i.e. you used :, or specified a refspec
that isn&acirc;t your current branch) and it resulted in a
<br>
non-fast-forward error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pushAlreadyExists <br>
Shown when git-push(1) rejects an update that does not
qualify for fast-forwarding (e.g., a tag.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pushFetchFirst <br>
Shown when git-push(1) rejects an update that tries to
overwrite a remote ref that points at an object we do not
have.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pushNeedsForce <br>
Shown when git-push(1) rejects an update that tries to
overwrite a remote ref that points at an object that is not
a committish, or make the remote ref point at an object <br>
that is not a committish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">statusHints <br>
Show directions on how to proceed from the current state in
the output of git-status(1), in the template shown when
writing commit messages in git-commit(1), and in the <br>
help message shown by git-checkout(1) when switching
branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">statusUoption <br>
Advise to consider using the -u option to git-status(1) when
the command takes more than 2 seconds to enumerate untracked
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">commitBeforeMerge <br>
Advice shown when git-merge(1) refuses to merge to avoid
overwriting local changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resolveConflict <br>
Advice shown by various commands when conflicts prevent the
operation from being performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">implicitIdentity <br>
Advice on how to set your identity configuration when your
information is guessed from the system username and domain
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">detachedHead <br>
Advice shown when you used git-checkout(1) to move to the
detach HEAD state, to instruct how to create a local branch
after the fact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">amWorkDir <br>
Advice that shows the location of the patch file when
git-am(1) fails to apply it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.fileMode <br>
If false, the executable bit differences between the index
and the working tree are ignored; useful on broken
filesystems like FAT. See git-update-index(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is true, except
git-clone(1) or git-init(1) will probe and set core.fileMode
false if appropriate when the repository is created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.ignoreCygwinFSTricks <br>
This option is only used by Cygwin implementation of Git. If
false, the Cygwin stat() and lstat() functions are used.
This may be useful if your repository consists of a few <br>
separate directories joined in one hierarchy using Cygwin
mount. If true, Git uses native Win32 API whenever it is
possible and falls back to Cygwin functions only to handle
<br>
symbol links. The native mode is more than twice faster than
normal Cygwin l/stat() functions. True by default, unless
core.filemode is true, in which case <br>
ignoreCygwinFSTricks is ignored as Cygwin&acirc;s POSIX
emulation is required to support core.filemode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.ignorecase <br>
If true, this option enables various workarounds to enable
Git to work better on filesystems that are not case
sensitive, like FAT. For example, if a directory listing
finds <br>
&quot;makefile&quot; when Git expects &quot;Makefile&quot;,
Git will assume it is really the same file, and continue to
remember it as &quot;Makefile&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is false, except
git-clone(1) or git-init(1) will probe and set
core.ignorecase true if appropriate when the repository is
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.precomposeunicode <br>
This option is only used by Mac OS implementation of Git.
When core.precomposeunicode=true, Git reverts the unicode
decomposition of filenames done by Mac OS. This is useful
<br>
when sharing a repository between Mac OS and Linux or
Windows. (Git for Windows 1.7.10 or higher is needed, or Git
under cygwin 1.7). When false, file names are handled fully
<br>
transparent by Git, which is backward compatible with older
versions of Git.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.trustctime <br>
If false, the ctime differences between the index and the
working tree are ignored; useful when the inode change time
is regularly modified by something outside Git (file <br>
system crawlers and some backup systems). See
git-update-index(1). True by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.checkstat <br>
Determines which stat fields to match between the index and
work tree. The user can set this to default or minimal.
Default (or explicitly default), is to check all fields,
<br>
including the sub-second part of mtime and ctime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.quotepath <br>
The commands that output paths (e.g. ls-files, diff), when
not given the -z option, will quote &quot;unusual&quot;
characters in the pathname by enclosing the pathname in a
<br>
double-quote pair and with backslashes the same way strings
in C source code are quoted. If this variable is set to
false, the bytes higher than 0x80 are not quoted but <br>
output as verbatim. Note that double quote, backslash and
control characters are always quoted without -z regardless
of the setting of this variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.eol <br>
Sets the line ending type to use in the working directory
for files that have the text property set. Alternatives are
lf, crlf and native, which uses the platform&acirc;s native
<br>
line ending. The default value is native. See
gitattributes(5) for more information on end-of-line
conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.safecrlf <br>
If true, makes Git check if converting CRLF is reversible
when end-of-line conversion is active. Git will verify if a
command modifies a file in the work tree either directly
<br>
or indirectly. For example, committing a file followed by
checking out the same file should yield the original file in
the work tree. If this is not the case for the current <br>
setting of core.autocrlf, Git will reject the file. The
variable can be set to &quot;warn&quot;, in which case Git
will only warn about an irreversible conversion but continue
the <br>
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CRLF conversion bears a slight
chance of corrupting data. When it is enabled, Git will
convert CRLF to LF during commit and LF to CRLF during
checkout. A file that contains a <br>
mixture of LF and CRLF before the commit cannot be recreated
by Git. For text files this is the right thing to do: it
corrects line endings such that we have only LF line <br>
endings in the repository. But for binary files that are
accidentally classified as text the conversion can corrupt
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you recognize such corruption
early you can easily fix it by setting the conversion type
explicitly in .gitattributes. Right after committing you
still have the original <br>
file in your work tree and this file is not yet corrupted.
You can explicitly tell Git that this file is binary and Git
will handle the file appropriately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately, the desired
effect of cleaning up text files with mixed line endings and
the undesired effect of corrupting binary files cannot be
distinguished. In both cases <br>
CRLFs are removed in an irreversible way. For text files
this is the right thing to do because CRLFs are line
endings, while for binary files converting CRLFs corrupts
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, this safety check does not
mean that a checkout will generate a file identical to the
original file for a different setting of core.eol and
core.autocrlf, but only for <br>
the current one. For example, a text file with LF would be
accepted with core.eol=lf and could later be checked out
with core.eol=crlf, in which case the resulting file would
<br>
contain CRLF, although the original file contained LF.
However, in both work trees the line endings would be
consistent, that is either all LF or all CRLF, but never
mixed. A <br>
file with mixed line endings would be reported by the
core.safecrlf mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.autocrlf <br>
Setting this variable to &quot;true&quot; is almost the same
as setting the text attribute to &quot;auto&quot; on all
files except that text files are not guaranteed to be
normalized: files that <br>
contain CRLF in the repository will not be touched. Use this
setting if you want to have CRLF line endings in your
working directory even though the repository does not have
<br>
normalized line endings. This variable can be set to input,
in which case no output conversion is performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.symlinks <br>
If false, symbolic links are checked out as small plain
files that contain the link text. git-update-index(1) and
git-add(1) will not change the recorded type to regular <br>
file. Useful on filesystems like FAT that do not support
symbolic links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is true, except
git-clone(1) or git-init(1) will probe and set core.symlinks
false if appropriate when the repository is created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.gitProxy <br>
A &quot;proxy command&quot; to execute (as command host
port) instead of establishing direct connection to the
remote server when using the Git protocol for fetching. If
the variable <br>
value is in the &quot;COMMAND for DOMAIN&quot; format, the
command is applied only on hostnames ending with the
specified domain string. This variable may be set multiple
times and is <br>
matched in the given order; the first match wins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can be overridden by the
GIT_PROXY_COMMAND environment variable (which always applies
universally, without the special &quot;for&quot;
handling).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special string none can be
used as the proxy command to specify that no proxy be used
for a given domain pattern. This is useful for excluding
servers inside a firewall <br>
from proxy use, while defaulting to a common proxy for
external domains.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.ignoreStat <br>
If true, commands which modify both the working tree and the
index will mark the updated paths with the &quot;assume
unchanged&quot; bit in the index. These marked files are
then <br>
assumed to stay unchanged in the working tree, until you
mark them otherwise manually - Git will not detect the file
changes by lstat() calls. This is useful on systems where
<br>
those are very slow, such as Microsoft Windows. See
git-update-index(1). False by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.preferSymlinkRefs <br>
Instead of the default &quot;symref&quot; format for HEAD
and other symbolic reference files, use symbolic links. This
is sometimes needed to work with old scripts that expect
HEAD to <br>
be a symbolic link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.bare <br>
If true this repository is assumed to be bare and has no
working directory associated with it. If this is the case a
number of commands that require a working directory will
<br>
be disabled, such as git-add(1) or git-merge(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This setting is automatically
guessed by git-clone(1) or git-init(1) when the repository
was created. By default a repository that ends in
&quot;/.git&quot; is assumed to be not bare <br>
(bare = false), while all other repositories are assumed to
be bare (bare = true).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.worktree <br>
Set the path to the root of the working tree. This can be
overridden by the GIT_WORK_TREE environment variable and the
--work-tree command line option. The value can be an <br>
absolute path or relative to the path to the .git directory,
which is either specified by --git-dir or GIT_DIR, or
automatically discovered. If --git-dir or GIT_DIR is <br>
specified but none of --work-tree, GIT_WORK_TREE and
core.worktree is specified, the current working directory is
regarded as the top level of your working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this variable is
honored even when set in a configuration file in a
&quot;.git&quot; subdirectory of a directory and its value
differs from the latter directory (e.g. <br>
&quot;/path/to/.git/config&quot; has core.worktree set to
&quot;/different/path&quot;), which is most likely a
misconfiguration. Running Git commands in the
&quot;/path/to&quot; directory will still use <br>
&quot;/different/path&quot; as the root of the work tree and
can cause confusion unless you know what you are doing (e.g.
you are creating a read-only snapshot of the same index to a
<br>
location different from the repository&acirc;s usual working
tree).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.logAllRefUpdates <br>
Enable the reflog. Updates to a ref &lt;ref&gt; is logged to
the file &quot;$GIT_DIR/logs/&lt;ref&gt;&quot;, by appending
the new and old SHA-1, the date/time and the reason of the
update, but <br>
only when the file exists. If this configuration variable is
set to true, missing &quot;$GIT_DIR/logs/&lt;ref&gt;&quot;
file is automatically created for branch heads (i.e. under
<br>
refs/heads/), remote refs (i.e. under refs/remotes/), note
refs (i.e. under refs/notes/), and the symbolic ref
HEAD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This information can be used to
determine what commit was the tip of a branch &quot;2 days
ago&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This value is true by default in
a repository that has a working directory associated with
it, and false by default in a bare repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.repositoryFormatVersion
<br>
Internal variable identifying the repository format and
layout version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.sharedRepository <br>
When group (or true), the repository is made shareable
between several users in a group (making sure all the files
and objects are group-writable). When all (or world or <br>
everybody), the repository will be readable by all users,
additionally to being group-shareable. When umask (or
false), Git will use permissions reported by umask(2). When
<br>
0xxx, where 0xxx is an octal number, files in the repository
will have this mode value. 0xxx will override user&acirc;s
umask value (whereas the other options will only override
<br>
requested parts of the user&acirc;s umask value). Examples:
0660 will make the repo read/write-able for the owner and
group, but inaccessible to others (equivalent to group
unless <br>
umask is e.g. 0022). 0640 is a repository that is
group-readable but not group-writable. See git-init(1).
False by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.warnAmbiguousRefs <br>
If true, Git will warn you if the ref name you passed it is
ambiguous and might match multiple refs in the repository.
True by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.compression <br>
An integer -1..9, indicating a default compression level. -1
is the zlib default. 0 means no compression, and 1..9 are
various speed/size tradeoffs, 9 being slowest. If set, <br>
this provides a default to other compression variables, such
as core.loosecompression and pack.compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.loosecompression <br>
An integer -1..9, indicating the compression level for
objects that are not in a pack file. -1 is the zlib default.
0 means no compression, and 1..9 are various speed/size <br>
tradeoffs, 9 being slowest. If not set, defaults to
core.compression. If that is not set, defaults to 1 (best
speed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.packedGitWindowSize <br>
Number of bytes of a pack file to map into memory in a
single mapping operation. Larger window sizes may allow your
system to process a smaller number of large pack files <br>
more quickly. Smaller window sizes will negatively affect
performance due to increased calls to the operating
system&acirc;s memory manager, but may improve performance
when <br>
accessing a large number of large pack files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default is 1 MiB if NO_MMAP was
set at compile time, otherwise 32 MiB on 32 bit platforms
and 1 GiB on 64 bit platforms. This should be reasonable for
all users/operating <br>
systems. You probably do not need to adjust this value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Common unit suffixes of k, m, or
g are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.packedGitLimit <br>
Maximum number of bytes to map simultaneously into memory
from pack files. If Git needs to access more than this many
bytes at once to complete an operation it will unmap <br>
existing regions to reclaim virtual address space within the
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default is 256 MiB on 32 bit
platforms and 8 GiB on 64 bit platforms. This should be
reasonable for all users/operating systems, except on the
largest projects. You probably <br>
do not need to adjust this value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Common unit suffixes of k, m, or
g are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.deltaBaseCacheLimit <br>
Maximum number of bytes to reserve for caching base objects
that may be referenced by multiple deltified objects. By
storing the entire decompressed base objects in a cache <br>
Git is able to avoid unpacking and decompressing frequently
used base objects multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default is 16 MiB on all
platforms. This should be reasonable for all users/operating
systems, except on the largest projects. You probably do not
need to adjust this value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Common unit suffixes of k, m, or
g are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.bigFileThreshold <br>
Files larger than this size are stored deflated, without
attempting delta compression. Storing large files without
delta compression avoids excessive memory usage, at the <br>
slight expense of increased disk usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default is 512 MiB on all
platforms. This should be reasonable for most projects as
source code and other text files can still be delta
compressed, but larger binary media <br>
files won&acirc;t be.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Common unit suffixes of k, m, or
g are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.excludesfile <br>
In addition to .gitignore (per-directory) and
.git/info/exclude, Git looks into this file for patterns of
files which are not meant to be tracked. &quot;~/&quot; is
expanded to the <br>
value of $HOME and &quot;~user/&quot; to the specified
user&acirc;s home directory. Its default value is
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is either
not set or empty, <br>
$HOME/.config/git/ignore is used instead. See
gitignore(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.askpass <br>
Some commands (e.g. svn and http interfaces) that
interactively ask for a password can be told to use an
external program given via the value of this variable. Can
be <br>
overridden by the GIT_ASKPASS environment variable. If not
set, fall back to the value of the SSH_ASKPASS environment
variable or, failing that, a simple password prompt. The
<br>
external program shall be given a suitable prompt as command
line argument and write the password on its STDOUT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.attributesfile <br>
In addition to .gitattributes (per-directory) and
.git/info/attributes, Git looks into this file for
attributes (see gitattributes(5)). Path expansions are made
the same way <br>
as for core.excludesfile. Its default value is
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/attributes. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is
either not set or empty, $HOME/.config/git/attributes is
used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.editor <br>
Commands such as commit and tag that lets you edit messages
by launching an editor uses the value of this variable when
it is set, and the environment variable GIT_EDITOR is <br>
not set. See git-var(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.commentchar <br>
Commands such as commit and tag that lets you edit messages
consider a line that begins with this character commented,
and removes them after the editor returns (default #).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sequence.editor <br>
Text editor used by git rebase -i for editing the rebase
instruction file. The value is meant to be interpreted by
the shell when it is used. It can be overridden by the <br>
GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR environment variable. When not
configured the default commit message editor is used
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.pager <br>
The command that Git will use to paginate output. Can be
overridden with the GIT_PAGER environment variable. Note
that Git sets the LESS environment variable to FRSX if it is
<br>
unset when it runs the pager. One can change these settings
by setting the LESS variable to some other value.
Alternately, these settings can be overridden on a project
or <br>
global basis by setting the core.pager option. Setting
core.pager has no effect on the LESS environment variable
behaviour above, so if you want to override Git&acirc;s
default <br>
settings this way, you need to be explicit. For example, to
disable the S option in a backward compatible manner, set
core.pager to less -+S. This will be passed to the shell
<br>
by Git, which will translate the final command to LESS=FRSX
less -+S.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.whitespace <br>
A comma separated list of common whitespace problems to
notice. git diff will use color.diff.whitespace to highlight
them, and git apply --whitespace=error will consider <br>
them as errors. You can prefix - to disable any of them
(e.g. -trailing-space):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; blank-at-eol
treats trailing whitespaces at the end of the line as an
error (enabled by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; space-before-tab
treats a space character that appears immediately before a
tab character in the initial indent part of the line as an
error (enabled by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
indent-with-non-tab treats a line that is indented with
space characters instead of the equivalent tabs as an error
(not enabled by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; tab-in-indent
treats a tab character in the initial indent part of the
line as an error (not enabled by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; blank-at-eof
treats blank lines added at the end of file as an error
(enabled by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; trailing-space
is a short-hand to cover both blank-at-eol and
blank-at-eof.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; cr-at-eol treats
a carriage-return at the end of line as part of the line
terminator, i.e. with it, trailing-space does not trigger if
the character before such a <br>
carriage-return is not a whitespace (not enabled by
default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
tabwidth=&lt;n&gt; tells how many character positions a tab
occupies; this is relevant for indent-with-non-tab and when
Git fixes tab-in-indent errors. The default tab width is
<br>
8. Allowed values are 1 to 63.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.fsyncobjectfiles <br>
This boolean will enable fsync() when writing object
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a total waste of time
and effort on a filesystem that orders data writes properly,
but can be useful for filesystems that do not use
journalling (traditional UNIX <br>
filesystems) or that only journal metadata and not file
contents (OS X&acirc;s HFS+, or Linux ext3 with
&quot;data=writeback&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.preloadindex <br>
Enable parallel index preload for operations like git
diff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can speed up operations
like git diff and git status especially on filesystems like
NFS that have weak caching semantics and thus relatively
high IO latencies. With this <br>
set to true, Git will do the index comparison to the
filesystem data in parallel, allowing overlapping
IO&acirc;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.createObject <br>
You can set this to link, in which case a hardlink followed
by a delete of the source are used to make sure that object
creation will not overwrite existing objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some file system/operating
system combinations, this is unreliable. Set this config
setting to rename there; However, This will remove the check
that makes sure that <br>
existing object files will not get overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.notesRef <br>
When showing commit messages, also show notes which are
stored in the given ref. The ref must be fully qualified. If
the given ref does not exist, it is not an error but <br>
means that no notes should be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This setting defaults to
&quot;refs/notes/commits&quot;, and it can be overridden by
the GIT_NOTES_REF environment variable. See
git-notes(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.sparseCheckout <br>
Enable &quot;sparse checkout&quot; feature. See section
&quot;Sparse checkout&quot; in git-read-tree(1) for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">core.abbrev <br>
Set the length object names are abbreviated to. If
unspecified, many commands abbreviate to 7 hexdigits, which
may not be enough for abbreviated object names to stay
unique <br>
for sufficiently long time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add.ignore-errors,
add.ignoreErrors <br>
Tells git add to continue adding files when some files
cannot be added due to indexing errors. Equivalent to the
--ignore-errors option of git-add(1). Older versions of Git
<br>
accept only add.ignore-errors, which does not follow the
usual naming convention for configuration variables. Newer
versions of Git honor add.ignoreErrors as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias.* <br>
Command aliases for the git(1) command wrapper - e.g. after
defining &quot;alias.last = cat-file commit HEAD&quot;, the
invocation &quot;git last&quot; is equivalent to &quot;git
cat-file commit <br>
HEAD&quot;. To avoid confusion and troubles with script
usage, aliases that hide existing Git commands are ignored.
Arguments are split by spaces, the usual shell quoting and
<br>
escaping is supported. quote pair and a backslash can be
used to quote them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the alias expansion is
prefixed with an exclamation point, it will be treated as a
shell command. For example, defining &quot;alias.new = !gitk
--all --not ORIG_HEAD&quot;, the <br>
invocation &quot;git new&quot; is equivalent to running the
shell command &quot;gitk --all --not ORIG_HEAD&quot;. Note
that shell commands will be executed from the top-level
directory of a <br>
repository, which may not necessarily be the current
directory. GIT_PREFIX is set as returned by running git
rev-parse --show-prefix from the original current directory.
See <br>
git-rev-parse(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">am.keepcr <br>
If true, git-am will call git-mailsplit for patches in mbox
format with parameter --keep-cr. In this case git-mailsplit
0 Can be from lines ending with will not remove <br>
overridden by giving --no-keep-cr from the command line. See
git-am(1), git-mailsplit(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apply.ignorewhitespace <br>
When set to change, tells git apply to ignore changes in
whitespace, in the same way as the --ignore-space-change
option. When set to one of: no, none, never, false tells git
<br>
apply to respect all whitespace differences. See
git-apply(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apply.whitespace <br>
Tells git apply how to handle whitespaces, in the same way
as the --whitespace option. See git-apply(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">branch.autosetupmerge <br>
Tells git branch and git checkout to set up new branches so
that git-pull(1) will appropriately merge from the starting
point branch. Note that even if this option is not <br>
set, this behavior can be chosen per-branch using the
--track and --no-track options. The valid settings are:
false &acirc; no automatic setup is done; true &acirc;
automatic setup is <br>
done when the starting point is a remote-tracking branch;
always &acirc; automatic setup is done when the starting
point is either a local branch or remote-tracking branch.
This <br>
option defaults to true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">branch.autosetuprebase <br>
When a new branch is created with git branch or git checkout
that tracks another branch, this variable tells Git to set
up pull to rebase instead of merge (see <br>
&quot;branch.&lt;name&gt;.rebase&quot;). When never, rebase
is never automatically set to true. When local, rebase is
set to true for tracked branches of other local branches.
When remote, <br>
rebase is set to true for tracked branches of
remote-tracking branches. When always, rebase will be set to
true for all tracking branches. See
&quot;branch.autosetupmerge&quot; for <br>
details on how to set up a branch to track another branch.
This option defaults to never.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote <br>
When on branch &lt;name&gt;, it tells git fetch and git push
which remote to fetch from/push to. The remote to push to
may be overridden with remote.pushdefault (for all
branches). <br>
The remote to push to, for the current branch, may be
further overridden by branch.&lt;name&gt;.pushremote. If no
remote is configured, or if you are not on any branch, it
defaults <br>
to origin for fetching and remote.pushdefault for
pushing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">branch.&lt;name&gt;.pushremote
<br>
When on branch &lt;name&gt;, it overrides
branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote for pushing. It also overrides
remote.pushdefault for pushing from branch &lt;name&gt;.
When you pull from one place (e.g. <br>
your upstream) and push to another place (e.g. your own
publishing repository), you would want to set
remote.pushdefault to specify the remote to push to for all
branches, <br>
and use this option to override it for a specific
branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge <br>
Defines, together with branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote, the
upstream branch for the given branch. It tells git fetch/git
pull/git rebase which branch to merge and can also affect
git <br>
push (see push.default). When in branch &lt;name&gt;, it
tells git fetch the default refspec to be marked for merging
in FETCH_HEAD. The value is handled like the remote part of
a <br>
refspec, and must match a ref which is fetched from the
remote given by &quot;branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote&quot;. The
merge information is used by git pull (which at first calls
git fetch) to <br>
lookup the default branch for merging. Without this option,
git pull defaults to merge the first refspec fetched.
Specify multiple values to get an octopus merge. If you wish
<br>
to setup git pull so that it merges into &lt;name&gt; from
another branch in the local repository, you can point
branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge to the desired branch, and use the
special <br>
setting . (a period) for branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">branch.&lt;name&gt;.mergeoptions
<br>
Sets default options for merging into branch &lt;name&gt;.
The syntax and supported options are the same as those of
git-merge(1), but option values containing whitespace <br>
characters are currently not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">branch.&lt;name&gt;.rebase <br>
When true, rebase the branch &lt;name&gt; on top of the
fetched branch, instead of merging the default branch from
the default remote when &quot;git pull&quot; is run. See
&quot;pull.rebase&quot; for <br>
doing this in a non branch-specific manner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: this is a possibly
dangerous operation; do not use it unless you understand the
implications (see git-rebase(1) for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">branch.&lt;name&gt;.description
<br>
Branch description, can be edited with git branch
--edit-description. Branch description is automatically
added in the format-patch cover letter or request-pull
summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">browser.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd <br>
Specify the command to invoke the specified browser. The
specified command is evaluated in shell with the URLs passed

Override the path for the given tool that may be used to
browse HTML help (see -w option in git-help(1)) or a working
repository in gitweb (see git-instaweb(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clean.requireForce <br>
A boolean to make git-clean do nothing unless given -f or
-n. Defaults to true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">color.branch <br>
A boolean to enable/disable color in the output of
git-branch(1). May be set to always, false (or never) or
auto (or true), in which case colors are used only when the
output <br>
is to a terminal. Defaults to false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">color.branch.&lt;slot&gt; <br>
Use customized color for branch coloration. &lt;slot&gt; is
one of current (the current branch), local (a local branch),
remote (a remote-tracking branch in refs/remotes/), <br>
upstream (upstream tracking branch), plain (other refs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value for these
configuration variables is a list of colors (at most two)
and attributes (at most one), separated by spaces. The
colors accepted are normal, black, red, <br>
green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white; the attributes
are bold, dim, ul, blink and reverse. The first color given
is the foreground; the second is the background. The <br>
position of the attribute, if any, doesn&acirc;t matter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">color.diff <br>
Whether to use ANSI escape sequences to add color to
patches. If this is set to always, git-diff(1), git-log(1),
and git-show(1) will use color for all patches. If it is set
<br>
to true or auto, those commands will only use color when
output is to the terminal. Defaults to false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This does not affect
git-format-patch(1) nor the git-diff-* plumbing commands.
Can be overridden on the command line with the
--color[=&lt;when&gt;] option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">color.diff.&lt;slot&gt; <br>
Use customized color for diff colorization. &lt;slot&gt;
specifies which part of the patch to use the specified
color, and is one of plain (context text), meta
(metainformation), <br>
frag (hunk header), func (function in hunk header), old
(removed lines), new (added lines), commit (commit headers),

Use customized color for git log --decorate output.
&lt;slot&gt; is one of branch, remoteBranch, tag, stash or
HEAD for local branches, remote-tracking branches, tags,
stash and <br>
HEAD, respectively.</p>

When set to always, always highlight matches. When false (or
never), never. When set to true or auto, use color only when
the output is written to the terminal. Defaults to <br>
false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">color.grep.&lt;slot&gt; <br>
Use customized color for grep colorization. &lt;slot&gt;
specifies which part of the line to use the specified color,
and is one of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">context <br>
non-matching text in context lines (when using -A, -B, or
-C)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename <br>
filename prefix (when not using -h)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">function <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The values of these variables
may be specified as in color.branch.&lt;slot&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">color.interactive <br>
When set to always, always use colors for interactive
prompts and displays (such as those used by &quot;git-add
--interactive&quot;). When false (or never), never. When set
to true or <br>
auto, use colors only when the output is to the terminal.
Defaults to false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">color.interactive.&lt;slot&gt;
<br>
Use customized color for git add --interactive output.
&lt;slot&gt; may be prompt, header, help or error, for four
distinct types of normal output from interactive commands.
The <br>
values of these variables may be specified as in

<p style="margin-top: 1em">color.pager <br>
A boolean to enable/disable colored output when the pager is
in use (default is true).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">color.showbranch <br>
A boolean to enable/disable color in the output of
git-show-branch(1). May be set to always, false (or never)
or auto (or true), in which case colors are used only when

git-status(1). May be set to always, false (or never) or
auto (or true), in which case colors are used only when the
output <br>
is to a terminal. Defaults to false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">color.status.&lt;slot&gt; <br>
Use customized color for status colorization. &lt;slot&gt;
is one of header (the header text of the status message),
added or updated (files which are added but not committed),
<br>
changed (files which are changed but not added in the
index), untracked (files which are not tracked by Git),
branch (the current branch), or nobranch (the color the no
<br>
branch warning is shown in, defaulting to red). The values
of these variables may be specified as in
color.branch.&lt;slot&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">color.ui <br>
This variable determines the default value for variables
such as color.diff and color.grep that control the use of
color per command family. Its scope will expand as more <br>
commands learn configuration to set a default for the
--color option. Set it to always if you want all output not
intended for machine consumption to use color, to true or
<br>
auto if you want such output to use color when written to
the terminal, or to false or never if you prefer Git
commands not to use color unless enabled explicitly with
some <br>
other configuration or the --color option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">column.ui <br>
Specify whether supported commands should output in columns.
This variable consists of a list of tokens separated by
spaces or commas:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">always <br>
always show in columns</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">never <br>
never show in columns</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto <br>
show in columns if the output is to the terminal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">column <br>
fill columns before rows (default)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">row <br>
fill rows before columns</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plain <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dense <br>
make unequal size columns to utilize more space</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodense <br>
make equal size columns</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option defaults to
never.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">column.branch <br>
Specify whether to output branch listing in git branch in
columns. See column.ui for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">column.status <br>
Specify whether to output untracked files in git status in
columns. See column.ui for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">column.tag <br>
Specify whether to output tag listing in git tag in columns.
See column.ui for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">commit.cleanup <br>
This setting overrides the default of the --cleanup option
in git commit. See git-commit(1) for details. Changing the
default can be useful when you always want to keep lines
<br>
that begin with comment character # in your log message, in
which case you would do git config commit.cleanup whitespace
(note that you will have to remove the help lines <br>
that begin with # in the commit log template yourself, if
you do this).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">commit.status <br>
A boolean to enable/disable inclusion of status information
in the commit message template when using an editor to
prepare the commit message. Defaults to true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">commit.template <br>
Specify a file to use as the template for new commit
messages. &quot;~/&quot; is expanded to the value of $HOME
and &quot;~user/&quot; to the specified user&acirc;s home
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">credential.helper <br>
Specify an external helper to be called when a username or
password credential is needed; the helper may consult
external storage to avoid prompting the user for the <br>
credentials. See gitcredentials(7) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">credential.useHttpPath <br>
When acquiring credentials, consider the &quot;path&quot;
component of an http or https URL to be important. Defaults
to false. See gitcredentials(7) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">credential.username <br>
If no username is set for a network authentication, use this
username by default. See credential.&lt;context&gt;.* below,
and gitcredentials(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">credential.&lt;url&gt;.* <br>
Any of the credential.* options above can be applied
selectively to some credentials. For example
&quot;credential.https://example.com.username&quot; would
set the default username <br>
only for https connections to example.com. See
gitcredentials(7) for details on how URLs are matched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff.autorefreshindex <br>
When using git diff to compare with work tree files, do not
consider stat-only change as changed. Instead, silently run
git update-index --refresh to update the cached stat <br>
information for paths whose contents in the work tree match
the contents in the index. This option defaults to true.
Note that this affects only git diff Porcelain, and not <br>
lower level diff commands such as git diff-files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff.dirstat <br>
A comma separated list of --dirstat parameters specifying
the default behavior of the --dirstat option to
git-diff(1)&lsquo; and friends. The defaults can be
overridden on the <br>
command line (using --dirstat=&lt;param1,param2,...&gt;).
The fallback defaults (when not changed by diff.dirstat) are
changes,noncumulative,3. The following parameters are <br>
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">changes <br>
Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that have
been removed from the source, or added to the destination.
This ignores the amount of pure code movements <br>
within a file. In other words, rearranging lines in a file
is not counted as much as other changes. This is the default
behavior when no parameter is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lines <br>
Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular line-based
diff analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts.
(For binary files, count 64-byte chunks instead, <br>
since binary files have no natural concept of lines). This
is a more expensive --dirstat behavior than the changes
behavior, but it does count rearranged lines within a <br>
file as much as other changes. The resulting output is
consistent with what you get from the other --*stat
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">files <br>
Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of files
changed. Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat
analysis. This is the computationally cheapest <br>
--dirstat behavior, since it does not have to look at the
file contents at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cumulative <br>
Count changes in a child directory for the parent directory
as well. Note that when using cumulative, the sum of the
percentages reported may exceed 100%. The default <br>
(non-cumulative) behavior can be specified with the
noncumulative parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;limit&gt; <br>
An integer parameter specifies a cut-off percent (3% by
default). Directories contributing less than this percentage
of the changes are not shown in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: The following will
count changed files, while ignoring directories with less
than 10% of the total amount of changed files, and
accumulating child directory counts <br>
in the parent directories: files,10,cumulative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff.statGraphWidth <br>
Limit the width of the graph part in --stat output. If set,
applies to all commands generating --stat output except
format-patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff.context <br>
Generate diffs with &lt;n&gt; lines of context instead of
the default of 3. This value is overridden by the -U
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff.external <br>
If this config variable is set, diff generation is not
performed using the internal diff machinery, but using the
given command. Can be overridden with the <br>
&acirc;GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF&acirc; environment variable. The
command is called with parameters as described under
&quot;git Diffs&quot; in git(1). Note: if you want to use an
external diff program <br>
only on a subset of your files, you might want to use
gitattributes(5) instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff.ignoreSubmodules <br>
Sets the default value of --ignore-submodules. Note that
this affects only git diff Porcelain, and not lower level
diff commands such as git diff-files. git checkout also <br>
honors this setting when reporting uncommitted changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff.mnemonicprefix <br>
If set, git diff uses a prefix pair that is different from
the standard &quot;a/&quot; and &quot;b/&quot; depending on
what is being compared. When this configuration is in
effect, reverse diff <br>
output also swaps the order of the prefixes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git diff <br>
compares the (i)ndex and the (w)ork tree;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git diff HEAD <br>
compares a (c)ommit and the (w)ork tree;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git diff --cached <br>
compares a (c)ommit and the (i)ndex;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git diff HEAD:file1 file2 <br>
compares an (o)bject and a (w)ork tree entity;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git diff --no-index a b <br>
compares two non-git things (1) and (2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff.noprefix <br>
If set, git diff does not show any source or destination
prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff.renameLimit <br>
The number of files to consider when performing the
copy/rename detection; equivalent to the git diff option
-l.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff.renames <br>
Tells Git to detect renames. If set to any boolean value, it
will enable basic rename detection. If set to
&quot;copies&quot; or &quot;copy&quot;, it will detect
copies, as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff.suppressBlankEmpty <br>
A boolean to inhibit the standard behavior of printing a
space before each empty output line. Defaults to false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff.submodule <br>
Specify the format in which differences in submodules are
shown. The &quot;log&quot; format lists the commits in the
range like git-submodule(1)summary does. The
&quot;short&quot; format format <br>
just shows the names of the commits at the beginning and end
of the range. Defaults to short.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff.wordRegex <br>
A POSIX Extended Regular Expression used to determine what
is a &quot;word&quot; when performing word-by-word
difference calculations. Character sequences that match the
regular <br>
expression are &quot;words&quot;, all other characters are
ignorable whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff.&lt;driver&gt;.command <br>
The custom diff driver command. See gitattributes(5) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff.&lt;driver&gt;.xfuncname
<br>
The regular expression that the diff driver should use to
recognize the hunk header. A built-in pattern may also be
used. See gitattributes(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff.&lt;driver&gt;.binary <br>
Set this option to true to make the diff driver treat files
as binary. See gitattributes(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff.&lt;driver&gt;.textconv
<br>
The command that the diff driver should call to generate the
text-converted version of a file. The result of the
conversion is used to generate a human-readable diff. See
<br>
gitattributes(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff.&lt;driver&gt;.wordregex
<br>
The regular expression that the diff driver should use to
split words in a line. See gitattributes(5) for details.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff.&lt;driver&gt;.cachetextconv
<br>
Set this option to true to make the diff driver cache the
text conversion outputs. See gitattributes(5) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff.tool <br>
Controls which diff tool is used by git-difftool(1). This
variable overrides the value configured in merge.tool. The
list below shows the valid built-in values. Any other <br>
value is treated as a custom diff tool and requires that a
corresponding difftool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd variable is
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; araxis</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; bc3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; xxdiff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff.algorithm <br>
Choose a diff algorithm. The variants are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default, myers <br>
The basic greedy diff algorithm. Currently, this is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minimal <br>
Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is
produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">patience <br>
Use &quot;patience diff&quot; algorithm when generating
patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">histogram <br>
This algorithm extends the patience algorithm to
&quot;support low-occurrence common elements&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">difftool.&lt;tool&gt;.path <br>
Override the path for the given tool. This is useful in case
your tool is not in the PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">difftool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd <br>
Specify the command to invoke the specified diff tool. The
specified command is evaluated in shell with the following
variables available: LOCAL is set to the name of the <br>
temporary file containing the contents of the diff pre-image
and REMOTE is set to the name of the temporary file
containing the contents of the diff post-image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">difftool.prompt <br>
Prompt before each invocation of the diff tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fetch.recurseSubmodules <br>
This option can be either set to a boolean value or to
on-demand. Setting it to a boolean changes the behavior of
fetch and pull to unconditionally recurse into submodules
<br>
when set to true or to not recurse at all when set to false.
When set to on-demand (the default value), fetch and pull
will only recurse into a populated submodule when its <br>
superproject retrieves a commit that updates the
submodule&acirc;s reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fetch.fsckObjects <br>
If it is set to true, git-fetch-pack will check all fetched
objects. It will abort in the case of a malformed object or
a broken link. The result of an abort are only <br>
dangling objects. Defaults to false. If not set, the value
of transfer.fsckObjects is used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fetch.unpackLimit <br>
If the number of objects fetched over the Git native
transfer is below this limit, then the objects will be
unpacked into loose object files. However if the number of
<br>
received objects equals or exceeds this limit then the
received pack will be stored as a pack, after adding any
missing delta bases. Storing the pack from a push can make
the <br>
push operation complete faster, especially on slow
filesystems. If not set, the value of transfer.unpackLimit
is used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format.attach <br>
Enable multipart/mixed attachments as the default for
format-patch. The value can also be a double quoted string
which will enable attachments as the default and set the
<br>
value as the boundary. See the --attach option in
git-format-patch(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format.numbered <br>
A boolean which can enable or disable sequence numbers in
patch subjects. It defaults to &quot;auto&quot; which
enables it only if there is more than one patch. It can be
enabled or <br>
disabled for all messages by setting it to &quot;true&quot;
or &quot;false&quot;. See --numbered option in
git-format-patch(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format.headers <br>
Additional email headers to include in a patch to be
submitted by mail. See git-format-patch(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format.to, format.cc <br>
Additional recipients to include in a patch to be submitted
by mail. See the --to and --cc options in
git-format-patch(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format.subjectprefix <br>
The default for format-patch is to output files with the
[PATCH] subject prefix. Use this variable to change that
prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format.signature <br>
The default for format-patch is to output a signature
containing the Git version number. Use this variable to
change that default. Set this variable to the empty string
(&quot;&quot;) <br>
to suppress signature generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format.suffix <br>
The default for format-patch is to output files with the
suffix .patch. Use this variable to change that suffix (make
sure to include the dot if you want it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format.pretty <br>
The default pretty format for log/show/whatchanged command,
See git-log(1), git-show(1), git-whatchanged(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format.thread <br>
The default threading style for git format-patch. Can be a
boolean value, or shallow or deep. shallow threading makes
every mail a reply to the head of the series, where the <br>
head is chosen from the cover letter, the --in-reply-to, and
the first patch mail, in this order. deep threading makes
every mail a reply to the previous one. A true boolean <br>
value is the same as shallow, and a false value disables
threading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format.signoff <br>
A boolean value which lets you enable the -s/--signoff
option of format-patch by default. Note: Adding the
Signed-off-by: line to a patch should be a conscious act and
means <br>
that you certify you have the rights to submit this work
under the same open source license. Please see the
SubmittingPatches document for further discussion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format.coverLetter <br>
A boolean that controls whether to generate a cover-letter
when format-patch is invoked, but in addition can be set to
&quot;auto&quot;, to generate a cover-letter only when
there&acirc;s <br>
more than one patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filter.&lt;driver&gt;.clean <br>
The command which is used to convert the content of a
worktree file to a blob upon checkin. See gitattributes(5)
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filter.&lt;driver&gt;.smudge
<br>
The command which is used to convert the content of a blob
object to a worktree file upon checkout. See
gitattributes(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gc.aggressiveWindow <br>
The window size parameter used in the delta compression
algorithm used by git gc --aggressive. This defaults to
250.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gc.auto <br>
When there are approximately more than this many loose
objects in the repository, git gc --auto will pack them.
Some Porcelain commands use this command to perform a <br>
light-weight garbage collection from time to time. The
default value is 6700. Setting this to 0 disables it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gc.autopacklimit <br>
When there are more than this many packs that are not marked
with *.keep file in the repository, git gc --auto
consolidates them into one larger pack. The default value is
<br>
50. Setting this to 0 disables it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gc.packrefs <br>
Running git pack-refs in a repository renders it unclonable
by Git versions prior to 1.5.1.2 over dumb transports such
as HTTP. This variable determines whether git gc runs <br>
git pack-refs. This can be set to notbare to enable it
within all non-bare repos or it can be set to a boolean
value. The default is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gc.pruneexpire <br>
When git gc is run, it will call prune --expire 2.weeks.ago.
Override the grace period with this config variable. The
value &quot;now&quot; may be used to disable this grace
period and <br>
always prune unreachable objects immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gc.reflogexpire,
gc.&lt;pattern&gt;.reflogexpire <br>
git reflog expire removes reflog entries older than this
time; defaults to 90 days. With &quot;&lt;pattern&gt;&quot;
(e.g. &quot;refs/stash&quot;) in the middle the setting
applies only to the refs <br>
that match the &lt;pattern&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gc.reflogexpireunreachable,
gc.&lt;ref&gt;.reflogexpireunreachable <br>
git reflog expire removes reflog entries older than this
time and are not reachable from the current tip; defaults to
30 days. With &quot;&lt;pattern&gt;&quot; (e.g.
&quot;refs/stash&quot;) in the <br>
middle, the setting applies only to the refs that match the
&lt;pattern&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gc.rerereresolved <br>
Records of conflicted merge you resolved earlier are kept
for this many days when git rerere gc is run. The default is
60 days. See git-rerere(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gc.rerereunresolved <br>
Records of conflicted merge you have not resolved are kept
for this many days when git rerere gc is run. The default is
15 days. See git-rerere(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitcvs.commitmsgannotation <br>
Append this string to each commit message. Set to empty
string to disable this feature. Defaults to &quot;via
git-CVS emulator&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitcvs.enabled <br>
Whether the CVS server interface is enabled for this
repository. See git-cvsserver(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitcvs.logfile <br>
Path to a log file where the CVS server interface well...
logs various stuff. See git-cvsserver(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitcvs.usecrlfattr <br>
If true, the server will look up the end-of-line conversion
attributes for files to determine the -k modes to use. If
the attributes force Git to treat a file as text, the -k
<br>
mode will be left blank so CVS clients will treat it as
text. If they suppress text conversion, the file will be set
with -kb mode, which suppresses any newline munging the <br>
client might otherwise do. If the attributes do not allow
the file type to be determined, then gitcvs.allbinary is
used. See gitattributes(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitcvs.allbinary <br>
This is used if gitcvs.usecrlfattr does not resolve the
correct -kb mode to use. If true, all unresolved files are
sent to the client in mode -kb. This causes the client to
<br>
treat them as binary files, which suppresses any newline
munging it otherwise might do. Alternatively, if it is set
to &quot;guess&quot;, then the contents of the file are
examined to <br>
decide if it is binary, similar to core.autocrlf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitcvs.dbname <br>
Database used by git-cvsserver to cache revision information
derived from the Git repository. The exact meaning depends
on the used database driver, for SQLite (which is the <br>
default driver) this is a filename. Supports variable
substitution (see git-cvsserver(1) for details). May not
contain semicolons (;). Default: %Ggitcvs.%m.sqlite</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitcvs.dbdriver <br>
Used Perl DBI driver. You can specify any available driver
for this here, but it might not work. git-cvsserver is
tested with DBD::SQLite, reported to work with DBD::Pg, and
<br>
reported not to work with DBD::mysql. Experimental feature.
May not contain double colons (:). Default: SQLite. See
git-cvsserver(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitcvs.dbuser, gitcvs.dbpass
<br>
Database user and password. Only useful if setting
gitcvs.dbdriver, since SQLite has no concept of database
users and/or passwords. gitcvs.dbuser supports variable <br>
substitution (see git-cvsserver(1) for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitcvs.dbTableNamePrefix <br>
Database table name prefix. Prepended to the names of any
database tables used, allowing a single database to be used
for several repositories. Supports variable substitution
<br>
(see git-cvsserver(1) for details). Any non-alphabetic
characters will be replaced with underscores.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All gitcvs variables except for
gitcvs.usecrlfattr and gitcvs.allbinary can also be
specified as gitcvs.&lt;access_method&gt;.&lt;varname&gt;
(where access_method is one of &quot;ext&quot; and <br>
&quot;pserver&quot;) to make them apply only for the given
access method.</p>

gitweb.pickaxe, gitweb.remote_heads, gitweb.showsizes,
gitweb.snapshot <br>
See gitweb.conf(5) for description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grep.lineNumber <br>
If set to true, enable -n option by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grep.patternType <br>
Set the default matching behavior. Using a value of basic,
extended, fixed, or perl will enable the --basic-regexp,
--extended-regexp, --fixed-strings, or --perl-regexp <br>
option accordingly, while the value default will return to
the default matching behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grep.extendedRegexp <br>
If set to true, enable --extended-regexp option by default.
This option is ignored when the grep.patternType option is
set to a value other than default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpg.program <br>
Use this custom program instead of &quot;gpg&quot; found on
$PATH when making or verifying a PGP signature. The program
must support the same command line interface as GPG, namely,
to <br>
verify a detached signature, &quot;gpg --verify $file -
&lt;$signature&quot; is run, and the program is expected to
signal a good signature by exiting with code 0, and to
generate an <br>
ascii-armored detached signature, the standard input of
&quot;gpg -bsau $key&quot; is fed with the contents to be
signed, and the program is expected to send the result to
its standard <br>
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gui.commitmsgwidth <br>
Defines how wide the commit message window is in the
git-gui(1). &quot;75&quot; is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gui.diffcontext <br>
Specifies how many context lines should be used in calls to
diff made by the git-gui(1). The default is
&quot;5&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gui.encoding <br>
Specifies the default encoding to use for displaying of file
contents in git-gui(1) and gitk(1). It can be overridden by
setting the encoding attribute for relevant files <br>
(see gitattributes(5)). If this option is not set, the tools
default to the locale encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gui.matchtrackingbranch <br>
Determines if new branches created with git-gui(1) should
default to tracking remote branches with matching names or
not. Default: &quot;false&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gui.newbranchtemplate <br>
Is used as suggested name when creating new branches using
the git-gui(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gui.pruneduringfetch <br>
&quot;true&quot; if git-gui(1) should prune remote-tracking
branches when performing a fetch. The default value is
&quot;false&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gui.trustmtime <br>
Determines if git-gui(1) should trust the file modification
timestamp or not. By default the timestamps are not
trusted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gui.spellingdictionary <br>
Specifies the dictionary used for spell checking commit
messages in the git-gui(1). When set to &quot;none&quot;
spell checking is turned off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gui.fastcopyblame <br>
If true, git gui blame uses -C instead of -C -C for original
location detection. It makes blame significantly faster on
huge repositories at the expense of less thorough copy <br>
detection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gui.copyblamethreshold <br>
Specifies the threshold to use in git gui blame original
location detection, measured in alphanumeric characters. See
the git-blame(1) manual for more information on copy <br>
detection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gui.blamehistoryctx <br>
Specifies the radius of history context in days to show in
gitk(1) for the selected commit, when the Show History
Context menu item is invoked from git gui blame. If this
<br>
variable is set to zero, the whole history is shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">guitool.&lt;name&gt;.cmd <br>
Specifies the shell command line to execute when the
corresponding item of the git-gui(1)Tools menu is invoked.
This option is mandatory for every tool. The command is <br>
executed from the root of the working directory, and in the
environment it receives the name of the tool as GIT_GUITOOL,
the name of the currently selected file as FILENAME, <br>
and the name of the current branch as CUR_BRANCH (if the
head is detached, CUR_BRANCH is empty).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">guitool.&lt;name&gt;.needsfile
<br>
Run the tool only if a diff is selected in the GUI. It
guarantees that FILENAME is not empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">guitool.&lt;name&gt;.noconsole
<br>
Run the command silently, without creating a window to
display its output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">guitool.&lt;name&gt;.norescan
<br>
Don&acirc;t rescan the working directory for changes after
the tool finishes execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">guitool.&lt;name&gt;.confirm
<br>
Show a confirmation dialog before actually running the
tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">guitool.&lt;name&gt;.argprompt
<br>
Request a string argument from the user, and pass it to the
tool through the ARGS environment variable. Since requesting
an argument implies confirmation, the confirm option <br>
has no effect if this is enabled. If the option is set to
true, yes, or 1, the dialog uses a built-in generic prompt;
otherwise the exact value of the variable is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">guitool.&lt;name&gt;.revprompt
<br>
Request a single valid revision from the user, and set the
REVISION environment variable. In other aspects this option
is similar to argprompt, and can be used together with <br>
it.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">guitool.&lt;name&gt;.revunmerged
<br>
Show only unmerged branches in the revprompt subdialog. This
is useful for tools similar to merge or rebase, but not for
things like checkout or reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">guitool.&lt;name&gt;.title <br>
Specifies the title to use for the prompt dialog. The
default is the tool name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">guitool.&lt;name&gt;.prompt <br>
Specifies the general prompt string to display at the top of
the dialog, before subsections for argprompt and revprompt.
The default value includes the actual command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help.browser <br>
Specify the browser that will be used to display help in the
web format. See git-help(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help.format <br>
Override the default help format used by git-help(1). Values
man, info, web and html are supported. man is the default.
web and html are the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help.autocorrect <br>
Automatically correct and execute mistyped commands after
waiting for the given number of deciseconds (0.1 sec). If
more than one command can be deduced from the entered <br>
text, nothing will be executed. If the value of this option
is negative, the corrected command will be executed
immediately. If the value is 0 - the command will be just
<br>
shown but not executed. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help.htmlpath <br>
Specify the path where the HTML documentation resides. File
system paths and URLs are supported. HTML pages will be
prefixed with this path when help is displayed in the web
<br>
format. This defaults to the documentation path of your Git
installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http.proxy <br>
Override the HTTP proxy, normally configured using the
http_proxy, https_proxy, and all_proxy environment variables
(see curl(1)). This can be overridden on a per-remote <br>
basis; see remote.&lt;name&gt;.proxy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http.cookiefile <br>
File containing previously stored cookie lines which should
be used in the Git http session, if they match the server.
The file format of the file to read cookies from should <br>
be plain HTTP headers or the Netscape/Mozilla cookie file
format (see curl(1)). NOTE that the file specified with
http.cookiefile is only used as input. No cookies will be
<br>
stored in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http.sslVerify <br>
Whether to verify the SSL certificate when fetching or
pushing over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the
GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http.sslCert <br>

over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the GIT_SSL_CERT
environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http.sslKey <br>
File containing the SSL private key when fetching or pushing
over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the GIT_SSL_KEY environment
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http.sslCertPasswordProtected
<br>
Enable Git&acirc;s password prompt for the SSL certificate.
Otherwise OpenSSL will prompt the user, possibly many times,
if the certificate or private key is encrypted. Can be <br>
overridden by the GIT_SSL_CERT_PASSWORD_PROTECTED
environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http.sslCAInfo <br>
File containing the certificates to verify the peer with
when fetching or pushing over HTTPS. Can be overridden by
the GIT_SSL_CAINFO environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http.sslCAPath <br>
Path containing files with the CA certificates to verify the
peer with when fetching or pushing over HTTPS. Can be
overridden by the GIT_SSL_CAPATH environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http.sslTry <br>
Attempt to use AUTH SSL/TLS and encrypted data transfers
when connecting via regular FTP protocol. This might be
needed if the FTP server requires it for security reasons or
<br>
you wish to connect securely whenever remote FTP server
supports it. Default is false since it might trigger
certificate verification errors on misconfigured
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http.maxRequests <br>
How many HTTP requests to launch in parallel. Can be
overridden by the GIT_HTTP_MAX_REQUESTS environment
variable. Default is 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http.minSessions <br>
The number of curl sessions (counted across slots) to be
kept across requests. They will not be ended with
curl_easy_cleanup() until http_cleanup() is invoked. If <br>
USE_CURL_MULTI is not defined, this value will be capped at
1. Defaults to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http.postBuffer <br>
Maximum size in bytes of the buffer used by smart HTTP
transports when POSTing data to the remote system. For
requests larger than this buffer size, HTTP/1.1 and <br>
Transfer-Encoding: chunked is used to avoid creating a
massive pack file locally. Default is 1 MiB, which is
sufficient for most requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http.lowSpeedLimit,
http.lowSpeedTime <br>
If the HTTP transfer speed is less than http.lowSpeedLimit
for longer than http.lowSpeedTime seconds, the transfer is
aborted. Can be overridden by the <br>
GIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT and GIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_TIME
environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http.noEPSV <br>
A boolean which disables using of EPSV ftp command by curl.
This can helpful with some &quot;poor&quot; ftp servers
which don&acirc;t support EPSV mode. Can be overridden by
the <br>
GIT_CURL_FTP_NO_EPSV environment variable. Default is false
(curl will use EPSV).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http.useragent <br>
The HTTP USER_AGENT string presented to an HTTP server. The
default value represents the version of the client Git such
as git/1.7.1. This option allows you to override this <br>
value to a more common value such as Mozilla/4.0. This may
be necessary, for instance, if connecting through a firewall
that restricts HTTP connections to a set of common <br>
USER_AGENT strings (but not including those like git/1.7.1).
Can be overridden by the GIT_HTTP_USER_AGENT environment
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i18n.commitEncoding <br>
Character encoding the commit messages are stored in; Git
itself does not care per se, but this information is
necessary e.g. when importing commits from emails or in the
<br>
gitk graphical history browser (and possibly at other places
in the future or in other porcelains). See e.g.
git-mailinfo(1). Defaults to utf-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i18n.logOutputEncoding <br>
Character encoding the commit messages are converted to when
running git log and friends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">imap <br>
The configuration variables in the imap section are
described in git-imap-send(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">init.templatedir <br>
Specify the directory from which templates will be copied.
(See the &quot;TEMPLATE DIRECTORY&quot; section of
git-init(1).)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">instaweb.browser <br>
Specify the program that will be used to browse your working
repository in gitweb. See git-instaweb(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">instaweb.httpd <br>
The HTTP daemon command-line to start gitweb on your working
repository. See git-instaweb(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">instaweb.local <br>
If true the web server started by git-instaweb(1) will be
bound to the local IP (127.0.0.1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">instaweb.modulepath <br>
The default module path for git-instaweb(1) to use instead
of /usr/lib/apache2/modules. Only used if httpd is
Apache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">instaweb.port <br>
The port number to bind the gitweb httpd to. See
git-instaweb(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interactive.singlekey <br>
In interactive commands, allow the user to provide
one-letter input with a single key (i.e., without hitting
enter). Currently this is used by the --patch mode of
git-add(1), <br>
git-checkout(1), git-commit(1), git-reset(1), and
git-stash(1). Note that this setting is silently ignored if
portable keystroke input is not available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log.abbrevCommit <br>
If true, makes git-log(1), git-show(1), and
git-whatchanged(1) assume --abbrev-commit. You may override
this option with --no-abbrev-commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log.date <br>
Set the default date-time mode for the log command. Setting
a value for log.date is similar to using git log&rsquo;s
--date option. Possible values are relative, local, default,
<br>
iso, rfc, and short; see git-log(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log.decorate <br>
Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown by the
log command. If short is specified, the ref name prefixes
refs/heads/, refs/tags/ and refs/remotes/ will not be <br>
printed. If full is specified, the full ref name (including
prefix) will be printed. This is the same as the log
commands --decorate option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log.showroot <br>
If true, the initial commit will be shown as a big creation
event. This is equivalent to a diff against an empty tree.
Tools like git-log(1) or git-whatchanged(1), which <br>
normally hide the root commit will now show it. True by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log.mailmap <br>
If true, makes git-log(1), git-show(1), and
git-whatchanged(1) assume --use-mailmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mailmap.file <br>
The location of an augmenting mailmap file. The default
mailmap, located in the root of the repository, is loaded
first, then the mailmap file pointed to by this variable.
<br>
The location of the mailmap file may be in a repository
subdirectory, or somewhere outside of the repository itself.
See git-shortlog(1) and git-blame(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mailmap.blob <br>
Like mailmap.file, but consider the value as a reference to
a blob in the repository. If both mailmap.file and
mailmap.blob are given, both are parsed, with entries from
<br>
mailmap.file taking precedence. In a bare repository, this
defaults to HEAD:.mailmap. In a non-bare repository, it
defaults to empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">man.viewer <br>
Specify the programs that may be used to display help in the
man format. See git-help(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">man.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd <br>
Specify the command to invoke the specified man viewer. The
specified command is evaluated in shell with the man page
passed as argument. (See git-help(1).)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">man.&lt;tool&gt;.path <br>
Override the path for the given tool that may be used to
display help in the man format. See git-help(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge.conflictstyle <br>
Specify the style in which conflicted hunks are written out
to working tree files upon merge. The default is
&quot;merge&quot;, which shows a
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; conflict marker, changes made
by <br>
one side, a ======= marker, changes made by the other side,
and then a &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; marker. An alternate
style, &quot;diff3&quot;, adds a ||||||| marker and the
original text before the <br>
======= marker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge.defaultToUpstream <br>
If merge is called without any commit argument, merge the
upstream branches configured for the current branch by using
their last observed values stored in their <br>
remote-tracking branches. The values of the
branch.&lt;current branch&gt;.merge that name the branches
at the remote named by branch.&lt;current branch&gt;.remote
are consulted, and then <br>
they are mapped via remote.&lt;remote&gt;.fetch to their
corresponding remote-tracking branches, and the tips of
these tracking branches are merged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge.ff <br>
By default, Git does not create an extra merge commit when
merging a commit that is a descendant of the current commit.
Instead, the tip of the current branch is <br>
fast-forwarded. When set to false, this variable tells Git
to create an extra merge commit in such a case (equivalent
to giving the --no-ff option from the command line). <br>
When set to only, only such fast-forward merges are allowed
(equivalent to giving the --ff-only option from the command
line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge.log <br>
In addition to branch names, populate the log message with
at most the specified number of one-line descriptions from
the actual commits that are being merged. Defaults to <br>
false, and true is a synonym for 20.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge.renameLimit <br>
The number of files to consider when performing rename
detection during a merge; if not specified, defaults to the
value of diff.renameLimit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge.renormalize <br>
Tell Git that canonical representation of files in the
repository has changed over time (e.g. earlier commits
record text files with CRLF line endings, but recent ones
use LF <br>
line endings). In such a repository, Git can convert the
data recorded in commits to a canonical form before
performing a merge to reduce unnecessary conflicts. For more
<br>
information, see section &quot;Merging branches with
differing checkin/checkout attributes&quot; in
gitattributes(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge.stat <br>
Whether to print the diffstat between ORIG_HEAD and the
merge result at the end of the merge. True by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge.tool <br>
Controls which merge tool is used by git-mergetool(1). The
list below shows the valid built-in values. Any other value
is treated as a custom merge tool and requires that a <br>
corresponding mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd variable is
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge.verbosity <br>
Controls the amount of output shown by the recursive merge
strategy. Level 0 outputs nothing except a final error
message if conflicts were detected. Level 1 outputs only
<br>
conflicts, 2 outputs conflicts and file changes. Level 5 and
above outputs debugging information. The default is level 2.
Can be overridden by the GIT_MERGE_VERBOSITY <br>
environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge.&lt;driver&gt;.name <br>
Defines a human-readable name for a custom low-level merge
driver. See gitattributes(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge.&lt;driver&gt;.driver <br>
Defines the command that implements a custom low-level merge
driver. See gitattributes(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge.&lt;driver&gt;.recursive
<br>
Names a low-level merge driver to be used when performing an
internal merge between common ancestors. See
gitattributes(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.path <br>
Override the path for the given tool. This is useful in case
your tool is not in the PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd <br>
Specify the command to invoke the specified merge tool. The
specified command is evaluated in shell with the following
variables available: BASE is the name of a temporary <br>
file containing the common base of the files to be merged,
if available; LOCAL is the name of a temporary file
containing the contents of the file on the current branch;
<br>
REMOTE is the name of a temporary file containing the
contents of the file from the branch being merged; MERGED
contains the name of the file to which the merge tool should
<br>
write the results of a successful merge.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.trustExitCode
<br>
For a custom merge command, specify whether the exit code of
the merge command can be used to determine whether the merge
was successful. If this is not set to true then the <br>
merge target file timestamp is checked and the merge assumed
to have been successful if the file has been updated,
otherwise the user is prompted to indicate the success of
<br>
the merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mergetool.keepBackup <br>
After performing a merge, the original file with conflict
markers can be saved as a file with a .orig extension. If
this variable is set to false then this file is not <br>
preserved. Defaults to true (i.e. keep the backup
files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mergetool.keepTemporaries <br>
When invoking a custom merge tool, Git uses a set of
temporary files to pass to the tool. If the tool returns an
error and this variable is set to true, then these temporary
<br>
files will be preserved, otherwise they will be removed
after the tool has exited. Defaults to false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mergetool.prompt <br>
Prompt before each invocation of the merge resolution
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notes.displayRef <br>
The (fully qualified) refname from which to show notes when
showing commit messages. The value of this variable can be
set to a glob, in which case notes from all matching <br>
refs will be shown. You may also specify this configuration
variable several times. A warning will be issued for refs
that do not exist, but a glob that does not match any <br>
refs is silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This setting can be overridden
with the GIT_NOTES_DISPLAY_REF environment variable, which
must be a colon separated list of refs or globs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The effective value of
&quot;core.notesRef&quot; (possibly overridden by
GIT_NOTES_REF) is also implicitly added to the list of refs
to be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;
<br>
When rewriting commits with &lt;command&gt; (currently amend
or rebase) and this variable is set to true, Git
automatically copies your notes from the original to the
rewritten <br>
commit. Defaults to true, but see
&quot;notes.rewriteRef&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notes.rewriteMode <br>
When copying notes during a rewrite (see the
&quot;notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;&quot; option),
determines what to do if the target commit already has a
note. Must be one of overwrite, <br>
concatenate, or ignore. Defaults to concatenate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This setting can be overridden
with the GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_MODE environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notes.rewriteRef <br>
When copying notes during a rewrite, specifies the (fully
qualified) ref whose notes should be copied. The ref may be
a glob, in which case notes in all matching refs will be
<br>
copied. You may also specify this configuration several
times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Does not have a default value;
you must configure this variable to enable note rewriting.
Set it to refs/notes/commits to enable rewriting for the
default commit notes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This setting can be overridden
with the GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF environment variable, which
must be a colon separated list of refs or globs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pack.window <br>
The size of the window used by git-pack-objects(1) when no
window size is given on the command line. Defaults to
10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pack.depth <br>
The maximum delta depth used by git-pack-objects(1) when no
maximum depth is given on the command line. Defaults to
50.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pack.windowMemory <br>
The window memory size limit used by git-pack-objects(1)
when no limit is given on the command line. The value can be
suffixed with &quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, or
&quot;g&quot;. Defaults to 0, meaning <br>
no limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pack.compression <br>
An integer -1..9, indicating the compression level for
objects in a pack file. -1 is the zlib default. 0 means no
compression, and 1..9 are various speed/size tradeoffs, 9
<br>
being slowest. If not set, defaults to core.compression. If
that is not set, defaults to -1, the zlib default, which is
&quot;a default compromise between speed and compression
<br>
(currently equivalent to level 6).&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that changing the
compression level will not automatically recompress all
existing objects. You can force recompression by passing the
-F option to git-repack(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pack.deltaCacheSize <br>
The maximum memory in bytes used for caching deltas in
git-pack-objects(1) before writing them out to a pack. This
cache is used to speed up the writing object phase by not
<br>
having to recompute the final delta result once the best
match for all objects is found. Repacking large repositories
on machines which are tight with memory might be badly <br>
impacted by this though, especially if this cache pushes the
system into swapping. A value of 0 means no limit. The
smallest size of 1 byte may be used to virtually disable
<br>
this cache. Defaults to 256 MiB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pack.deltaCacheLimit <br>
The maximum size of a delta, that is cached in
git-pack-objects(1). This cache is used to speed up the
writing object phase by not having to recompute the final
delta result <br>
once the best match for all objects is found. Defaults to
1000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pack.threads <br>
Specifies the number of threads to spawn when searching for
best delta matches. This requires that git-pack-objects(1)
be compiled with pthreads otherwise this option is <br>
ignored with a warning. This is meant to reduce packing time
on multiprocessor machines. The required amount of memory
for the delta search window is however multiplied by <br>
the number of threads. Specifying 0 will cause Git to
auto-detect the number of CPU&acirc;s and set the number of
threads accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pack.indexVersion <br>
Specify the default pack index version. Valid values are 1
for legacy pack index used by Git versions prior to 1.5.2,
and 2 for the new pack index with capabilities for packs
<br>
larger than 4 GB as well as proper protection against the
repacking of corrupted packs. Version 2 is the default. Note
that version 2 is enforced and this config option <br>
ignored whenever the corresponding pack is larger than 2
GB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have an old Git that does
not understand the version 2 *.idx file, cloning or fetching
over a non native protocol (e.g. &quot;http&quot; and
&quot;rsync&quot;) that will copy both *.pack <br>
file and corresponding *.idx file from the other side may
give you a repository that cannot be accessed with your
older version of Git. If the *.pack file is smaller than 2
<br>
GB, however, you can use git-index-pack(1) on the *.pack
file to regenerate the *.idx file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pack.packSizeLimit <br>
The maximum size of a pack. This setting only affects
packing to a file when repacking, i.e. the git:// protocol
is unaffected. It can be overridden by the --max-pack-size
<br>
option of git-repack(1). The minimum size allowed is limited
to 1 MiB. The default is unlimited. Common unit suffixes of
k, m, or g are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pager.&lt;cmd&gt; <br>
If the value is boolean, turns on or off pagination of the
output of a particular Git subcommand when writing to a tty.
Otherwise, turns on pagination for the subcommand <br>
using the pager specified by the value of pager.&lt;cmd&gt;.
If --paginate or --no-pager is specified on the command
line, it takes precedence over this option. To disable <br>
pagination for all commands, set core.pager or GIT_PAGER to
cat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pretty.&lt;name&gt; <br>
Alias for a --pretty= format string, as specified in
git-log(1). Any aliases defined here can be used just as the
built-in pretty formats could. For example, running git <br>
config pretty.changelog &quot;format:* %H %s&quot; would
cause the invocation git log --pretty=changelog to be
equivalent to running git log &quot;--pretty=format:* %H
%s&quot;. Note that an <br>
alias with the same name as a built-in format will be
silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pull.rebase <br>
When true, rebase branches on top of the fetched branch,
instead of merging the default branch from the default
remote when &quot;git pull&quot; is run. See
&quot;branch.&lt;name&gt;.rebase&quot; for <br>
setting this on a per-branch basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: this is a possibly
dangerous operation; do not use it unless you understand the
implications (see git-rebase(1) for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pull.octopus <br>
The default merge strategy to use when pulling multiple
branches at once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pull.twohead <br>
The default merge strategy to use when pulling a single
branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">push.default <br>
Defines the action git push should take if no refspec is
given on the command line, no refspec is configured in the
remote, and no refspec is implied by any of the options <br>
given on the command line. Possible values are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; nothing - do not
push anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; matching - push
all branches having the same name in both ends. This is for
those who prepare all the branches into a publishable shape
and then push them out with a <br>
single command. It is not appropriate for pushing into a
repository shared by multiple users, since locally stalled
branches will attempt a non-fast forward push if other <br>
users updated the branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is currently the default,
but Git 2.0 will change the default to simple.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; upstream - push
the current branch to its upstream branch (tracking is a
deprecated synonym for this). With this, git push will
update the same remote ref as the one <br>
which is merged by git pull, making push and pull
symmetrical. See &quot;branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge&quot; for
how to configure the upstream branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; simple - like
upstream, but refuses to push if the upstream branch&acirc;s
name is different from the local one. This is the safest
option and is well-suited for beginners. It <br>
will become the default in Git 2.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; current - push
the current branch to a branch of the same name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The simple, current and upstream
modes are for those who want to push out a single branch
after finishing work, even when the other branches are not
yet ready to be pushed <br>
out. If you are working with other people to push into the
same shared repository, you would want to use one of
these.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rebase.stat <br>
Whether to show a diffstat of what changed upstream since
the last rebase. False by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rebase.autosquash <br>
If set to true enable --autosquash option by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">receive.autogc <br>
By default, git-receive-pack will run &quot;git-gc
--auto&quot; after receiving data from git-push and updating
refs. You can stop it by setting this variable to false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">receive.fsckObjects <br>
If it is set to true, git-receive-pack will check all
received objects. It will abort in the case of a malformed
object or a broken link. The result of an abort are only
<br>
dangling objects. Defaults to false. If not set, the value
of transfer.fsckObjects is used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">receive.unpackLimit <br>
If the number of objects received in a push is below this
limit then the objects will be unpacked into loose object
files. However if the number of received objects equals or
<br>
exceeds this limit then the received pack will be stored as
a pack, after adding any missing delta bases. Storing the
pack from a push can make the push operation complete <br>
faster, especially on slow filesystems. If not set, the
value of transfer.unpackLimit is used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">receive.denyDeletes <br>
If set to true, git-receive-pack will deny a ref update that
deletes the ref. Use this to prevent such a ref deletion via
a push.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">receive.denyDeleteCurrent <br>
If set to true, git-receive-pack will deny a ref update that
deletes the currently checked out branch of a non-bare
repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">receive.denyCurrentBranch <br>
If set to true or &quot;refuse&quot;, git-receive-pack will
deny a ref update to the currently checked out branch of a
non-bare repository. Such a push is potentially dangerous
because <br>
it brings the HEAD out of sync with the index and working
tree. If set to &quot;warn&quot;, print a warning of such a
push to stderr, but allow the push to proceed. If set to
false or <br>
&quot;ignore&quot;, allow such pushes with no message.
Defaults to &quot;refuse&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">receive.denyNonFastForwards <br>
If set to true, git-receive-pack will deny a ref update
which is not a fast-forward. Use this to prevent such an
update via a push, even if that push is forced. This <br>
configuration variable is set when initializing a shared
repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">receive.hiderefs <br>
String(s) receive-pack uses to decide which refs to omit
from its initial advertisement. Use more than one
definitions to specify multiple prefix strings. A ref that
are <br>
under the hierarchies listed on the value of this variable
is excluded, and is hidden when responding to git push, and
an attempt to update or delete a hidden ref by git push <br>
is rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">receive.updateserverinfo <br>
If set to true, git-receive-pack will run
git-update-server-info after receiving data from git-push
and updating refs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote.pushdefault <br>
The remote to push to by default. Overrides
branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote for all branches, and is
overridden by branch.&lt;name&gt;.pushremote for specific
branches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote.&lt;name&gt;.url <br>
The URL of a remote repository. See git-fetch(1) or
git-push(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote.&lt;name&gt;.pushurl <br>
The push URL of a remote repository. See git-push(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote.&lt;name&gt;.proxy <br>
For remotes that require curl (http, https and ftp), the URL
to the proxy to use for that remote. Set to the empty string
to disable proxying for that remote.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote.&lt;name&gt;.fetch <br>
The default set of &quot;refspec&quot; for git-fetch(1). See
git-fetch(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote.&lt;name&gt;.push <br>
The default set of &quot;refspec&quot; for git-push(1). See
git-push(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote.&lt;name&gt;.mirror <br>
If true, pushing to this remote will automatically behave as
if the --mirror option was given on the command line.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote.&lt;name&gt;.skipDefaultUpdate
<br>
If true, this remote will be skipped by default when
updating using git-fetch(1) or the update subcommand of
git-remote(1).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote.&lt;name&gt;.skipFetchAll
<br>
If true, this remote will be skipped by default when
updating using git-fetch(1) or the update subcommand of
git-remote(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote.&lt;name&gt;.receivepack
<br>
The default program to execute on the remote side when
pushing. See option --receive-pack of git-push(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote.&lt;name&gt;.uploadpack
<br>
The default program to execute on the remote side when
fetching. See option --upload-pack of git-fetch-pack(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote.&lt;name&gt;.tagopt <br>
Setting this value to --no-tags disables automatic tag
following when fetching from remote &lt;name&gt;. Setting it
to --tags will fetch every tag from remote &lt;name&gt;,
even if they <br>
are not reachable from remote branch heads. Passing these
flags directly to git-fetch(1) can override this setting.
See options --tags and --no-tags of git-fetch(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote.&lt;name&gt;.vcs <br>
Setting this to a value &lt;vcs&gt; will cause Git to
interact with the remote with the git-remote-&lt;vcs&gt;
helper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remotes.&lt;group&gt; <br>
The list of remotes which are fetched by &quot;git remote
update &lt;group&gt;&quot;. See git-remote(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">repack.usedeltabaseoffset <br>
By default, git-repack(1) creates packs that use delta-base
offset. If you need to share your repository with Git older
than version 1.4.4, either directly or via a dumb <br>
protocol such as http, then you need to set this option to
&quot;false&quot; and repack. Access from old Git versions
over the native protocol are unaffected by this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rerere.autoupdate <br>
When set to true, git-rerere updates the index with the
resulting contents after it cleanly resolves conflicts using
previously recorded resolution. Defaults to false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rerere.enabled <br>
Activate recording of resolved conflicts, so that identical
conflict hunks can be resolved automatically, should they be
encountered again. By default, git-rerere(1) is <br>
enabled if there is an rr-cache directory under the
$GIT_DIR, e.g. if &quot;rerere&quot; was previously used in
the repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sendemail.identity <br>
A configuration identity. When given, causes values in the
sendemail.&lt;identity&gt; subsection to take precedence
over values in the sendemail section. The default identity
is <br>
the value of sendemail.identity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sendemail.smtpencryption <br>
See git-send-email(1) for description. Note that this
setting is not subject to the identity mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sendemail.smtpssl <br>
Deprecated alias for sendemail.smtpencryption = ssl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sendemail.&lt;identity&gt;.*
<br>
Identity-specific versions of the sendemail.* parameters
found below, taking precedence over those when the this
identity is selected, through command-line or <br>
sendemail.identity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sendemail.aliasesfile,
sendemail.aliasfiletype, sendemail.annotate, sendemail.bcc,

<br>
See git-send-email(1) for description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sendemail.signedoffcc <br>
Deprecated alias for sendemail.signedoffbycc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">showbranch.default <br>
The default set of branches for git-show-branch(1). See
git-show-branch(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status.relativePaths <br>
By default, git-status(1) shows paths relative to the
current directory. Setting this variable to false shows
paths relative to the repository root (this was the default
for <br>
Git prior to v1.5.4).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status.showUntrackedFiles <br>
By default, git-status(1) and git-commit(1) show files which
are not currently tracked by Git. Directories which contain
only untracked files, are shown with the directory <br>
name only. Showing untracked files means that Git needs to
lstat() all all the files in the whole repository, which
might be slow on some systems. So, this variable controls
<br>
how the commands displays the untracked files. Possible
values are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; no - Show no
untracked files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; normal - Show
untracked files and directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; all - Show also
individual files in untracked directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this variable is not
specified, it defaults to normal. This variable can be
overridden with the -u|--untracked-files option of
git-status(1) and git-commit(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status.submodulesummary <br>
Defaults to false. If this is set to a non zero number or
true (identical to -1 or an unlimited number), the submodule
summary will be enabled and a summary of commits for <br>
modified submodules will be shown (see --summary-limit
option of git-submodule(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">submodule.&lt;name&gt;.path,
submodule.&lt;name&gt;.url, submodule.&lt;name&gt;.update
<br>
The path within this project, URL, and the updating strategy
for a submodule. These variables are initially populated by
git submodule init; edit them to override the URL and <br>
other values found in the .gitmodules file. See
git-submodule(1) and gitmodules(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">submodule.&lt;name&gt;.branch
<br>
The remote branch name for a submodule, used by git
submodule update --remote. Set this option to override the
value found in the .gitmodules file. See git-submodule(1)
and <br>
gitmodules(5) for details.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">submodule.&lt;name&gt;.fetchRecurseSubmodules
<br>
This option can be used to control recursive fetching of
this submodule. It can be overridden by using the
--[no-]recurse-submodules command line option to &quot;git
fetch&quot; and <br>
&quot;git pull&quot;. This setting will override that from
in the gitmodules(5) file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">submodule.&lt;name&gt;.ignore
<br>
Defines under what circumstances &quot;git status&quot; and
the diff family show a submodule as modified. When set to
&quot;all&quot;, it will never be considered modified,
&quot;dirty&quot; will ignore <br>
all changes to the submodules work tree and takes only
differences between the HEAD of the submodule and the commit
recorded in the superproject into account.
&quot;untracked&quot; <br>
will additionally let submodules with modified tracked files
in their work tree show up. Using &quot;none&quot; (the
default when this option is not set) also shows submodules
that <br>
have untracked files in their work tree as changed. This
setting overrides any setting made in .gitmodules for this
submodule, both settings can be overridden on the command
<br>
line by using the &quot;--ignore-submodules&quot;
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tar.umask <br>
This variable can be used to restrict the permission bits of
tar archive entries. The default is 0002, which turns off
the world write bit. The special value &quot;user&quot;
indicates <br>
that the archiving user&acirc;s umask will be used instead.
See umask(2) and git-archive(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">transfer.fsckObjects <br>
When fetch.fsckObjects or receive.fsckObjects are not set,
the value of this variable is used instead. Defaults to
false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">transfer.hiderefs <br>
This variable can be used to set both receive.hiderefs and
uploadpack.hiderefs at the same time to the same values. See
entries for these other variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">transfer.unpackLimit <br>
When fetch.unpackLimit or receive.unpackLimit are not set,
the value of this variable is used instead. The default
value is 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uploadpack.hiderefs <br>
String(s) upload-pack uses to decide which refs to omit from
its initial advertisement. Use more than one definitions to
specify multiple prefix strings. A ref that are under <br>
the hierarchies listed on the value of this variable is
excluded, and is hidden from git ls-remote, git fetch, etc.
An attempt to fetch a hidden ref by git fetch will fail.
<br>
See also uploadpack.allowtipsha1inwant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uploadpack.allowtipsha1inwant
<br>
When uploadpack.hiderefs is in effect, allow upload-pack to
accept a fetch request that asks for an object at the tip of
a hidden ref (by default, such a request is <br>
rejected). see also uploadpack.hiderefs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">url.&lt;base&gt;.insteadOf <br>
Any URL that starts with this value will be rewritten to
start, instead, with &lt;base&gt;. In cases where some site
serves a large number of repositories, and serves them with
<br>
multiple access methods, and some users need to use
different access methods, this feature allows people to
specify any of the equivalent URLs and have Git
automatically <br>
rewrite the URL to the best alternative for the particular
user, even for a never-before-seen repository on the site.
When more than one insteadOf strings match a given URL, <br>
the longest match is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">url.&lt;base&gt;.pushInsteadOf
<br>
Any URL that starts with this value will not be pushed to;
instead, it will be rewritten to start with &lt;base&gt;,
and the resulting URL will be pushed to. In cases where some
<br>
site serves a large number of repositories, and serves them
with multiple access methods, some of which do not allow
push, this feature allows people to specify a pull-only <br>
URL and have Git automatically use an appropriate URL to
push, even for a never-before-seen repository on the site.
When more than one pushInsteadOf strings match a given <br>
URL, the longest match is used. If a remote has an explicit
pushurl, Git will ignore this setting for that remote.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user.email <br>
Your email address to be recorded in any newly created
commits. Can be overridden by the GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL,
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL, and EMAIL environment variables. See
git- <br>
commit-tree(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user.name <br>
Your full name to be recorded in any newly created commits.
Can be overridden by the GIT_AUTHOR_NAME and
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME environment variables. See
git-commit-tree(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user.signingkey <br>
If git-tag(1) is not selecting the key you want it to
automatically when creating a signed tag, you can override
the default selection with this variable. This option is
<br>
passed unchanged to gpg&acirc;s --local-user parameter, so
you may specify a key using any method that gpg
supports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">web.browser <br>
Specify a web browser that may be used by some commands.
Currently only git-instaweb(1) and git-help(1) may use
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GIT <br>
Part of the git(1) suite</p>
