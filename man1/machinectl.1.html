<p>MACHINECTL(1) machinectl MACHINECTL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
machinectl - Control the systemd machine manager</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
machinectl [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND} [NAME...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
machinectl may be used to introspect and control the state
of the systemd(1) virtual machine and container registration
manager systemd-machined.service(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are understood:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --property= <br>
When showing machine or image properties, limit the output
to certain properties as specified by the argument. If not
specified, all set properties are shown. The argument <br>
should be a property name, such as &quot;Name&quot;. If
specified more than once, all properties with the specified
names are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --all <br>
When showing machine or image properties, show all
properties regardless of whether they are set or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When listing VM or container
images, do not suppress images beginning in a dot character
(&quot;.&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --full <br>
Do not ellipsize process tree entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-ask-password <br>
Do not query the user for authentication for privileged
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--kill-who= <br>
When used with kill, choose which processes to kill. Must be
one of leader, or all to select whether to kill only the
leader process of the machine or all processes of the <br>
machine. If omitted, defaults to all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --signal= <br>
When used with kill, choose which signal to send to selected
processes. Must be one of the well-known signal specifiers,
such as SIGTERM, SIGINT or SIGSTOP. If omitted, <br>
defaults to SIGTERM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mkdir <br>
When used with bind creates the destination directory before
applying the bind mount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--read-only <br>
When used with bind applies a read-only bind mount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --lines= <br>
When used with status, controls the number of journal lines
to show, counting from the most recent ones. Takes a
positive integer argument. Defaults to 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --output= <br>
When used with status, controls the formatting of the
journal entries that are shown. For the available choices,
see journalctl(1). Defaults to &quot;short&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verify= <br>
When downloading a container or VM image, specify whether
the image shall be verified before it is made available.
Takes one of &quot;no&quot;, &quot;checksum&quot; and
&quot;signature&quot;. If &quot;no&quot; no <br>
verification is done. If &quot;checksum&quot; is specified
the download is checked for integrity after transfer is
complete, but no signatures are verified. If
&quot;signature&quot; is <br>
specified, the checksum is verified and the images&rsquo;s
signature is checked against a local keyring of trustable
vendors. It is strongly recommended to set this option to
<br>
&quot;signature&quot; if the server and protocol support
this. Defaults to &quot;signature&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force <br>
When downloading a container or VM image, and a local copy
by the specified local machine name already exists, delete
it first and replace it by the newly downloaded image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --host= <br>
Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or a
username and hostname separated by &quot;@&quot;, to connect
to. The hostname may optionally be suffixed by a container
name, <br>
separated by &quot;:&quot;, which connects directly to a
specific container on the specified host. This will use SSH
to talk to the remote machine manager instance. Container
names may <br>
be enumerated with machinectl -H HOST.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --machine= <br>
Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container
name to connect to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-pager <br>
Do not pipe output into a pager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-legend <br>
Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer
with hints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a short help text and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print a short version string and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
The following commands are understood:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Machine Commands <br>
list <br>
List currently running (online) virtual machines and
containers. To enumerate container images that can be
started, use list-images (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status NAME... <br>
Show terse runtime status information about one or more
virtual machines and containers, followed by the most recent
log data from the journal. This function is intended to <br>
generate human-readable output. If you are looking for
computer-parsable output, use show instead. Note that the
log data shown is reported by the virtual machine or <br>
container manager, and frequently contains console output of
the machine, but not necessarily journal contents of the
machine itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show NAME... <br>
Show properties of one or more registered virtual machines
or containers or the manager itself. If no argument is
specified, properties of the manager will be shown. If an
<br>
NAME is specified, properties of this virtual machine or
container are shown. By default, empty properties are
suppressed. Use --all to show those too. To select specific
<br>
properties to show, use --property=. This command is
intended to be used whenever computer-parsable output is
required. Use status if you are looking for formatted <br>
human-readable output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start NAME... <br>
Start a container as a system service, using
systemd-nspawn(1). This starts systemd-nspawn@.service,
instantiated for the specified machine name, similar to the
effect of <br>
systemctl start on the service name. systemd-nspawn looks
for a container image by the specified name in
/var/lib/machines/ (and other search paths, see below) and
runs it. <br>
Use list-images (see below), for listing available container
images to start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that
systemd-machined.service(8) also interfaces with a variety
of other container and VM managers, systemd-nspawn is just
one implementation of it. Most of the commands <br>
available in machinectl may be used on containers or VMs
controlled by other managers, not just systemd-nspawn.
Starting VMs and container images on those managers requires
<br>
manager-specific tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To interactively start a
container on the command line with full access to the
container&rsquo;s console, please invoke systemd-nspawn
directly. To stop a running container use <br>
machinectl poweroff, see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">login NAME <br>
Open an interactive terminal login session to a container.
This will create a TTY connection to a specific container
and asks for the execution of a getty on it. Note that <br>
this is only supported for containers running systemd(1) as
init system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command will open a full
login prompt on the container, which then asks for username
and password. Use systemd-run(1) with the --machine= switch
to invoke a single <br>
command, either interactively or in the background within a
local container.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable NAME..., disable NAME...
<br>
Enable or disable a container as a system service to start
at system boot, using systemd-nspawn(1). This enables or
disables systemd-nspawn@.service, instantiated for the <br>
specified machine name, similar to the effect of systemctl
enable or systemctl disable on the service name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">poweroff NAME... <br>
Power off one or more containers. This will trigger a reboot
by sending SIGRTMIN+4 to the container&rsquo;s init process,
which causes systemd-compatible init systems to shut down
<br>
cleanly. This operation does not work on containers that do
not run a systemd(1)-compatible init system, such as
sysvinit. Use terminate (see below) to immediately terminate
<br>
a container or VM, without cleanly shutting it down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reboot NAME... <br>
Reboot one or more containers. This will trigger a reboot by
sending SIGINT to the container&rsquo;s init process, which
is roughly equivalent to pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del on a <br>
non-containerized system, and is compatible with containers
running any system manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">terminate NAME... <br>
Immediately terminates a virtual machine or container,
without cleanly shutting it down. This kills all processes
of the virtual machine or container and deallocates all <br>
resources attached to that instance. Use poweroff to issue a
clean shutdown request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill NAME... <br>
Send a signal to one or more processes of the virtual
machine or container. This means processes as seen by the
host, not the processes inside the virtual machine or <br>
container. Use --kill-who= to select which process to kill.
Use --signal= to select the signal to send.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind NAME PATH [PATH] <br>
Bind mounts a directory from the host into the specified
container. The first directory argument is the source
directory on the host, the second directory argument the
source <br>
directory on the host. When the latter is omitted the
destination path in the container is the same as the source
path on the host. When combined with the --read-only switch
<br>
a ready-only bind mount is created. When combined with the
--mkdir switch the destination path is first created before
the mount is applied. Note that this option is <br>
currently only supported for systemd-nspawn(1)
containers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copy-to NAME PATH [PATH] <br>
Copies files or directories from the host system into a
running container. Takes a container name, followed by the
source path on the host and the destination path in the <br>
container. If the destination path is omitted the same as
the source path is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copy-from NAME PATH [PATH] <br>
Copies files or directories from a container into the host
system. Takes a container name, followed by the source path
in the container the destination path on the host. If <br>
the destination path is omitted the same as the source path
is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Image Commands <br>
list-images <br>
Show a list of locally installed container and VM images.
This enumerates all raw disk images and container
directories and subvolumes in /var/lib/machines/ (and other
search <br>
paths, see below). Use start (see above) to run a container
off one of the listed images. Note that by default
containers whose name begins with a dot (&quot;.&quot;) are
not shown. To <br>
show these too, specify --all. Note that a special image
&quot;.host&quot; always implicitly exists and refers to the
image the host itself is booted from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">image-status NAME... <br>
Show terse status information about one or more container or
VM images. This function is intended to generate
human-readable output. Use show-image (see below) to
generate <br>
computer-parsable output instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-image NAME... <br>
Show properties of one or more registered virtual machine or
container images, or the manager itself. If no argument is
specified, properties of the manager will be shown. If <br>
an NAME is specified, properties of this virtual machine or
container image are shown. By default, empty properties are
suppressed. Use --all to show those too. To select <br>
specific properties to show, use --property=. This command
is intended to be used whenever computer-parsable output is
required. Use image-status if you are looking for <br>
formatted human-readable output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clone NAME NAME <br>
Clones a container or disk image. The arguments specify the
name of the image to clone and the name of the newly cloned
image. Note that plain directory container images are <br>
cloned into subvolume images with this command. Note that
cloning a container or VM image is optimized for btrfs file
systems, and might not be efficient on others, due to <br>
file system limitations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rename NAME NAME <br>
Renames a container or disk image. The arguments specify the
name of the image to rename and the new name of the
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">read-only NAME [BOOL] <br>
Marks or (unmarks) a container or disk image read-only.
Takes a VM or container image name, followed by a boolean as
arguments. If the boolean is omitted, positive is <br>
implied, i.e. the image is marked read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove NAME... <br>
Removes one or more container or disk images. The special
image &quot;.host&quot;, which refers to the host&rsquo;s
own directory tree may not be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Image Transfer Commands <br>
pull-tar URL [NAME] <br>
Downloads a .tar container image from the specified URL, and
makes it available under the specified local machine name.
The URL must be of type &quot;http://&quot; or
&quot;https://&quot;, and <br>
must refer to a .tar, .tar.gz, .tar.xz or .tar.bz2 archive
file. If the local machine name is omitted the name it is
automatically derived from the last component of the URL,
<br>
with its suffix removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The image is verified before it
is made available, unless --verify=no is specified.
Verification is done via SHA256SUMS and SHA256SUMS.gpg
files, that need to be made <br>
available on the same web server, under the same URL as the
.tar file, but with the last component (the filename) of the
URL replaced. With --verify=checksum only the SHA256 <br>
checksum for the file is verified, based on the SHA256SUMS
file. With --verify=signature the SHA256SUMS file is first
verified with detached GPG signature file <br>
SHA256SUMS.gpg. The public key for this verification step
needs to be available in /usr/lib/systemd/import-pubring.gpg
or /etc/systemd/import-pubring.gpg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The container image will be
downloaded and stored in a read-only subvolume in
/var/lib/machines/, that is named after the specified URL
and its HTTP etag. A writable snapshot <br>
is then taken from this subvolume, and named after the
specified local name. This behaviour ensures that creating
multiple container instances of the same URL is efficient,
<br>
as multiple downloads are not necessary. In order to create
only the read-only image, and avoid creating its writable
snapshot, specify &quot;-&quot; as local machine name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the read-only
subvolume is prefixed with .tar-, and is thus now shown by
list-images, unless --all is passed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that pressing C-c during
execution of this command will not abort the download. Use
cancel-transfer, described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pull-raw URL [NAME] <br>
Downloads a .raw container or VM disk image from the
specified URL, and makes it available under the specified
local machine name. The URL must be of type
&quot;http://&quot; or <br>
&quot;https://&quot;. The container image must either be a
.qcow2 or raw disk image, optionally compressed as .gz, .xz,
or .bz2. If the local machine name is omitted the name it is
<br>
automatically derived from the last component of the URL,
with its suffix removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Image verification is identical
for raw and tar images (see above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the the downloaded image is
in .qcow2 format it es converted into a raw image file
before it is made available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Downloaded images of this type
will be placed as read-only .raw file in /var/lib/machines/.
A local, writable (reflinked) copy is then made under the
specified local machine <br>
name. To omit creation of the local, writable copy pass
&quot;-&quot; as local machine name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similar to the behaviour of
pull-tar, the read-only image is prefixed with .raw-, and
thus now shown by list-images, unless --all is passed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that pressing C-c during
execution of this command will not abort the download. Use
cancel-transfer, described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-transfers <br>
Shows a list of container or VM image downloads that are
currently in progress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cancel-transfers ID... <br>
Aborts download of the container or VM image with the
specified ID. To list ongoing transfers and their IDs, use
list-transfers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES AND DIRECTORIES <br>
Machine images are preferably stored in /var/lib/machines/,
but are also searched for in /usr/local/lib/machines/ and
/usr/lib/machines/. For compatibility reasons the directory
<br>
/var/lib/container/ is searched, too. Note that images
stored below /usr are always considered read-only. It is
possible to symlink machines images from other directories
into <br>
/var/lib/machines/ to make them available for control with
machinectl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disk images are understood by
systemd-nspawn(1) and machinectl in three formats:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A simple
directory tree, containing the files and directories of the
container to boot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A subvolume (on
btrfs file systems), which are similar to the simple
directories, described above. However, they have additional
benefits, such as efficient cloning and quota <br>
reporting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;Raw&quot;
disk images, i.e. binary images of disks with a GPT or MBR
partition table. Images of this type are regular files with
the suffix &quot;.raw&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See systemd-nspawn(1) for more
information on image formats, in particular it&rsquo;s
--directory= and --image= options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Example 1. Download an Ubuntu image and open a shell in
it</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># machinectl pull-tar
https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/trusty/current/trusty-server-cloudimg-amd64-root.tar.gz
<br>
# systemd-nspawn -M trusty-server-cloudimg-amd64-root</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This downloads and verifies the
specified .tar image, and then uses systemd-nspawn(1) to
open a shell in it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 2. Download a Fedora
image, set a root password in it, start it as service</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># machinectl pull-raw
--verify=no
http://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/fedora/linux/releases/21/Cloud/Images/x86_64/Fedora-Cloud-Base-20141203-21.x86_64.raw.xz
<br>
# systemd-nspawn -M Fedora-Cloud-Base-20141203-21 <br>
# passwd <br>
# exit <br>
# machinectl start Fedora-Cloud-Base-20141203-21 <br>
# machinectl login Fedora-Cloud-Base-20141203-21</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This downloads the specified
.raw image with verification disabled. Then a shell is
opened in it and a root password is set. Afterwards the
shell is left, and the machine started <br>
as system service. With the last command a login prompt into
the container is requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
$SYSTEMD_PAGER <br>
Pager to use when --no-pager is not given; overrides $PAGER.
Setting this to an empty string or the value &quot;cat&quot;
is equivalent to passing --no-pager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYSTEMD_LESS <br>
Override the default options passed to less
(&quot;FRSXMK&quot;).</p>
