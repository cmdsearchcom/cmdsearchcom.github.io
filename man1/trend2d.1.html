<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
trend2d - Fit a [weighted] [robust] polynomial model for z =
f(x,y) to xyz[w] data</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
trend2d [ table ] -Fxyzmrw -Nn_model[+r] [ xyz[w]file ] [
-Ccondition_number ] [ -I[confidence_level] ] [ -V[level] ]
[ -W ] [ [ -bbinary ] [ -dnodata ] [ -eregexp ] [ <br>
-fflags ] [ -hheaders ] [ -iflags ] [ -:[i|o] ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: No space is allowed
between the option flag and the associated arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
trend2d reads x,y,z [and w] values from the first three
[four] columns on standard input [or xyz[w]file] and fits a
regression model z = f(x,y) + e by [weighted] least squares.
<br>
The fit may be made robust by iterative reweighting of the
data. The user may also search for the number of terms in
f(x,y) which significantly reduce the variance in z. n_model
<br>
may be in [1,10] to fit a model of the following form
(similar to grdtrend): <br>
m1 + m2*x + m3*y + m4*x*y + m5*x*x + m6*y*y + m7*x*x*x +
m8*x*x*y + m9*x*y*y + m10*y*y*y.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user must specify -Nn_model,
the number of model parameters to use; thus, -N4 fits a
bilinear trend, -N6 a quadratic surface, and so on.
Optionally, append +r to perform a <br>
robust fit. In this case, the program will iteratively
reweight the data based on a robust scale estimate, in order
to converge to a solution insensitive to outliers. This may
be <br>
handy when separating a &acirc;regional&acirc; field from a
&acirc;residual&acirc; which should have non-zero mean, such
as a local mountain on a regional surface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIRED ARGUMENTS <br>
-Fxyzmrw <br>
Specify up to six letters from the set {x y z m r w} in any
order to create columns of ASCII [or binary] output. x = x,
y = y, z = z, m = model f(x,y), r = residual z - m, <br>
w = weight used in fitting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Nn_model[+r] <br>
Specify the number of terms in the model, n_model, and
append +r to do a robust fit. E.g., a robust bilinear model
is -N4+r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS <br>
table One or more ASCII [or binary, see -bi] files
containing x,y,z [w] values in the first 3 [4] columns. If
no files are specified, trend2d will read from standard
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ccondition_number <br>
Set the maximum allowed condition number for the matrix
solution. trend2d fits a damped least squares model,
retaining only that part of the eigenvalue spectrum such
that <br>
the ratio of the largest eigenvalue to the smallest
eigenvalue is condition_#. [Default: condition_# = 1.0e06.
].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I[confidence_level] <br>
Iteratively increase the number of model parameters,
starting at one, until n_model is reached or the reduction
in variance of the model is not significant at the
confi&acirc; <br>
dence_level level. You may set -I only, without an attached
number; in this case the fit will be iterative with a
default confidence level of 0.51. Or choose your own <br>
level between 0 and 1. See remarks section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V[level] (more &acirc;&brvbar;)
<br>
Select verbosity level [c].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W Weights are supplied in input
column 4. Do a weighted least squares fit [or start with
these weights when doing the iterative robust fit]. [Default
reads only the first 3 <br>
columns.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bi[ncols][t] (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Select native binary input. [Default is 3 (or 4 if -W is
set) input columns].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bo[ncols][type] (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Select native binary output. [Default is 1-6 columns as set
by -F].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d[i|o]nodata (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Replace input columns that equal nodata with NaN and do the
reverse on output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e[~]&acirc;pattern&acirc; |
-e[~]/regexp/[i] (more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Only accept data records that match the given pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f[i|o]colinfo (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Specify data types of input and/or output columns.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h[i|o][n][+c][+d][+rremark][+rtitle]
(more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Skip or produce header record(s).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-icols[+l][+sscale][+ooffset][,&acirc;&brvbar;]
(more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Select input columns and transformations (0 is first
column).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-:[i|o] (more &acirc;&brvbar;)
<br>
Swap 1st and 2nd column on input and/or output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-^ or just - <br>
Print a short message about the syntax of the command, then
exits (NOTE: on Windows just use -).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+ or just + <br>
Print an extensive usage (help) message, including the
explanation of any module-specific option (but not the GMT
common options), then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? or no arguments <br>
Print a complete usage (help) message, including the
explanation of all options, then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMARKS <br>
The domain of x and y will be shifted and scaled to [-1, 1]
and the basis functions are built from Chebyshev
polynomials. These have a numerical advantage in the form of
the <br>
matrix which must be inverted and allow more accurate
solutions. In many applications of trend2d the user has data
located approximately along a line in the x,y plane which
makes <br>
an angle with the x axis (such as data collected along a
road or ship track). In this case the accuracy could be
improved by a rotation of the x,y axes. trend2d does not
search <br>
for such a rotation; instead, it may find that the matrix
problem has deficient rank. However, the solution is
computed using the generalized inverse and should still work
out <br>
OK. The user should check the results graphically if trend2d
shows deficient rank. NOTE: The model parameters listed with
-V are Chebyshev coefficients; they are not numerically <br>
equivalent to the m#s in the equation described above. The
description above is to allow the user to match -N with the
order of the polynomial surface. For evaluating Chebyshev
<br>
polynomials, see grdmath.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -Nn_modelr (robust) and -I
(iterative) options evaluate the significance of the
improvement in model misfit Chi-Squared by an F test. The
default confidence limit is set at <br>
0.51; it can be changed with the -I option. The user may be
surprised to find that in most cases the reduction in
variance achieved by increasing the number of terms in a
model <br>
is not significant at a very high degree of confidence. For
example, with 120 degrees of freedom, Chi-Squared must
decrease by 26% or more to be significant at the 95%
confidence <br>
level. If you want to keep iterating as long as Chi-Squared
is decreasing, set confidence_level to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A low confidence limit (such as
the default value of 0.51) is needed to make the robust
method work. This method iteratively reweights the data to
reduce the influence of out&acirc; <br>
liers. The weight is based on the Median Absolute Deviation
and a formula from Huber [1964], and is 95% efficient when
the model residuals have an outlier-free normal
distribu&acirc; <br>
tion. This means that the influence of outliers is reduced
only slightly at each iteration; consequently the reduction
in Chi-Squared is not very significant. If the procedure
<br>
needs a few iterations to successfully attenuate their
effect, the significance level of the F test must be kept
low.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASCII FORMAT PRECISION <br>
The ASCII output formats of numerical data are controlled by
parameters in your gmt.conf file. Longitude and latitude are
formatted according to FORMAT_GEO_OUT, absolute time is <br>
under the control of FORMAT_DATE_OUT and FORMAT_CLOCK_OUT,
whereas general floating point values are formatted
according to FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT. Be aware that the format in
effect <br>
can lead to loss of precision in ASCII output, which can
lead to various problems downstream. If you find the output
is not written with enough precision, consider switching to
<br>
binary output (-bo if available) or specify more decimals
using the FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To remove a planar trend from data.xyz by ordinary least
squares, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt trend2d data.xyz -Fxyr -N2
&gt; detrended_data.xyz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make the above planar trend
robust with respect to outliers, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt trend2d data.xzy -Fxyr -N2+r
&gt; detrended_data.xyz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To find out how many terms (up
to 10 in a robust interpolant are significant in fitting
data.xyz, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt trend2d data.xyz -N10+r -I
-V</p>
