<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
infocmp - compare or print out terminfo descriptions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
infocmp [-1CDEFGIKLTUVcdegilnpqrtux] <br>
[-v n] [-s d| i| l| c] [-Q n] [-R subset] <br>
[-w width] [-A directory] [-B directory] <br>
[termname...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
infocmp can be used to compare a binary terminfo entry with
other terminfo entries, rewrite a terminfo description to
take advantage of the use= terminfo field, or print out a
<br>
terminfo description from the binary file (term) in a
variety of formats. In all cases, the boolean fields will be
printed first, followed by the numeric fields, followed by
the <br>
string fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default Options <br>
If no options are specified and zero or one termnames are
specified, the -I option will be assumed. If more than one
termname is specified, the -d option will be assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comparison Options [-d] [-c]
[-n] <br>
infocmp compares the terminfo description of the first
terminal termname with each of the descriptions given by the
entries for the other terminal&rsquo;s termnames. If a
capability <br>
is defined for only one of the terminals, the value returned
will depend on the type of the capability: F for boolean
variables, -1 for integer variables, and NULL for string
<br>
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -d option produces a list of
each capability that is different between two entries. This
option is useful to show the difference between two entries,
created by different <br>
people, for the same or similar terminals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -c option produces a list of
each capability that is common between two or more entries.
Capabilities that are not set are ignored. This option can
be used as a quick check <br>
to see if the -u option is worth using.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -n option produces a list of
each capability that is in none of the given entries. If no
termnames are given, the environment variable TERM will be
used for both of the <br>
termnames. This can be used as a quick check to see if
anything was left out of a description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Source Listing Options [-I] [-L]
[-C] [-r] <br>
The -I, -L, and -C options will produce a source listing for
each terminal named.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I use the terminfo names <br>
-L use the long C variable name listed in &lt;term.h&gt;
<br>
-C use the termcap names <br>
-r when using -C, put out all capabilities in termcap form
<br>
-K modifies the -C option, improving BSD-compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no termnames are given, the
environment variable TERM will be used for the terminal
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The source produced by the -C
option may be used directly as a termcap entry, but not all
parameterized strings can be changed to the termcap format.
infocmp will attempt to <br>
convert most of the parameterized information, and anything
not converted will be plainly marked in the output and
commented out. These should be edited by hand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For best results when converting
to termcap format, you should use both -C and -r. Normally a
termcap description is limited to 1023 bytes. infocmp trims
away less essential <br>
parts to make it fit. If you are converting to one of the
(rare) termcap implementations which accept an unlimited
size of termcap, you may want to add the -T option. More
<br>
often however, you must help the termcap implementation, and
trim excess whitespace (use the -0 option for that).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All padding information for
strings will be collected together and placed at the
beginning of the string where termcap expects it. Mandatory
padding (padding information with a <br>
trailing &rsquo;/&rsquo;) will become optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All termcap variables no longer
supported by terminfo, but which are derivable from other
terminfo variables, will be output. Not all terminfo
capabilities will be translated; <br>
only those variables which were part of termcap will
normally be output. Specifying the -r option will take off
this restriction, allowing all capabilities to be output in
term&acirc; <br>
cap form. Normally you would use both the -C and -r options.
The actual format used incorporates some improvements for
escaped characters from terminfo format. For a stricter <br>
BSD-compatible translation, use the -K option rather than
-C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that because padding is
collected to the beginning of the capability, not all
capabilities are output. Mandatory padding is not supported.
Because termcap strings are not <br>
as flexible, it is not always possible to convert a terminfo
string capability into an equivalent termcap format. A
subsequent conversion of the termcap file back into terminfo
<br>
format will not necessarily reproduce the original terminfo
source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some common terminfo parameter
sequences, their termcap equivalents, and some terminal
types which commonly have such sequences, are:</p>

%p2 is printed before %p1 %r hp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use= Option [-u] <br>
The -u option produces a terminfo source description of the
first terminal termname which is relative to the sum of the
descriptions given by the entries for the other terminals
<br>
termnames. It does this by analyzing the differences between
the first termname and the other termnames and producing a
description with use= fields for the other terminals. In
<br>
this manner, it is possible to retrofit generic terminfo
entries into a terminal&rsquo;s description. Or, if two
similar terminals exist, but were coded at different times
or by dif&acirc; <br>
ferent people so that each description is a full
description, using infocmp will show what can be done to
change one description to be relative to the other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A capability will get printed
with an at-sign (@) if it no longer exists in the first
termname, but one of the other termname entries contains a
value for it. A capability&rsquo;s <br>
value gets printed if the value in the first termname is not
found in any of the other termname entries, or if the first
of the other termname entries that has this capability <br>
gives a different value for the capability than that in the
first termname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The order of the other termname
entries is significant. Since the terminfo compiler tic does
a left-to-right scan of the capabilities, specifying two
use= entries that contain <br>
differing entries for the same capabilities will produce
different results depending on the order that the entries
are given in. infocmp will flag any such inconsistencies
<br>
between the other termname entries as they are found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, specifying a
capability after a use= entry that contains that capability
will cause the second specification to be ignored. Using
infocmp to recreate a descrip&acirc; <br>
tion can be a useful check to make sure that everything was
specified correctly in the original source description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another error that does not
cause incorrect compiled files, but will slow down the
compilation time, is specifying extra use= fields that are
superfluous. infocmp will flag any <br>
other termname use= fields that were not needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changing Databases [-A
directory] [-B directory] <br>
Like other ncurses utilities, infocmp looks for the terminal
descriptions in several places. You can use the TERMINFO and
TERMINFO_DIRS environment variables to override the <br>
compiled-in default list of places to search (see curses(3X)
for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also use the options -A
and -B to override the list of places to search when
comparing terminal descriptions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The -A option
sets the location for the first termname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The -B option
sets the location for the other termnames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using these options, it is
possible to compare descriptions for a terminal with the
same name located in two different databases. For instance,
you can use this feature for com&acirc; <br>
paring descriptions for the same terminal created by
different people.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other Options <br>
-0 causes the fields to be printed on one line, without
wrapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 causes the fields to be
printed out one to a line. Otherwise, the fields will be
printed several to a line to a maximum width of 60
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a tells infocmp to retain
commented-out capabilities rather than discarding them.
Capabilities are commented by prefixing them with a
period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D tells infocmp to print the
database locations that it knows about, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Dump the capabilities of the
given terminal as tables, needed in the C initializer for a
TERMTYPE structure (the terminal capability structure in the
&lt;term.h&gt;). This option <br>
is useful for preparing versions of the curses library
hardwired for a given terminal type. The tables are all
declared static, and are named according to the type and the
<br>
name of the corresponding terminal entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before ncurses 5.0, the split
between the -e and -E options was not needed; but support
for extended names required making the arrays of terminal
capabilities separate from <br>
the TERMTYPE structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Dump the capabilities of the
given terminal as a C initializer for a TERMTYPE structure
(the terminal capability structure in the &lt;term.h&gt;).
This option is useful for pre&acirc; <br>
paring versions of the curses library hardwired for a given
terminal type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F compare terminfo files. This
assumes that two following arguments are filenames. The
files are searched for pairwise matches between entries,
with two entries considered <br>
to match if any of their names do. The report printed to
standard output lists entries with no matches in the other
file, and entries with more than one match. For entries <br>
with exactly one match it includes a difference report.
Normally, to reduce the volume of the report, use references
are not resolved before looking for differences, but <br>
resolution can be forced by also specifying -r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Display complex terminfo
strings which contain if/then/else/endif expressions
indented for readability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Display constant literals in
decimal form rather than their character equivalents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Display constant character
literals in quoted form rather than their decimal
equivalents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Analyze the initialization
(is1, is2, is3), and reset (rs1, rs2, rs3), strings in the
entry, as well as those used for starting/stopping
cursor-positioning mode (smcup, <br>
rmcup) as well as starting/stopping keymap mode (smkx,
rmkx).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each string, the code tries
to analyze it into actions in terms of the other
capabilities in the entry, certain X3.64/ISO 6429/ECMA-48
capabilities, and certain DEC VT- <br>
series private modes (the set of recognized special
sequences has been selected for completeness over the
existing terminfo database). Each report line consists of
the <br>
capability name, followed by a colon and space, followed by
a printable expansion of the capability string with sections
matching recognized actions translated into <br>
{}-bracketed descriptions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An SGR0 designates an empty

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Ignore padding specifications

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q n Rather than show source in
terminfo (text) format, print the compiled (binary) format
in hexadecimal or base64 form, depending on the
option&rsquo;s value:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 hexadecimal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 base64</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 hexadecimal and base64</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q This makes the output a
little shorter:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Make the
comparison listing shorter by omitting subheadings, and
using &quot;-&quot; for absent capabilities, &quot;@&quot;
for canceled rather than &quot;NULL&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Omit the
&quot;Reconstructed from&quot; comment for source
listings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Rsubset <br>
Restrict output to a given subset. This option is for use
with archaic versions of terminfo like those on SVr1,
Ultrix, or HP/UX that do not support the full set of <br>
SVR4/XSI Curses terminfo; and variants such as AIX that have
their own extensions incompatible with SVr4/XSI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Available terminfo subsets are
&quot;SVr1&quot;, &quot;Ultrix&quot;, &quot;HP&quot;, and
&quot;AIX&quot;; see terminfo(5) for details. You can also
choose the subset &quot;BSD&quot; which selects only
capabilities with <br>
termcap equivalents recognized by 4.4BSD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s [d|i|l|c] <br>
The -s option sorts the fields within each type according to
the argument below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d leave fields in the order that
they are stored in the terminfo database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i sort by terminfo name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l sort by the long C variable
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c sort by the termcap name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -s option is not given,
the fields printed out will be sorted alphabetically by the
terminfo name within each type, except in the case of the -C
or the -L options, <br>
which cause the sorting to be done by the termcap name or
the long C variable name, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T eliminates size-restrictions
on the generated text. This is mainly useful for testing and
analysis, since the compiled descriptions are limited (e.g.,
1023 for termcap, <br>
4096 for terminfo).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t tells tic to discard
commented-out capabilities. Normally when translating from
terminfo to termcap, untranslatable capabilities are
commented-out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U tells infocmp to not
post-process the data after parsing the source file. This
feature helps when comparing the actual contents of two
source files, since it excludes the <br>
inferences that infocmp makes to fill in missing data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V reports the version of
ncurses which was used in this program, and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v n prints out tracing
information on standard error as the program runs. Higher
values of n induce greater verbosity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w width <br>
changes the output to width characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x print information for
user-defined capabilities. These are extensions to the
terminfo repertoire which can be loaded using the -x option
of tic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/terminfo Compiled terminal description database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENSIONS <br>
The -0, -1, -E, -F, -G, -R, -T, -V, -a, -e, -f, -g, -i, -l,
-p, -q and -t options are not supported in SVr4 curses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -r option&rsquo;s notion of
&lsquo;termcap&rsquo; capabilities is System V Release
4&rsquo;s. Actual BSD curses versions will have a more
restricted set. To see only the 4.4BSD set, use -r
-RBSD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The -F option of infocmp(1) should be a toe(1) mode.</p>
