<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
scalpel - Recover files or data fragments from a disk image
using file type-specific patterns</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
scalpel [-b] [-c &lt;config file&gt;] [-d] [-e] [-h] [-i
&lt;file&gt;] [-n] [-o &lt;dir&gt;] [-O] [-p] [-q
&lt;clustersize&gt;] [-r] [-V] [-v] [FILES]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Recover files from a disk image or raw block device based on
headers and footers specified by the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Carve files even if defined
footers aren&rsquo;t discovered within maximum carve size
for file type [foremost 0.69 compat mode]. This option may
help when fragmentary evidence <br>
is useful, but will increase the number of false
positives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c file <br>
Chooses which configuration file to use. If this option is
omitted, then &quot;scalpel.conf&quot; in the current
directory is used. The format for the configuration file is
<br>
described in the default configuration file
&quot;scalpel.conf&quot;. See the CONFIGURATION FILE section
below for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Generate header/footer
database. This option forces Scalpel to discover all headers
and footers and write header/footer locations to a text
file. Since certain optimiza&acirc; <br>
tions are bypassed when all footers must be discovered,
performance will suffer. This option does not affect the set
of files that are carved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Do nested header/footer
matching, to deal with structured files that may contain
embedded files of the same type. Applicable only to FORWARD
/ NEXT patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Show a help screen and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i file <br>
file is used as a list of input files to examine. Each line
in the specified file should contain a single filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o directory <br>
Recovered files are written to the directory directory.
Scalpel requires that this directory be either empty or not
exist. The directory will be created if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Don&rsquo;t add extensions to
extracted files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Set output directory for
carved files. Scalpel will only write carved files to an
empty output directory. &quot;scalpel-output&quot; in the
current directory is the default if <br>
this option is not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O Don&rsquo;t organize carved
files by type. By default, scalpel organizes carved files
into subdirectories, by type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Perform an image file
preview. When this option is specified, the audit log
indicates which files would have been carved, but no files
are actually carved. This option <br>
also supports in-place file carving.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Carve files only when the
header is cluster-aligned. If you aren&rsquo;t interested in
carving files embedded within other file types, this option
should be used, as it signifi&acirc; <br>
cantly reduces the false positive rate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Find only first of
overlapping headers/footers [foremost 0.69 compat mode].
This option is rarely needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Show copyright information
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Enables verbose mode. This
causes copious amounts of debugging information to be
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
The configuration file is used to control the types of files
Scalpel will attempt to carve. A sample configuration file,
&quot;scalpel.conf&quot;, is included with this
distribution. For <br>
each file type, the configuration file describes the
file&rsquo;s extension, whether the header and footer are
case sensitive, the minimum and maximum file sizes, and the
header and <br>
footer for the file. Minimum carve sizes and footer fields
are optional, but the header, maximum size, case
sensitivity, and extension fields are required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any line in the configuration
file that begins with a pound sign is considered a comment
and ignored. Please see the documentation in the sample
configuration file for more <br>
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
Written by Golden G. Richard III and Lodovico Marziale. The
first version of Scalpel was based on foremost 0.69, which
was written by Special Agent Kris Kendall and Special <br>
Agent Jesse Kornblum of the United States Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
It is currently not possible to carve block devices directly
using the Windows version of Scalpel. This may be addressed
in a future release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORTING BUGS <br>

of the problem, how you found it, and your contact
