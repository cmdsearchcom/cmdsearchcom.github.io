<p>GCL(1L) GCL(1L)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gcl - GCL Common Lisp interpreter/compiler, CVS snapshot</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gcl [ options ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The program gcl is an implementation of a subset of the
Common Lisp Ansi standard. It is written in C and in Common
Lisp, and is highly portable. It includes those features in
<br>
the original definition of Common Lisp, (Guy Steele version
1.), as well as some features from the proposed new
standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The best documentation is
available in texinfo/info form, with there being three
groups of information. gcl-si for basic common lisp
descriptions, and features unique to gcl The <br>
gcl-tk info refers to the connection with tk window system,
allowing all the power of the tcl/tk interaction system to
be used from lisp. The third info file gcl details the <br>
Ansi standard for common lisp, to which this subset tries to
adhere. It is highly recommended to write programs, which
will be in the intersection of gcl and ansi common lisp.
<br>
Unfortunately the Ansi standard is huge, and will require a
substantial effort, and increase in the size of gcl, to
include all of it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When gcl is invoked from the
shell, the variable si::*command-args* is set to the list of
command line arguments. Various options are understood:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-eval command <br>
Call read and then eval on the command passed in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- Stop processing arguments,
setting si::*command-args* to a list containing the
arguments after the --.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-load pathname <br>
Load the file whose pathname is specified after -load.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Open the file following -f
for input, skip the first line, and then read and eval the
rest of the forms in the file. Replaces si::*command-args*
by the the list starting <br>
after -f. This can be used as with the shells to write small
shell programs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/local/bin/gcl.exe -f <br>
(format t &quot;hello world ~a~%&quot; (nth 1
si::*command-args*))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value si::*command-args*
will have the appropriate value. Thus if the above 2 line
file is made executable and called foo then</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tutorial% foo billy <br>
hello world billy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: On many systems (eg SunOs)
the first line of an executable script file such as:
#!/usr/local/bin/gcl.exe -f only reads the first 32
characters! So if your pathname <br>
where the executable together with the &rsquo;-f&rsquo;
amount to more than 32 characters the file will not be
recognized. Also the executable must be the actual large
binary file, [or a <br>
link to it], and not just a /bin/sh script. In latter case
the /bin/sh interpreter would get invoked on the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternately one could invoke the
file foo without making it executable:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tutorial% gcl -f foo &quot;from
bill&quot; <br>
hello world from bill</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-batch Do not enter the command
print loop. Useful if the other command line arguments do
something. Do not print the License and acknowledgement
information. Note if your <br>
program does print any License information, it must print
the GCL header information also.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dir Directory where the
executable binary that is running is located. Needed by save
and friends. This gets set as si::*system-directory*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-libdir <br>
-libdir /d/wfs/gcl-2.0/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would mean that the files like
gcl-tk/tk.o would be found by concatting the path to the
libdir path, ie in /d/wfs/gcl-2.0/gcl-tk/tk.o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-compile <br>
Invoke the compiler on the filename following -compile Other
flags affect compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o-file <br>
If nil follows -o-file then do not produce an .o file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c-file <br>
If -c-file is specified, leave the intermediate .c file
there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h-file <br>
If -h-file is specified, leave the intermediate .h file
there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-data-file <br>
If -data-file is specified, leave the intermediate .data
file there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-system-p <br>
If -system-p is specified then invoke compile-file with the
:system-p t keyword argument, meaning that the C init
function will bear a name based on the name of the file,
<br>
so that it may be invoked by name by C code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This GNU package should not be
confused with the proprietary program distributed by FRANZ,
Inc. Nor should it be confused with any public domain or
proprietary lisp sys&acirc; <br>
tem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For anything other than program
development, use of the lisp compiler is strongly
recommended in preference to use of the interpreter, due to
much higher speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
The GCL system contains C and Lisp source files to build a
Common Lisp system. CGL is derived from Kyoto Common LISP
(kcl), which was written in 1984 by T. Yuasa and M. Hagiya
<br>
(working under Professor R. Nakajima at the Research
Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Kyoto University). The
AKCL system work was begun in 1987 by William Schelter at
the <br>
University of Texas, Austin, and continued through 1994. In
1994 AKCL was released as GCL (GNU Common Lisp) under the
GNU public library license.</p>
