<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pamendian - reverse endianness of a Netpbm image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pamendian</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All Netpbm formats that have
samples in pure binary format with multiple bytes are
defined to have them in big endian (most significant byte
first) order. However, there exist <br>
variations on these formats, primarily developed before
official multibyte Netpbm formats existed, that are
identical to Netpbm formats in every respect except that
samples are <br>
in little endian (least significant byte first) order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamendian reverses the byte
order of the sample to convert between the two formats. If
the input is true PAM, PGM, or PPM, the output is the little
endian variation on that for&acirc; <br>
mat, and vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The X Window System viewer xv
expects the little endian variation of PGM and PPM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Programs that come with the
Independent Jpeg Group&rsquo;s JPEG library are known to use
the little endian variation of PGM and PPM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reason some programs use
this variant is that at one time during Netpbm&rsquo;s
darkage(1) , there was a version of Netpbm around that used
it. But it was never formally speci&acirc; <br>
fied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program takes input only on
Standard Input. Its output is always on Standard Output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should never have to use
this program with images generated by programs in the Netpbm
package or programs that use the Netpbm libraries. If you
do, that probably means some&acirc; <br>
thing needs to be fixed in those programs. The Netpbm
converter for any graphics format that represents numbers in
little endian form should properly reverse the bytes to
create <br>
correct Netpbm output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you create a Netpbm image
from a generic stream of samples, using rawtopgm or
rawtoppm, use options on those programs to declare the
endianness of your input, thus creating <br>
correct endianness in your PGM or PPM output.</p>
