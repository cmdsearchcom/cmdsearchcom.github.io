This program is part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)
<div class="Pp"></div>
All Netpbm formats that have samples in pure binary format with multiple bytes
  are defined to have them in big endian (most significant byte first) order.
  However, there exist variations on these formats, primarily developed before
  official multibyte Netpbm formats existed, that are identical to Netpbm
  formats in every respect except that samples are in little endian (least
  significant byte first) order.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pamendian</b> reverses the byte order of the sample to convert between the
  two formats. If the input is true PAM, PGM, or PPM, the output is the little
  endian variation on that format, and vice versa.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The X Window System viewer <b>xv</b> expects the little endian variation of PGM
  and PPM.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Programs that come with the Independent Jpeg Group's JPEG library are known to
  use the little endian variation of PGM and PPM.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The reason some programs use this variant is that at one time during Netpbm's
  <b>dark</b>age<b>(1)</b> , there was a version of Netpbm around that used it.
  But it was never formally specified.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This program takes input only on Standard Input. Its output is always on
  Standard Output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You should never have to use this program with images generated by programs in
  the Netpbm package or programs that use the Netpbm libraries. If you do, that
  probably means something needs to be fixed in those programs. The Netpbm
  converter for any graphics format that represents numbers in little endian
  form should properly reverse the bytes to create correct Netpbm output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you create a Netpbm image from a generic stream of samples, using
  <b>rawtopgm</b> or <b>rawtoppm</b>, use options on those programs to declare
  the endianness of your input, thus creating correct endianness in your PGM or
  PPM output.
