<p>MAKE(1) LOCAL USER COMMANDS MAKE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
make - GNU make utility to maintain groups of programs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
make [ -f makefile ] [ options ] ... [ targets ] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
This man page is an extract of the documentation of GNU
make. It is updated only occasionally, because the GNU
project does not use nroff. For complete, current
documentation, <br>
refer to the Info file make.info which is made from the
Texinfo source file make.texi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The purpose of the make utility is to determine
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be
recompiled, and issue the commands to recompile them. The
manual <br>
describes the GNU implementation of make, which was written
by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath, and is currently
maintained by Paul Smith. Our examples show C programs, <br>
since they are most common, but you can use make with any
programming language whose compiler can be run with a shell
command. In fact, make is not limited to programs. You can
<br>
use it to describe any task where some files must be updated
automatically from others whenever the others change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To prepare to use make, you must
write a file called the makefile that describes the
relationships among files in your program, and the states
the commands for updating each <br>
file. In a program, typically the executable file is updated
from object files, which are in turn made by compiling
source files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once a suitable makefile exists,
each time you change some source files, this simple shell
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">make</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">suffices to perform all
necessary recompilations. The make program uses the makefile
data base and the last-modification times of the files to
decide which of the files need to <br>
be updated. For each of those files, it issues the commands
recorded in the data base.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">make executes commands in the
makefile to update one or more target names, where name is
typically a program. If no -f option is present, make will
look for the makefiles GNU&acirc; <br>
makefile, makefile, and Makefile, in that order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally you should call your
makefile either makefile or Makefile. (We recommend Makefile
because it appears prominently near the beginning of a
directory listing, right near <br>
other important files such as README.) The first name
checked, GNUmakefile, is not recommended for most makefiles.
You should use this name if you have a makefile that is
spe&acirc; <br>
cific to GNU make, and will not be understood by other
versions of make. If makefile is &lsquo;-&rsquo;, the
standard input is read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">make updates a target if it
depends on prerequisite files that have been modified since
the target was last modified, or if the target does not
exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b, -m <br>
These options are ignored for compatibility with other
versions of make.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --always-make <br>
Unconditionally make all targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C dir, --directory=dir <br>
Change to directory dir before reading the makefiles or
doing anything else. If multiple -C options are specified,
each is interpreted relative to the previous one: -C / -C
<br>
etc is equivalent to -C /etc. This is typically used with
recursive invocations of make.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Print debugging information
in addition to normal processing. The debugging information
says which files are being considered for remaking, which
file-times are being com&acirc; <br>
pared and with what results, which files actually need to be
remade, which implicit rules are considered and which are
applied---everything interesting about how make <br>
decides what to do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug[=FLAGS] <br>
Print debugging information in addition to normal
processing. If the FLAGS are omitted, then the behavior is
the same as if -d was specified. FLAGS may be a for all
debug&acirc; <br>
ging output (same as using -d), b for basic debugging, v for
more verbose basic debugging, i for showing implicit rules,
j for details on invocation of commands, and m for <br>
debugging while remaking makefiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --environment-overrides <br>
Give variables taken from the environment precedence over
variables from makefiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f file, --file=file,
--makefile=FILE <br>
Use file as a makefile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --ignore-errors <br>
Ignore all errors in commands executed to remake files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I dir, --include-dir=dir <br>
Specifies a directory dir to search for included makefiles.
If several -I options are used to specify several
directories, the directories are searched in the order
speci&acirc; <br>
fied. Unlike the arguments to other flags of make,
directories given with -I flags may come directly after the
flag: -Idir is allowed, as well as -I dir. This syntax is
<br>
allowed for compatibility with the C preprocessor&rsquo;s -I
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j [jobs], --jobs[=jobs] <br>
Specifies the number of jobs (commands) to run
simultaneously. If there is more than one -j option, the
last one is effective. If the -j option is given without an
argu&acirc; <br>
ment, make will not limit the number of jobs that can run
simultaneously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --keep-going <br>
Continue as much as possible after an error. While the
target that failed, and those that depend on it, cannot be
remade, the other dependencies of these targets can be <br>
processed all the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l [load], --load-average[=load]
<br>
Specifies that no new jobs (commands) should be started if
there are others jobs running and the load average is at
least load (a floating-point number). With no argument, <br>
removes a previous load limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --check-symlink-times <br>
Use the latest mtime between symlinks and target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --just-print, --dry-run,
--recon <br>
Print the commands that would be executed, but do not
execute them (except in certain circumstances).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o file, --old-file=file,
--assume-old=file <br>
Do not remake the file file even if it is older than its
dependencies, and do not remake anything on account of
changes in file. Essentially the file is treated as very old
<br>
and its rules are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --print-data-base <br>
Print the data base (rules and variable values) that results
from reading the makefiles; then execute as usual or as
otherwise specified. This also prints the version <br>
information given by the -v switch (see below). To print the
data base without trying to remake any files, use make -p
-f/dev/null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --question <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;Question mode&rsquo;&rsquo;. Do not run any
commands, or print anything; just return an exit status that
is zero if the specified targets are already up to date,
nonzero otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --no-builtin-rules <br>
Eliminate use of the built-in implicit rules. Also clear out
the default list of suffixes for suffix rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --no-builtin-variables <br>
Don&rsquo;t define any built-in variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --silent, --quiet <br>
Silent operation; do not print the commands as they are
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --no-keep-going, --stop <br>
Cancel the effect of the -k option. This is never necessary
except in a recursive make where -k might be inherited from
the top-level make via MAKEFLAGS or if you set -k in <br>
MAKEFLAGS in your environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --touch <br>
Touch files (mark them up to date without really changing
them) instead of running their commands. This is used to
pretend that the commands were done, in order to fool <br>
future invocations of make.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Print the version of the make program plus a copyright, a
list of authors and a notice that there is no warranty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --print-directory <br>
Print a message containing the working directory before and
after other processing. This may be useful for tracking down
errors from complicated nests of recursive make <br>
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-print-directory <br>
Turn off -w, even if it was turned on implicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W file, --what-if=file,
--new-file=file, --assume-new=file <br>
Pretend that the target file has just been modified. When
used with the -n flag, this shows you what would happen if
you were to modify that file. Without -n, it is almost <br>
the same as running a touch command on the given file before
running make, except that the modification time is changed
only in the imagination of make.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--warn-undefined-variables <br>
Warn when an undefined variable is referenced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
GNU make exits with a status of zero if all makefiles were
successfully parsed and no targets that were built failed. A
status of one will be returned if the -q flag was used <br>
and make determines that a target needs to be rebuilt. A
status of two will be returned if any errors were
encountered.</p>
