<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
vbindiff - hexadecimal file display and comparison</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
vbindiff file1 [ file2 ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Visual Binary Diff (VBinDiff) displays files in hexadecimal
and ASCII (or EBCDIC). It can also display two files at
once, and highlight the differences between them. Unlike
<br>
diff, it works well with large files (up to 4 GB).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Viewing files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Movement Keys <br>
------------- <br>
Up Move one line (16 bytes) towards the beginning of the
file <br>
Down Move one line (16 bytes) towards the end of the file
<br>
Left Move one byte towards the beginning of the file <br>
Right Move one byte towards the end of the file <br>
PageUp Move one page towards the beginning of the file <br>
PageDn Move one page towards the end of the file <br>
Home Move to the beginning of the file <br>
End Move to the end of the (shorter) file <br>
F Search for a string or byte sequence <br>
G Move to a specified file position</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When displaying two files, both
files move together. If bytes have been added or removed in
one of the files, you can adjust the comparison by moving
just one of the files. To <br>
move only the top file, press &quot;T&quot;. To move only
the bottom file, press &quot;B&quot;. To return to moving
both files, press the same key again. (The window at the
bottom of the screen <br>
will indicate when you are moving only one file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other Keys <br>
---------- <br>
Enter Move to the next difference between the files <br>
Space (same as Enter) <br>
C Toggle between ASCII and EBCDIC display <br>
E Edit currently displayed section of file <br>
Esc Exit VBinDiff <br>
Q Exit VBinDiff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Enter&quot; key will
advance to the next difference between the files (after
those already displayed on the screen). If there are no more
differences, it moves to the end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Line editor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The line editor is used to enter
search strings and file positions. It uses the basic
Emacs-style editing keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keys <br>
----------------- <br>
Ctrl-B, Left Move the cursor one character left <br>
Ctrl-F, Right Move the cursor one character right <br>
Ctrl-A, Home Move to the beginning of the line <br>
Ctrl-E, End Move to the end of the line <br>
Ctrl-P, Up Move up in input history <br>
Ctrl-N, Down Move down in input history <br>
Ctrl-H, Backspace Delete the character to the left <br>
Ctrl-D, Delete Delete the character under the cursor <br>
Ctrl-K Delete from cursor to end of line <br>
Insert Toggle between insert &amp; overstrike mode <br>
Enter Finished entering text <br>
Esc Abort the operation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Editing files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can press &quot;E&quot; to
edit the current file. When displaying two files, this edits
the one in the top window, unless you are in &quot;move
bottom&quot; mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When editing, you can move the
cursor around with the arrow keys. Use TAB to switch between
entering hexadecimal or ASCII (or EBCDIC) characters. Press
the Esc key when you are <br>
done. You will be given the choice to save or discard your
changes then.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are displaying two files,
you can use the Enter key to copy a byte from the other file
into the one you are editing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You cannot scroll through the
file while editing, although you can save your changes and
then move to a different part of the file. Also, you cannot
insert or delete bytes, only <br>
change them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-L, --license Display license information for vbindiff <br>
-V, --version Display the version number <br>
--help Display help information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Does not work properly with files over 4 gigabytes. It
should be able to view the first 4 gigabytes ok, but the
display only has room for 8 hex digits of file position, and
the <br>
Goto box is also limited to 8 digits.</p>
