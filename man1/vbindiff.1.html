vbindiff - hexadecimal file display and comparison

Visual Binary Diff (VBinDiff) displays files in hexadecimal and ASCII (or
  EBCDIC). It can also display two files at once, and highlight the differences
  between them. Unlike <b>diff</b>, it works well with large files (up to 4 GB).

<b>Viewing files</b>

 Movement Keys
 -------------
 Up      Move one line (16 bytes) towards the beginning of the file
 Down    Move one line (16 bytes) towards the end of the file
 Left    Move one byte towards the beginning of the file
 Right   Move one byte towards the end of the file
 PageUp  Move one page towards the beginning of the file
 PageDn  Move one page towards the end of the file
 Home    Move to the beginning of the file
 End     Move to the end of the (shorter) file
 F       Search for a string or byte sequence
 G       Move to a specified file position
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When displaying two files, both files move together. If bytes have been added or
  removed in one of the files, you can adjust the comparison by moving just one
  of the files. To move only the top file, press &quot;T&quot;. To move only the
  bottom file, press &quot;B&quot;. To return to moving both files, press the
  same key again. (The window at the bottom of the screen will indicate when you
  are moving only one file.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 Other Keys
 ----------
 Enter  Move to the next difference between the files
 Space  (same as Enter)
 C      Toggle between ASCII and EBCDIC display
 E      Edit currently displayed section of file
 Esc    Exit VBinDiff
 Q      Exit VBinDiff
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;Enter&quot; key will advance to the next difference between the files
  (after those already displayed on the screen). If there are no more
  differences, it moves to the end.

<b>Line editor</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The line editor is used to enter search strings and file positions. It uses the
  basic Emacs-style editing keys.

<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Editing files</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can press &quot;E&quot; to edit the current file. When displaying two files,
  this edits the one in the top window, unless you are in &quot;move
  bottom&quot; mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When editing, you can move the cursor around with the arrow keys. Use TAB to
  switch between entering hexadecimal or ASCII (or EBCDIC) characters. Press the
  Esc key when you are done. You will be given the choice to save or discard
  your changes then.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are displaying two files, you can use the Enter key to copy a byte from
  the other file into the one you are editing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You cannot scroll through the file while editing, although you can save your
  changes and then move to a different part of the file. Also, you cannot insert
  or delete bytes, only change them.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Does not work properly with files over 4 gigabytes. It should be able to view
  the first 4 gigabytes ok, but the display only has room for 8 hex digits of
  file position, and the Goto box is also limited to 8 digits.
