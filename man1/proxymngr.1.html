The proxy manager (proxymngr) is responsible for resolving requests from
  xfindproxy (and other similar clients), starting new proxies when appropriate,
  and keeping track of all of the available proxy services. The proxy manager
  strives to reuse existing proxies whenever possible.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are two types of proxies that the proxy manager deals with, <i>managed</i>
  and <i>unmanaged</i> proxies.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A <i>managed</i> proxy is a proxy that is started ``on demand'' by the proxy
  manager.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An <i>unmanaged</i> proxy, on the other hand, is started either at system boot
  time, or manually by a system administrator. The proxy manager is made aware
  of its existence, but no attempt is made by the proxy manager to start
  unmanaged proxies.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The command line options that can be specified to <b>proxymngr</b> are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-config</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Used to override the default proxymngr config file. See
      below for more details about the config file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-timeout</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Sets the number of seconds between attempts made by the
      proxy manager to find an unmanaged proxy. The default is 10.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-retries</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Sets the maximum number of retries made by the proxy
      manager to find an an unmanaged proxy. The default is 3.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-verbose</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Causes various debugging and tracing records to be
      displayed as requests are received and proxies are started.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Proxy_Manager_Config_File"><a class="selflink" href="#Proxy_Manager_Config_File">Proxy
  Manager Config File</a></h1>
The proxy manager maintains a local configuration file describing the proxy
  services available. This configuration file is installed in
  <i>/usr/lib/X11/proxymngr/pmconfig</i> during the installation of proxymngr.
  The location of the configuration file can be overwritten using the
  <b>-config</b> command line option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Aside from lines starting with an exclamation point for comments, each line of
  the configuration file describes either an unmanaged or managed proxy service.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For unmanaged proxies, the format is:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&lt;service-name&gt; unmanaged &lt;proxy-address&gt;</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
service-name is the name of the unmanaged proxy service, and must not contain
  any spaces, for example ``XFWP''. service-name is case insensitive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
proxy-address is the network address of the unmanaged proxy. The format of the
  address is specific to the service-name. For example, for the ``XFWP''
  service, the proxy-address might be ``firewall.x.org:100''.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If there is more than one entry in the config file with the same unmanaged
  service-name, the proxy manager will try to use the proxies in the order
  presented in the config file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For managed proxies, the format is:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&lt;service-name&gt; managed
    &lt;command-to-start-proxy&gt;</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
service-name is the name of the managed proxy service, and must not contain any
  spaces, for example ``LBX''. service-name is case insensitive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
command-to-start-proxy is the command executed by the proxy manager to start a
  new instance of the proxy. If command-to-start-proxy contains spaces, the
  complete command should be surrounded by single quotes. If desired,
  command-to-start-proxy can be used to start a proxy on a remote machine. The
  specifics of the remote execution method used to do this is not specified
  here.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLE"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLE">EXAMPLE</a></h1>
Here is a sample configuration file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
</pre>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
! proxy manager config file
!
! Each line has the format:
!    &lt;serviceName&gt; managed &lt;startCommand&gt;
!        or
!    &lt;serviceName&gt; unmanaged &lt;proxyAddress&gt;
!
lbx managed /usr/bin/lbxproxy
!
! substitute site-specific info
xfwp unmanaged firewall:4444
</pre>
</div>
<br/>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PROXY_MANAGER_DETAILS"><a class="selflink" href="#PROXY_MANAGER_DETAILS">PROXY
  MANAGER DETAILS</a></h1>
When the proxy manager gets a request from xfindproxy (or another similar
  client), its course of action will depend on the service-name in question.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For a managed proxy service, the proxy manager will find out if any of the
  already running proxies for this service can handle a new request. If not, the
  proxy manager will attempt to start up a new instance of the proxy (using the
  command-to-start-proxy found in the config file). If that fails, an error will
  be returned to the caller.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For an unmanaged proxy service, the proxy manager will look in the config file
  to find all unmanaged proxies for this service. If there is more than one
  entry in the config file with the same unmanaged service-name, the proxy
  manager will try to use the proxies in the order presented in the config file.
  If none of the unmanaged proxies can satisfy the request, the proxy manager
  will timeout for a configurable amount of time (specified by <b>-timeout</b>
  or default of 10) and reattempt to find an unmanaged proxy willing to satisfy
  the request. The number of retries can be specified by the <b>-retries</b>
  argument, or a default of 3 will be used. If the retries fail, the proxy
  manager has no choice but to return an error to the caller (since the proxy
  manager can not start unmanaged proxy services).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
proxy manager listen port should be configurable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-timeout</b> and <b>-retries</b> is not implemented in proxymngr.
<div class="Pp"></div>
proxymngr does not utilize the ``options'' and ``host'' fields in the proxy
  management protocol GetProxyAddr request.
