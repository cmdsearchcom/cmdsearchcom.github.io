<p>PROXYMNGR(1) General Commands Manual PROXYMNGR(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
proxymngr - proxy manager service</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
proxymngr [-config filename] [-timeout seconds] [-retries #]
[-verbose]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The proxy manager (proxymngr) is responsible for resolving
requests from xfindproxy (and other similar clients),
starting new proxies when appropriate, and keeping track of
all <br>
of the available proxy services. The proxy manager strives
to reuse existing proxies whenever possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two types of proxies
that the proxy manager deals with, managed and unmanaged
proxies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A managed proxy is a proxy that
is started &lsquo;&lsquo;on demand&rsquo;&rsquo; by the
proxy manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An unmanaged proxy, on the other
hand, is started either at system boot time, or manually by
a system administrator. The proxy manager is made aware of
its existence, but no <br>
attempt is made by the proxy manager to start unmanaged
proxies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command line options that
can be specified to proxymngr are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-config Used to override the
default proxymngr config file. See below for more details
about the config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-timeout <br>
Sets the number of seconds between attempts made by the
proxy manager to find an unmanaged proxy. The default is
10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-retries <br>
Sets the maximum number of retries made by the proxy manager
to find an an unmanaged proxy. The default is 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Causes various debugging and tracing records to be displayed
as requests are received and proxies are started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Proxy Manager Config File <br>
The proxy manager maintains a local configuration file
describing the proxy services available. This configuration
file is installed in /usr/lib/X11/proxymngr/pmconfig during
<br>
the installation of proxymngr. The location of the
configuration file can be overwritten using the -config
command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Aside from lines starting with
an exclamation point for comments, each line of the
configuration file describes either an unmanaged or managed
proxy service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For unmanaged proxies, the
format is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;service-name&gt; unmanaged
&lt;proxy-address&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">service-name is the name of the
unmanaged proxy service, and must not contain any spaces,
for example &lsquo;&lsquo;XFWP&rsquo;&rsquo;. service-name
is case insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">proxy-address is the network
address of the unmanaged proxy. The format of the address is
specific to the service-name. For example, for the
&lsquo;&lsquo;XFWP&rsquo;&rsquo; service, the proxy-address
<br>
might be &lsquo;&lsquo;firewall.x.org:100&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is more than one entry
in the config file with the same unmanaged service-name, the
proxy manager will try to use the proxies in the order
presented in the config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For managed proxies, the format
is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;service-name&gt; managed
&lt;command-to-start-proxy&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">service-name is the name of the
managed proxy service, and must not contain any spaces, for
example &lsquo;&lsquo;LBX&rsquo;&rsquo;. service-name is
case insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command-to-start-proxy is the
command executed by the proxy manager to start a new
instance of the proxy. If command-to-start-proxy contains
spaces, the complete command should <br>
be surrounded by single quotes. If desired,
command-to-start-proxy can be used to start a proxy on a
remote machine. The specifics of the remote execution method
used to do <br>
this is not specified here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Here is a sample configuration file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! proxy manager config file <br>
! <br>
! Each line has the format: <br>
! &lt;serviceName&gt; managed &lt;startCommand&gt; <br>
! or <br>
! &lt;serviceName&gt; unmanaged &lt;proxyAddress&gt; <br>
! <br>
lbx managed /usr/bin/lbxproxy <br>
! <br>
! substitute site-specific info <br>
xfwp unmanaged firewall:4444</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROXY MANAGER DETAILS <br>
When the proxy manager gets a request from xfindproxy (or
another similar client), its course of action will depend on
the service-name in question.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a managed proxy service, the
proxy manager will find out if any of the already running
proxies for this service can handle a new request. If not,
the proxy manager will <br>
attempt to start up a new instance of the proxy (using the
command-to-start-proxy found in the config file). If that
fails, an error will be returned to the caller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For an unmanaged proxy service,
the proxy manager will look in the config file to find all
unmanaged proxies for this service. If there is more than
one entry in the config file <br>
with the same unmanaged service-name, the proxy manager will
try to use the proxies in the order presented in the config
file. If none of the unmanaged proxies can satisfy the <br>
request, the proxy manager will timeout for a configurable
amount of time (specified by -timeout or default of 10) and
reattempt to find an unmanaged proxy willing to satisfy the
<br>
request. The number of retries can be specified by the
-retries argument, or a default of 3 will be used. If the
retries fail, the proxy manager has no choice but to return
an <br>
error to the caller (since the proxy manager can not start
unmanaged proxy services).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
proxy manager listen port should be configurable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-timeout and -retries is not
implemented in proxymngr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">proxymngr does not utilize the
&lsquo;&lsquo;options&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;host&rsquo;&rsquo; fields in the proxy
management protocol GetProxyAddr request.</p>
