<p>HH_CLIENT(1) General Commands Manual HH_CLIENT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hh_client - Interface to Hack language typechecker</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
hh_client [MODE] [OPTIONS] [DIRECTORY]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
hh_client(1) is an interface to a static analysis tool which
is what enforces most of the Hack language&rsquo;s type
system. Code must pass validation of this tool in order to
be con&acirc; <br>
sidered valid code in the Hack language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several possible MODEs
for hh_client(1) (see below). By default, it will invoke the
check mode, with the current directory as DIRECTORY. These
are reasonable defaults, <br>
meaning that most users can simply invoke the command as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hh_client</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">with no arguments to get a list
of type errors across the entire project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of the MODEs accept a
DIRECTORY as an optional final argument. This denotes the
project upon which to operate. hh_client(1) walks up the
filesystem from the DIRECTORY until <br>
it finds a file called .hhconfig and then operates on the
body of Hack language code rooted in this directory. If no
DIRECTORY is specified, it uses the current directory by
<br>
default. This means you may run hh_client(1) in any
subdirectory of your project and get type errors for the
whole project without ever specifying a DIRECTORY
explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hh_client(1) implements very
little logic itself, but rather serves as an interface to
the hh_server(1) daemon. The server will automatically be
started and restarted as needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODES <br>
check <br>
The default MODE if none is specified. With no OPTIONS
specified, it prints a list of type errors on standard
output, or prints &quot;No errors!&quot; if there were
none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many OPTIONS affect the output
of check mode, sometimes causing it to do completely
different things. (Those can be considered
&quot;sub-modes&quot; of check mode.) Many of these options
<br>
are undergoing considerable revision and so are not
documented here; read the source for a full list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Widely-useful OPTIONS for check
mode include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--color FILE <br>
Sub-mode which prints out information on what parts of FILE
are actually typechecked and which are not. Due to
Hack&rsquo;s partial mode and PHP interoperability, the type
sys&acirc; <br>
tem may not know the types of parts of a program. In this
case, it trusts the programmer and carries on. The --color
mode prints out a file with ANSI terminal colors, <br>
where green code is actually fully checked, and red code
cannot be fully checked due to such missing type
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Prints information about
hh_client(1) and its command line options, and then exits.
Many of the options described there are experimental,
especially if they are not <br>
described in this man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--from EDITOR <br>
Prints output in the format expected by a specific editor.
Valid values of EDITOR are emacs and vim. For usage by other
tools, try --json instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--json Prints output in a JSON
format intended for machine consumption, instead of the
output intended for human consumption that is output by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--retries NUM <br>
If the typechecker daemon is busy, try NUM times to connect
to it before giving up. Set NUM to 0 to disable retries if
the server is not immediately available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--status <br>
Prints human-readable type error information to standard out
and then exits. The default sub-mode of check if none is
specified. This output is not intended for usage by <br>
tools, but only for human consumption. For output intended
for tool usage, see the --json and/or --from options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Prints the current client version, including build ID and
build date, and then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--auto-complete <br>
Autocompletes text on STDIN where the cursor is replaced
with AUTO332. Returns a newline-separated list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--search STRING <br>
Fuzzy search symbol definitions for STRING. Returns a
newline-separated list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start <br>
Explicitly starts the hh_server(1) daemon if it is not
already running. This is not normally necessary, since check
mode will start it as needed if it is not running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop <br>
Explicitly stops the hh_server(1) daemon if it is running.
This is not normally necessary, since the daemon will exit
if it has not been used for an extended period of time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restart <br>
Explicitly stops and then starts again the hh_server(1)
daemon. Fails if the daemon is not currently running.
Restarting the daemon is not normally necessary, since it
updates <br>
its state in the background, and hh_client(1) will restart
it automatically if the typechecker binaries have been
updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
For check mode in the --status sub-mode, hh_client(1)
returns 0 if there are no type errors, and non-zero
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exit statuses for any other
invocations are currently undefined and subject to
change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
USER Used in combination with the path to the project root
in order to locate the socket for communicating with the
running hh_server(1) daemon. Normally set by your login <br>
environment, but may be unset in some nonstandard
setups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
.hhconfig <br>
When determining where the project root is in order to
figure out what files to actually typecheck, hh_client(1)
walks up the directory tree from the specified DIRECTORY
<br>
until it finds this file. The set of files recursively
included in the directory with the .hhconfig file is the set
of files typechecked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/tmp/hh_server_$USER/ <br>
The client looks inside this directory for sockets to
communicate with the hh_server(1) daemon. The sockets are
named based on a hash of the absolute path of the project
<br>
root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The Hack language is part of the HHVM project. Known bugs
can be found at that tracker, and new ones should be
reported there as well:
