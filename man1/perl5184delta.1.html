<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5184delta - what is new for perl v5.18.4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.18.4
release and the 5.18.2 release. Please note: This document
ignores perl 5.18.3, a broken release which existed for a
few <br>
hours only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.18.1, first read perl5182delta,
which describes differences between 5.18.1 and 5.18.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
Updated Modules and Pragmata <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Digest::SHA has been upgraded from 5.84_01
to 5.84_02.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; perl5db.pl has
been upgraded from version 1.39_10 to 1.39_11.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This fixes a crash in tab
completion, where available. [perl #120827] Also, filehandle
information is properly reset after a pager is run. [perl
#121456]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Support <br>
Platform-Specific Notes <br>
Win32 <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Introduced by perl #113536
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=113536&gt;,
a memory leak on every call to &quot;system&quot; and
backticks (&quot; &lsquo;&lsquo; &quot;), on most Win32
Perls <br>
starting from 5.18.0 has been fixed. The memory leak only
occurred if you enabled psuedo-fork in your build of Win32
Perl, and were running that build on Server 2003 R2 <br>
or newer OS. The leak does not appear on WinXP SP3. [perl
#121676
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=121676&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; The debugger now properly resets filehandles
as needed. [perl #121456]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A segfault in
Digest::SHA has been addressed. [perl #121421]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; perl can again
be built with USE_64_BIT_INT, with Visual C 2003, 32 bit.
[perl #120925]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A leading {
(brace) in formats is properly parsed again. [perl
#119973]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Copy the values
used to perturb hash iteration when cloning an interpreter.
This was fairly harmless but caused &quot;valgrind&quot; to
complain. [perl #121336]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In Perl v5.18
&quot;undef *_; goto &amp;sub&quot; and &quot;local *_; goto
&amp;sub&quot; started crashing. This has been fixed. [perl
#119949]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acknowledgements <br>
Perl 5.18.4 represents approximately 9 months of development
since Perl 5.18.2 and contains approximately 2,000 lines of
changes across 53 files from 13 authors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl continues to flourish into
its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and
developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that <br>
became Perl 5.18.4:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Daniel Dragan, David Mitchell,
Doug Bell, Father Chrysostomos, Hiroo Hayashi, James E
Keenan, Karl Williamson, Mark Shelor, Ricardo Signes, Shlomi
Fish, Smylers, Steve Hay, Tony <br>
Cook.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list above is almost
certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from
version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much <br>
appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl
bug tracker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the changes included in
this version originated in the CPAN modules included in
Perl&rsquo;s core. We&rsquo;re grateful to the entire CPAN
community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a more complete list of all
of Perl&rsquo;s historical contributors, please see the
AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . <br>
There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the
Perl Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the bug you are reporting has
security implications, which make it inappropriate to send
to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to
<br>
perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the
core committers, who will be able to help assess the impact
<br>
of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the
release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use <br>
this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for
modules independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
