<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mwm &acirc; The Motif Window Manager</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mwm [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The mwm window manager provides functions that facilitate
control (by the user and the programmer) of elements of
window state such as placement, size, icon/normal display,
and <br>
input-focus ownership.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The stand-alone window manager
is not an integral part of CDE and does not support
communication with other components in the CDE environment,
such as the Style Manager and the <br>
Session Manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
-display display <br>
This option specifies the display to use; see X(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xrm resourcestring <br>
This option specifies a resource string to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-multiscreen <br>
This option causes mwm to manage all screens on the display.
The default is to manage only a single screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-name name <br>
This option causes mwm to retrieve its resources using the
specified name, as in name*resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-screens name [name [...]] <br>
This option specifies the resource names to use for the
screens managed by mwm. If mwm is managing a single screen,
only the first name in the list is used. If mwm is <br>
managing multiple screens, the names are assigned to the
screens in order, starting with screen 0. Screen 0 gets the
first name, screen 1 the second name, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Appearance <br>
The following sections describe the basic default behaviors
of windows, icons, the icon box, input focus, and window
stacking. The appearance and behavior of the window manager
<br>
can be altered by changing the configuration of specific
resources. Resources are defined under the heading &quot;X
DEFAULTS.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Screens <br>
By default, mwm manages only the single screen specified by
the -display option or the DISPLAY environment variable (by
default, screen 0). If the -multiscreen option is
speci&acirc; <br>
fied or if the multiScreen resource is True, mwm tries to
manage all the screens on the display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When mwm is managing multiple
screens, the -screens option can be used to give each screen
a unique resource name. The names are separated by blanks,
for example, -screens scr0 <br>
scr1. If there are more screens than names, resources for
the remaining screens will be retrieved using the first
name. By default, the screen number is used for the screen
<br>
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windows <br>
Default mwm window frames have distinct components with
associated functions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Title Area <br>
In addition to displaying the client&rsquo;s title, the
title area is used to move the window. To move the window,
place the pointer over the title area, press button 1 and
<br>
drag the window to a new location. By default, a wire frame
is moved during the drag to indicate the new location. When
the button is released, the window is moved to <br>
the new location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Title Bar The title bar includes
the title area, the minimize button, the maximize button,
and the window menu button. In shaped windows, such as round
windows, the title bar <br>
floats above the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimize Button <br>
To turn the window into an icon, click button 1 on the
minimize button (the frame box with a small square in
it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Maximize Button <br>
To make the window fill the screen (or enlarge to the
largest size allowed by the configuration files), click
button 1 on the maximize button (the frame box with a <br>
large square in it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Window Menu Button <br>
The window menu button is the frame box with a horizontal
bar in it. To pull down the window menu, press button 1.
While pressing, drag the pointer on the menu to your <br>
selection, then release the button when your selection is
highlighted. Pressing button 3 in the title bar or resize
border handles also posts the window menu. Alter&acirc; <br>
nately, you can click button 1 to pull down the menu and
keep it posted; then position the pointer and select. You
can also post the window menu by pressing &lt;Shift&gt; <br>
&lt;Esc&gt; or &lt;Alt&gt; &lt;Space&gt;. Double-clicking
button 1 with the pointer on the window menu button closes
the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following table lists the
contents of the window menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default Window Menu <br>
Selection Accelerator Description <br>
Restore Restores the window to its size <br>
before minimizing or maximizing. <br>
Move Allows the window to be moved <br>
with keys or mouse. <br>
Size Allows the window to be resized. <br>
Minimize Turns the window into an icon. <br>
Maximize Makes the window fill the screen. <br>
Lower Moves window to bottom of window <br>
stack. <br>
Close Alt+F4 Causes client to terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resize Border Handles <br>
To change the size of a window, move the pointer over a
resize border handle (the cursor changes), press button 1,
and drag the window to a new size. When the button is <br>
released, the window is resized. While dragging is being
done, a rubber-band outline is displayed to indicate the new
window size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Matte An optional matte
decoration can be added between the client area and the
window frame (see the matteWidth resource). A matte is not
actually part of the window frame. <br>
There is no functionality associated with a matte.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Icons <br>
Icons are small graphic representations of windows. A window
can be minimized (iconified) using the minimize button on
the window frame. Icons provide a way to reduce clutter on
<br>
the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pressing mouse button 1 when the
pointer is over an icon causes the icon&rsquo;s window menu
to pop up. Releasing the button (press + release without
moving mouse = click) causes the <br>
menu to stay posted. The menu contains the following
selections:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Icon Window Menu <br>
Selection Accelerator Description <br>
Restore Opens the associated window. <br>
Move Allows the icon to be moved with <br>
keys. <br>
Size Inactive (not an option for icons). <br>
Minimize Inactive (not an option for icons). <br>
Maximize Opens the associated window and <br>
makes it fill the screen. <br>
Lower Moves icon to bottom of icon stack. <br>
Close Alt+F4 Removes client from mwm management.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that pressing button 3 over
an icon also causes the icon&rsquo;s window menu to pop up.
To make a menu selection, drag the pointer over the menu and
release button 3 when the <br>
desired item is highlighted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Double-clicking button 1 on an
icon invokes the f.restore_and_raise function and restores
the icon&rsquo;s associated window to its previous state.
For example, if a maximized window <br>
is iconified, double-clicking button 1 restores it to its
maximized state. Double-clicking button 1 on the icon
box&rsquo;s icon opens the icon box and allows access to the
contained <br>
icons. (In general, double-clicking a mouse button is a
quick way to perform a function.) Pressing &lt;Shift&gt;
&lt;Esc&gt; or &lt;Menu&gt; (the pop-up menu key) causes the
icon window menu of <br>
the currently selected icon to pop up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Icon Box <br>
When icons begin to clutter the screen, they can be packed
into an icon box. (To use an icon box, mwm must be started
with the icon box configuration already set.) The icon box
<br>
is a mwm window that holds client icons. It includes one or
more scroll bars when there are more window icons than the
icon box can show at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Icons in the icon box can be
manipulated with the mouse. The following table summarizes
the behavior of this interface. Button actions apply
whenever the pointer is on any part <br>
of the icon. Note that double-clicking an icon in the icon
box invokes the f.restore_and_raise function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Button Action Description <br>
Button 1 click Selects the icon. <br>
Button 1 double-click Normalizes (opens) the associated <br>
window. Raises an already open win&acirc; <br>
dow to the top of the stack. <br>
Button 1 drag Moves the icon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Button 3 press Causes the menu
for that icon to pop <br>
up. <br>
Button 3 drag Highlights items as the pointer <br>
moves across the menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pressing mouse button 3 when the
pointer is over an icon causes the menu for that icon to pop
up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Icon Menu for the Icon Box <br>
Selection Accelerator Description <br>
Restore Opens the associated window (if not <br>
already open). <br>
Move Allows the icon to be moved with <br>
keys. <br>
Size Inactive. <br>
Minimize Inactive. <br>
Maximize Opens the associated window (if not <br>
already open) and maximizes its <br>
size. <br>
Lower Inactive. <br>
Close Alt+F4 Removes client from mwm management.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To pull down the window menu for
the icon box itself, press button 1 with the pointer over
the menu button for the icon box. The window menu of the
icon box differs from the win&acirc; <br>
dow menu of a client window: The &quot;Close&quot; selection
is replaced with the &quot;PackIcons Shift+Alt+F7&quot;
selection. When selected, PackIcons packs the icons in the
box to achieve neat <br>
rows with no empty slots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also post the window
menu by pressing &lt;Shift&gt;, &lt;Esc&gt; or &lt;Alt&gt;
&lt;Space&gt;. Pressing &lt;Menu&gt; (the pop-up menu key)
causes the icon window menu of the currently selected icon
to <br>
pop up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input Focus <br>
The mwm window manager supports (by default) a keyboard
input focus policy of explicit selection. This means when a
window is selected to get keyboard input, it continues to
get <br>
keyboard input until the window is withdrawn from window
management, another window is explicitly selected to get
keyboard input, or the window is iconified. Several
resources <br>
control the input focus. The client window with the keyboard
input focus has the active window appearance with a visually
distinct window frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following tables summarize
the keyboard input focus selection behavior:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Button Action Object Function
Description <br>
Button 1 press Window / window frame Keyboard focus
selection. <br>
Button 1 press Icon Keyboard focus selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key Action Function Description
<br>
[Alt][Tab] Move input focus to next window in window <br>
stack (available only in explicit focus <br>
mode). <br>
[Alt][Shift][Tab] Move input focus to previous window in
<br>
window stack (available only in explicit <br>
focus mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Window Stacking <br>
There are two types of window stacks: global window stacks
and an application&rsquo;s local family window stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The global stacking order of
windows may be changed as a result of setting the keyboard
input focus, iconifying a window, or performing a window
manager window stacking function. <br>
When keyboard focus policy is explicit the default value of
the focusAutoRaise resource is True. This causes a window to
be raised to the top of the stack when it receives input
<br>
focus, for example, by pressing button 1 on the title bar.
The key actions defined in the previous table will thus
raise the window receiving focus to the top of the
stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In pointer mode, the default
value of focusAutoRaise is False, that is, the window
stacking order is not changed when a window receives
keyboard input focus. The following key <br>
actions can be used to cycle through the global window
stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key Action Function Description
<br>
[Alt][ESC] Place top window on bottom of stack. <br>
[Alt][Shift][ESC] Place bottom window on top of stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, a window&rsquo;s
icon is placed on the bottom of the stack when the window is
iconified; however, the default can be changed by the
lowerOnIconify resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transient windows (secondary
windows such a dialog boxes) stay above their parent windows
by default; however, an application&rsquo;s local family
stacking order may be changed to <br>
allow a transient window to be placed below its parent
top-level window. The following arguments show the
modification of the stacking order for the f.lower
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.lower Lowers the transient
window within the family (staying above the parent) and
lowers the family in the global window stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.lower [ within] <br>
Lowers the transient window within the family (staying above
the parent) but does not lower the family in the global
window stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.lower [freeFamily ] <br>
Lowers the window free from its family stack (below the
parent), but does not lower the family in the global window
stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The arguments within and
freeFamily can also be used with f.raise and
f.raise_lower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Session Management <br>
The window manager is an X Session Management Protocol aware
client. It responds to SaveYourself (and other associated
messages) by saving the geometries of its clients to a <br>
state file. mwm can then be restarted by the XSMP session
manager. The default location for the state file is
$HOME/.mwmclientdb. This location can be overriden with the
<br>
resource sessionClientDB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X Resources <br>
The mwm command is configured from its resource database.
This database is built from the following sources. They are
listed in order of precedence, low to high:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/share/X11/app-defaults/Mwm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/Mwm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESOURCE_MANAGER root window
property or $HOME/.Xdefaults</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XENVIRONMENT variable or
$HOME/.Xdefaults-host</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mwm command line options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file names
/usr/share/X11/app-defaults/Mwm and $HOME/Mwm represent
customary locations for these files. The actual location of
the system-wide class resource file may depend <br>
on the XFILESEARCHPATH environment variable and the current
language environment. The actual location of the
user-specific class resource file may depend on the
XUSERFILESEARCH&acirc; <br>
PATH and XAPPLRESDIR environment variables and the current
language environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Entries in the resource database
may refer to other resource files for specific types of
resources. These include files that contain bitmaps, fonts,
and mwm specific resources <br>
such as menus and behavior specifications (for example,
button and key bindings).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mwm is the resource class name
of mwm and mwm is the default resource name used by mwm to
look up resources. the -screens command line option
specifies resource names, such as <br>
&quot;mwm_b+w&quot; and &quot;mwm_color&quot;.) In the
following discussion of resource specification,
&quot;Mwm&quot; and &quot;mwm&quot; (and the aliased mwm
resource names) can be used interchangeably, but
&quot;mwm&quot; <br>
takes precedence over &quot;Mwm&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mwm command uses the
following types of resources:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Component Appearance Resources:
<br>
These resources specify appearance attributes of window
manager user interface components. They can be applied to
the appearance of window manager menus, feedback win&acirc;
<br>
dows (for example, the window reconfiguration feedback
window), client window frames, and icons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General Appearance and Behavior
Resources: <br>
These resources specify mwm appearance and behavior (for
example, window management policies). They are not set
separately for different mwm user interface components. <br>
They apply to all screens and workspaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Screen Specific Appearance and
Behavior Resources: <br>
These resources specify the appearance and behavior of mwm
elements that are settable on a per-screen basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Client Specific Resources: <br>
These mwm resources can be set for a particular client
window or class of client windows. They specify
client-specific icon and client window frame appearance and
<br>
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resource identifiers can be
either a resource name (for example, foreground) or a
resource class (for example, Foreground). If the value of a
resource is a filename and if the <br>
filename is prefixed by &quot;~/&quot;, then it is relative
to the path contained in the HOME environment variable
(generally the user&rsquo;s home directory).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Component Appearance Resources
<br>
The syntax for specifying component appearance resources
that apply to window manager icons, menus, and client window
frames is Mwm* resource_id</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, Mwm*foreground is
used to specify the foreground color for mwm menus, icons,
client window frames, and feedback dialogs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syntax for specifying
component appearance resources that apply to a particular
mwm component is Mwm*[menu|icon|client|feedback]
*resource_id</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If menu is specified, the
resource is applied only to mwm menus; if icon is specified,
the resource is applied to icons; and if client is
specified, the resource is applied to <br>
client window frames. For example, Mwm*icon*foreground is
used to specify the foreground color for mwm icons,
Mwm*menu*foreground specifies the foreground color for mwm
menus, <br>
and Mwm*client*foreground is used to specify the foreground
color for mwm client window frames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The appearance of the title area
of a client window frame (including window management
buttons) can be separately configured. The syntax for
configuring the title area of a <br>
client window frame is Mwm*client*title* resource_id</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example,
Mwm*client*title*foreground specifies the foreground color
for the title area. Defaults for title area resources are
based on the values of the corresponding client <br>
window frame resources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The appearance of menus can be
configured based on the name of the menu. The syntax for
specifying menu appearance by name is Mwm*menu*
menu_name*resource_id</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example,
Mwm*menu*my_menu*foreground specifies the foreground color
for the menu named my_menu. The user can also specify
resources for window manager menu components, that <br>
is, the gadgets that comprise the menu. These may include
for example, a menu title, title separator, one or more
buttons, and separators. If a menu contains more than one
<br>
instance of a class, such as multiple PushButtonGadgets, the
name of the first instance is &quot;PushButtonGadget1&quot;,
the second is &quot;PushButtonGadget2&quot;, and so on. The
following list <br>
identifies the naming convention used for window manager
menu components:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Menu Title
LabelGadget - &quot;TitleName&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Menu Title
SeparatorGadget - &quot;TitleSeparator&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
CascadeButtonGadget -
&quot;CascadeButtonGadget&lt;n&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; PushButtonGadget
- &quot;PushButtonGadget&lt;n&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; SeparatorGadget
- &quot;SeparatorGadget&lt;n&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Refer to the man page for each
class for a list of resources that can be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following component
appearance resources that apply to all window manager parts
can be specified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">saveUnder (class SaveUnder) <br>
This is used to indicate whether &quot;save unders&quot; are
used for mwm components. For this to have any effect, save
unders must be implemented by the X server. If save unders
<br>
are implemented, the X server saves the contents of windows
obscured by windows that have the save under attribute set.
If the saveUnder resource is True, mwm will set <br>
the save under attribute on the window manager frame of any
client that has it set. If saveUnder is False, save unders
will not be used on any window manager frames. <br>
The default value is False.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">topShadowColor (class

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;&nbsp;The resource
doubleClickTime is included for backward compatibility. Use
of the Xt resource multiClickTime is preferred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoKeyFocus (class
AutoKeyFocus) <br>
This resource is available only when the keyboard input
focus policy is explicit. If autoKeyFocus is given a value
of True, then when a window with the keyboard input <br>
focus is withdrawn from window management or is iconified,
the focus is set to the previous window that had the focus.
If the value given is False, there is no auto&acirc; <br>
matic setting of the keyboard input focus. It is recommended
that both autoKeyFocus and startupKeyFocus be True to work
with tear off menus. The default value is True.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoRaiseDelay (class
AutoRaiseDelay) <br>
This resource is available only when the focusAutoRaise
resource is True and the keyboard focus policy is pointer.
The autoRaiseDelay resource specifies the amount of <br>
time (in milliseconds) that mwm will wait before raising a
window after it gets the keyboard focus. The default value
of this resource is 500 (ms).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bitmapDirectory (class
BitmapDirectory) <br>
This resource identifies a directory to be searched for
bitmaps referenced by mwm resources. This directory is
searched if a bitmap is specified without an absolute <br>
pathname. The default value for this resource is
/usr/include/X11/bitmaps. The directory
/usr/include/X11/bitmaps represents the customary locations
for this directory. <br>
The actual location of this directory may vary on some
systems. If the bitmap is not found in the specified
directory, XBMLANGPATH is searched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clientAutoPlace (class
ClientAutoPlace) <br>
This resource determines the position of a window when the
window has not been given a program- or user-specified
position. With a value of True, windows are positioned <br>
with the top left corners of the frames offset horizontally
and vertically. A value of False causes the currently
configured position of the window to be used. In <br>
either case, mwm will attempt to place the windows totally
on-screen. The default value is True.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">colormapFocusPolicy (class
ColormapFocusPolicy) <br>
This resource indicates the colormap focus policy that is to
be used. If the resource value is explicit, a colormap
selection action is done on a client window to set <br>
the colormap focus to that window. If the value is pointer,
the client window containing the pointer has the colormap
focus. If the value is keyboard, the client win&acirc; <br>
dow that has the keyboard input focus has the colormap
focus. The default value for this resource is keyboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">configFile (class ConfigFile)
<br>
The resource value is the pathname for a mwm resource
description file. If the pathname begins with
&quot;~/&quot;, mwm considers it to be relative to the
user&rsquo;s home directory <br>
(as specified by the HOME environment variable). If the LANG
environment variable is set, mwm looks for $HOME/$LANG/
configFile. If that file does not exist or if LANG <br>
is not set, mwm looks for $HOME/configFile. If the
configFile pathname does not begin with &quot;~/&quot; or
&quot;/&quot;, mwm considers it to be relative to the
current working direc&acirc; <br>
tory. If the configFile resource is not specified or if that
file does not exist, mwm uses several default paths to find
a configuration file. The order of the search <br>
is shown below: /etc/X11/mwm/$LANG/system.mwmrc&acirc;&nbsp;
/etc/X11/mwm/system.mwmrc&acirc;&nbsp; Paths marked with
&rsquo;&acirc;&nbsp;&rsquo; are implementation
dependent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deiconifyKeyFocus (class
DeiconifyKeyFocus) <br>
This resource applies only when the keyboard input focus
policy is explicit. If a value of True is used, a window
receives the keyboard input focus when it is normal&acirc;
<br>
ized (deiconified). True is the default value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">doubleClickTime (class
DoubleClickTime) <br>
This resource is used to set the maximum time (in ms)
between the clicks (button presses) that make up a
double-click. The use of this resource is deprecated. Use
the <br>
Xt resource multiClickTime instead. The value of
doubleClickTime dynamically defaults to the value of
multiClickTime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enableWarp (class EnableWarp)
<br>
The default value of this resource, True, causes mwm to warp
the pointer to the center of the selected window during
keyboard-controlled resize and move operations. <br>
Setting the value to False causes mwm to leave the pointer
at its original place on the screen, unless the user
explicitly moves it with the cursor keys or pointing <br>
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enforceKeyFocus (class
EnforceKeyFocus) <br>
If this resource is given a value of True, the keyboard
input focus is always explicitly set to selected windows
even if there is an indication that they are &quot;globally
<br>
active&quot; input windows. (An example of a globally active
window is a scroll bar that can be operated without setting
the focus to that client.) If the resource is False, <br>
the keyboard input focus is not explicitly set to globally
active windows. The default value is True.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">frameStyle (class frameStyle)
<br>
If this resource is given a value of &quot;slab&quot;, the
the window manager frame is drawn such that the client area
appears to be at the same height as the top of the window
<br>
frame. If the resource is set to &quot;recessed&quot;, the
window frame is drawn such that the client area appears
lower than the top of the window frame. The default value is
<br>
&quot;recessed&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iconAutoPlace (class
IconAutoPlace) <br>
This resource indicates whether the window manager arranges
icons in a particular area of the screen or places each icon
where the window was when it was iconified. The <br>
value True indicates that icons are arranged in a particular
area of the screen, determined by the iconPlacement
resource. The value False indicates that an icon is <br>
placed at the location of the window when it is iconified.
The default is True.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iconClick (class IconClick) <br>
When this resource is given the value of True, the system
menu is posted and left posted when an icon is clicked. The
default value is True.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interactivePlacement (class
InteractivePlacement) <br>
This resource controls the initial placement of new windows
on the screen. If the value is True, the pointer shape
changes before a new window is placed on the screen <br>
to indicate to the user that a position should be selected
for the upper-left hand corner of the window. If the value
is False, windows are placed according to the ini&acirc;
<br>
tial window configuration attributes. The default value of
this resource is False.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keyboardFocusPolicy (class
KeyboardFocusPolicy) <br>
If set to pointer, the keyboard focus policy is to have the
keyboard focus set to the client window that contains the
pointer (the pointer could also be in the client <br>
window decoration that mwm adds). If set to explicit, the
policy is to have the keyboard focus set to a client window
when the user presses button 1 with the pointer <br>
on the client window or any part of the associated mwm
decoration. The default value for this resource is
explicit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lowerOnIconify (class
LowerOnIconify) <br>
If this resource is given the default value of True, a
window&rsquo;s icon appears on the bottom of the window
stack when the window is minimized (iconified). A value of
<br>
False places the icon in the stacking order at the same
place as its associated window. The default value of this
resource is True.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">moveThreshold (class
MoveThreshold) <br>
This resource is used to control the sensitivity of dragging
operations that move windows and icons. The value of this
resource is the number of pixels that the locator <br>
is moved with a button down before the move operation is
initiated. This is used to prevent window/icon movement when
you click or double-click and there is uninten&acirc; <br>
tional pointer movement with the button down. The default
value of this resource is 4 (pixels).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">multiScreen (class MultiScreen)
<br>
This resource, if True, causes mwm to manage all the screens
on the display. If False, mwm manages only a single screen.
The default value is False.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">passButtons (class PassButtons)
<br>
This resource indicates whether or not button press events
are passed to clients after they are used to do a window
manager function in the client context. If the <br>
resource value is False, the button press is not passed to
the client. If the value is True, the button press is passed
to the client window. The window manager func&acirc; <br>
tion is done in either case. The default value for this
resource is False.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">passSelectButton (class
PassSelectButton) <br>
This resource indicates whether or not to pass the select
button press events to clients after they are used to do a
window manager function in the client context. If <br>
the resource value is False, then the button press will not
be passed to the client. If the value is True, the button
press is passed to the client window. The window <br>
manager function is done in either case. The default value
for this resource is True.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">positionIsFrame (class
PositionIsFrame) <br>
This resource indicates how client window position
information (from the WM_NORMAL_HINTS property and from
configuration requests) is to be interpreted. If the
resource <br>
value is True, the information is interpreted as the
position of the mwm client window frame. If the value is
False, it is interpreted as being the position of the <br>
client area of the window. The default value of this
resource is True.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">positionOnScreen (class
PositionOnScreen) <br>
This resource is used to indicate that windows should
initially be placed (if possible) so that they are not
clipped by the edge of the screen (if the resource value is
<br>
True). If a window is larger than the size of the screen, at
least the upper-left corner of the window is on-screen. If
the resource value is False, windows are placed <br>
in the requested position even if totally off-screen. The
default value of this resource is True.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quitTimeout (class QuitTimeout)
<br>
This resource specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds)
that mwm will wait for a client to update the WM_COMMAND
property after mwm has sent the WM_SAVE_YOURSELF <br>
message. The default value of this resource is 1000 (ms).
(Refer to the f.kill function description for additional
information.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">raiseKeyFocus (class
RaiseKeyFocus) <br>
This resource is available only when the keyboard input
focus policy is explicit. When set to True, this resource
specifies that a window raised by means of the f.nor&acirc;
<br>
malize_and_raise function also receives the input focus. The
default value of this resource is False.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">refreshByClearing (class
RefreshByClearing) <br>
This resource determines the mechanism used to refresh a
window (or the screen) when the f.refresh_win (f.refresh)
function is executed. When set to True, an XClearArea <br>
is performed over the window for f.refresh_win. When set to
False, a covering window is created and destroyed over the
top of the window to be refreshed. If the func&acirc; <br>
tion is f.refresh and this resource is set to True, then an
XClearArea is performed over every window on the screen. If
the resource is set to False, then one large <br>
window covering the entire screen is created and destroyed.
The default value of this resource is True.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rootButtonClick (class
RootButtonClick) <br>
The rootButtonClick resource controls whether the a click on
the root window will post the root menu in a
&quot;sticky&quot; mode. If this resource is set to True, a
button click <br>
on the root window will post the menu bound to the button
down event for that button in a &quot;sticky&quot; fashion.
If this resource is set to False, then the same button <br>
click would only cause the menu to flash as it would be
unposted once the button up event is seen. The criterion
used to determine if it is a button click is if the <br>
pointer doesn&rsquo;t move between the button down and
button up events. The default value for this resource is
True.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">screens (class Screens) <br>
This resource specifies the resource names to use for the
screens managed by mwm. If mwm is managing a single screen,
only the first name in the list is used. If mwm is <br>
managing multiple screens, the names are assigned to the
screens in order, starting with screen 0. Screen 0 gets the
first name, screen 1 the second name, and so on. <br>
The default screen names are 0, 1, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sessionClientDB (class
SessionClientDB) <br>
This resource identifies a file name to use as a root when
saving state at the request of an XSMP session manager. When
the session is saved, the window manager will <br>
then reuse the file name by automatically incrementing a
suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">showFeedback (class
ShowFeedback) <br>
This resource controls whether or not feedback windows or
confirmation dialogs are displayed. A feedback window shows
a client window&rsquo;s initial placement and shows <br>
position and size during move and resize operations.
Confirmation dialogs can be displayed for certain
operations. The value for this resource is a list of names
of <br>
the feedback options to be enabled or disabled; the names
must be separated by a space. If an option is preceded by a
minus sign, that option is excluded from the list. <br>
The sign of the first item in the list determines the
initial set of options. If the sign of the first option is
minus, mwm assumes all options are present and starts <br>
subtracting from that set. If the sign of the first
decoration is plus (or not specified), mwm starts with no
options and builds up a list from the resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The names of the feedback
options are shown below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name Description <br>
all Show all feedback (Default value). <br>
behavior Confirm behavior switch. <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This resource specification
provides feedback for initial client placement and resize,
and enables the dialog boxes to confirm the restart and set
behavior functions. It disables <br>
feedback for the move function. The default value for this
resource is all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">startupKeyFocus (class
StartupKeyFocus) <br>
This resource is available only when the keyboard input
focus policy is explicit. When given the default value of
True, a window gets the keyboard input focus when the <br>
window is mapped (that is, initially managed by the window
manager). It is recommended that both autoKeyFocus and
startupKeyFocus be True to work with tear off menus. <br>
The default value is True.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wMenuButtonClick (class
WMenuButtonClick) <br>
This resource indicates whether a click of the mouse when
the pointer is over the window menu button posts and leaves
posted the window menu. If the value given this <br>
resource is True, the menu remains posted. True is the
default value for this resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wMenuButtonClick2 (class
WMenuButtonClick2) <br>
When this resource is given the default value of True, a
double-click action on the window menu button does an f.kill
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Screen Specific Appearance and
Behavior Resources <br>
The syntax for specifying screen specific resources is Mwm*

ButtonBindings) <br>
This resource identifies the set of button bindings for
window management functions. The named set of button
bindings is specified in the mwm resource description file.
<br>
These button bindings are merged with the built-in default
bindings. The default value for this resource is
&quot;DefaultButtonBindings&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cleanText (class CleanText) <br>
This resource controls the display of window manager text in
the client title and feedback windows. If the default value
of True is used, the text is drawn with a clear <br>
(no stipple) background. This makes text easier to read on
monochrome systems where a backgroundPixmap is specified.
Only the stippling in the area immediately around <br>
the text is cleared. If False, the text is drawn directly on
top of the existing background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fadeNormalIcon (class
FadeNormalIcon) <br>
If this resource is given a value of True, an icon is grayed
out whenever it has been normalized (its window has been
opened). The default value is False.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">feedbackGeometry (class
FeedbackGeometry) <br>
This resource sets the position of the move and resize
feedback window. If this resource is not specified, the
default is to place the feedback window at the center of
<br>
the screen. The value of the resource is a standard window
geometry string with the following syntax: [=]{
+-}xoffset{+-} yoffset]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">frameBorderWidth (class
FrameBorderWidth) <br>
This resource specifies the width (in pixels) of a client
window frame border without resize handles. The border width
includes the 3-D shadows. The default value is <br>
based on the size and resolution of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iconBoxGeometry (class
IconBoxGeometry) <br>
This resource indicates the initial position and size of the
icon box. The value of the resource is a standard window
geometry string with the following syntax: <br>
[=][width xheight][{+-}xoffset {+-}yoffset] If the offsets
are not provided, the iconPlacement policy is used to
determine the initial placement. The units for width <br>
and height are columns and rows. The actual screen size of
the icon box window depends on the iconImageMaximum (size)
and iconDecoration resources. The default value <br>
for size is (6 * iconWidth + padding) wide by (1 *
iconHeight + padding) high. The default value of the
location is +0 -0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iconBoxName (class IconBoxName)
<br>
This resource specifies the name that is used to look up
icon box resources. The default name is iconbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iconBoxSBDisplayPolicy (class
IconBoxSBDisplayPolicy) <br>
This resource specifies the scroll bar display policy of the
window manager in the icon box. The resource has three
possible values: all, vertical, and horizontal. The <br>
default value, &quot;all&quot;, causes both vertical and
horizontal scroll bars always to appear. The value
&quot;vertical&quot; causes a single vertical scroll bar to
appear in the icon <br>
box and sets the orientation of the icon box to horizontal
(regardless of the iconBoxGeometry specification). The value
&quot;horizontal&quot; causes a single horizontal scroll
<br>
bar to appear in the icon box and sets the orientation of
the icon box to vertical (regardless of the iconBoxGeometry
specification).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iconBoxTitle (class
IconBoxTitle) <br>
This resource specifies the name that is used in the title
area of the icon box frame. The default value is Icons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iconDecoration (class
IconDecoration) <br>
This resource specifies the general icon decoration. The
resource value is label (only the label part is displayed)
or image (only the image part is displayed) or label <br>
image (both the label and image parts are displayed). A
value of activelabel can also be specified to get a label
(not truncated to the width of the icon) when the <br>
icon is selected. The default icon decoration for icon box
icons is that each icon has a label part and an image part
(label image). The default icon decoration for <br>
stand alone icons is that each icon has an active label
part, a label part, and an image part (activelabel label
image).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iconImageMaximum (class
IconImageMaximum) <br>
This resource specifies the maximum size of the icon image.
The resource value is widthx height (for example, 64x64).
The maximum supported size is 128x128. The <br>
default value of this resource is 50x50.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iconImageMinimum (class
IconImageMinimum) <br>
This resource specifies the minimum size of the icon image.
The resource value is widthx height (for example, 32x50).
The minimum supported size is 16x16. The default <br>
value of this resource is 16x16.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iconPlacement (class
IconPlacement) <br>
This resource specifies the icon placement scheme to be
used. The resource value has the following syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">primary_layout secondary_layout
[tight]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The layout values are one of the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Value Description <br>
top Lay the icons out top to bottom. <br>
bottom Lay the icons out bottom to top. <br>
left Lay the icons out left to right. <br>
right Lay the icons out right to left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A horizontal (vertical) layout
value should not be used for both the primary_layout and the
secondary_layout (for example, don&rsquo;t use top for the
primary_layout and bottom for the <br>
secondary_layout).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The primary_layout indicates
whether, when an icon placement is done, the icon is placed
in a row or a column and the direction of placement. The
secondary_layout indicates where <br>
to place new rows or columns. For example, top right
indicates that icons should be placed top to bottom on the
screen and that columns should be added from right to left
on the <br>
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default placement is left
bottom (icons are placed left to right on the screen, with
the first row on the bottom of the screen, and new rows
added from the bottom of the <br>
screen to the top of the screen). A tight value places icons
with zero spacing in between icons. This value is useful for
aesthetic reasons, as well as X-terminals with small <br>
screens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iconPlacementMargin (class
IconPlacementMargin) <br>
This resource sets the distance between the edge of the
screen and the icons that are placed along the edge of the

&quot;DefaultKeyBindings&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">limitResize (class LimitResize)
<br>
If this resource is True, the user is not allowed to resize
a window to greater than the maximum size. The default value
for this resource is True.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maximumMaximumSize (class
MaximumMaximumSize) <br>
This resource is used to limit the maximum size of a client
window as set by the user or client. The resource value is
widthxheight (for example, 1024x1024) where the <br>
width and height are in pixels. The default value of this
resource is twice the screen width and height.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">moveOpaque (class MoveOpaque)
<br>
This resource controls whether the actual window is moved or
a rectangular outline of the window is moved. A default
value of False displays a rectangular outline on <br>
moves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resizeBorderWidth (class
ResizeBorderWidth) <br>
This resource specifies the width (in pixels) of a client
window frame border with resize handles. The specified
border width includes the 3-D shadows. The default <br>
value is based on the size and resolution of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resizeCursors (class
ResizeCursors) <br>
This is used to indicate whether the resize cursors are
always displayed when the pointer is in the window size
border. If True, the cursors are shown, otherwise the <br>
window manager cursor is shown. The default value is
True.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">transientDecoration (class
TransientDecoration) <br>
This controls the amount of decoration that mwm puts on
transient windows. The decoration specification is exactly
the same as for the clientDecoration (client spe&acirc; <br>
cific) resource. Transient windows are identified by the
WM_TRANSIENT_FOR property, which is added by the client to
indicate a relatively temporary window. The default <br>
value for this resource is menu title (that is, transient
windows have frame borders and a titlebar with a window menu
button).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An application can also specify
which decorations mwm should apply to its windows. If it
does so, mwm applies only those decorations indicated by
both the application <br>
and the transientDecoration resource. Otherwise, mwm applies
the decorations indicated by the transientDecoration
resource. For more information see the description of <br>
XmNmwmDecorations on the VendorShell(3) reference page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">transientFunctions (class
TransientFunctions) <br>
This resource is used to indicate which window management
functions are applicable (or not applicable) to transient
windows. The function specification is exactly the <br>
same as for the clientFunctions (client specific) resource.
The default value for this resource is -minimize
-maximize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An application can also specify
which functions mwm should apply to its windows. If it does
so, mwm applies only those functions indicated by both the
application and <br>
the transientFunctions resource. Otherwise, mwm applies the

more information see the description of XmNmwm&acirc; <br>
Functions on the VendorShell(3) reference page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">useIconBox (class UseIconBox)
<br>
If this resource is given a value of True, icons are placed
in an icon box. When an icon box is not used, the icons are
placed on the root window (default value).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Client Specific Resources <br>
The syntax for specifying client specific resources is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mwm*client_name_or_class
*resource_id</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example,
Mwm*mterm*windowMenu is used to specify the window menu to
be used with mterm clients. The syntax for specifying client
specific resources for all classes of clients <br>
is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mwm*resource_id</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specific client specifications
take precedence over the specifications for all clients. For
example, Mwm*windowMenu is used to specify the window menu
to be used for all classes <br>
of clients that don&rsquo;t have a window menu
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syntax for specifying
resource values for windows that have an unknown name and
class (that is, windows that do not have a WM_CLASS property
associated with them) is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mwm*defaults*resource_id</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example,
Mwm*defaults*iconImage is used to specify the icon image to

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clientDecoration (class
ClientDecoration) <br>
This resource controls the amount of window frame
decoration. The resource is specified as a list of
decorations to specify their inclusion in the frame. If a
decora&acirc; <br>
tion is preceded by a minus sign, that decoration is
excluded from the frame. The sign of the first item in the
list determines the initial amount of decoration. If the
<br>
sign of the first decoration is minus, mwm assumes all
decorations are present and starts subtracting from that
set. If the sign of the first decoration is plus (or not
<br>
specified), then mwm starts with no decoration and builds up
a list from the resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An application can also specify
which decorations mwm should apply to its windows. If it
does so, mwm applies only those decorations indicated by
both the application <br>
and the clientDecoration resource. Otherwise, mwm applies

or minimize implies title.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clientFunctions (class
ClientFunctions) <br>
This resource is used to indicate which mwm functions are
applicable (or not applicable) to the client window. The
value for the resource is a list of functions. If the <br>
first function in the list has a minus sign in front of it,
then mwm starts with all functions and subtracts from that
set. If the first function in the list has a plus <br>
sign in front of it, then mwm starts with no functions and
builds up a list. Each function in the list must be preceded
by the appropriate plus or minus sign and sepa&acirc; <br>
rated from the next function by a space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An application can also specify
which functions mwm should apply to its windows. If it does
so, mwm applies only those functions indicated by both the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">focusAutoRaise (class
FocusAutoRaise) <br>
When the value of this resource is True, clients are raised
when they get the keyboard input focus. If the value is
False, the stacking of windows on the display is not <br>
changed when a window gets the keyboard input focus. The
default value is True when the keyboardFocusPolicy is
explicit and False when the keyboardFocusPolicy is <br>
pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iconImage (class IconImage) <br>
This resource can be used to specify an icon image for a
client (for example, &quot;Mwm*myclock*iconImage&quot;). The
resource value is a pathname for a pixmap or bitmap file.
<br>

<br>
This resource specifies the width of the optional matte. The
default value is 0, which effectively disables the
matte.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maximumClientSize (class
MaximumClientSize) <br>
This resource is either a size specification or a direction
that indicates how a client window is to be maximized. The
resource value can be specified as a size speci&acirc; <br>
fication widthxheight. The width and height are interpreted
in the units that the client uses (for example, for terminal
emulators this is generally characters). Alter&acirc; <br>
nately, &quot;vertical&quot; or &quot;horizontal&quot; can
be specified to indicate the direction in which the client
maximizes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this resource is not
specified, the maximum size from the WM_NORMAL_HINTS
property is used if set. Otherwise the default value is the
size where the client window <br>
with window management borders fills the screen. When the
maximum client size is not determined by the
maximumClientSize resource, the maximumMaximumSize resource
value <br>
is used as a constraint on the maximum size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">useClientIcon (class
UseClientIcon) <br>
If the value given for this resource is True, a
client-supplied icon image takes precedence over a
user-supplied icon image. The default value is True, giving

<p style="margin-top: 1em">usePPosition (class
UsePPosition) <br>
This resource specifies whether Mwm honors program specified
position PPosition specified in the WM_NORMAL_HINTS property
in the absence of an user specified position. <br>
Setting this resource to on, causes mwm to always honor
program specified position. Setting this resource to off,
causes mwm to always ignore program specified posi&acirc;
<br>
tion. Setting this resource to the default value of nonzero
cause mwm to honor program specified position other than
(0,0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">windowMenu (class WindowMenu)
<br>
This resource indicates the name of the menu pane that is
posted when the window menu is popped up (usually by
pressing button 1 on the window menu button on the client
<br>
window frame). Menu panes are specified in the mwm resource
description file. Window menus can be customized on a client
class basis by creating custom menus in your <br>
mwmrc file (see mwmrc(4) and specifying resources to
activate the custom menus. The resources have the form Mwm*
client_name_or_class*windowMenu. The default value of <br>
this resource is DefaultWindowMenu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resource Description File <br>
The mwm resource description file is a supplementary
resource file that contains resource descriptions that are
referred to by entries in the resource manager property (see
<br>
xrdb(1) and the defaults files (.Xdefaults, app-defaults/Mwm
). It contains descriptions of resources that are to be used
by mwm, and that cannot be easily encoded in the <br>
defaults files (a bitmap file is an analogous type of
resource description file). A particular mwm resource
description file can be selected using the configFile
resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following types of resources
can be described in the mwm resource description file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Buttons Window manager functions
can be bound (associated) with button events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keys Window manager functions
can be bound (associated) with key press events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Menus Menu panes can be used for
the window menu and other menus posted with key bindings and
button bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mwm resource description
file is described in mwmrc(4).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Environment <br>
The mwm window manager uses the environment variable HOME
specifying the user&rsquo;s home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mwm window manager uses the
environment variable LANG specifying the user&rsquo;s choice
of language for the mwm message catalog and the mwm resource
description file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mwm window uses the
environment variable XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,
XAPPLRESDIR, XENVIRONMENT, LANG, and HOME in determining
search paths for resource defaults <br>
files. The mwm window manager may also us XBMLANGPATH to
search for bitmap files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mwm window manager reads the
$HOME/.motifbind file if it exists to install a virtual key
bindings property on the root window. For more information
on the content of the <br>
.motifbind file, see</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mwm window manager uses the
environment variable MWMSHELL (or SHELL, if MWMSHELL is not
set), specifying the shell to use when executing commands
via the f.exec function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files <br>
