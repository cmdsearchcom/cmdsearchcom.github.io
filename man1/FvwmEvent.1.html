<p>FvwmEvent(1) Fvwm Modules FvwmEvent(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
FvwmEvent - the fvwm event module</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
FvwmEvent is a more versatile replacement for FvwmAudio. It
can in general be used to hook any fvwm function or program
to any window manager event. E.g: Delete unwanted Net&acirc;
<br>
scape Pop ups or application error pop ups as they appear,
play sounds, log events to a file and the like. Be creative,
you&rsquo;ll find a use for it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FvwmEvent is spawned by fvwm, so
no command line invocation will work. From within the
.fvwm2rc file, FvwmEvent is spawned as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module FvwmEvent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or from within an fvwm pop-up
menu:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DestroyMenu Module-Popup <br>
AddToMenu Module-Popup &quot;Modules&quot; Title <br>
+ &quot;Event&quot; Module FvwmEvent <br>
+ &quot;Auto&quot; Module FvwmAuto 200 <br>
+ &quot;Buttons&quot; Module FvwmButtons <br>
+ &quot;Console&quot; Module FvwmConsole <br>
+ &quot;Ident&quot; Module FvwmIdent <br>
+ &quot;Banner&quot; Module FvwmBanner <br>
+ &quot;Pager&quot; Module FvwmPager 0 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The FvwmEvent module communicates with the fvwm window
manager to bind actions to window manager events. Different
actions may be assigned to distinct window manager
events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FvwmEvent can be used to bind
sound files to events like FvwmAudio (RiP) did. It can be
used for logging event traces to a log file, while debugging
fvwm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FvwmEvent can also have builtin
support for the rplay library. (heritage of FvwmAudio)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INVOCATION <br>
The invocation method was shown in the synopsis section. No
command line invocation is possible. FvwmEvent must be
invoked by the fvwm window manager. FvwmEvent accepts a
single <br>
argument:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-audio Enables FvwmAudio
compatibility mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias Makes FvwmEvent use alias
as its name. This affects which lines from the user&rsquo;s
configuration file are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invoking FvwmEvent as FvwmAudio
(either by using an alias or creating a symlink) enables
FvwmAudio compatibility mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION OPTIONS <br>
FvwmEvent gets config info from fvwm&rsquo;s module
configuration database (see fvwm(1), section MODULE
COMMANDS), and looks for certain configuration options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmEvent: Cmd command <br>
This determines the fvwm function that is to be called with
the event parameters. You might want to do one of the
following (details below):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># play sounds <br>
*FvwmEvent: Cmd builtin-rplay</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># execute distinct fvwm
functions <br>
*FvwmEvent: Cmd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># execute distinct external
programs <br>
*FvwmEvent: Cmd exec</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This version of FvwmEvent has
builtin rplay support which does not need to invoke an
external audio player to play sounds. The rplay support is
enabled when FvwmEvent is <br>
compiled with HAVE_RPLAY defined and when FvwmEvent: Cmd is
set to builtin-rplay. See remarks below if FvwmEvent is
invoked in FvwmAudio compatibility mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmEvent: Cmd builtin-rplay
<br>
*FvwmEvent: add_window drip.au</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rplay can be obtained via
anonymous ftp at</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;URL:ftp://ftp.sdsu.edu/pub/rplay&gt;
or <br>
&lt;URL:ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/Event/audio/rplay&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FvwmEvent also has support for
any other external program. e.g: the rsynth
&rsquo;say&rsquo; command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmEvent: Cmd &quot;Exec
/rsynth/say&quot; <br>
*FvwmEvent: destroy_window &quot;window closed&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also use fvwm&rsquo;s
builtin Echo command as FvwmEvent: Cmd to obtain debug
output for fvwm events quietly. I used this setup to debug
FvwmAuto:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmEvent: Cmd Echo <br>
*FvwmEvent: focus_change &quot;focus change&quot; <br>
*FvwmEvent: raise_window &quot;raise window&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can even call different
shell commands for each event just by setting</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmEvent: Cmd exec <br>
*FvwmEvent: add_window &rsquo;killname &quot;APPL
ERROR&quot;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmEvent: PassId <br>
Specifies that the event action will have an ID parameter
added to the end of the command line. Most events will have
the windowID of the window that the event refers to, <br>
new_desk will have the new desk number. The windowID is a
hexadecimal string preceded by 0x, desk numbers are
decimal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmEvent: window-manager-event
action-or-filename <br>
Binds particular actions to window manager events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e.g. for audio-events:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmEvent: startup TaDa.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: shutdown Elvis_Left.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: unknown doh.au</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmEvent: new_page
beam_trek.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: new_desk beam_trek.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: old_add_window drip.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: raise_window swoosh.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: lower_window swoosh.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: old_configure_window hammer.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: focus_change boing.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: enter_window boing.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: leave_window boing.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: destroy_window explosion.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: iconify ploop.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: deiconify ploop.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: window_name huh.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: icon_name beep.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: visible_icon_name beep.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: res_class beep.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: res_name beep.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: end_windowlist twang.au</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmEvent: icon_location
beep.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: map beep.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: error beep.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: config_info beep.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: end_config_info beep.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: icon_file beep.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: default_icon beep.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: string plapper.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: mini_icon beep.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: windowshade beep.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: dewindowshade beep.au</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmEvent: visible_name beep.au
<br>
*FvwmEvent: sendconfig beep.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: restack beep.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: add_window beep.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: configure_window beep.au</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmEvent: visible_icon_name
beep.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: enter_window beep.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: leave_window beep.au <br>
*FvwmEvent: property_change beep.au</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The window related event
handlers are executed within a window context. Previously
PassId was used for this purpose, but now using PassId is
not needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The enter_window event is
generated when the pointer enters a window. With the -passid
option, that window&rsquo;s id is passed to fvwm. An
enter_window event is gener&acirc; <br>
ated too when the pointer leaves a window and moves into the
root window. In this case, the id passed is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: When the shutdown event
arrives, FvwmEvent may be killed before it can trigger the
associated action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Provided fvwm supports it (not
yet), there&rsquo;s an additional event to replace all fvwm
beeps with a sound:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmEvent: beep beep.au</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmEvent: Delay 5 <br>
Specifies that an event-action will only be executed if it
occurs at least 5 seconds after the previous event. Events
that occur during the delay period are ignored. <br>
This option is useful if you don&rsquo;t want several sounds
playing at the same time. The default delay is 0 which
disables the Event delay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmEvent: StartDelay delay
<br>
Specifies that an event-action will only be executed if it
occurs at least delay seconds after the startup event.
Events that occur during the delay period are ignored. <br>
This option is useful when fvwm starts and restarts using an
audio player. The default delay is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RPLAY OPTIONS <br>
The following options are only valid with builtin rplay
support. i.e: when FvwmEvent was compiled with HAVE_RPLAY
defined. They are used only if FvwmEvent: Cmd is set to <br>
builtin-rplay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmEvent: RplayHost hostname
<br>
Specifies what host the rplay sounds will play on. The
hostname can also be an environment variable such as
$HOSTDISPLAY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmEvent: RplayPriority 0 <br>
Specifies what priority will be assigned to the rplay sounds
when they are played.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmEvent: RplayVolume 127 <br>
Specifies what volume will be assigned to the sounds when
they are played.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FvwmAudio Compatibility Mode
<br>
When invoked in FvwmAudio compatibility mode (see above),
FvwmEvent accepts the following options to provide backwards
compatibility for FvwmAudio:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmEvent: PlayCmd command <br>
This is equivalent to using *FvwmEvent: Cmd to Exec
commands. This determines the independent audio player
program that will actually play the sounds. If the play
command <br>
is set to builtin-rplay then the builtin rplay support will
be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*FvwmAudio: Dir directory <br>
Specifies the directory to look for the audio files. This
option is ignored when rplay is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
It&rsquo;s REALLY noisy when fvwm starts and restarts using
an audio player. You can use FvwmEvent: StartDelay to fix
this problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COPYRIGHTS <br>
This module has evolved of FvwmAudio, which in term is
heavily based on a similar Fvwm module called FvwmSound by
Mark Boyns. FvwmAudio simply took Mark&rsquo;s original
program and <br>
extended it to make it generic enough to work with any audio
player. Due to different requests to do specific things on
specific events, FvwmEvent took this one step further and
<br>
now calls any fvwm function, or builtin-rplay. If
fvwm&rsquo;s Exec function is used, any external program can
be called with any parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The concept for interfacing this
module to the Window Manager, is original work by Robert
Nation.</p>
