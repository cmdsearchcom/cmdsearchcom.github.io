<i>Latexmk</i> completely automates the process of compiling a LaTeX document.
  Essentially, it is like a specialized relative of the general <i>make</i>
  utility, but one which determines dependencies automatically and has some
  other very useful features. In its basic mode of operation <i>latexmk</i> is
  given the name of the primary source file for a document, and it issues the
  appropriate sequence of commands to generate a .dvi, .ps, .pdf and/or hardcopy
  version of the document.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default <i>latexmk</i> will run the commands necessary to generate a .dvi
  file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Latexmk</i> can also be set to run continuously with a suitable previewer. In
  that case the <i>latex</i> program (or one of its relatives), etc, are rerun
  whenever one of the source files is modified, and the previewer automatically
  updates the on-screen view of the compiled document.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Latexmk</i> determines which are the source files by examining the log file.
  (Optionally, it also examines the list of input and output files generated by
  the <b>-recorder</b> option of modern versions of <i>latex</i> (and
  <i>pdflatex</i>, <i>xelatex</i>, <i>lualatex</i>, etc). See the documentation
  for the <b>-recorder</b> option of <i>latexmk</i> below.) When <i>latexmk</i>
  is run, it examines properties of the source files, and if any have been
  changed since the last document generation, <i>latexmk</i> will run the
  various LaTeX processing programs as necessary. In particular, it will repeat
  the run of <i>latex</i> (or a related program)) often enough to resolve all
  cross references; depending on the macro packages used. With some macro
  packages and document classes, four, or even more, runs may be needed. If
  necessary, <i>latexmk</i> will also run <i>bibtex</i>, <i>biber</i>, and/or
  <i>makeindex</i>. In addition, <i>latexmk</i> can be configured to generate
  other necessary files. For example, from an updated figure file it can
  automatically generate a file in encapsulated postscript or another suitable
  format for reading by LaTeX.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Latexmk</i> has two different previewing options. In the simple <b>-pv</b>
  option, a dvi, postscript or pdf previewer is automatically run after
  generating the dvi, postscript or pdf version of the document. The type of
  file to view is selected according to configuration settings and command line
  options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second previewing option is the powerful <b>-pvc</b> option (mnemonic:
  &quot;preview continuously&quot;). In this case, <i>latexmk</i> runs
  continuously, regularly monitoring all the source files to see if any have
  changed. Every time a change is detected, <i>latexmk</i> runs all the programs
  necessary to generate a new version of the document. A good previewer (like
  <i>gv</i>) will then automatically update its display. Thus the user can
  simply edit a file and, when the changes are written to disk, <i>latexmk</i>
  completely automates the cycle of updating the .dvi (and possibly the .ps and
  .pdf) file, and refreshing the previewer's display. It's not quite WYSIWYG,
  but usefully close.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For other previewers, the user may have to manually make the previewer update
  its display, which can be (some versions of <i>xdvi</i> and <i>gsview</i>) as
  simple as forcing a redraw of its display.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Latexmk</i> has the ability to print a banner in gray diagonally across each
  page when making the postscript file. It can also, if needed, call an external
  program to do other postprocessing on generated dvi and postscript files. (See
  the options <b>-dF</b> and <b>-pF</b>, and the documentation for the
  <i>$dvi_filter</i> and <i>$ps_filter</i> configuration variables.) These
  capabilities are leftover from older versions of <i>latexmk</i>. More
  flexibility can be obtained in current versions, since the command strings for
  running latex, pdflatex, etc can now be configured to run multiple commands.
  This also extends the possibility of postprocessing generated files to pdf
  files. files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Latexmk</i> is highly configurable, both from the command line and in
  configuration files, so that it can accommodate a wide variety of user needs
  and system configurations. Default values are set according to the operating
  system, so <i>latexmk</i> often works without special configuration on
  MS-Windows, cygwin, Linux, OS-X, and other UNIX systems (notably Solaris).
<div class="Pp"></div>
A very annoying complication handled very reliably by <i>latexmk</i>, is that
  LaTeX is a multiple pass system. On each run, LaTeX reads in information
  generated on a previous run, for things like cross referencing and indexing.
  In the simplest cases, a second run of LaTeX suffices, and often the log file
  contains a message about the need for another pass. However, there is a wide
  variety of add-on macro packages to LaTeX, with a variety of behaviors. The
  result is to break simple-minded determinations of how many runs are needed
  and of which programs. In its new version, <i>latexmk</i> has a highly general
  and efficient solution to these issues. The solution involves retaining
  between runs information on the source files, and a symptom is that
  <i>latexmk</i> generates an extra file (with extension <i>.fdb_latexmk</i>, by
  default) that contains the source file information.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LATEXMK_OPTIONS_AND_ARGUMENTS_ON_COMMAND_LINE"><a class="selflink" href="#LATEXMK_OPTIONS_AND_ARGUMENTS_ON_COMMAND_LINE">LATEXMK
  OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS ON COMMAND LINE</a></h1>
In general the command line to invoke <i>latexmk</i> has the form
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	latexmk [options] [file]
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
All options can be introduced by single or double &quot;-&quot; characters,
  e.g., &quot;latexmk -help&quot; or &quot;latexmk --help&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Note 1</b>: In addition to the options in the list below, <i>latexmk</i>
  recognizes almost all the options recognized by the <i>latex</i>,
  <i>pdflatex</i> programs (and their relatives) in their current TeXLive and
  MiKTeX implementations. Some of the options for these programs also trigger
  special action or behavior by <i>latexmk</i>, in which case they have specific
  explanations in this document. Otherwise, they are just passed through to a
  called <i>latex</i> or <i>pdflatex</i> program. Run <i>latexmk</i> with the
  <b>-showextraoptions</b> to get a list of the options that <i>latexmk</i>
  accepts and that are simply passed through to <i>latex</i> or <i>pdflatex</i>
  (etc). See also the explanation of the <b>-showextraoptions</b> option for
  more information.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Note 2</b>: In this documentation, the program <i>pdflatex</i> is often
  referred to. Users of programs like <i>lualatex</i> and <i>xelatex</i> should
  know that from <i>latexmk</i>'s point of view, these other programs behave
  like <i>pdflatex</i>, i.e., they make a pdf file from a tex file, etc. So
  whenever <i>pdflatex</i> is mentioned without mention of the other programs,
  the statements apply equally to <i>lualatex</i>, <i>xelatex</i>, and any other
  similar programs. <i>Latexmk</i> can be easily configured to use whichever of
  these programs is needed. See the documentation for the following options:
  <b>-pdflatex=&quot;COMMAND&quot;</b>, <b>-lualatex</b>, and <b>-xelatex</b>,
  and also see the documentation for the <i>$pdflatex</i> configuration
  variable. At present <i>latexmk</i> cannot do automatic detection of which
  program is to be used.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Definitions of options and arguments</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>file</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">One or more files can be specified. If no files are
      specified, <i>latexmk</i> will, by default, run on all files in the
      current working directory with a &quot;.tex&quot; extension. This behavior
      can be changed: see the description concerning the <i>@default_files</i>
      variable in the section &quot;List of configuration variables usable in
      initialization files&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a file is specified without an extension, then the &quot;.tex&quot; extension
  is automatically added, just as LaTeX does. Thus, if you specify:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	latexmk foo
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
then <i>latexmk</i> will operate on the file &quot;foo.tex&quot;.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-auxdir=FOO or -aux-directory=FOO</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Sets the directory for auxiliary output files of (pdf)latex (.aux, .log
      etc). This achieves its effect by the <b>-aux-directory</b> option of
      (pdf)latex, which currently is only implemented on the MiKTeX version of
      (pdf)latex.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    See also the <b>-outdir</b>/<b>-output-directory</b> options, and the
      <i>$aux_dir</i>, <i>$out_dir</i>, and <i>$search_path_separator</i>
      configuration variables of <i>latexmk</i>. In particular, see the
      documentation of <i>$out_dir</i> for some complications on what directory
      names are suitable.

      bibtex or biber as needed to regenerate the bbl files.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

  <dd class="It-tag">Never run bibtex or biber.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A common use for this option is when a document comes from an external
      source, complete with its bbl file(s), and the user does not have the
      corresponding bib files available. In this situation use of the
      <b>-bibtex-</b> option will prevent <i>latexmk</i> from trying to run
      <i>bibtex</i> or <i>biber</i>, which would result in overwriting of the
      bbl files.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">When the source file uses bbl file(s) for the bibliography,
      run <i>bibtex</i> or <i>biber</i> as needed to regenerate the bbl files,
      but only if the relevant bib file(s) exist. Thus when the bib files are
      not available, <i>bibtex</i> or <i>biber</i> is not run, thereby avoiding
      overwriting of the bbl file(s). This is the default setting.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    (Note that it is possible for <i>latexmk</i> to decide that the bib file
      does not exist, even though the bib file does exist and <i>bibtex</i> or
      <i>biber</i> finds it. The problem is that the bib file may not be in the
      current directory but in some search path; the places <i>latexmk</i> and
      <i>bibtex</i> or <i>biber</i> cause to be searched need not be identical.
      On modern installations of TeX and related programs this problem should
      not arise, since <i>latexmk</i> uses the <i>kpsewhich</i> program to do
      the search, and <i>kpsewhich</i> should use the same search path as
      <i>bibtex</i> and <i>biber</i>. If this problem arises, use the

    The code is executed when the <b>-e</b> option is encountered during

    Some care is needed to deal with proper quoting of special characters in the

      command to use its -shell-escape option, then under UNIX/LINUX you could
      use the line
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    	latexmk -e '$latex=q/latex %O -shell-escape %S/' file.tex
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that the single quotes block normal UNIX/LINUX command shells from
      treating the characters inside the quotes as special. (In this example,
      the q/.../ construct is a <i>Perl</i> idiom equivalent to using single
      quotes. This avoids the complications of getting a quote character inside
      an already quoted string in a way that is independent of both the shell
      and the operating-system.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The above command line will NOT work under MS-Windows with cmd.exe or
      command.com or 4nt.exe. For MS-Windows with these command shells you could
      use
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    	latexmk -e &quot;$latex=q/latex %O -shell-escape %S/&quot; file.tex

     <b>Important note</b>: the acroread program on MS-Windows locks the pdf

  TO CHANGE THE WAY LATEXMK BEHAVES, DEALING WITH PROBLEMS, ETC</a></h1>
Some possibilities:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
a. If you get a strange error, do look carefully at the output that is on the
  screen and in log files. While there is much that is notoriously verbose in
  the output of <i>latex</i> (and that is added to by <i>latexmk</i>), the
  verbosity is there for a reason: to enable the user to diagnose problems.
  <i>Latexmk</i> does repeat some messages at the end of a run that it thinks
  would otherwise be easy to miss in the middle of other output.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
b. If <i>latexmk</i> doesn't do things the way you would like, the first step in
  finding out what to do is to look in this documentation at the list of command
  line options and then at the sections on configuration/initialization files. A
  lot of <i>latexmk</i>'s behavior is configurable to deal with particular
  situations. (But there is a lot of reading.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
c. Further tricks can involve replacing the standard commands that
  <i>latexmk</i> by other commands or scripts.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
d. For possible examples of code for use in an RC file, see the directory
  example_rcfiles in the distribution of <i>latexmk</i> (e.g., at
  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/latexmk/example_rcfiles). Even if
  these examples don't do what you want, they may provide suitable inspiration.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
e. There's a useful trick that can be used when you are <i>lualatex</i> instead
  of <i>pdflatex</i> (and in some related situations). The problem is that
  <i>latexmk</i> won't notice a dependency on a file, bar.baz say, that is input
  by the lua code in your document instead of by the LaTeX part. (Thus if you
  change bar.baz and rerun <i>latexmk</i>, then <i>latexmk</i> will think no
  files have changed and not rerun <i>lualatex</i>, whereas if you had
  '\input{bar.baz}' in the LaTeX part of the document, <i>latexmk</i> would
  notice the change.) One solution is just to put the following somewhere in the
  LaTeX part of the document:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 \typeout{(bar.baz)}
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This puts a line in the log file that <i>latexmk</i> will treat as implying that
  the file bar.baz was read. (At present I don't know a way of doing this
  automatically.) Of course, if the file has a different name, change bar.baz to
  the name of your file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
f. Look on tex.stackexchange, i.e., at
  http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/latexmk Someone may have already
  solved your problem.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION/INITIALIZATION_(RC)_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION/INITIALIZATION_(RC)_FILES">CONFIGURATION/INITIALIZATION
  (RC) FILES</a></h1>
<i>Latexmk</i> can be customized using initialization files, which are read at
  startup in the following order:
<div class="Pp"></div>
1) The system RC file, if it exists.
<br/>
 On a UNIX system, <i>latexmk</i> searches for following places for its system
  RC file, in the following order, and reads the first it finds:
<br/>
 &quot;/opt/local/share/latexmk/LatexMk&quot;,
<br/>
 &quot;/usr/local/share/latexmk/LatexMk&quot;,
<br/>
 &quot;/usr/local/lib/latexmk/LatexMk&quot;.
<br/>
 On a MS-WINDOWS system it looks for &quot;C:\latexmk\LatexMk&quot;.
<br/>
 On a cygwin system (i.e., a MS-Windows system in which Perl is that of cygwin),
  <i>latexmk</i> reads for the first it finds of
<br/>
 &quot;/cygdrive/c/latexmk/LatexMk&quot;,
<br/>
 &quot;/opt/local/share/latexmk/LatexMk&quot;,
<br/>
 &quot;/usr/local/share/latexmk/LatexMk&quot;,
<br/>
 &quot;/usr/local/lib/latexmk/LatexMk&quot;.
<br/>
 In addition, it then tries the same set of locations, but with the file name
  replaced &quot;LatexMk&quot; replaced by &quot;latexmkrc&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2) The user's RC file, &quot;$HOME/.latexmkrc&quot;, if it exists. Here $HOME is
  the user's home directory. [ <i>Latexmk</i> determines the user's home
  directory as follows: It is the value of the environment variable HOME, if
  this variable exists, which normally is the case on UNIX-like systems
  (including LINUX and OS-X). Otherwise the environment variable USERPROFILE is
  used, if it exists, which normally is the case on MS-Windows systems.
  Otherwise a blank string is used instead of $HOME.]
<div class="Pp"></div>
3) The RC file in the current working directory. This file can be named either
  &quot;latexmkrc&quot; or &quot;.latexmkrc&quot;, and the first of these to be
  found is used, if any.
<div class="Pp"></div>
4) Any RC file(s) specified on the command line with the <b>-r</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each RC file is a sequence of <i>Perl</i> commands. Naturally, a user can use
  this in creative ways. But for most purposes, one simply uses a sequence of
  assignment statements that override some of the built-in settings of
  <i>Latexmk</i>. Straightforward cases can be handled without knowledge of the
  <i>Perl</i> language by using the examples in this document as templates.
  Comment lines are introduced by the &quot;#&quot; character.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that command line options are obeyed in the order in which they are
  written; thus any RC file specified on the command line with the <b>-r</b>
  option can override previous options but can be itself overridden by later
  options on the command line. There is also the <b>-e</b> option, which allows
  initialization code to be specified in <i>latexmk</i>'s command line.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<i></i> <i>For possible examples of code for in an RC file, see the
  directory</i> <i>example_rcfiles in the distribution of latexmk (e.g., at</i>

  TO SET VARIABLES IN INITIALIZATION FILES</a></h1>
The important variables that can be configured are described in the section
  &quot;List of configuration variables usable in initialization files&quot;.
  Syntax for setting these variables is of the following forms:
<div class="Pp"></div>
	$bibtex = 'bibtex %O %B';
<div class="Pp"></div>
for the setting of a string variable,
<div class="Pp"></div>
	$preview_mode = 1;
<div class="Pp"></div>
for the setting of a numeric variable, and
<div class="Pp"></div>
	@default_files = ('paper', 'paper1');
<div class="Pp"></div>
for the setting of an array of strings. It is possible to append an item to an
  array variable as follows:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	push @default_files, 'paper2';
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that simple &quot;scalar&quot; variables have names that begin with a $
  character and array variables have names that begin with a @ character. Each
  statement ends with a semicolon.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Strings should be enclosed in single quotes. (You could use double quotes, as in
  many programming languages. But then the <i>Perl</i> programming language
  brings into play some special rules for interpolating variables into strings.
  People not fluent in <i>Perl</i> will want to avoid these complications.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can do much more complicated things, but for this you will need to consult a
  manual for the <i>Perl</i> programming language.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FORMAT_OF_COMMAND_SPECIFICATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#FORMAT_OF_COMMAND_SPECIFICATIONS">FORMAT
  OF COMMAND SPECIFICATIONS</a></h1>
Some of the variables set the commands that <i>latexmk</i> uses for carrying out
  its work, for example to generate a dvi file from a tex file or to view a
  postscript file. This section describes some important features of how the
  commands are specified.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Placeholders</b>: Supposed you wanted <i>latexmk</i> to use the command
  elatex in place of the regular latex command, and suppose moreover that you
  wanted to give it the option &quot;--shell-escape&quot;. You could do this by
  the following setting:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 $latex = 'elatex --shell-escape %O %S';
<div class="Pp"></div>
The two items starting with the % character are placeholders. These are
  substituted by appropriate values before the command is run. Thus %S will be
  replaced by the source file that elatex will be applied to, and %O will be
  replaced by any options that <i>latexmk</i> has decided to use for this
  command. (E.g., if you used the -silent option it would replace %O by
  &quot;-interaction=batchmode&quot;.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The available placeholders are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>%B</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">base of filename for current command. E.g., if a postscript
      file document.ps is being made from the dvi file document.dvi, then the
      basename is document.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>%D</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">destination file (e.g., the name of the postscript file
      when converting a dvi file to postscript).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>%O</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">options</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>%R</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">root filename. This is the base name for the main tex
    file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>%S</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">source file (e.g., the name of the dvi file when converting
      a dvi file to ps).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>%T</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The name of the primary tex file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>%Y</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Name of directory for auxiliary output files (see the
      configuration variable <i>$aux_dir</i>). A directory separation character
      ('/') is appended if <i>$aux_dir</i> is non-empty and does not end in a
      suitable character, with suitable characters being those appropriate to
      UNIX and MS-Windows, i.e., ':', '/' and '\'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>%Z</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Name of directory for output files (see the configuration
      variable <i>$out_dir</i>). A directory separation character ('/') is
      appended if <i>$out_dir</i> is non-empty and does not end in a suitable
      character, with suitable characters being those appropriate to UNIX and
      MS-Windows, i.e., ':', '/' and '\'.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If for some reason you need a literal % character in your string not subject to
  the above rules, use a pair of these characters. Thus with the command
  specification $ps_previewer = 'latex -ad=%%Sfile.ad %S', the %%S will become
  %S when the command is executed, but the %S will be replaced by the source
  filename, which in this case would be the name of a postscript file to be
  viewed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Appropriate quoting will be applied to the filename substitutions, so you
  mustn't supply them yourself even if the names of your files have spaces in
  them. (But if your TeX filenames have spaces in them, beware that many
  versions of the TeX program cannot correctly handle filenames containing
  spaces.) In case latexmk's quoting does not work correctly on your system, you
  can turn it off -- see the documentation for the variable
  <i>$quote_filenames</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The distinction between %B and %R needs a bit of care, since they are often the
  same, but not always. For example on a simple document, the basename of a
  bibtex run is the same as for the texfile. But in a document with several
  bibliographies, the bibliography files will have a variety of names. Since
  bibtex is invoked with the basename of the bibliography file, the setting for
  the bibtex command should therefore be
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 $bibtex = 'bibtex %O %B';
<div class="Pp"></div>
Generally, you should use %B rather than %R. Similarly for most purposes, the
  name %T of the primary texfile is not a useful placeholder.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
See the default values in the section &quot;List of configuration variables
  usable in initialization files&quot; for what is normally the most appropriate
  usage.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you omit to supply any placeholders whatever in the specification of a
  command, <i>latexmk</i> will supply what its author thinks are appropriate
  defaults. This gives compatibility with configuration files for previous
  versions of <i>latexmk</i>, which didn't use placeholders.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>&quot;Detaching&quot; a command</b>: Normally when <i>latexmk</i> runs a
  command, it waits for the command to run to completion. This is appropriate
  for commands like latex, of course. But for previewers, the command should
  normally run detached, so that <i>latexmk</i> gets the previewer running and
  then returns to its next task (or exits if there is nothing else to do). To
  achieve this effect of detaching a command, you need to precede the command
  name with &quot;start &quot;, as in
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 $dvi_previewer = 'start xdvi %O %S';
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will be translated to whatever is appropriate for your operating system.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Notes: (1) In some circumstances, <i>latex</i> will always run a command
  detached. This is the case for a previewer in preview continuous mode, since
  otherwise previewing continuously makes no sense. (2) This precludes the
  possibility of running a command named start. (3) If the word start occurs
  more than once at the beginning of the command string, that is equivalent to
  having just one. (4) Under cygwin, some complications happen, since cygwin
  amounts to a complicated merging of UNIX and MS-Windows. See the source code
  for how I've handled the problem.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Command names containing spaces</b>: Under MS-Windows it is common that the
  name of a command includes spaces, since software is often installed in a
  subdirectory of &quot;C:\Program Files&quot;. Such command names should be
  enclosed in double quotes, as in
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 $lpr_pdf = '&quot;c:/Program Files/Ghostgum/gsview/gsview32.exe&quot; /p %S';
<br/>
 $pdf_previewer = 'start &quot;c:/Program Files/SumatraPDF/SumatraPDF.exe&quot;
  %O %S';
<br/>
 $pdf_previewer = 'start &quot;c:/Program Files/SumatraPDF
  (x86)/SumatraPDF.exe&quot; %O %S';
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(Note about the above example: Forward slashes are equivalent to backslashes in
  filenames under MS-Windows, provided that the filename is inside double
  quotes. It is easier to use forward slashes in examples like the one above,
  since then one does not have to worry about the rules for dealing with forward
  slashes in strings in the Perl language.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Command names under Cygwin</b>: If latexmk is executed by Cygwin's Perl, <i>
  be particularly certain that pathnames in commands have</i>
  <i></i><b>forward</b> <i> slashes</i> not the usual backslashes for the
  separator of pathname components. See the above examples. Backslashes often
  get misinterpreted by the Unix shell used by Cygwin's Perl to execute external
  commands. Forward slashes don't suffer from this problem, and (when quoted, as
  above) are equally acceptable to MS-Windows.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Using MS-Windows file associations</b>: A useful trick under modern versions
  of MS-Windows (e.g., WinXP) is to use just the command 'start' by itself:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 $dvi_previewer = 'start %S';
<div class="Pp"></div>
Under recent versions of MS-Windows, this will cause to be run whatever program
  the system has associated with dvi files. (The same applies for a postscript
  viewer and a pdf viewer.) But note that this trick is not always suitable for
  the pdf previwer, if your system has acroread for the default pdf viewer. As
  explained elsewhere, acroread under MS-Windows does not work well with
  <i>latex</i> and <i>latexmk</i>, because acroread locks the pdf file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Not using a certain command</b>: If a command is not to be run, the command
  name NONE is used, as in
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 $lpr = 'NONE lpr';
<div class="Pp"></div>
This typically is used when an appropriate command does not exist on your
  system. The string after the &quot;NONE&quot; is effectively a comment.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Options to commands</b>: Setting the name of a command can be used not only
  for changing the name of the command called, but also to add options to
  command. Suppose you want <i>latexmk</i> to use latex with source specials
  enabled. Then you might use the following line in an initialization file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 $latex = 'latex --src-specials %O %S';
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Running a subroutine instead of an external command</b>: Use a specification
  starting with &quot;internal&quot;, as in
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 $latex = 'internal mylatex %O %S';
<br/>
 sub mylatex {
<br/>
 my @args = @_;
<br/>
 # Possible preprocessing here
<br/>
 return system 'latex', @args;
<br/>
 }
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Advanced tricks</b>: Normally one specifies a single command for the commands
  invoked by <i>latexmk</i>. Naturally, if there is some complicated additional
  processing you need to do in your special situation, you can write a script
  (or batch file) to do the processing, and then configure <i>latexmk</i> to use
  your script in place of the standard program.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
It is also possible to configure <i>latexmk</i> to run multiple commands. For
  example, if when running pdflatex to generate a pdf file from a tex file you
  need to run another program after pdflatex to perform some extra processing,
  you could do something like:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 $pdflatex = 'pdflatex --shell-escape %O %S; pst2pdf_for_latexmk %B';
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This definition assumes you are using a UNIX-like system (which includes Linux
  and OS-X), so that the two commands to be run are separated by the semicolon
  in the middle of the string.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you are using MS-Windows, you would replace the above line by
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 $pdflatex = 'cmd /c pdflatex --shell-escape %O %S'
<br/>
 . '&amp;&amp; pst2pdf_for_latexmk %B';
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Here, the UNIX command separator ; is replaced by &amp;&amp;. In addition, there
  is a problem that some versions of <i>Perl</i> on MS-Windows do not obey the
  command separator; this problem is overcome by explicitly invoking the
  MS-Windows command-line processor <i>cmd.exe</i>.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This use of a temporary file solves a problem that the making of these files
      can occupy a substantial time. If a viewer sees that the file has changed,
      it reads the new file, and this can cause havoc if the program writing the
      file has not yet finished its work.

    These variables specify commands that are executed at certain points of
      compilations during preview-continuous mode. One motivation for their
      existance is to allow convenient visual indications of compilation status
      even when the window receiving the screen output of the compilation is
      hidden.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The commands are executed at the following points: $compiling_cmd at the
      start of compilation, $success_cmd at the end of a successful compilation,
      and $failure_cmd at the end of an unsuccessful compilation. If any of
      above variables is undefined (the default situation) or blank, then the
      corresponding command is not executed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    An example of a typical setting of these variables is as follows
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     $compiling_cmd = &quot;xdotool search --name \&quot;%D\&quot; set_window
      --name \&quot;%D compiling\&quot;&quot;;
    <br/>
     $success_cmd = &quot;xdotool search --name \&quot;%D\&quot; set_window
      --name \&quot;%D OK\&quot;&quot;;
    <br/>
     $failure_cmd = &quot;xdotool search --name \&quot;%D\&quot; set_window
      --name \&quot;%D FAILURE\&quot;&quot;;
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    These assume that the program <i>xdotool</i> is installed, that the
      previewer is using an X-Window system for display, and that the title of
      the window contains the name of the displayed file, as it normally does.
      When the commands are executed, the placeholder string %D is replaced by
      the name of the destination file, which is the previewed file. The above
      commands result in an appropriate string being appended to the filename in
      the window title: &quot; compiling&quot;, &quot; OK&quot;, or &quot;
      FAILURE&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Other placeholders that can be used are %S, %T, and %R, with %S and %T
      normally being identical. These can be useful for a command changing the
      title of the edit window. The visual indication in a window title can
      useful, since the user does not have to keep shifting attention to the
      (possibly hidden) compilation window to know the status of the
      compilation.

      will process an appropriate set of files. But sometimes you want only some
      of these files to be processed. In this case you set the
      <i>@default_files</i> in an initialization file (e.g., the file
      &quot;latexmkrc&quot; in the current directory). Then if no files are
      specified on the command line then the files you specify by setting

    This list has two uses: (a) to set the kinds of file to be deleted in a
      cleanup operation (with the <b>-c</b>, <b>-C</b>, <b>-CA</b>, <b>-g</b>
      and <b>-gg</b> options), and (b) in the determination of whether a rerun
      of (pdf)LaTeX is needed after a run that gives an error.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    (Normally, a change of a source file during a run should provoke a rerun.
      This includes a file generated by LaTeX, e.g., an aux file, that is read
      in on subsequent runs. But after a run that results in an error, a new run
      should occur until the user has made a change in the files. But the user
      may have corrected an error in a source .tex file during the run. So
      <i>latexmk</i> needs to distinguish user-generated and automatically
      generated files; it determines the automatically generated files as those
      with extensions in the list in @generated_exts.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A convenient way to add an extra extension to the list, without losing the
      already defined ones is to use a push command in the line in an RC file.
      E.g.,
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     push @generated_exts, &quot;end&quot;;
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The general rule <i>latexmk</i> uses for determining when an extra run of
      some program is needed is that one of the source files has changed. But
      consider for example a latex package that causes an encapsulated
      postscript file (an &quot;eps&quot; file) to be made that is to be read in
      on the next run. The file contains a comment line giving its creation date
      and time. On the next run the time changes, <i>latex</i> sees that the eps
      file has changed, and therefore reruns latex. This causes an infinite
      loop, that is only terminated because <i>latexmk</i> has a limit on the
      number of runs to guard against pathological situations.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    But the changing line has no real effect, since it is a comment. You can
      instruct <i>latex</i> to ignore the offending line as follows:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     $hash_calc_ignore_pattern{'eps'} = '^%%CreationDate: ';
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This creates a rule for files with extension <i>.eps</i> about lines to
      ignore. The left-hand side is a <i>Perl</i> idiom for setting an item in a
      hash. Note that the file extension is specified without a period. The
      value, on the right-hand side, is a string containing a regular
      expresssion. (See documentation on <i>Perl</i> for how they are to be
      specified in general.) This particular regular expression specifies that
      lines beginning with &quot;%%CreationDate: &quot; are to be ignored in
      deciding whether a file of the given extension <i>.eps</i> has changed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    There is only one regular expression available for each extension. If you
      need more one pattern to specify lines to ignore, then you need to combine
      the patterns into a single regular expression. The simplest method is
      separate the different simple patterns by a vertical bar character
      (indicating &quot;alternation&quot; in the jargon of regular expressions).
      For example,
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     $hash_calc_ignore_pattern{'eps'} = '^%%CreationDate: |^%%Title: ';
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    causes lines starting with either &quot;^%%CreationDate: &quot; or
      &quot;^%%Title: &quot; to be ignored.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    It may happen that a pattern to be ignored is specified in, for example, in
      a system or user initialization file, and you wish to remove this in a
      file read later. To do this, you use Perl's delete function, e.g.,
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     delete $hash_calc_ignore_pattern{'eps'};

    In this situation, latexmk searches for custom dependencies to make the

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     remove_input_ext( 'latex', 'tex' );
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

    <br/>
     add_input_ext( 'latex', 'asdf' );
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    add the extension 'asdf to latex_input_extensions. (Naturally with such an
      extension, you should have made an appropriate custom dependency for
      latexmk, and should also have done the appropriate programming in the
      LaTeX source file to enable the file to be read. The standard extensions
      are handled by LaTeX and its graphics/graphicx packages.

    Commonly, the directory specified for output files is a subdirectory of the
      current working directory. However, if you specify some other directory,
      e.g., &quot;/tmp/foo&quot; or &quot;../output&quot;, be aware that this
      could cause problems, e.g., with <i>makeindex</i> or <i>bibtex</i>. This
      is because modern versions of these programs, by default, will refuse to
      work when they find that they are asked to write to a file in a directory
      that appears not to be the current working directory or one of its
      subdirectories. This is part of security measures by the whole TeX system

      includes a higher-level directory, then you need to disable the security
      measures (and assume any risks). This can be done by temporarily setting
      the operating system's environment variable openout_any to &quot;a&quot;

  <dd class="It-tag">This variable specifies the extensions tried by latexmk
      when it finds that a pdflatex run resulted in an error that a file has not
      been found, and the file is given without an extension. This typically
      happens when LaTeX commands of the form \input{file} or
      \includegraphics{figure}, when the relevant source file does not exist.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In this situation, latexmk searches for custom dependencies to make the
      missing file(s), but restricts it to the extensions specified by the
      variable %pdflatex_input_extensions. The default extensions are 'tex',
      'pdf', 'jpg, and 'png'.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    (For Perl experts: %pdflatex_input_extensions is a hash whose keys are the
      extensions. The values are irrelevant.) Two subroutines are provided for
      manipulating this and the related variable %latex_input_extensions,
      add_input_ext and remove_input_ext. They are used as in the following
      examples are possible lines in an initialization file:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     remove_input_ext( 'pdflatex', 'tex' );
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    removes the extension 'tex' from pdflatex_input_extensions
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     add_input_ext( 'pdflatex', 'asdf' );
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    add the extension 'asdf to pdflatex_input_extensions. (Naturally with such
      an extension, you should have made an appropriate custom dependency for
      latexmk, and should also have done the appropriate programming in the
      LaTeX source file to enable the file to be read. The standard extensions
      are handled by pdflatex and its graphics/graphicx packages.)

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    On MS-WINDOWS, the default is changed to &quot;cmd /c start
      &quot;&quot;&quot;; under more recent versions of Windows, this will cause
      to be run whatever command the system has associated with .pdf files. But
      this may be undesirable if this association is to <i>acroread</i> -- see
      the notes in the explanation of the <b>-pvc</b> option.]
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    On OS-X the default is changed to &quot;open %S&quot;, which results in OS-X
      starting up (and detaching) the viewer associated with the file. By
      default, for pdf files this association is to OS-X's preview, which is
      quite satisfactory.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>WARNING</b>: Problem under MS-Windows: if acroread is used as the pdf
      previewer, and it is actually viewing a pdf file, the pdf file cannot be
      updated. Thus makes acroread a bad choice of previewer if you use
      <i>latexmk</i>'s previous-continuous mode (option <b>-pvc</b>) under
      MS-windows. This problem does not occur if, for example, SumatraPDF or
      gsview is used to view pdf files.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>Important note</b>: Normally you will want to have a previewer run
      detached, so that <i>latexmk</i> doesn't wait for the previewer to
      terminate before continuing its work. So normally you should prefix the
      command by &quot;start &quot;, which flags to <i>latexmk</i> that it
      should do the detaching of the previewer itself (by whatever method is
      appropriate to the operating system). But sometimes letting <i>latexmk</i>
      do the detaching is not appropriate (for a variety of non-trivial
      reasons), so you should put the &quot;start &quot; bit in yourself,
      whenever it is needed.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Arranging to use a command to get a previewer explicitly updated requires

    <br/>
     $pdf_previewer = &quot;start xpdf -remote %R %O %S&quot;;

     $pdf_update_command = &quot;xpdf -remote %R -reload&quot;;

    The first setting arranges for the xpdf program to be used in its

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CUSTOM_DEPENDENCIES"><a class="selflink" href="#CUSTOM_DEPENDENCIES">CUSTOM
  DEPENDENCIES</a></h1>
In any RC file a set of custom dependencies can be set up to convert a file with
  one extension to a file with another. An example use of this would be to allow
  <i>latexmk</i> to convert a <i>.fig</i> file to <i>.eps</i> to be included in
  the <i>.tex</i> file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The old method of configuring <i>latexmk</i> was to directly manipulate the
  <b>@cus_dep_list</b> array that contains information defining the custom
  dependencies. This method still works. But now there are subroutines that
  allow convenient manipulations of the custom dependency list. These are
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 add_cus_dep( fromextension, toextension, must, subroutine )
<br/>
 remove_cus_dep( fromextension, toextension )
<br/>
 show_cus_dep()
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The custom dependency is a list of rules, each of which is specified as follow:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>from extension:</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The extension of the file we are converting from (e.g.
      &quot;fig&quot;). It is specified without a period.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>to extension:</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The extension of the file we are converting to (e.g.
      &quot;eps&quot;). It is specified without a period.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>must:</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If non-zero, the file from which we are converting
      <b>must</b> exist, if it doesn't exist <i>latexmk</i> will give an error
      message and exit unless the <b>-f</b> option is specified. If <i>must</i>
      is zero and the file we are converting from doesn't exist, then no action
      is taken.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>function:</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The name of the subroutine that <i>latexmk</i> should call
      to perform the file conversion. The first argument to the subroutine is
      the base name of the file to be converted without any extension. The
      subroutines are declared in the syntax of <i>Perl</i>. The function should
      return 0 if it was successful and a nonzero number if it failed.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is invoked whenever <i>latexmk</i> detects that a run of latex/pdflatex needs
  to read a file, like a graphics file, whose extension is the to-extension of a
  custom dependency. Then <i>latexmk</i> examines whether a file exists with the
  same name, but with the corresponding from-extension, as specified in the
  custom-dependency rule. If it does, then whenever the destination file (the
  one with the to-extension) is out-of-date with respect to the corresponding
  source file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To make the new destination file, the <i>Perl</i> subroutine specified in the
  rule is invoked, with an argument that is the base name of the files in
  question. Simple cases just involve a subroutine invoking an external program;
  this can be done by following the templates below, even by those without
  knowledge of the <i>Perl</i> programming language. Of course, experts could do
  something much more elaborate.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
One other item in each custom-dependency rule labeled &quot;must&quot; above
  specifies how the rule should be applied when the source file fails to exist.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A simple and typical example of code in an initialization rcfile is
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 add_cus_dep( 'fig', 'eps', 0, 'fig2eps' );
<br/>
 sub fig2eps {
<br/>
 system( &quot;fig2dev -Leps \&quot;$_[0].fig\&quot;
  \&quot;$_[0].eps\&quot;&quot; );
<br/>
 }
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The first line adds a custom dependency that converts a file with extension
  &quot;fig&quot;, as created by the xfig program, to an encapsulated postscript
  file, with extension &quot;eps&quot;. The remaining lines define a subroutine
  that carries out the conversion. If a rule for converting &quot;fig&quot; to
  &quot;eps&quot; files already exists (e.g., from a previously read-in
  initialization file), the <i>latexmk</i> will delete this rule before making
  the new one.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Suppose <i>latexmk</i> is using this rule to convert a file
  &quot;figure.fig&quot; to &quot;figure.eps&quot;. Then it will invoke the
  fig2eps subroutine defined in the above code with a single argument
  &quot;figure&quot;, which is the basename of each of the files (possibly with
  a path component). This argument is referred to by <i>Perl</i> as $_[0]. In
  the example above, the subroutine uses the <i>Perl</i> command system to
  invoke the program fig2dev. The double quotes around the string are a
  <i>Perl</i> idiom that signify that each string of the form of a variable
  name, $_[0] in this case, is to be substituted by its value.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the return value of the subroutine is non-zero, then <i>latexmk</i> will
  assume an error occurred during the execution of the subroutine. In the above
  example, no explicit return value is given, and instead the return value is
  the value returned by the last (and only) statement, i.e., the invocation of
  system, which returns the value 0 on success.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you use pdflatex instead of latex, then you will probably prefer to convert
  your graphics files to pdf format, in which case you would replace the above
  code in an initialization file by
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 add_cus_dep( 'fig', 'pdf, 0, 'fig2pdf' );
<br/>
 sub fig2pdf {
<br/>
 system( &quot;fig2dev -Lpdf \&quot;$_[0].fig\&quot;
  \&quot;$_[0].pdf\&quot;&quot; );
<br/>
 }
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Note 1:</b> In the command lines given in the system commands in the above
  examples, double quotes have been inserted around the file names (implemented
  by '\&quot;' in the Perl language). They immunize the running of the program
  against special characters in filenames. Very often these quotes are not
  necessary, i.e., they can be omitted. But it is normally safer to keep them
  in. Even though the rules for quoting vary between operating systems, command
  shells and individual pieces of software, the quotes in the above examples do
  not cause problems in the cases I have tested.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Note 2:</b> One case in which the quotes are important is when the files are
  in a subdirectory and your operating system is Microsoft Windows. Then the
  separator character for directory components can be either a forward slash '/'
  or Microsoft's more usual backward slash &#x00B4;\'. Forward slashes are
  generated by latexmk, to maintain its sanity from software like MiKTeX that
  mixes both directory separators; but their correct use normally requires
  quoted filenames. (See a log file from a run of MiKTeX (at least in v. 2.9)
  for an example of the use of both directory separators.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you have some general custom dependencies defined in the system or user
  initialization file, you may find that for a particular project they are
  undesirable. So you might want to delete the unneeded ones. For example, you
  remove any &quot;fig&quot; to &quot;eps&quot; rule by the line
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 remove_cus_dep( 'fig', 'eps' );
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you have complicated sets of custom dependencies, you may want to get a
  listing of the custom dependencies. This is done by using the line
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 show_cus_dep();
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
in an initialization file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Another example of a custom dependency overcomes a limitation of <i>latexmk</i>
  concerning index files. The only index-file conversion built-in to
  <i>latexmk</i> is from an &quot;.idx&quot; file written on one run of
  latex/pdflatex to an &quot;.ind&quot; file to be read in on a subsequent run.
  But with the index.sty package you can create extra indexes with extensions
  that you configure. <i>Latexmk</i> does not know how to deduce the extensions
  from the information it has. But you can easily write a custom dependency. For
  example if your latex file uses the command
  &quot;\newindex{special}{ndx}{nnd}{Special index}&quot; you will need to
  convert files with the extension <i>.ndx</i> to <i>.nnd</i>. The following
  lines in an initialization RC file will cause this to happen:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 add_cus_dep('ndx', 'nnd', 0, 'makendx2nnd');
<br/>
 sub makendx2nnd {
<br/>
 system( &quot;makeindex -o \&quot;$_[0].nnd\&quot;
  \&quot;$_[0].ndx\&quot;&quot; );
<br/>
 }
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
(You will need to modify this code if you use filenames with spaces in them, to
  provide correct quoting of the filenames.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Those of you with experience with Makefiles, will undoubtedly be concerned that
  the <i>.ndx</i> file is written during a run of latex/pdflatex and is always
  later than the <i>.nnd</i> last read in. Thus the <i>.nnd</i> appears to be
  perpetually out-of-date. This situation, of circular dependencies, is endemic
  to latex, and <i>latexmk</i> in its current version works correctly with
  circular dependencies. It examines the contents of the files (by use of an md5
  checksum), and only does a remake when the file contents have actually
  changed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Of course if you choose to write random data to the <i>.nnd</i> (or and
  <i>.aux</i> file, etc) that changes on each new run, then you will have a
  problem. For real experts: See the <i>%hash_cal_ignore_pattern</i> if you have
  to deal with such problems.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Glossaries can be dealt with similarly.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OLD_METHOD_OF_DEFINING_CUSTOM_DEPENDENCIES"><a class="selflink" href="#OLD_METHOD_OF_DEFINING_CUSTOM_DEPENDENCIES">OLD
  METHOD OF DEFINING CUSTOM DEPENDENCIES</a></h1>
In previous versions of <i>latexmk</i>, the only method of defining custom
  dependencies was to directly manipulate the table of custom dependencies. This
  is contained in the <b>@cus_dep_list</b> array. It is an array of strings, and
  each string in the array has four items in it, each separated by a space, the
  from-extension, the to-extension, the &quot;must&quot; item, and the name of
  the subroutine for the custom dependency. These were all defined above.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An example of the old method of defining custom dependencies is as follows. It
  is the code in an RC file to ensure automatic conversion of <i>.fig</i> files
  to <i>.eps</i> files:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 push @cus_dep_list, &quot;fig eps 0 fig2eps&quot;;
<br/>
 sub fig2eps {
<br/>
 system( &quot;fig2dev -Lps \&quot;$_[0].fig\&quot;
  \&quot;$_[0].eps\&quot;&quot; );
<br/>
 }
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This method still works, and is equivalent to the earlier code using the
  add_cus_dep subroutine, except that it doesn't delete any previous
  custom-dependency for the same conversion. So the new method is preferable.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USING_latexmk_WITH_make"><a class="selflink" href="#USING_latexmk_WITH_make">USING
  <i>latexmk</i> WITH <i>make</i></a></h1>
This section is targeted only at advanced users who use the <i>make</i> program
  for complex projects, as for software development, with the dependencies
  specified by a Makefile.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Now the basic task of <i>latexmk</i> is to run the appropriate programs to make
  a viewable version of a LaTeX document. However, the usual <i>make</i> program
  is not suited to this purpose for at least two reasons. First is that the use
  of LaTeX involves circular dependencies (e.g., via .aux files), and these
  cannot be handled by the standard <i>make</i> program. Second is that in a
  large document the set of source files can change quite frequently,
  particularly with included graphics files; in this situation keeping a
  Makefile manually updated is inappropriate and error-prone, especially when
  the dependencies can be determined automatically. <i>Latexmk</i> solves both
  of these problems robustly.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Thus for many standard LaTeX documents <i>latexmk</i> can be used by itself
  without the <i>make</i> program. In a complex project it simply needs to be
  suitably configured. A standard configuration would be to define custom
  dependencies to make graphics files from their source files (e.g., as created
  by the <i>xfig</i> program). Custom dependencies are <i>latexmk</i>'s
  equivalent of pattern rules in Makefiles.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Nevertheless there are projects for which a Makefile is appropriate, and it is
  useful to know how to use <i>latexmk</i> from a Makefile. A typical example
  would be to generate documentation for a software project. Potentially the
  interaction with the rest of the rules in the Makefile could be quite
  complicated, for example if some of the source files for a LaTeX document are
  generated by the project's software.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In this section, I give a couple of examples of how <i>latexmk</i> can be
  usefully invoked from a Makefile. The examples use specific features of
  current versions of GNU <i>make</i>, which is the default on both linux and
  OS-X systems. They may need modifications for other versions of <i>make</i>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The simplest method is simply to delegate all the relevant tasks to
  <i>latexmk</i>, as is suitable for a straightforward LaTeX document. For this
  a suitable Makefile is like
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 .PHONY : FORCE_MAKE
<br/>
 all : try.pdf
<br/>
 %.pdf : %.tex FORCE_MAKE
<br/>
 latexmk -pdf -dvi- -ps- $&lt;
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
(Note: the last line must be introduced by a tab for the Makefile to function
  correctly!) Naturally, if making try.pdf from its associated LaTeX file
  try.tex were the only task to be performed, a direct use of <i>latexmk</i>
  without a Makefile would normally be better. The benefit of using a Makefile
  for a LaTeX document would be in a larger project, where lines such as the
  above would be only be a small part of a larger Makefile.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The above example has a pattern rule for making a .pdf file from a .tex file,
  and it is defined to use latexmk in the obvious way. There is a conventional
  default target named &quot;all&quot;, with a prerequisite of try.pdf. So when
  <i>make</i> is invoked, by default it makes try.pdf. The only complication is
  that there may be many source files beyond try.tex, but these aren't specified
  in the Makefile, so changes in them will not by themselves cause
  <i>latexmk</i> to be invoked. Instead, the pattern rule is equipped with a
  &quot;phony&quot; prerequisite FORCE_MAKE; this has the effect of causing the
  rule to be always out-of-date, so that <i>latexmk</i> is always run. It is
  <i>latexmk</i> that decides whether any action is needed, e.g., a rerun of
  <i>pdflatex</i>. Effectively the Makefile delegates all decisions to
  <i>latexmk</i>, while <i>make</i> has no knowledge of the list of source files
  except for primary LaTeX file for the document. If there are, for example,
  graphics files to be made, these must be made by custom dependencies
  configured in <i>latexmk</i>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
But something better is needed in more complicated situations, for example, when
  the making of graphics files needs to be specified by rules in the Makefile.
  To do this, one can use a Makefile like the following:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 TARGETS = document1.pdf document2.pdf
<br/>
 DEPS_DIR = .deps
<br/>
 LATEXMK = latexmk -recorder -use-make -deps \
<br/>
 -e 'warn qq(In Makefile, turn off custom dependencies\n);' \
<br/>
 -e '@cus_dep_list = ();' \
<br/>
 -e 'show_cus_dep();'
<br/>
 all : $(TARGETS)
<br/>
 $(foreach file,$(TARGETS),$(eval -include $(DEPS_DIR)/$(file)P))
<br/>
 $(DEPS_DIR) :
<br/>
 mkdir $@
<br/>
 %.pdf : %.tex
<br/>
 if [ ! -e $(DEPS_DIR) ]; then mkdir $(DEPS_DIR); fi
<br/>
 $(LATEXMK) -pdf -dvi- -ps- -deps-out=$(DEPS_DIR)/$@P $&lt;
<br/>
 %.pdf : %.fig
<br/>
 fig2dev -Lpdf $&lt; $@
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
(Again, the lines containing the commands for the rules should be started with
  tabs.) This example was inspired by how GNU <i>automake</i> handles automatic
  dependency tracking of C source files.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
After each run of latexmk, dependency information is put in a file in the .deps
  subdirectory. The Makefile causes these dependency files to be read by
  <i>make</i>, which now has the full dependency information for each target
  .pdf file. To make things less trivial it is specificed that two files
  document1.pdf and document2.pdf are the targets. The dependency files are
  .deps/document1.pdfP and .deps/document2.pdfP.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There is now no need for the phony prerequisite for the rule to make .pdf files
  from .tex files. But I have added a rule to make .pdf files from .fig files
  produced by the <i>xfig</i> program; these are commonly used for graphics
  insertions in LaTeX documents. <i>Latexmk</i> is arranged to output a
  dependency file after each run. It is given the <b>-recorder</b> option, which
  improves its detection of files generated during a run of <i>pdflatex</i>;
  such files should not be in the dependency list. The <b>-e</b> options are
  used to turn off all custom dependencies, and to document this. Instead the
  <b>-use-make</b> is used to delegate the making of missing files to
  <i>make</i> itself.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Suppose in the LaTeX file there is a command \includegraphics{graph}, and an
  <i>xfig</i> file &quot;graph.fig&quot; exists. On a first run, <i>pdflatex</i>
  reports a missing file, named &quot;graph&quot;. <i>Latexmk</i> succeeds in
  making &quot;graph.pdf&quot; by calling &quot;make graph.pdf&quot;, and after
  completion of its work, it lists &quot;fig.pdf&quot; among the dependents of
  the file <i>latexmk</i> is making. Then let &quot;fig.fig&quot; be updated,
  and then let <i>make</i> be run. <i>Make</i> first remakes
  &quot;fig.pdf&quot;, and only then reruns <i>latexmk</i>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Thus we now have a method by which all the subsidiary processing is delegated to
  <i>make</i>.

Sometimes a viewer (gv) tries to read an updated .ps or .pdf file after its
  creation is started but before the file is complete. Work around: manually
  refresh (or reopen) display. Or use one of the other previewers and update
  methods.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
(The following isn't really a bug, but concerns features of previewers.) Preview
  continuous mode only works perfectly with certain previewers: Xdvi on
  UNIX/LINUX works for dvi files. Gv on UNIX/LINUX works for both postscript and
  pdf. Ghostview on UNIX/LINUX needs a manual update (reopen); it views
  postscript and pdf. Gsview under MS-Windows works for both postscript and pdf,
  but only reads the updated file when its screen is refreshed. Acroread under
  UNIX/LINUX views pdf, but the file needs to be closed and reopened to view an
  updated version. Under MS-Windows, acroread locks its input file and so the
  pdf file cannot be updated. (Remedy: configure <i>latexmk</i> to use
  <i>sumatrapdf</i> instead.)
