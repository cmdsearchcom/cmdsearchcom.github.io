<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ppmfade - generate a transition between two image files
using special effects</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ppmfade [-f first.ppm] [-l last.ppm] [-mix|-spread|-shift|
-relief|-oil|-edge|-bentley|-block] [-base name]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppmfadegenerates a transition
between either two input images or between one input image
and black. You can use the 30 intermediate images generated
to show a smooth transition <br>
between segments of a movie. The input and output images are
in the PPM format. If you specify both input images, they
should both be the same size. If you want to fade from <br>
black to an image, specify only the last image. If you want
to fade from an image to black, specify only the first
image. ppmfade names the resulting image files
base.nnnn.ppm, <br>
where nnnn is a number varying between 0001 and 0030 and
base is what you specify with via the -base option (default
fade).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another way to convert by steps
from one image to another is morphing. You can use xmorph to
do that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f first.ppm <br>
This is the image file (PPM format) to be used at the
beginning of the transition. If you don&rsquo;t specify
this, the fade will start from black.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l last.ppm <br>
This is the image file (PPM format) to be used at the ending
of the transition. If you don&rsquo;t specify this, the fade
will end with black.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mix The two images are
superimposed with the brightness of the first image
decreasing from full to none and the brightness of the final
image increasing from none to full. <br>
The transition is quadratic in brightness with faster
transition in the beginning and slower at the end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-spread <br>
The pixels in the first image will be moved (spread) further
and further from their original location and then moved into
the proper location in the final image. This is <br>
the default transition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-shift The pixels in the first
image will be shifted further and further horizontally from
their original location and then moved into the proper
location in the final image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-relief <br>
The first image is faded to a Laplacian relief filtered
version of the first image. This is then faded to a
Laplacian relief filtered version of the second image and
<br>
finally faded to the final image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-oil The first image is faded to
an &rsquo;oil transfer&rsquo; version of the first image.
This is then faded to an &rsquo;oil transfer&rsquo; version
of the second image and finally faded to the <br>
final image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-edge The first image is faded
to an edge detected version of the first image. This is then
faded to an edge detected version of the second image and
finally faded to the final <br>
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bentley <br>
The first image is faded to a &rsquo;Bentley Effect&rsquo;
version of the first image. This is then faded to a
&rsquo;Bentley Effect&rsquo; version of the second image and
finally faded to the <br>
final image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-block The first image is
defocused to small blocks. The small blocks are converted to
match a defocused version of the last image. The block
version of the last image is then <br>
focused to the final image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-base name <br>
This forms part of the output filenames, as described
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
ppmfade -f teapot.ppm -l pyr.ppm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fade from teapot.ppm to pyr.ppm
generating fade.0001.ppm to fade.0030.ppm using the
&rsquo;spread&rsquo; transition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppmfade -l teapot.ppm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fade from black to teapot.ppm
generating fade.0001.ppm to fade.0030.ppm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppmfade -f teapot.ppm -base
end</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fade from teapot.ppm to black
generating end.0001.ppm to end.0030.ppm.</p>
