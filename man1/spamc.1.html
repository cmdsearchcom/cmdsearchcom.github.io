<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
spamc - client for spamd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
spamc [options] &lt; message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Spamc is the client half of the spamc/spamd pair. It should
be used in place of &quot;spamassassin&quot; in scripts to
process mail. It will read the mail from STDIN, and spool it
to its <br>
connection to spamd, then read the result back and print it
to STDOUT. Spamc has extremely low overhead in loading, so
it should be much faster to load than the whole <br>
spamassassin program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the README file in the spamd
directory of the SpamAssassin distribution for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
All options detailed below can be passed as command line
arguments, or be contained in a configuration file, as
described in the CONFIGURATION FILE section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the long options, a la
&quot;--long-options&quot;, are new as of SpamAssassin
3.2.0, and were not available in earlier versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --bsmtp <br>
Assume input is a single BSMTP-formatted message. In other
words, spamc will pull out everything between the DATA line
and the lone-dot line to feed to spamd, and will place <br>
the spamd output back in the same envelope (thus, any SIZE
extension in your BSMTP file will cause many problems).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --check <br>
Just check if the message is spam or not. Set process
exitcode to 1 if message is spam, 0 if not spam or
processing failure occurs. Will print score/threshold to
stdout (as <br>
ints) or 0/0 if there was an error. Combining -c and -E is a
no-op, since -c implies the behaviour of -E.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d host[,host2],
--dest=host[,host2] <br>
In TCP/IP mode, connect to spamd server on given host
(default: localhost). Several hosts can be specified if
separated by commas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If host resolves to multiple
addresses, then spamc will fail-over to the other addresses,
if the first one cannot be connected to. It will first try
all addresses of one <br>
host before it tries the next one in the list. Note that
this fail-over behaviour is incompatible with -x; if that
switch is used, fail-over will not occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e command [args], --pipe-to
command [args] <br>
Instead of writing to stdout, pipe the output to
command&rsquo;s standard input. Note that there is a very
slight chance mail will be lost here, because if the
fork-and-exec fails <br>
there&rsquo;s no place to put the mail message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this must be the LAST
command line option, as everything after the -e is taken as
arguments to the command (it&rsquo;s like rxvt or
xterm).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is not supported on
Win32 platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --exitcode <br>
Filter according to the other options, but set the process
exitcode to 1 if message is spam, 0 if not spam or
processing failure occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F /path/to/file, --config=path
<br>
Specify a configuration file to read additional command-line
flags from. See CONFIGURATION FILE below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print this help message and terminate without action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --randomize <br>
For TCP/IP sockets, randomize the IP addresses returned for
the hosts given by the -d switch. This provides for a simple
kind of load balancing. It will try only three times <br>
though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --log-to-stderr <br>
Send log messages to stderr, instead of to the syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L learn type, --learntype=type
<br>
Send message to spamd for learning. The &quot;learn
type&quot; can be either spam, ham or forget. The exitcode
for spamc will be set to 5 if the message was learned, or 6
if it was <br>
already learned, under a condition that a --no-safe-fallback
option is selected too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the &quot;spamd&quot;
must run with the &quot;--allow-tell&quot; option for this
to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C report type,
--reporttype=type <br>
Report or revoke a message to one of the configured
collaborative filtering databases. The &quot;report
type&quot; can be either report or revoke.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the &quot;spamd&quot;
must run with the &quot;--allow-tell&quot; option for this
to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port, --port=port <br>
In TCP/IP mode, connect to spamd server listening on given
port (default: 783).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --full-spam <br>
Just output the SpamAssassin report text to stdout, if the
message is spam. If the message is ham (non-spam), nothing
will be printed. The first line of the output is the <br>
message score and the threshold, in this format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">score/threshold</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --full <br>
Just output the SpamAssassin report text to stdout, for all
messages. See -r for details of the output format used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s max_size, --max-size=max_size
<br>
Set the maximum message size which will be sent to spamd --
any bigger than this threshold and the message will be
returned unprocessed (default: 500 KB). If spamc gets <br>
handed a message bigger than this, it won&rsquo;t be passed
to spamd. The maximum message size is 256 MB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The size is specified in bytes,
as a positive integer greater than 0. For example, -s
500000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--connect-retries=retries <br>
Retry connecting to spamd retries times. The default is 3
times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--retry-sleep=sleep <br>
Sleep for sleep seconds between attempts to connect to
spamd. The default is 1 second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--filter-retries=retries <br>
Retry filtering retries times if the spamd process fails
(usually times out). This differs from --connect-retries in
that it times out the transaction after the TCP <br>
connection has been established successfully. The default is
1 time (ie. one attempt and no retries).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--filter-retry-sleep=sleep <br>
Sleep for sleep seconds between failed spamd filtering
attempts. The default is 1 second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --ssl, --ssl=sslversion <br>
If spamc was built with support for SSL, encrypt data to and
from the spamd process with SSL; spamd must support SSL as
well. sslversion specifies the SSL protocol version <br>
to use, either &quot;sslv3&quot;, or &quot;tlsv1&quot;. The
default, is &quot;sslv3&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t timeout, --timeout=timeout
<br>
Set the timeout for spamc-to-spamd communications (default:
600, 0 disables). If spamd takes longer than this many
seconds to reply to a message, spamc will abort the <br>
connection and treat this as a failure to connect; in other
words the message will be returned unprocessed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n timeout,
--connect-timeout=timeout <br>
Set the timeout for spamc-to-spamd connection establishment
(default: 600, 0 disables). If spamc takes longer than this
many seconds to establish a connection to spamd, spamc <br>
will abort the connection and treat this as a failure to
connect; in other words the message will be returned
unprocessed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u username, --username=username
<br>
To have spamd use per-user-config files, run spamc as the
user whose config files spamd should load; by default the
effective user-ID is sent to spamd. If you&rsquo;re running
<br>
spamc as some other user, though, (eg. root, mail, nobody,
cyrus, etc.) then you may use this flag to override the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U socketpath, --socket=path
<br>
Connect to &quot;spamd&quot; via UNIX domain socket
socketpath instead of a TCP/IP connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is not supported on
Win32 platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Report the version of this &quot;spamc&quot; client. If
built with SSL support, an additional line will be included
noting this, like so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SpamAssassin Client version
3.0.0-rc4 <br>
compiled with SSL support (OpenSSL 0.9.7d 17 Mar 2004)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --no-safe-fallback <br>
Disables the &rsquo;safe fallback&rsquo; error-recovery
method, which passes through the unaltered message if an
error occurs. Instead, exit with an error code, and let the
MTA queue up <br>
the mails for a retry later. See also &quot;EXIT
CODES&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This also disables the TCP
fail-over behaviour from -d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X, --unavailable-tempfail <br>
When disabling &rsquo;safe fallback&rsquo; with -x, this
option will turn EX_UNAVAILABLE errors into EX_TEMPFAIL.
This may allow your MTA to defer mails with a temporary SMTP
error <br>
instead of bouncing them with a permanent SMTP error. See
also &quot;EXIT CODES&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y, --tests <br>
Just output the names of the tests hit to stdout, on one
line, separated by commas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K Perform a keep-alive check of
spamd, instead of a full message check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Use gzip compression to
compress the mail message sent to &quot;spamd&quot;. This is
useful for long-distance use of spamc over the internet.
Note that this relies on &quot;zlib&quot; being <br>
installed on the &quot;spamc&quot; client side, and the
&quot;Compress::Zlib&quot; perl module on the server side;
an error will be returned otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--headers <br>
Perform a scan, but instead of allowing any part of the
message (header and body) to be rewritten, limit rewriting
to only the message headers. This is much more efficient in
<br>
bandwidth usage, since the response message transmitted back
from the spamd server will not include the body.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this only makes sense
if you are using &quot;report_safe 0&quot; in the scanning
configuration on the remote end; with &quot;report_safe
1&quot;, it is likely to result in corrupt <br>
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
The above command-line switches can also be loaded from a
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the file is
similar to the SpamAssassin rules files; blank lines and
lines beginning with &quot;#&quot; are ignored. Any
space-separated words are considered additions to <br>
the command line, and are prepended. Newlines are treated as
equivalent to spaces. Existing command line switches will
override any settings in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -F switch is specified,
that file will be used. Otherwise, &quot;spamc&quot; will
attempt to load spamc.conf in &quot;SYSCONFDIR&quot;
(default: /etc/mail/spamassassin). If that file
doesn&rsquo;t <br>
exist, and the -F switch is not specified, no configuration
file will be read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># spamc global configuration
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># connect to
&quot;server.example.com&quot;, port 783 <br>
-d server.example.com <br>
-p 783</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># max message size for scanning
= 350k <br>
-s 350000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODES <br>
By default, spamc will use the &rsquo;safe fallback&rsquo;
error recovery method. That means, it will always exit with
an exit code of 0, even if an error was encountered. If any
error <br>
occurrs, it will simply pass through the unaltered
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -c and -E options modify
this; instead, spamc will use an exit code of 1 if the
message is determined to be spam.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one of the &quot;-x&quot;,
&quot;-L&quot; or &quot;-C&quot; options are specified,
&rsquo;safe fallback&rsquo; will be disabled, and certain
error conditions related to communication between spamc and
spamd will <br>
result in an error code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exit codes used are as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EX_USAGE 64 command line usage
error <br>
EX_DATAERR 65 data format error <br>
EX_NOINPUT 66 cannot open input <br>
EX_NOUSER 67 addressee unknown <br>
EX_NOHOST 68 host name unknown <br>
EX_UNAVAILABLE 69 service unavailable <br>
EX_SOFTWARE 70 internal software error <br>
EX_OSERR 71 system error (e.g., can&rsquo;t fork) <br>
EX_OSFILE 72 critical OS file missing <br>
EX_CANTCREAT 73 can&rsquo;t create (user) output file <br>
EX_IOERR 74 input/output error <br>
EX_TEMPFAIL 75 temp failure; user is invited to retry <br>
EX_PROTOCOL 76 remote error in protocol <br>
EX_NOPERM 77 permission denied <br>
EX_CONFIG 78 configuration error</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The EX_TOOBIG error level is
never used. If spamc receives a message <br>
that is too big, the exit code will be 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EX_TOOBIG 98 message was too big
to process (see --max-size)</p>
