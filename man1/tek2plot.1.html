<p>TEK2PLOT(1) GNU Plotting Utilities TEK2PLOT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tek2plot - translate Tektronix files to other graphics
formats</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tek2plot [ options ] [ files ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tek2plot translates Tektronix graphics files to other
formats, or displays them on an X Window System display. The
output format is specified with the -T option. The possible
<br>
output formats are the same as those supported by graph(1),
plot(1), pic2plot(1), and plotfont(1). If an output file is
produced, it is written to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options and file names may be
interspersed on the command line, but the options are
processed before the file names are read. If -- is seen, it
is interpreted as the end of the <br>
options. If no file names are specified, or the file name -
is encountered, the standard input is read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
General Options <br>
-T type <br>
--output-format type <br>
Select type as the output format. It may be &quot;X&quot;,
&quot;png&quot;, &quot;pnm&quot;, &quot;gif&quot;,
&quot;svg&quot;, &quot;ai&quot;, &quot;ps&quot;,
&quot;cgm&quot;, &quot;fig&quot;, &quot;pcl&quot;,
&quot;hpgl&quot;, &quot;regis&quot;, &quot;tek&quot;, or
&quot;meta&quot; (the default). These <br>
refer respectively to the X Window System, PNG (Portable
Network Graphics) format, portable anymap format
(PBM/PGM/PPM), a pseudo-GIF format that does not use LZW
encod&acirc; <br>
ing, the new XML-based Scalable Vector Graphics format, the
format used by Adobe Illustrator, Postscript or Encapsulated
Postscript (EPS) that can be edited with idraw(1), <br>
CGM format (by default, confirming to the WebCGM profile),
the format used by the xfig(1) drawing editor, the
Hewlett-Packard PCL 5 printer language, the Hewlett-Packard
<br>
Graphics Language, ReGIS graphics format (which can be
displayed by the dxterm(1) terminal emulator or by a VT330
or VT340 terminal), Tektronix format itself, and device-
<br>
independent GNU metafile format. Unless type is
&quot;X&quot;, an output file is produced and written to
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Omitting the -T option is
equivalent to specifying -T meta. GNU metafile format may be
translated to other formats with plot(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p n <br>
--page-number n <br>
Output only page number n, within the Tektronix file or
sequence of Tektronix files that is being translated. n must
be a non-negative integer, since a Tektronix file may <br>
consist of one or more pages, numbered beginning with
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default behavior if the -p
option is not used is to output all nonempty pages in
succession. For example, tek2plot -T X displays each
Tektronix page in its own X win&acirc; <br>
dow. If the -T png, -T pnm, -T gif, -T ai, or -T fig option
is used, the default behavior is to output only the first
nonempty Tektronix page, since files in those output <br>
formats contain only a single page of graphics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most Tektronix files consist of
either one page (page #0) or two pages (an empty page #0,
and page #1). Tektronix files produced by the GNU plotting
utilities (e.g., by <br>
graph -T tek) are normally of the latter sort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F name <br>
--font-name name <br>
Use the font name for rendering the native Textronix fonts,
if it is available. The default font is &quot;Courier&quot;
except for tek2plot -T png, tek2plot -T pnm, tek2plot -T
<br>
gif, tek2plot -T hpgl, tek2plot -T regis, and tek2plot -T
tek, for which it is &quot;HersheySerif&quot;. A list of
available fonts can be obtained with the --help-fonts option
(see <br>
below). If a font outside the Courier family is used, the
--position-chars option (see below) should probably be
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -F option is useful only if
you have a Tektronix file that draws text using native
Tektronix fonts. Tektronix files produced by the GNU
plotting utilities (e.g., by <br>
graph -T tek) do not use native Tektronix fonts: they use
Hershey vector fonts instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W line_width <br>
--line-width line_width <br>
Set the width of lines, as a fraction of the width of the
display, to be line_width. A negative value means that a
default value should be used. This value is format- <br>
dependent. The interpretation of zero line width is also
format-dependent (in some output formats, a zero-width line
is the thinnest line that can be drawn; in others, a <br>
zero-width line is invisible).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bg-color name <br>
Set the color used for the background to be name. This is
relevant only to tek2plot -T X, tek2plot -T png, tek2plot -T
pnm, tek2plot -T gif, tek2plot -T svg, tek2plot -T <br>
cgm, and tek2plot -T regis. An unrecognized name sets the
color to the default, which is &quot;white&quot;. The
environment variable BG_COLOR can equally well be used to
specify <br>
the background color. If the -T svg or -T cgm option is
used, an output file without a background may be produced by
setting the background color to &quot;none&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -T png or -T gif option
is used, a transparent PNG file or a transparent pseudo-GIF,
respectively, may be produced by setting the
TRANSPARENT_COLOR environment <br>
variable to the name of the background color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bitmap-size bitmap_size <br>
Set the size of the graphics display in which the plot will
be drawn, in terms of pixels, to be bitmap_size. The default
is &quot;570x570&quot;. This is relevant only to plot -T
<br>
X, plot -T png, plot -T pnm, and plot -T gif. If you choose
a rectangular (non-square) window size, the fonts in the
plot will be scaled anisotropically, i.e., by differ&acirc;
<br>
ent factors in the horizontal and vertical directions. For
plot -T X, this requires an X11R6 display. Any font that
cannot be scaled in this way will be replaced by a <br>
default scalable font, such as the vector font
&quot;HersheySerif&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment variable
BITMAPSIZE can equally well be used to specify the window
size. For backward compatibility, the X resource
Xplot.geometry may be used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--emulate-color option <br>
If option is yes, replace each color in the output by an
appropriate shade of gray. This is seldom useful, except
when using &lsquo; tek2plot -T pcl to prepare output for a
PCL <br>
5 device. (Many monochrome PCL 5 devices, such as monochrome
LaserJets, do a poor job of emulating color on their own.)
You may equally well request color emulation by <br>
setting the environment variable EMULATE_COLOR to
&quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-line-length
max_line_length <br>
Set the maximum number of points that a polygonal line may
contain, before it is flushed out, to be max_line_length. If
this flushing occurs, the polygonal line will be <br>
split into two or more sub-lines, though the splitting
should not be noticeable. The default value of
max_line_length is 500.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reason for splitting long
polygonal lines is that some display devices (e.g., old
Postscript printers and HP-GL pen plotters) have limited
buffer sizes. The environ&acirc; <br>
ment variable MAX_LINE_LENGTH can also be used to specify
the maximum line length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--page-size pagesize <br>
Set the size of the page on which the plot will be
positioned. This is relevant only to tek2plot -T svg,
tek2plot -T ai, tek2plot -T ps, tek2plot -T cgm, tek2plot -T
fig, <br>
tek2plot -T pcl, and tek2plot -T hpgl. The default is
&quot;letter&quot;, which means an 8.5 inch by 11 inch page.
Any ISO page size in the range
&quot;a0&quot;...&quot;a4&quot; or ANSI page size in <br>
the range &quot;a&quot;...&quot;e&quot; may be specified
(&quot;letter&quot; is an alias for &quot;a&quot; and
&quot;tabloid&quot; is an alias for &quot;b&quot;).
&quot;legal&quot; and &quot;ledger&quot; are recognized page
sizes also. The environ&acirc; <br>
ment variable PAGESIZE can equally well be used to specify
the page size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The graphics display in which
the plot is drawn will be a square region that would occupy
nearly the full width of the specified page. An alternative
size for the graph&acirc; <br>
ics display can be specified. For example, the page size
could be specified as
&quot;letter,xsize=4in,ysize=6in&quot;, or
&quot;a4,xsize=5.0cm,ysize=100mm&quot;. For all of the above
except <br>
tek2plot -T hpgl, the graphics display will, by default, be
centered on the page. For all of the above except tek2plot
-T svg and tek2plot -T cgm, the graphics display <br>
may be repositioned manually, by specifying the location of
its lower left corner, relative to the lower left corner of
the page. For example, the page size could be <br>
specified as &quot;letter,xorigin=2in,yorigin=3in&quot;, or
&quot;a4,xorigin=0.5cm,yorigin=0.5cm&quot;. It is also
possible to specify an offset vector. For example, the page
size could be <br>
specified as &quot;letter,xoffset=1in&quot;, or
&quot;letter,xoffset=1in,yoffset=1.2in&quot;, or
&quot;a4,yoffset=-1cm&quot;. In SVG format and WebCGM format
it is possible to specify the size of the <br>
graphics display, but not its position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pen-color name <br>
Set the pen color to be name. An unrecognized name sets the
pen color to the default, which is &quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--position-chars <br>
Position the characters in each text string individually. If
the text font is not a member of the Courier family, and
especially if it is not a fixed-width font, this <br>
option is recommended. It will improve the appearance of
text strings, at the price of making it difficult to edit
the output file with xfig(1), idraw(1), or Illustrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rotation angle <br>
Rotate the graphics display by angle degrees. Recognized
values are &quot;0&quot;, &quot;90&quot;, &quot;180&quot;,
and &quot;270&quot;. &quot;no&quot; and &quot;yes&quot; are
equivalent to &quot;0&quot; and &quot;90&quot;,
respectively. The envi&acirc; <br>
ronment variable ROTATION can also be used to specify a
rotation angle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-tek-fonts <br>
Use the bitmap fonts that were used on the original
Tektronix 4010/4014 terminal. This option is relevant only
to tek2plot -T X. The four relevant bitmap fonts are
dis&acirc; <br>
tributed with most versions of the GNU plotting utilities,
under the names &quot;tekfont0&quot;...&quot;tekfont3&quot;.
They can easily be installed on any modern X Window System
display. <br>
For this option to work properly, you must also select a
window size of 1024x1024 pixels, either by using the
--bitmap-size 1024x1024 option or by setting the value of
the <br>
Xplot.geometry resource. This is because bitmap fonts,
unlike the scalable fonts that tek2plot normally uses,
cannot be rescaled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is useful only if
you have a file in Tektronix format that draws text using
native Tektronix fonts. Tektronix files produced by the GNU
plotting utilities <br>
(e.g., by graph -T tek) do not use native Tektronix fonts:
they use Hershey vector fonts instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for Metafile Output <br>
The following option is relevant only if the -T option is
omitted or if -T meta is used. In this case tek2plot outputs
a GNU graphics metafile, which must be translated to other
<br>
formats with plot(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O <br>
--portable-output <br>
Output the portable (human-readable) version of GNU metafile
format, rather than a binary version (the default). The
format of the binary version is machine-dependent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Informational Options <br>
--help Print a list of command-line options, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help-fonts <br>
Print a table of available fonts, and exit. The table will
depend on which output format is specified with the -T
option. tek2plot -T X, tek2plot -T svg, tek2plot -T ai, <br>
tek2plot -T ps, tek2plot -T cgm, and tek2plot -T fig each
support the 35 standard Postscript fonts. tek2plot -T svg,
tek2plot -T pcl, and tek2plot -T hpgl support the 45 <br>
standard PCL 5 fonts, and the latter two support a number of
Hewlett-Packard vector fonts. All seven support a set of 22
Hershey vector fonts, as do tek2plot -T png, <br>
tek2plot -T pnm, tek2plot -T gif, tek2plot -T regis, and
tek2plot -T tek. tek2plot without a -T option in principle
supports any of these fonts, since its output must be <br>
translated to other formats with plot(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The plotfont(1) utility may be
used to obtain a character map of any supported font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-fonts <br>
Like --help-fonts, but lists the fonts in a single column to
facilitate piping to other programs. If no output format is
specified with the -T option, the full set of <br>
supported fonts is listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print the version number of tek2plot and the plotting
utilities package, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The environment variables BITMAPSIZE, PAGESIZE, BG_COLOR,
EMULATE_COLOR, MAX_LINE_LENGTH and ROTATION serve as backups
for the options --bitmap-size, --page-size, --bg-color, <br>
--emulate-color, --max-line-length, and --rotation,
respectively. The remaining environment variables are
specific to individual output formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tek2plot -T X, which pops up a
window on an X Window System display and draws graphics in
it, checks the DISPLAY environment variable. Its value
determines the display that will <br>
be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tek2plot -T png and tek2plot -T
gif, which produce output in PNG format and pseudo-GIF
format respectively, are affected by the INTERLACE
environment variable. If its value is <br>
&quot;yes&quot;, the output will be interlaced. Also, if the
TRANSPARENT_COLOR environment variable is set to the name of
a color, that color will be treated as transparent in the
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tek2plot -T pnm, which produces
output in portable anymap (PBM/PGM/PPM) format, is affected
by the PNM_PORTABLE environment variable. If its value is
&quot;yes&quot;, the output will be <br>
in a human-readable format rather than binary (the
default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tek2plot -T cgm, which produces
output in CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) format, is
affected by the CGM_MAX_VERSION and CGM_ENCODING environment
variables. By default, it pro&acirc; <br>
duces a binary-encoded version of CGM version 3 format. For
backward compatibility, the version number may be reduced by
setting CGM_MAX_VERSION to &quot;2&quot; or &quot;1&quot;.
Irrespective of <br>
version, the output CGM file will use the human-readable
clear text encoding if CGM_ENCODING is set to
&quot;clear_text&quot;. However, only binary-encoded CGM
files conform to the WebCGM <br>
profile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tek2plot -T pcl, which produces
PCL 5 output for Hewlett-Packard printers and plotters, is
affected by the environment variable PCL_ASSIGN_COLORS. It
should be set to &quot;yes&quot; when <br>
producing PCL 5 output for a color printer or other color
device. This will ensure accurate color reproduction by
giving the output device complete freedom in assigning
colors, <br>
internally, to its &quot;logical pens&quot;. If it is
&quot;no&quot; then the device will use a fixed set of
colored pens, and will emulate other colors by shading. The
default is &quot;no&quot; because <br>
monochrome PCL 5 devices, which are much more common than
colored ones, must use shading to emulate color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tek2plot -T hpgl, which produces
Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language output, is affected by
several environment variables. The most important is
HPGL_VERSION, which may be set to <br>
&quot;1&quot;, &quot;1.5&quot;, or &quot;2&quot; (the
default). &quot;1&quot; means that the output should be
generic HP-GL, &quot;1.5&quot; means that the output should
be suitable for the HP7550A graphics plotter and the <br>
HP758x, HP7595A and HP7596A drafting plotters (HP-GL with
some HP-GL/2 extensions), and &quot;2&quot; means that the
output should be modern HP-GL/2. If the version is
&quot;1&quot; or &quot;1.5&quot; then <br>
the only available fonts will be vector fonts, and all lines
will be drawn with a default width (the -W option will not
work).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The position of the tek2plot -T
hpgl graphics display on the page can be rotated 90 degrees
counterclockwise by setting the HPGL_ROTATE environment
variable to &quot;yes&quot;. This is <br>
not the same as the rotation obtained with the --rotation
option, since it both rotates the graphics display and
repositions its lower left corner toward another corner of
the <br>
page. Besides &quot;no&quot; and &quot;yes&quot;, recognized
values for HPGL_ROTATE are &quot;0&quot;, &quot;90&quot;,
&quot;180&quot;, and &quot;270&quot;. &quot;no&quot; and
&quot;yes&quot; are equivalent to &quot;0&quot; and
&quot;90&quot;, respectively. &quot;180&quot; and
&quot;270&quot; <br>
are supported only if HPGL_VERSION is &quot;2&quot; (the
default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, tek2plot -T hpgl
will draw with a fixed set of pens. Which pens are present
may be specified by setting the HPGL_PENS environment
variable. If HPGL_VERSION is &quot;1&quot;, <br>
the default value of HPGL_PENS is &quot;1=black&quot;; if
HPGL_VERSION is &quot;1.5&quot; or &quot;2&quot;, the
default value of HPGL_PENS is
&quot;1=black:2=red:3=green:4=yellow:5=blue:6=magenta:7=cyan&quot;.
The <br>
format should be self-explanatory. By setting HPGL_PENS you
may specify a color for any pen in the range #1...#31. All
color names recognized by the X Window System may be <br>
used. Pen #1 must always be present, though it need not be
black. Any other pen in the range #1...#31 may be
omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If HPGL_VERSION is &quot;2&quot;
then tek2plot -T hpgl will also be affected by the
environment variable HPGL_ASSIGN_COLORS. If its value is
&quot;yes&quot;, then tek2plot -T hpgl will not be <br>
restricted to the palette specified in HPGL_PENS: it will
assign colors to &quot;logical pens&quot; in the range
#1...#31, as needed. The default value is &quot;no&quot;
because other than color <br>
LaserJet printers and DesignJet plotters, not many HP-GL/2
devices allow the assignment of colors to logical pens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The drawing of visible white
lines is supported only if HPGL_VERSION is &quot;2&quot; and
the environment variable HPGL_OPAQUE_MODE is &quot;yes&quot;
(the default). If its value is &quot;no&quot; then white
<br>
lines (if any), which are normally drawn with pen #0, will
not be drawn. This feature is to accommodate older HP-GL/2
devices. HP-GL/2 pen plotters, for example, do not support
<br>
the use of pen #0 to draw visible white lines. Some older
HP-GL/2 devices may, in fact, malfunction if asked to draw
opaque objects.</p>
