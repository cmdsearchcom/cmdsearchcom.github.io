<p style="margin-top: 1em">fax send [-l] [-v] { -m | number
} filename...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fax [ receive [-v] [

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fax answer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-l use low (96 line per inch) resolution</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v display verbose messages for
debugging</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m the phone call has already
been dialed manually</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The commands make, send,
receive, view and queue may be abbreviated to their first
characters (e.g. &lsquo;&lsquo;fax q&rsquo;&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assignments of the form
VARIABLE=value may appear before the command name to
temporarily change the values of most fax script variables
(e.g. &lsquo;&lsquo;fax PAGE=A4 print
letter.001&rsquo;&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
fax provides a simple user interface to the efax(1) and
efix(1) programs. It allows you to send text or Postscript
files as faxes and receive, print or preview received faxes.
<br>
The fax help command prints a summary of the possible
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To send a fax, the original
files need to be converted from ASCII or Postscript into a
particular bit-map format (TIFF with Group 3 encoding). This
can be done automatically by <br>
the fax send command or you can use the fax make command to
do the conversion before sending the fax. The conversion
will create one file per page. These files will have the
<br>
name of the original file with the page number as an
additional suffix. For example, running fax make doc.ps on
the two-page postscript file doc.ps would generate the files
<br>
doc.ps.001 and doc.ps.002.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When sending a fax with the fax
send command you may dial the number manually and use the -m
option or you may give the phone number on the command line.
The names of the files <br>
to be sent are given on the command line, usually by using
wildcards. For example, to send a multi-page fax consisting
of the files doc.ps.001, doc.ps.002, and so on, you could
<br>
use the command fax send 555-1212 doc.ps.0* (if you had
already run the fax make command) or simply fax send
555-1212 doc.ps. If the number is busy the script will wait
and try <br>
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the fax receive command to
answer the phone and receive a fax. If a file name is
specified the received fax will be stored in files with the
given file name plus an exten&acirc; <br>
sion equal to the page number. If no options are given, the
received fax will be stored in files having a name given by
the date and time and an extension equal to the page
num&acirc; <br>
ber. For example, a fax received beginning on July 4 at
3:05:20 pm will generate files 0704150520.001,
0704150520.002, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fax print, fax view, and fax
rm commands are used to print, preview or remove received
fax files. As with the send command the file names are
usually given using wildcards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If efax has been installed for
automatic fax reception you can use the fax queue command to
check for files in the incoming spool directory. The fax
script can also be config&acirc; <br>
ured to print received faxes or e-mail them as MIME
attachments with type image/tiff-f. For convenience the fax
print, view and rm commands will first check for the named
files <br>
in this spool directory. The fax status command shows the
status of the automatic receive process once, or every t
seconds. Privileged users can use the fax stop and fax start
<br>
commands to stop and restart the fax reception daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fax answer command is used
for unattended reception of faxes. It is normally placed in
the inittab(5) or ttytab(5) file and is run automatically by
init(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -v option displays verbose
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other features of the fax script
are documented within the script:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- a directory that lets you
specify recipients by name instead of number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the fax new command to create
a simple cover page and start up a text editor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the fax makefont command
converts a Postscript font to a bit-mapped font for use in
headers or text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESOLUTION <br>
Faxes can be created at low (98 lines per inch) or high (196
lpi) resolution. Almost all fax machines will operate at
either resolution. By default files are created at high <br>
resolution but you can use the optional -l argument to
create files at low resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SESSION LOGS <br>
The modem commands and responses together with status and
error messages are written to file. If the fax is
successfully sent or received the log file is removed.
Otherwise a <br>
message is printed showing the log file name. Please send a
copy of this file when reporting problems with efax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
The fax script will &lsquo;source&rsquo; the optional shell
scripts /etc/efax.rc, ~/.efaxrc and/or ./.efaxrc before
processing command-line arguments. These files can be used
to set script <br>
variables to custom values for a particular system, user
and/or directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following files are created
in the FAXDIR spool directory when automatic fax reception
is enabled (see the fax script). DEV represents the name of
the fax modem device file <br>
in /dev (e.g. cua1 for /dev/cua1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEV.n the log file created by
the fax answer daemon with process id n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEV.log contains collected log
files for device DEV. Log files showing a termination status
of 1 (device busy) or 4 (no response from modem) are not
added to this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEV.stop created by the fax stop
command to prevent the fax daemon from starting up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>

reports to edc@cce.com. Please describe the type of modem
used and include a copy of the log file.</p>
