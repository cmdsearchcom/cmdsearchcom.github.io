<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
daemonize - run a program as a Unix daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
daemonize [-a] [-c directory] [-e stderr] [-o stdout] [-p
pidfile] [-l lockfile] [-u user] [-v] path [arg] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
daemonize runs a command as a Unix daemon. As defined in W.
Richard Stevens&rsquo; 1990 book, Unix Network Programming
(Addison-Wesley, 1990), a daemon is &acirc;a process that
executes &lsquo;in <br>
the background&rsquo; (i.e., without an associated terminal
or login shell) either waiting for some event to occur, or
waiting to perform some specified task on a periodic
basis.&acirc; Upon <br>
startup, a typical daemon program will:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Close all open file
descriptors (especially standard input, standard output and
standard error)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Change its working directory
to the root filesystem, to ensure that it doesn&rsquo;t tie
up another filesystem and prevent it from being
unmounted</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Reset its umask value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Run in the background (i.e.,
fork)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Disassociate from its process
group (usually a shell), to insulate itself from signals
(such as HUP) sent to the process group</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Ignore all terminal I/O
signals</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Disassociate from the control
terminal (and take steps not to reacquire one)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Handle any SIGCLD signals</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most programs that are designed
to be run as daemons do that work for themselves. However,
you&rsquo;ll occasionally run across one that does not. When
you must run a daemon program <br>
that does not properly make itself into a true Unix daemon,
you can use daemonize to force it to run as a true
daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a Append to the output files, rather than overwriting them
(which is the default). Only applicable if -e and/or -o are
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c directory <br>
Specifies the directory to which to change before running
the program. Defaults to &quot;/&quot;. The choice for this
option is important. The file system containing the
daemon&rsquo;s <br>
working directory cannot be unmounted while the daemon is
running. That&rsquo;s why most daemons are careful to use a
working directory on the root file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e stderr <br>
Redirect standard error to the specified file, instead of
&quot;/dev/null&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: Be careful where you
redirect the output! The file system containing the open
file cannot be unmounted as long as the file is open. For
best results, make sure <br>
that this output file is on the same file system as the
daemon&rsquo;s working directory. (See the -c option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E name=value <br>
Add an environment variable to the environment the daemon
will see. The parameter must be of the form name=value. This
parameter may be specified multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o stdout <br>
Redirect standard output to the specified file, instead of
&quot;/dev/null&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: Be careful where you
redirect the output! The file system containing the open
file cannot be unmounted as long as the file is open. For
best results, make sure <br>
that this output file is on the same file system as the
daemon&rsquo;s working directory. (See the -c option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pidfile <br>
Causes daemonize to write the numeric process ID (PID) of
the running daemon to the specified file. This option is
useful when the program being daemonized doesn&rsquo;t
create <br>
its own PID file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l lockfile <br>
Single-instance checking. Causes daemonize to ensure that no
more than one instance of the daemon is running by placing
an exclusive lock on given lockfile. If another <br>
process already has a lock on the lockfile, daemonize
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to use the
pidfile as the lock file (e.g., &quot;-p /var/run/foo -l
/var/run/foo&quot;), though typical daemons use separate
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: If the executed program
decides to close all file descriptors, the single-instance
locking will not work, since the lock depends on an open
file descriptor. (The operating <br>
system kernel removes the lock once the process holding the
lock closes the file or exits.) Normal processes that do not
daemonize themselves do not usually close all file <br>
descriptors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u user <br>
Run the program as the specified user. This option only
works if daemonize is invoked by the superuser. Note: For
obvious reasons, it&rsquo;s very dangerous to install
daemo&acirc; <br>
nize as a setuid-to-root executable. For that reason,
daemonize will refuse to run if it detects that it has been
installed that way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Cause daemonize to write
verbose messages to standard error, telling what it&rsquo;s
doing as it daemonizes the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
If the host operating system provides the daemon(3) library
routine, daemonize will use it. Otherwise, daemonize uses
its own version of daemon(3). This choice is made at
com&acirc; <br>
pile time. (BSD 4.4-derived operating systems tend to
provide their own daemon(3) routine.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FreeBSD 5.0 introduced a
daemon(1) command that is similar to, but less functional,
than daemonize.</p>
