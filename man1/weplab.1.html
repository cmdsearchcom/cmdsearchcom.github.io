<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
weplab - Wireless WEP encryption security analyzer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
weplab {-a | -r | -b | -y | -c} [options] {pcap file}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
weplab is a tool to review the security of WEP encryption in
wireless networks from an educational point of view. Several
attacks are available (including advanced statistical <br>
attacks) so it can be measured the efectiveness and minimun
requirements of each one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the other hand, weplab can
also be saw as an advanced Wireless WEP encryption cracker
that aims to support a big variety of attacks. At the moment
the attacks supported are <br>
dictionary based, bruteforce and several kind of statistical
based.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a, --analyze <br>
Analyzes specific file and gathers some statistics about the
packets that are stored per detected wlan network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --capture <br>
Uses a wlan interface to capture wep encrypted data packets.
Those captured packets will be logged into a file in pcap
format and can be used later to crack the key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --bruteforce <br>
Launches a bruteforce attack to break the key. That means
that weplab will test all possible keys in order to find the
right one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please, that this can take lot
of time depending on the key size and your processor speed.
Refer to Bruteforce method above in this document for futher
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no BSSID was specified, those
packets who belong to the same network as the first one,
will be used for the crack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --heuristics <br>
Launches an statistical attack to break the key. This is the
fastest method to crack the key if you own enough packets.
As an example a 64-bit key can be broken from <br>
100.000 packets, and a 128-bit key from 300.000 packets,
within 1-2 hours. With enough packets (lets say 900.000),
the cracking time is matter of seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several statistical attacks will
be used depending on the selected stability level (3 by
default). The processor time and number of packets required,
highly depends on the <br>
parameters used to launch the attack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This method is very advanced.
You are fully encouraged to understand it reading its
section on this document. Although it use to work fine with
default options and having, <br>
enough packets, its better to understand how it works so you
can tweak the procedure using the apropiate parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no BSSID was specified, those
packets who belong to the same network as the first one,
will be used for the crack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y, --dictionary <br>
Launches a dictionary based attack to break the key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many WEP keys are derived from
pass-phrases, entered by the network administrator. When,
this happens and you do not have enough packets to launch a
statistical attack, it <br>
is better to use a dictionary based cracking than a
bruteforce aproach.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On dictionary attack, John the
Ripper is used to generate the words that weplab will use to
derive the WEP key. So, John the Ripper must be present and
executed so its <br>
output is piped into weplabs input. In the EXAMPLES section
you will find several examples about that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no BSSID was specified, those
packets who belong to the same network as the first one,
will be used for the crack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --key &lt;key_length&gt;
<br>
Specify the key length. It can be either 64 or 128-bit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only usefull
within a cracking method, so -y, -r or -b must be used in
conjuntion with it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: 64 bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keyid &lt;key_id&gt; <br>
Specify the key id for 64-bit keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For 64-bit keys the WEP standard
specifies four possible keys, each one with a different
keyid (0-3). Usually only keyid 0 is used, but if you hit a
network with more <br>
keyids you will need to use this option to specify one of
them, and launch a separate cracking attack for each
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fcs Specify the presence of a
1 byte FCS tail on all logged packets</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Depending on your driver and how
did you set your card into monitor mode , it is possible
than logged packets have an aditional tail of 1 byte
length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Best way to find out if your
card/drivers needs this, is trying to break your own
network. This way, as you already know the key, if it does
not get cracked without FCS, <br>
try with it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only usefull
within a cracking method, so -y, -r or -b must be used in
conjuntion with it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: fcs not present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--prismheader <br>
Specify the presence of an special header called PrismHeader
on all logged packets</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Depending on your driver and how
did you set your card into monitor mode , it is possible
than logged packets have an aditional header of 144 bytes
length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to know if you need
it or not, just analyze the file with weplab. If prismheader
is not necessary it will tell you. If it is neccesary, you
will see lot of <br>
bogus BSSIDs, and no adversice about not using
prismehader</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anyway, cracking your own WEP
key is the best method to know if you need it or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only usefull
within a cracking method, so -y, -r or -b must be used in
conjuntion with it. From weplab 0.1.2 you will also need to
specify it with -a in <br>
order weplab to show you the right BSSIDs found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: prismheader not
present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bssid &lt;bssid_in_hex&gt;
<br>
Only use those packets that belongs to the selected
BSSID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BSSID must be in the form of
AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If BSSID is not specified only
those packets, that belong to the same BSSID as the first
one, will be used</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -a with your file if you
want to see all detected BSSIDs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only usefull
within a cracking method, so -y, -r or -b must be used in
conjuntion with it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: none</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--caplen &lt;amount&gt; <br>
Specify the amount of bytes that will be logged for each
packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to launch an attack
only a few number of packets (10) must be fully logged. For
the statistical attacks, only the first bytes of other
packets are needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to save diskspace when
logging packets for the statistical attack, ony the begining
of the packet should be logged</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify 0 here, the whole
packet will be logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please, notice that you will
need to capture at least 10 packets behind this amount
(fully logged packets), as they will be needed for testing
candidate keys within the <br>
cracking process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: 1500</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i &lt;interface&gt; <br>
Specifies the wireless interface that will be used to
capture packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">weplab does not set the
interface into monitor mode, so you must do it yourself
before capturing packets. Read the above to learn how to do
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --multiprocess
&lt;number&gt; <br>
Specifies the number of threads that will be launched to
take advantage of multiprocessors systems. If your
microprocessor supports hyperthreading please use the double
of <br>
number of microprocessors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, use -m 4 if you own
a dual P4 hyperthreading and -m 2 if you own a dual
processor P-II machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the moment this option does
only work on bruteforce attack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ascii <br>
When launching a bruteforce attack, it is faster to search
only ascii bytes if you are sure that the WEP key was
generating from a pass phrase using ascii
direct-mapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This way, each key byte will
only be tested in the range of 00-3F. As the key-space is
smaller the attack is faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--perc &lt;probability&gt; <br>
Specify the desired minimun probability for the statistical
attack. It means that at least enough candidate key bytes
will be tested to fit this probability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to fully understand
this option you are encouraged to read carefully the
&quot;Statistical Attacks&quot; caption, above in this
document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that the higher the
minimun probability the slowest the attack. For most cases
50% is fine. You can increase to 60 or 70% if you get the
KEY NOT FOUND with <br>
50, but never increase it to 100% because you will be
waiting for ever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stability &lt;level&gt; <br>
Specify the predefined set of statistical attacks based on
their stability level. Not all the statistical attacks are
stable (works fine) your every key. Some of them are <br>
more unstable than others. This options allows you to launch
only those attacks that meets the specified stability
level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level can be from 1 to 5. The
highest the more stable. I do not recomment you to go for
level 1 because it is too unstable to give you any results.
By default level 3 is <br>
used. It is a good idea to change into level 2 if you have
little unique IV and cracking with level 3 failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the Statistical Attack
caption, you will find a detailed list of the 17 attacks
implemented with the stability level of each one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--attacks
#attack1,#attack2,#attack2 <br>
This is the other way to select the statistical attacks that
will be launched, without using --stability parameter. Only
those attacks, whose number is selected here, will <br>
be used in the statistical procedure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of the attacks go
from 1 to 17. Please, refer to the Statistical Attacks
section for further information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debugkey &lt;key&gt; <br>
if you want to test how a set of statistical attacks works
with a known WEP key, then this parameter will give you the
oportunity to get the final result without going <br>
trhow all the possible branches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using this option you tell
weplab about the WEP key used to encrypt the packets. Only
the real branch will be followed and you will get the
candidate list for each key <br>
byte.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Outputs version information
and exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Displays command line
parameters help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
weplab does not need any special installation. It runs in
userlevel and only requires the libpcap libraries (&gt;=0.8)
to be present. For most functions weplab can be executed by
<br>
any user, however for packet capture functionality it must
be executed by root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if you are installing it from
source code distribution, the configure script should be
able to detect your proccessor type to optimize the code
specifically for your platform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At least 128 MB of free RAM
memmory are required to run FMS statistical attack in
weplab, 64 MB of free ram for capturing packets, and nothing
special for the other features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Weplab is reported to work fine
under GNU/Linux for intel, GNU/Linux for PPC and MacOSX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windows version cannot capture
packets due to the lack of a opensource method to do it, but
its other features works fine. Please read Windows Platform
section under Capture <br>
Packets caption for futher information about how to deal
with this issue under Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAPTURING PACKETS <br>
First you will need to capture 802.11b encrypted packets to
crack the wep key. The way weplab cracks the key is using
passive attacks to an already captured packet set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To capture encrypted packets in
a wireless network, your wireless card must be put in
monitor mode. The way monitor mode is set is highly
dependant on which card do you own, and <br>
which drivers are you using.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Explaining how to set monitor
mode in your card is beyond the scope of this document, and
sometimes involves patching the kernel or
&quot;hacking&quot; the drivers. As an example, the
fol&acirc; <br>
lowing steps should be done in order to set monitor mode on
a prism2 based card using wlan-ng drivers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Initialization of the card. <br>
prism2 and wlan-ng</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wlanctl-ng wlan0 lnxreq_ifstate
ifstate=enable</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wlanctl-ng wlan0 lnxreq_autojoin
ssid=any authtype=opensystem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">orinoco : nothing special</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enable the interface (wlan0 in
the example, just change to eth0 if using orinoco) <br>
ifconfig wlan0 up</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting monitor mode on desired
channel (6 in the example). <br>
prism2 and wlan-ng</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wlanctl-ng wlan0
lnxreq_wlansniff channel=06 keepwepflags=false
prismheader=false enable=true (I dont know why, but
sometimes this step must be taken twice :) )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">orinoco and iwpriv</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iwpriv eth0 monitor 2 6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a few things that must
be done regardless of the card and drivers used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The wireless card placed in
monitor mode should accept encrypted packets and mark them
as encrypted. In the example above, that&rsquo;s the purpose
of the option keepwepflags=false <br>
in third step.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The interface must be enabled
(up)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If your card is appending
prism header or fcs &quot;tail&quot; to the packets, weplab
needs to be told about it (with --fcs or --prismheader).
Determining if this is necessary for your <br>
hardware will be explained later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, to capture encrypted
packets you can either use weplab, tcpdump, or a similar
sniffer that logs packets in pcap format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To do it with weplab, just use
-c. Interface must be specified with -i</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">weplab --debug 1 -c -i wlan0
./packets.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no need to log the
entire packet, just the 802.11 header and the IV, but to
verify possible canditate keys the whole packet encrypted
payload must be present. That&rsquo;s why <br>
you must specify two files in weplab when using FMS attack.
One file must have just 10 packets with the whole payload,
and the other file contains weak packets that don&rsquo;t
need to <br>
have payload logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So, in order to save disk space
it is a good idea to log a few packets for key verification
on one file, and then just log the first bytes of all other
possible packets, to be <br>
used as possible weak packet for FMS attack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify maximun captured
bytes per packet with --caplen bytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">weplab -c -i wlan0 --debug 1
./verification_packets.logweplab -c -i wlan0 --debug 1
--caplen 100 ./weak_packets.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternately, if your disk space
is not so critical and you don&rsquo;t mind wasting a few
extra seconds on loading the file later, these two steps can
be joined into one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">weplab -c -i wlan0 --debug 1
--caplen 150 ./packets.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then this file can be used both
for verification and weak packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ANALYZING PCAP FILE <br>
Before trying to crack the key using the already captured
packets, it is a good idea to verify the file just to ensure
that the packets were logged fine, and there are enough to
<br>
perform the desired attack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">weplab --debug 1 -a
./packets.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can try with --prismheader
or --fcs, or both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">weplab --debug 1 -a --fcs
./packets.logweplab --debug 1 -a --prismheader --fcs
./packets.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As explained above, prismheader
is an special header that some cards and drivers add to all
captured packets, and fcs is an special tail added to the
captured packets by some <br>
drivers. You can determine if your card/drivers needs --fcs
or --prismheaders by using the FMS attack together with
--debugkey and a set of encrypted packets captured by your
<br>
card where the wep key is known. This is explained later in
the FMS attack section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WEP KEY CRACKING. <br>
At the moment weplab supports 2 main cracking methods:
bruteforce and FMS statistical attack. Before selecting the
cracking method, the keysize should be specified. By default
<br>
the keysize is 64. To crack a 128-bit key, you must specify
--key 128</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BRUTEFORCE CRACKING. <br>
Bruteforce cracking means testing all possible keys to find
the right one. That means that each key byte can take values
from 0 to 255. So a quick calculus will reveal that for <br>
a 64 bits key the total combinations are 2^40, so at 100.000
c/s cracking the key will take you 4100061318 seconds
maximun. 127 days working fulltime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With a 128-bit key the total
combinations possible are 2^104, so at 100.000 c/s the total
maximun amount of time will be 6520836420927105974 YEARS!! I
guess you will never try <br>
to launch a bruteforce attack to a 128-bit key. Anyway,
weplab gives you the possibility to do it ;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You will need at least 10 full
wep encrypted data captured packets in order to launch a
bruteforce attack avoiding false positives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DICTIONNARY CRACKING <br>
Guess what ? Users often use simple words as their WEP key.
The dictionnary cracking mode gives you the ability to check
if the WEP key isn&rsquo;t a so-simple-to-guess word. Using
<br>
this mode in addition to John-the-Ripper could produce some
usefull results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Weplab reads the dictionnary
words from STDIN, so if you want statistics, you want be
able to press SPACE. However, you&rsquo;ll have statistics
printed on STDOUT every 10 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dictionary cracking can use two
different modes :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default the classical
algorithm (MD5 for 128 bits keys or one of 4 keys for 40
bits keys) it is used. This mode is widely used on Access
Points to generate keys from a <br>
passphrase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively you can select
Word to key with the &quot;--attack 2&quot; option if you
want weplab to use plaintext keys with NULL bytes appended
(if needed) at the end of each word to fit <br>
the WEP key size. This second mode is used on my system when
I configure the WEP key using &quot;iwconfig eth0
s:silly&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FMS STATISTICAL ATTACK <br>
Wireless networks WEP encryption is based on RC4 algorithm.
RC4 has some weaknesses as Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir
described in 2001 with the paper &quot;Weaknesses in the Key
Schedul&acirc; <br>
ing Algorithm of RC4&quot;. The specific implementation of
the RC4 algorithm in WEP makes possible its practical use.
The initials of the authors gave it the name of FMS
statistical <br>
cryptoanalysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to make this attack
possible for breaking the encryption of wireless networks,
lots of specific data wep encrypted packets, called weak
packets, must be gathered. Soon <br>
after the paper was published, two tools appeared that
implemented the FMS attack, but the set of weak packets that
these tools use is just asmall subset of the total possible
<br>
weak packets. As a result, the attack was not as practical
to launch as it should be.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In February 2002, h1kari
released the paper &quot;Practical Exploitation of RC4
Weaknesses in WEP Environments&quot;. This describes the
problem with the set of weak packets used by exist&acirc;
<br>
ing tools and suggest several optimization in the attack
like attacking other bytes besides the first one. H1kari
created a tool called dwepcrack that implements a part of
these <br>
optimizations, and runs under *BSD. Weplab uses FMS attack
supporting the whole set of weak packets for attacking both
the first and the second byte of the encrypted payload. <br>
Also some bruteforce and smart probabilistic based decisions
are implemented within the FMS attack to make it more
powerful, especially when you dont have enough packets to
<br>
launch a straight-forward attack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But apart from that, the main
purpose of weplab is to be an educational tool to help users
understand the existing weaknesses in WEP and how can the be
used to break the encryp&acirc; <br>
tion key. Several command line parameters are implemented
with this purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, if you plan to test weplab
cracking capacity with your own wireless lan, you can use
--debugkey. By using this option you tell weplab what your
WEP key is (or at least a <br>
part of it), so weplab will skip all other branches when
searching candidate key bytes in FMS attack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NEW STATISTICAL ATTACKS <br>
New statistical attacks published on Netstumbler forum by
Korek. These new attacks make possible to crack the key with
even less than 500k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many thanks to Korek for this
information. All the credit goes to you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Example 1. Cracking using FMS attack</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You want to test the tool so you
collect 1.5M packets from your own wireless LAN. You just
want to know if weplab would be able to crack it. You can
use first --debugkey. If <br>
you are using a 128-bit key the right sintax would be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">weplab -r./packets.log
--debugkey 01:02:03:04:05:06:07:08:09:10:11:12:13 --debug 1
--key 128 ./packets.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should see the statistics
and guesses for each byte of the key so you can see the
viability of the attack. At the end you should see &quot;key
succesfully cracked&quot;. If you do not <br>
see such message, perhaps your captured packets have the FCS
tail so it will be neccesary to issue --fcs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">weplab -r./packets.log
--debugkey 01:02:03:04:05:06:07:08:09:10:11:12:13 --fcs
--debug 1 --key 128 ./packets.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now can try with just a part of
the key in debugkey. If the FMS is possible with these
packets, weplab should be able to crack the key using just
these bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">weplab -r./packets.log
--debugkey 01:02:03:04:05:06 --fcs --debug 1 --key 128
./packets.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If it works you can try reducing
the debugkey more. At the end you can try with no debugkey
at all, as if it were a real attack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 2. Cracking using
bruteforce</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To crack a 64-bit key using
normal bruteforce just issue the following command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">weplab --debug 1 --key 64
./packets.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you suspect that the key may
be in plain ascii, do this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">weplab --debug 1 --key 64
--ascii ./packets.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 3. Capturing
packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to capture packets you
have to put your wireless card in monitor mode in the right
channel. Be carefull to configure monitor mode to ignore WEP
bit. Once you have your <br>
card in monitor mode, you can capture packets using tcpdump
or weplab -c -i interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">weplab -c -i wlan0 --debug 1
--caplen 150 ./packets.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can push ENTER key at any

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 4. Analyze an existing
pcap file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Weplab can also analyze a pcap
file to the some statistics. Use -a for this purpose.
--prismheader --fcs can also be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">weplab -a --debug 1
./pcap.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 5. Cracking a 64 WEP key
using a dictionnary file with John the Ripper</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">john
-w:/path/to/my/big/dictionnaryfile -rules -stdout | weplab
