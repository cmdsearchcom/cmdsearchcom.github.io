<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
weplab is a tool to review the security of WEP encryption in wireless networks
  from an educational point of view. Several attacks are available (including
  advanced statistical attacks) so it can be measured the efectiveness and
  minimun requirements of each one.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On the other hand, weplab can also be saw as an advanced Wireless WEP encryption
  cracker that aims to support a big variety of attacks. At the moment the
  attacks supported are dictionary based, bruteforce and several kind of
  statistical based.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Please, that this can take lot of time depending on the key size and your
      processor speed. Refer to Bruteforce method above in this document for
      futher information.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

  <dt class="It-tag">-r, --heuristics</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Launches an statistical attack to break the key. This is
      the fastest method to crack the key if you own enough packets. As an
      example a 64-bit key can be broken from 100.000 packets, and a 128-bit key
      from 300.000 packets, within 1-2 hours. With enough packets (lets say
      900.000), the cracking time is matter of seconds.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Several statistical attacks will be used depending on the selected stability
      level (3 by default). The processor time and number of packets required,
      highly depends on the parameters used to launch the attack.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This method is very advanced. You are fully encouraged to understand it
      reading its section on this document. Although it use to work fine with
      default options and having, enough packets, its better to understand how
      it works so you can tweak the procedure using the apropiate parameters.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If no BSSID was specified, those packets who belong to the same network as

  <dd class="It-tag">Launches a dictionary based attack to break the key.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Many WEP keys are derived from pass-phrases, entered by the network
      administrator. When, this happens and you do not have enough packets to
      launch a statistical attack, it is better to use a dictionary based
      cracking than a bruteforce aproach.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    On dictionary attack, John the Ripper is used to generate the words that
      weplab will use to derive the WEP key. So, John the Ripper must be present
      and executed so its output is piped into weplabs input. In the EXAMPLES
      section you will find several examples about that.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

    For 64-bit keys the WEP standard specifies four possible keys, each one with
      a different keyid (0-3). Usually only keyid 0 is used, but if you hit a
      network with more keyids you will need to use this option to specify one
      of them, and launch a separate cracking attack for each one.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Best way to find out if your card/drivers needs this, is trying to break

    If you want to know if you need it or not, just analyze the file with

weplab does not need any special installation. It runs in userlevel and only
  requires the libpcap libraries (&gt;=0.8) to be present. For most functions
  weplab can be executed by any user, however for packet capture functionality
  it must be executed by root.
<div class="Pp"></div>
if you are installing it from source code distribution, the configure script
  should be able to detect your proccessor type to optimize the code
  specifically for your platform.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At least 128 MB of free RAM memmory are required to run FMS statistical attack
  in weplab, 64 MB of free ram for capturing packets, and nothing special for
  the other features.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Weplab is reported to work fine under GNU/Linux for intel, GNU/Linux for PPC and
  MacOSX.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Windows version cannot capture packets due to the lack of a opensource method to
  do it, but its other features works fine. Please read Windows Platform section
  under Capture Packets caption for futher information about how to deal with
  this issue under Windows.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CAPTURING_PACKETS"><a class="selflink" href="#CAPTURING_PACKETS">CAPTURING
  PACKETS</a></h1>
First you will need to capture 802.11b encrypted packets to crack the wep key.
  The way weplab cracks the key is using passive attacks to an already captured
  packet set.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To capture encrypted packets in a wireless network, your wireless card must be
  put in monitor mode. The way monitor mode is set is highly dependant on which
  card do you own, and which drivers are you using.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Explaining how to set monitor mode in your card is beyond the scope of this
  document, and sometimes involves patching the kernel or &quot;hacking&quot;
  the drivers. As an example, the following steps should be done in order to set
  monitor mode on a prism2 based card using wlan-ng drivers.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Initialization of the card.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">prism2 and wlan-ng

      must be taken twice :) )
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    orinoco and iwpriv
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    iwpriv eth0 monitor 2 6</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are a few things that must be done regardless of the card and drivers
  used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
1. The wireless card placed in monitor mode should accept encrypted packets and
  mark them as encrypted. In the example above, that's the purpose of the option
  keepwepflags=false in third step.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2. The interface must be enabled (up)
<div class="Pp"></div>
3. If your card is appending prism header or fcs &quot;tail&quot; to the
  packets, weplab needs to be told about it (with --fcs or --prismheader).
  Determining if this is necessary for your hardware will be explained later.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now, to capture encrypted packets you can either use weplab, tcpdump, or a
  similar sniffer that logs packets in pcap format.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To do it with weplab, just use -c. Interface must be specified with -i
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
weplab --debug 1 -c -i wlan0 ./packets.log
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There is no need to log the entire packet, just the 802.11 header and the IV,
  but to verify possible canditate keys the whole packet encrypted payload must
  be present. That's why you must specify two files in weplab when using FMS
  attack. One file must have just 10 packets with the whole payload, and the
  other file contains weak packets that don't need to have payload logged.
<div class="Pp"></div>
So, in order to save disk space it is a good idea to log a few packets for key
  verification on one file, and then just log the first bytes of all other
  possible packets, to be used as possible weak packet for FMS attack.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can specify maximun captured bytes per packet with --caplen bytes
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
weplab -c -i wlan0 --debug 1 ./verification_packets.logweplab -c -i wlan0
  --debug 1 --caplen 100 ./weak_packets.log
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Alternately, if your disk space is not so critical and you don't mind wasting a
  few extra seconds on loading the file later, these two steps can be joined
  into one.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
weplab -c -i wlan0 --debug 1 --caplen 150 ./packets.log
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Then this file can be used both for verification and weak packets.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ANALYZING_PCAP_FILE"><a class="selflink" href="#ANALYZING_PCAP_FILE">ANALYZING
  PCAP FILE</a></h1>
Before trying to crack the key using the already captured packets, it is a good
  idea to verify the file just to ensure that the packets were logged fine, and
  there are enough to perform the desired attack.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
weplab --debug 1 -a ./packets.log
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can try with --prismheader or --fcs, or both.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
weplab --debug 1 -a --fcs ./packets.logweplab --debug 1 -a --prismheader --fcs
  ./packets.log
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
As explained above, prismheader is an special header that some cards and drivers
  add to all captured packets, and fcs is an special tail added to the captured
  packets by some drivers. You can determine if your card/drivers needs --fcs or
  --prismheaders by using the FMS attack together with --debugkey and a set of
  encrypted packets captured by your card where the wep key is known. This is
  explained later in the FMS attack section.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WEP_KEY_CRACKING."><a class="selflink" href="#WEP_KEY_CRACKING.">WEP
  KEY CRACKING.</a></h1>
At the moment weplab supports 2 main cracking methods: bruteforce and FMS
  statistical attack. Before selecting the cracking method, the keysize should
  be specified. By default the keysize is 64. To crack a 128-bit key, you must
  specify --key 128
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BRUTEFORCE_CRACKING."><a class="selflink" href="#BRUTEFORCE_CRACKING.">BRUTEFORCE
  CRACKING.</a></h1>
Bruteforce cracking means testing all possible keys to find the right one. That
  means that each key byte can take values from 0 to 255. So a quick calculus
  will reveal that for a 64 bits key the total combinations are 2^40, so at
  100.000 c/s cracking the key will take you 4100061318 seconds maximun. 127
  days working fulltime.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With a 128-bit key the total combinations possible are 2^104, so at 100.000 c/s
  the total maximun amount of time will be 6520836420927105974 YEARS!! I guess
  you will never try to launch a bruteforce attack to a 128-bit key. Anyway,
  weplab gives you the possibility to do it ;)
<div class="Pp"></div>
You will need at least 10 full wep encrypted data captured packets in order to
  launch a bruteforce attack avoiding false positives.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DICTIONNARY_CRACKING"><a class="selflink" href="#DICTIONNARY_CRACKING">DICTIONNARY
  CRACKING</a></h1>
Guess what ? Users often use simple words as their WEP key. The dictionnary
  cracking mode gives you the ability to check if the WEP key isn't a
  so-simple-to-guess word. Using this mode in addition to John-the-Ripper could
  produce some usefull results.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Weplab reads the dictionnary words from STDIN, so if you want statistics, you
  want be able to press SPACE. However, you'll have statistics printed on STDOUT
  every 10 seconds.

Dictionary cracking can use two different modes :
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default the classical algorithm (MD5 for 128 bits keys or one of 4 keys for
  40 bits keys) it is used. This mode is widely used on Access Points to
  generate keys from a passphrase.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Alternatively you can select Word to key with the &quot;--attack 2&quot; option
  if you want weplab to use plaintext keys with NULL bytes appended (if needed)
  at the end of each word to fit the WEP key size. This second mode is used on
  my system when I configure the WEP key using &quot;iwconfig eth0
  s:silly&quot;.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FMS_STATISTICAL_ATTACK"><a class="selflink" href="#FMS_STATISTICAL_ATTACK">FMS
  STATISTICAL ATTACK</a></h1>
Wireless networks WEP encryption is based on RC4 algorithm. RC4 has some
  weaknesses as Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir described in 2001 with the paper
  &quot;Weaknesses in the Key Scheduling Algorithm of RC4&quot;. The specific
  implementation of the RC4 algorithm in WEP makes possible its practical use.
  The initials of the authors gave it the name of FMS statistical
  cryptoanalysis.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to make this attack possible for breaking the encryption of wireless
  networks, lots of specific data wep encrypted packets, called weak packets,
  must be gathered. Soon after the paper was published, two tools appeared that
  implemented the FMS attack, but the set of weak packets that these tools use
  is just asmall subset of the total possible weak packets. As a result, the
  attack was not as practical to launch as it should be.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In February 2002, h1kari released the paper &quot;Practical Exploitation of RC4
  Weaknesses in WEP Environments&quot;. This describes the problem with the set
  of weak packets used by existing tools and suggest several optimization in the
  attack like attacking other bytes besides the first one. H1kari created a tool
  called dwepcrack that implements a part of these optimizations, and runs under
  *BSD. Weplab uses FMS attack supporting the whole set of weak packets for
  attacking both the first and the second byte of the encrypted payload. Also
  some bruteforce and smart probabilistic based decisions are implemented within
  the FMS attack to make it more powerful, especially when you dont have enough
  packets to launch a straight-forward attack.
<div class="Pp"></div>
But apart from that, the main purpose of weplab is to be an educational tool to
  help users understand the existing weaknesses in WEP and how can the be used
  to break the encryption key. Several command line parameters are implemented
  with this purpose.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Also, if you plan to test weplab cracking capacity with your own wireless lan,
  you can use --debugkey. By using this option you tell weplab what your WEP key
  is (or at least a part of it), so weplab will skip all other branches when
  searching candidate key bytes in FMS attack.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NEW_STATISTICAL_ATTACKS"><a class="selflink" href="#NEW_STATISTICAL_ATTACKS">NEW
  STATISTICAL ATTACKS</a></h1>
New statistical attacks published on Netstumbler forum by Korek. These new
  attacks make possible to crack the key with even less than 500k.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many thanks to Korek for this information. All the credit goes to you.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
Example 1. Cracking using FMS attack
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You want to test the tool so you collect 1.5M packets from your own wireless
  LAN. You just want to know if weplab would be able to crack it. You can use
  first --debugkey. If you are using a 128-bit key the right sintax would be:
<div class="Pp"></div>
weplab -r./packets.log --debugkey 01:02:03:04:05:06:07:08:09:10:11:12:13 --debug
  1 --key 128 ./packets.log
<div class="Pp"></div>
You should see the statistics and guesses for each byte of the key so you can
  see the viability of the attack. At the end you should see &quot;key
  succesfully cracked&quot;. If you do not see such message, perhaps your
  captured packets have the FCS tail so it will be neccesary to issue --fcs
<div class="Pp"></div>
weplab -r./packets.log --debugkey 01:02:03:04:05:06:07:08:09:10:11:12:13 --fcs
  --debug 1 --key 128 ./packets.log
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now can try with just a part of the key in debugkey. If the FMS is possible with
  these packets, weplab should be able to crack the key using just these bytes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
weplab -r./packets.log --debugkey 01:02:03:04:05:06 --fcs --debug 1 --key 128
  ./packets.log
<div class="Pp"></div>
If it works you can try reducing the debugkey more. At the end you can try with
  no debugkey at all, as if it were a real attack.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can push ENTER key in any moment to get statistics of the work done.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example 2. Cracking using bruteforce
<div class="Pp"></div>
To crack a 64-bit key using normal bruteforce just issue the following command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
weplab --debug 1 --key 64 ./packets.log
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you suspect that the key may be in plain ascii, do this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
weplab --debug 1 --key 64 --ascii ./packets.log
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can push ENTER key at any moment to get statistics of the work done.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example 3. Capturing packets.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to capture packets you have to put your wireless card in monitor mode
  in the right channel. Be carefull to configure monitor mode to ignore WEP bit.
  Once you have your card in monitor mode, you can capture packets using tcpdump
  or weplab -c -i interface
<div class="Pp"></div>
weplab -c -i wlan0 --debug 1 --caplen 150 ./packets.log
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can push ENTER key at any moment to get statistics of the work done.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example 4. Analyze an existing pcap file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Weplab can also analyze a pcap file to the some statistics. Use -a for this
  purpose. --prismheader --fcs can also be used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
weplab -a --debug 1 ./pcap.log
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example 5. Cracking a 64 WEP key using a dictionnary file with John the Ripper
<div class="Pp"></div>
john -w:/path/to/my/big/dictionnaryfile -rules -stdout | weplab -y -d 1 --key 64
  capt.dump
