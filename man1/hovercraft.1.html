  tools are limiting</a></h2>
I used to do presentations with typical slideshow software, such as
  OpenOffice/LibreOffice Impress, but these tools felt restricted and limiting.
  I need to do a lot of reorganizing and moving around, and that might mean
  changing things from bullet lists to headings to text to pictures and back to
  bullet lists over again. This happens through the whole process. I might
  realize something that was just a bullet point needs to be a slide, or that a
  set of slides for time reasons need to be shortened down to bullet points.
  Much of the reorganization comes from seeing what fits on one slide and what
  does not, and how I need to pace the presentation, and to some extent even
  what kinda of pictures I can find to illustrate what I try to say, and if the
  pictures are funny or not.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Presentation software should give you complete freedom to reorganize your</b>
  <b>presentation on every level, not only by reorganizing slides.</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The solution for me and many others, is to use a text-markup language, like
  reStructuredText, Markdown or similar, and then use a tool that generates an
  HTML slide show from that.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Text-markup gives you the convenience and freedom to quickly move parts</b>
  <b>around as you like.</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
I chose <i>reStructuredText</i>, because I know it and because it has a massive
  feature set. When I read the documentations of other text-markup langages it
  was not obvious if they has the features I needed or not.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Pan,_rotate_and_zoom"><a class="selflink" href="#Pan,_rotate_and_zoom">Pan,
  rotate and zoom</a></h2>
The tools that exist to make presentations from text-markup will make slideshows
  that has a sequence of slides from left to right. But the fashion now is to
  have presentations that rotate and zoon in and out. One open source solution
  for that is <i>impress.js</i>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>With impress.js you can make modern cool presentations.</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
But impress.js requires you to write your presentation as HTML, which is
  annoying, and the markup isn't flexible enough to let you quickly reorganize
  things from bullet points to headings etc.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You also have to position each slide separately, and if you insert a new slide
  in the middle, you have to reposition all the slides that follow.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Hovercraft!"><a class="selflink" href="#Hovercraft!">Hovercraft!</a></h2>
So what I want is a tool that takes the power, flexibility and convenience of
  reStructuredText and allows me to generate pan, rotate and zoom presentations
  with impress.js, without having to manually reposition each slide if I
  reorganize a little bit of the presentation. I couldn't find one, so I made
  Hovercraft.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Hovercraft&#x2019;s power comes from the combination of
  reStructuredText&#x2019;s convenience with the cool of impress.js, together
  with a flexible and powerful solution to position the slides.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There are four ways to position slides:
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<div style="margin-left: 3.50ex;">
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Absolute positioning: You simply add X and Y coordinates to
      a slide, in pixels. Doing only this will not be fun, but someone might
      need it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Relative positioning: By specifying x and/or y with with a
      starting r, you specify the distance from the previous slide. By using
      this form of positioning you can insert a slide, and the other slides will
      just move to make space for the new slide.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Automatically: If you don&#x2019;t specify any position the
      slide will end up the same distance from the previous slide as the
      previous slide was from its previous slide. This defaults to moving 1600px
      to the right, which means that if you supply no positions at all anywhere
      in the presentation, you get the standard boring slide-to-the-left
      presentation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">4.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">With an SVG path: In this last way of positioning, you can
      take an SVG path from an SVG document and stick it into the presentation,
      and that slide + all slides following that has no explicit positioning
      will be positioned on that path. This can be a bit fiddly to use, but can
      create awesome results, such as positioning the slides as snaking Python
      or similar.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<br/>

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Hovercraft! also includes <i>impress-console</i>, a presenter console that will
  show you your notes, slide previews and the time, essential tools for any
  presentation.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USING_HOVERCRAFT!"><a class="selflink" href="#USING_HOVERCRAFT!">USING
  HOVERCRAFT!</a></h1>
You can either use Hovercraft! to generate the presentation as HTML in a target
  directory, or you can let Hovercraft! serve the presentation from its builtin
  webserver.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The latter have several benefits. One is that most webbrowsers will be very
  reluctant to open popup-windows from pages served from the file system this is
  a security measure which can be changed, but it's easier to just point the
  browser to <i>http://localhost:8000</i> instead.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The second benefit is that Hovercraft! will monitor the source files for the
  presentation, and if they are modified Hovercraft! will generate the
  presentation again automatically. That way you don't have to run Hovercraft!
  everytime you save a file, you only need to refresh the browser.

There are two templates that come with Hovercraft! One is called <b>default</b>
  and will be used unless you specify a template. This is the template you will
  use most of the time.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The second is called <b>simple</b> and it doesn't have a presenter console. This
  template is especially useful if you combine it with the <b>--skip-notes</b>
  parameter to prepare a version of your presentation to be put online.

  note on terminology</a></h2>
Traditionally a presentation is made up of slides. Calling them
  &quot;slides&quot; is not really relevant in an impress.js context, as they
  can overlap and doesn't necessarily slide. The name &quot;steps&quot; is
  better, but it's also more ambiguous. Hence impress.js uses the terms
  &quot;slide&quot; and &quot;step&quot; as meaning the same thing, and so does
  Hovercraft!
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Hovercraft!_syntax"><a class="selflink" href="#Hovercraft!_syntax">Hovercraft!
  syntax</a></h2>
Presentations are reStructuredText files. If you are reading this documentation
  from the source code, then you are looking at a reStructuredText document
  already.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
It's fairly simple, you underline headings to mark them as headings:
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<div style="margin-left: 3.50ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
This becomes a h1
=================
<div class="Pp"></div>
And this a h2
-------------
</pre>
</div>
<br/>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The different ways of underlining them doesn't mean anything, instead the order
  of them is relevant, so the first type of underline encountered in the file
  will make a level 1 heading, the second type a level 2 heading and so on. In
  this file = is used for level 1, and - for level 2.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can also mark text as <i>italic</i> or <b>bold</b>, with <b>*single
  asterixes*</b> or <b>**double asterixes**</b> respectively.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can also have bullet lists:
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<div style="margin-left: 3.50ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
* Bullet 1
<div class="Pp"></div>
  * Bullet 1.1
<div class="Pp"></div>
* Bullet 2
<div class="Pp"></div>
* Bullet 3
</pre>
</div>
<br/>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
And numbered lists:
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<div style="margin-left: 3.50ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
1. Item 1
<div class="Pp"></div>
    1.1. Item 1.1
<div class="Pp"></div>
2. Item 2
<div class="Pp"></div>
3. Item 3
</pre>
</div>
<br/>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can include images:
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<div style="margin-left: 3.50ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
.. image:: path/to/image.png
    :height: 600px
    :width: 800px
</pre>
</div>
<br/>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
As you see you can also specify height and width and loads of other
  <i>parameters</i>, but they are all optional.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
And you can mark text as being preformatted. You do that by ending the previous
  row with double colons, or have a row of double colons by itself:
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<div style="margin-left: 3.50ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
::
<div class="Pp"></div>
    This code here will be preformatted
     and shown with a  monospaced font
    and    all    spaces     preserved.
</pre>
</div>
<br/>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you want to add source code, you can use the <b>code</b> directive, and get
  syntax highlighting:
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<div style="margin-left: 3.50ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
.. code:: python
<div class="Pp"></div>
    def some_example_code(foo):
        return foo * foo
</pre>
</div>
<br/>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The syntax highlighting is done by <i>Pygments</i> and supports lots and lots of
  <i>languages</i>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You are also likely to want to put a title on the presentation. You do that by
  having a <b>.. title::</b> statement before the first slide:
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<div style="margin-left: 3.50ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
.. title:: This is the presentation title
</pre>
</div>
<br/>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
That is the most important things you'll need to know about reStructuredText for
  making presentations. There is a lot more to know, and a lot of advanced
  features like links, footnotes, and more. It is in fact advanced enough so you
  can write a whole <i>book</i> in it, but for all that you need to read the
  <i>documentation</i>.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="External_files"><a class="selflink" href="#External_files">External
  files</a></h2>
Any image file referenced in the presentation by a relative path will be copied
  to the target directory, keeping it's relative path to the presentation. The
  same goes for images or fonts referenced in any CSS files used by the
  presentation or the template.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Images or fonts referenced by absolute paths or URI's will not be copied.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Styling_your_Presentation"><a class="selflink" href="#Styling_your_Presentation">Styling

The css that is included by the default template are three files.
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>impressConsole.css</b> contains the CSS needed for the
      presenter console to work,</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>highlight.css</b> contains a default style for code
      syntax highlighting, as that otherwise would be a lot of work. If you
      don't like the default colors or styles in the highlighting, this is the
      file you should copy and modify.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>hovercraft.css</b>, which only includes the bare
      minimum: It hides the impress.js fallback message, the presenter notes,
      and sets up a useful default of having a step width be 1000 pixels
    wide.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For this reason you want to include your own CSS to style your slides. To
  include a CSS file you add a <b>:css:</b>-field at the top of the
  presentation:
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<div style="margin-left: 3.50ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
:css: css/presentation.css
</pre>
</div>
<br/>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can also optionally specify that the css should be only valid for certain
  CSS media:
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<div style="margin-left: 3.50ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
:css-screen,projection: css/presentation.css
:css-print: css/print.css
</pre>
</div>
<br/>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can specify any number of css files in this way.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can also add one extra CSS-file via a command-line parameter:
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<div style="margin-left: 3.50ex;">hovercraft --extra-css=my_extra.css
  presentationfile.rst outdir/</div>
<br/>
</div>
<br/>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Styling_a_specific_slide"><a class="selflink" href="#Styling_a_specific_slide">Styling
  a specific slide</a></h2>
If you want to have specific styling for a specific slide, it is a good idea to
  give that slide a unique ID:
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<div style="margin-left: 3.50ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
:id: the-slide-id
</pre>
</div>
<br/>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can then style that slide specifically with:
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<div style="margin-left: 3.50ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
div#the-slide-id {
    /* Custom CSS here */
}
</pre>
</div>
<br/>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you don't give it a specific ID, it will get an ID based on its sequence
  number. And that means the slide's ID will change if you insert or remove
  slides that came before it, and in that case your custom stylings of that
  slide will stop working.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Portable_presentations"><a class="selflink" href="#Portable_presentations">Portable
  presentations</a></h2>
Since Hovercraft! generates HTML5 presentations, you can use any computer that
  has a modern browser installed to view or show the presentation. This allows
  you both to put up the presentation online and to use a borrowed computer for
  your conference or customer presentation.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When you travel you don't know what equipment you have to use when you show your
  presentaton, and it's surprisingly common to encounter a projector that
  refuses to talk to your computer. It is also very easy to forget your dongle
  if you have a MacBook, and there have even been cases of computers going
  completely black and dead when you connect them to a projector, even though
  all other computers seem to work fine.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The main way of making sure your presentation is portable is to try it on
  different browsers and different computers. But the latter can be unfeasible,
  not everyone has both Windows, Linux and OS X computers at home. To help make
  your presentations portable it is a good idea to define your own @font-face's
  and use them, so you are sure that the target browser will use the same fonts
  as you do. Hovercraft! will automatically find @font-face definitions and copy
  the font files to the target directory.

The documentation on impress.js is contained as comments in the <i>demo html</i>
  <i>file</i>. It is not always very clear, so here comes a short summary for
  convenience.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The different data fields that impress.js will use in 0.5.3, which is the
  current version, are the following:
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>data-transition-duration</b>: The time it will take to
      move from one slide to another. Defaults to 1000 (1 second). This is only

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>data-perspective</b>: Controls the

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Hovercraft!_specialities"><a class="selflink" href="#Hovercraft!_specialities">Hovercraft!
  specialities</a></h2>
Hovercraft! has some specific ways it uses reStructuredText. First of all, the
  reStructuredText &quot;transition&quot; is used to mark the separation between
  different slides or steps. A transition is simply a line with four or more
  dashes:
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<div style="margin-left: 3.50ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
----
</pre>
</div>
<br/>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You don't have to use dashes, you can use any of the characters used to
  underline headings, <b>= - ` : . ' &quot; ~ ^ _ * + #</b>. And just as width
  headings, using different characters indicates different &quot;levels&quot;.
  In this way you can make a hierarchical presentation, with steps and substeps.
  However, impress.js does not support that, so this is only useful if you make
  your own templates that uses another Javascript library, for example
  <i>Reveal.js</i>. If you have more than one transition level with the
  templates included with Hovercraft, the resulting presentation may behave
  strangely.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
All reStructuredText fields are converted into attributes on the current tag.
  Most of these will typically be ignored by the rendering to HTML, but there is
  two places where the tags will make a difference, and that is by putting them
  first in the document, or first on a slide.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Any fields you put first in a document will be rendered into attributes on the
  main impress.js <b>&lt;div&gt;</b>. This is currently only used to set the
  transition-duration with <b>data-transition-duration</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Any fields you put first in a slide will be rendered into attributes on the
  slide <b>&lt;div&gt;</b>. This is used primarily to set the
  position/zoom/rotation of the slide, either with the <b>data-x</b>,
  <b>data-y</b> and other impress.js settings, or the <b>hovercraft-path</b>
  setting, more on that later.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Hovercraft! will start making the first slide when it first encounters either a
  transition or a header. Everything that comes before that will belong to the
  presentation as a whole.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A presentation can therefore look something like this:
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<div style="margin-left: 3.50ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>

<br/>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Relative_positioning"><a class="selflink" href="#Relative_positioning">Relative
  positioning</a></h2>
Hovercraft! gives you the ability to position slides relative to each other. You
  do this by starting the coordinates with &quot;r&quot;. This will position the
  slide 500 pixels to the right and a thousand pixels above the previous slide:
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<div style="margin-left: 3.50ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
:data-x: r500
:data-y: r-1000
</pre>
</div>
<br/>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Relative paths allow you to insert and remove slides and have other slides
  adjust automatically. It's probably the most useful way of positioning.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Automatic_positioning"><a class="selflink" href="#Automatic_positioning">Automatic
  positioning</a></h2>
If you don't specify an attribute, the slide settings will be the same as the
  previous slide. This means that if you used a relative positioning, the next
  slide will move the same distance.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This gives a linear movement, and your slides will end up in a straight line.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
By default the movement is 1600 pixels to the right, which means that if you
  don't position any slides at all, you get a standard presentation where the
  slides will simply slide from right to left.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="SVG_Paths"><a class="selflink" href="#SVG_Paths">SVG
  Paths</a></h2>
Hovercraft! supports positioning slides along an SVG path. This is handy, as you
  can create a drawing in a software that supports SVG, and then copy-paste that
  drawings path into your presentation.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You specify the SVG path with the <b>:hovercraft-path:</b> field. For example:
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<div style="margin-left: 3.50ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
:hovercraft-path: m275,175 v-150 a150,150 0 0,0 -150,150 z
</pre>
</div>
<br/>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Every following slide that does not have any explicit positioning will be placed
  on this path.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There are some things you need to be careful about when using SVG paths.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Relative_and_absolute_coordinates"><a class="selflink" href="#Relative_and_absolute_coordinates">Relative
  and absolute coordinates</a></h2>
In SVG coordinates can either be absolute, with a reference to the page origin;
  or relative, which is in reference to the last point. Hovercraft! can handle
  both, but what it can not handle very well is a mixture of them.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Specifically, if you take an SVG path that starts with a relative movement and
  extract that from the SVG document, you will lose the context. All coordinates
  later must then also be relative. If you have an absolute coordinate you then
  suddenly regain the context, and everything after the first absolute
  coordinate will be misplaced compared to the points that come before.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Most notable, the open source software &quot;Inkscape&quot; will mix absolute
  and relative coordinates, if you allow it to use relative coordinates. You
  therefore need to go into it's settings and uncheck the checkbox that allows
  you to use relative coordinates. This forces Inkscape to save all coordinates
  as absolute, which will work fine.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Start_position"><a class="selflink" href="#Start_position">Start
  position</a></h2>
By default the start position of the path, and hence the start position of the
  first slide, will be whatever the start position would have been if the slide
  had no positioning at all. If you want to change this position then just
  include <b>:data-x:</b> or <b>:data-y:</b> fields. Both relative and absolute
  positioning will work here.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In all cases, the first <b>m</b> or <b>M</b> command of the SVG path is
  effectively ignored, but you have to include it anyway.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="SVG_transforms"><a class="selflink" href="#SVG_transforms">SVG
  transforms</a></h2>
SVG allows you to draw up path and then transform it. Hovercraft! has no support
  for these transforms, so before you extract the path you should make sure the
  SVG software doesn't use transforms. In Inkscape you can do this by the
  &quot;Simplify&quot; command.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Other_SVG_shapes"><a class="selflink" href="#Other_SVG_shapes">Other
  SVG shapes</a></h2>
Hovercraft! doesn't support other SVG shapes, just the path. This is because
  organising slides in squares, etc, is quite simple anyway, and the shapes can
  be made into paths. Usually in the software you will have to select the shape
  and tell your software to make it into a path. In Inkscape, transforming an
  object into a path will generally mean that the whole path is made of
  CubicBezier curves, which are unnecessarily complex. Using the
  &quot;Simplify&quot; command in Inkscape is usually enough to make the shapes
  into paths.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Shape-scaling"><a class="selflink" href="#Shape-scaling">Shape-scaling</a></h2>
Hovercraft! will scale the path so that all the slides that need to fit into the
  path will fit into the path. If you therefore have several paths in your
  presentation, they will <b>not</b> keep their relative sizes, but will be
  resized so the slides fit. If you need to have the shapes keep their relative
  sizes, you need to combine them into one path.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Examples"><a class="selflink" href="#Examples">Examples</a></h2>
To see how to use Hovercraft! in practice, there are three example presentations
  included with Hovercraft!

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESIGNING_YOUR_PRESENTATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#DESIGNING_YOUR_PRESENTATIONS">DESIGNING
  YOUR PRESENTATIONS</a></h1>
There are several tricks to making presentations. I certainly do not claim to be
  an expert, but here are some beginners hints.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Take_it_easy"><a class="selflink" href="#Take_it_easy">Take
  it easy</a></h2>
Don't go too heavy on the zoom. Having a difference between two slides in scale
  of more than 5 is rarely going to look good. It would make for a nice cool
  zooming effect if it did, but this is not what browsers are designed for, so
  it won't.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
And the 3D effects can be really cool if used well. But not all the time, it
  gets tiring for the audience.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Try, if you can, to use the zoom and 3D effects when they make sense in the
  presentation. You can for example mention the main topics on one slide, and
  then zoom in on each topic when you discuss it in more detail. That way the
  effects help clarify the presentation, rather than distract from it.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Custom_fonts"><a class="selflink" href="#Custom_fonts">Custom
  fonts</a></h2>
Browsers tend to render things subtly differently.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
They also have different default fonts, and different operating systems have
  different implementations of the same fonts. So to make sure you have as much
  control over the design as possible, you should always include fonts with the
  presentation. A good source for free fonts are Google <i>Webfonts</i>. Those
  fonts are free and open source, so you can use them with no cost and no risk
  of being sued. They can also be downloaded or included online.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Online_vs_Downloaded"><a class="selflink" href="#Online_vs_Downloaded">Online
  vs Downloaded</a></h2>
If you are making a presentation that is going to run on your computer at a
  conference or customer meeting, always download the fonts and have them as a
  part of the presentation. Put them in a folder called <b>fonts</b> under the
  folder where your presentation is.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You also need to define the font-family in your CSS. <i>Font Squirrel</i>'s
  webfont generator will provide you with a platform-independent toolkit for
  generating both the varius font formats and the CSS.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the presentation is online only, you can put an <b>@include</b>-statement in
  your CSS to include Googles webfonts directly:
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<div style="margin-left: 3.50ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
@import url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Libre+Baskerville|Racing+Sans+One|Satisfy);
</pre>
</div>
<br/>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
But don't use this for things you need to show on your computer, as it requires
  you to have internet access.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Test_with_different_browsers"><a class="selflink" href="#Test_with_different_browsers">Test
  with different browsers</a></h2>
If you are putting the presentation online, test it with a couple of major
  browsers, to make sure nothing breaks and that everything still looks good.
  Not only are there subtle differences in how things may get positioned,
  different browsers are also good at different things.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
I've tested some browsers, all on Ubuntu, and it is likely that they behave
  differently on other operating systems, so you have to try for yourself.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Firefox"><a class="selflink" href="#Firefox">Firefox</a></h2>
Firefox 18 is quite slow to use with impress.js, especially for 3D stuff, so it
  can have very jerky movements from slide to slide. It does keep text looking
  good no matter how much you zoom. On the other hand, it refuses to scale text
  infinitely, so if you scale too much characters will not grow larger, they
  will instead start moving around.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Firefox 19 is better, but for 3D stuff it's still a bit slow.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Chrome"><a class="selflink" href="#Chrome">Chrome</a></h2>
Chrome 24 is fast, but will not redraw text in different sizes, but will instead
  create an image of them and rescale them, resulting in the previous slide
  having a fuzzy pixelated effect.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Epiphany"><a class="selflink" href="#Epiphany">Epiphany</a></h2>
Epiphany 3.4.1 is comparable to Firefox 19, possibly a bit smoother, and the
  text looks good. But it has bugs in how it handles 3D data, and the location
  bar is visible in fullscreen mode, making it less suitable for any sort of
  presentation.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TEMPLATES"><a class="selflink" href="#TEMPLATES">TEMPLATES</a></h1>
Luckily, for most cases you don't need to create your own template, as the
  default template is very simple and most things you need to do is doable with
  css. However, I don't want Hovercraft! to set up a wall where it isn't
  flexible enough for your needs, so I added support to make your own templates.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You need to create your own template if you are unsatisfied with the HTML that
  Hovercraft! generates, for example if you need to use another version of HTML
  or if the reStructuredText you are using isn't being rendered in a way that is
  useful for you. Although if you aren't happy with the HTML generated from the
  reStructuredText that could very well be a bug, so open an issue on Github for
  discussion.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Hovercraft! generates presentations by converting the reStructuredText into XML
  and then using XSLT to translate the XML into HTML.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Templates are directories with a configuration file, a template XSL file, and
  any number of CSS, JS and other resource files.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_template_configuration_file"><a class="selflink" href="#The_template_configuration_file">The
  template configuration file</a></h2>
The configuration file is normally called template.cfg, but if you have several
  configuration files in one template directory, you can specify which one to
  use by specifying the full path to the configuration file. However, if you
  just specify the template directory, <b>template.cfg</b> will be used.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Template files are in configparser format, which is an extended ini-style
  format. They are very simple, and have only one section, [hovercraft]. Any
  other sections will be ignored. Many of the parameters are lists that often do
  not fit on one line. In that case you can split the line up over several
  lines, but indenting the lines. The amount of indentation doesn't make any
  difference, except aestethically.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The parameters in the [hovercraft] section are:
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<div style="margin-left: 3.50ex;">template The name of the xsl template.
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>css A list of CSS filenames separated by whitespace.
    These files</b></dt>

An example:

<br/>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_template_file"><a class="selflink" href="#The_template_file">The
  template file</a></h2>
The file specified with the <b>template</b> parameters is the actual XSLT
  template that will perform the translation from XML to HTML.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Most of the time you can just copy the default template file in
  <b>hovercraft/templates/default/template.xsl</b> and modify it. XSLT is very
  complex, but modifying the templates HTML is quite straightforward as long as
  you don't have to touch any of the <b>&lt;xsl:...&gt;</b> tags.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Also, the HTML that is generated is XHTML compatible and quite straightforward,
  so for the most case all you would need to generate another version of HTML,
  for example strict XHTML, would be to change the doctype.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
But if you need to add or change the main generated HTML you can add and change
  HTML statements in this main file as you like. See for example how the little
  help-popup is added to the bottom of the HTML.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you want to change the way the reStructuredText is rendered things get
  slightly more complex. The XSLT rules that convert the reStructuredText XML
  into HTML are contained in a separate file, <b>reST.xsl</b>. For the most part
  you can just include it in the template file with the following code:
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">
<div style="margin-left: 3.50ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
&lt;xsl:import href=&quot;resource:templates/reST.xsl&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<br/>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>resource:</b> part here is not a part of XSLT, but a part of Hovercraft!
  It tells the XSLT translation that the file specified should not be looked up
  on the file system, but as a Python package resource. Currently the
  <b>templates/reST.xsl</b> file is the only XSLT resource import available.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you need to change the way reStructuredText is rendered you need to make a
  copy of that file and modify it. You then need to make a copy of the main
  template and change the reference in it to your modified XSLT file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
None of the XSLT files need to be copied to the target, and should not be listed
  as a resource in the template configuration file.
