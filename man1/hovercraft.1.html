<p>HOVERCRAFT(1) Hovercraft! HOVERCRAFT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hovercraft - Hovercraft! Documentation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Contents:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION <br>
GUI tools are limiting <br>
I used to do presentations with typical slideshow software,
such as OpenOffice/LibreOffice Impress, but these tools felt
restricted and limiting. I need to do a lot of reorga&acirc;
<br>
nizing and moving around, and that might mean changing
things from bullet lists to headings to text to pictures and
back to bullet lists over again. This happens through the
<br>
whole process. I might realize something that was just a
bullet point needs to be a slide, or that a set of slides
for time reasons need to be shortened down to bullet points.
<br>
Much of the reorganization comes from seeing what fits on
one slide and what does not, and how I need to pace the
presentation, and to some extent even what kinda of pictures
I <br>
can find to illustrate what I try to say, and if the
pictures are funny or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Presentation software should
give you complete freedom to reorganize your presentation on
every level, not only by reorganizing slides.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The solution for me and many
others, is to use a text-markup language, like
reStructuredText, Markdown or similar, and then use a tool
that generates an HTML slide show from <br>
that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text-markup gives you the
convenience and freedom to quickly move parts around as you
like.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I chose reStructuredText,
because I know it and because it has a massive feature set.
When I read the documentations of other text-markup langages
it was not obvious if they has <br>
the features I needed or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pan, rotate and zoom <br>
The tools that exist to make presentations from text-markup
will make slideshows that has a sequence of slides from left
to right. But the fashion now is to have presentations <br>
that rotate and zoon in and out. One open source solution
for that is impress.js.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With impress.js you can make
modern cool presentations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But impress.js requires you to
write your presentation as HTML, which is annoying, and the
markup isn&rsquo;t flexible enough to let you quickly
reorganize things from bullet points to <br>
headings etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You also have to position each
slide separately, and if you insert a new slide in the
middle, you have to reposition all the slides that
follow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hovercraft! <br>
So what I want is a tool that takes the power, flexibility
and convenience of reStructuredText and allows me to
generate pan, rotate and zoom presentations with impress.js,
with&acirc; <br>
out having to manually reposition each slide if I reorganize
a little bit of the presentation. I couldn&rsquo;t find one,
so I made Hovercraft.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hovercraft&acirc;s power comes
from the combination of reStructuredText&acirc;s convenience
with the cool of impress.js, together with a flexible and
powerful solution to position the <br>
slides.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are four ways to position
slides:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Absolute positioning: You
simply add X and Y coordinates to a slide, in pixels. Doing
only this will not be fun, but someone might need it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Relative positioning: By
specifying x and/or y with with a starting r, you specify
the distance from the previous slide. By using this form of
positioning you can insert a <br>
slide, and the other slides will just move to make space for
the new slide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Automatically: If you
don&acirc;t specify any position the slide will end up the
same distance from the previous slide as the previous slide
was from its previous slide. This <br>
defaults to moving 1600px to the right, which means that if
you supply no positions at all anywhere in the presentation,
you get the standard boring slide-to-the-left pre&acirc;
<br>
sentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. With an SVG path: In this
last way of positioning, you can take an SVG path from an
SVG document and stick it into the presentation, and that
slide + all slides following <br>
that has no explicit positioning will be positioned on that
path. This can be a bit fiddly to use, but can create
awesome results, such as positioning the slides as snaking
<br>
Python or similar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hovercraft! also includes
impress-console, a presenter console that will show you your
notes, slide previews and the time, essential tools for any
presentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING HOVERCRAFT! <br>
You can either use Hovercraft! to generate the presentation
as HTML in a target directory, or you can let Hovercraft!
serve the presentation from its builtin webserver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The latter have several
benefits. One is that most webbrowsers will be very
reluctant to open popup-windows from pages served from the
file system this is a security measure <br>
which can be changed, but it&rsquo;s easier to just point
the browser to http://localhost:8000 instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second benefit is that
Hovercraft! will monitor the source files for the
presentation, and if they are modified Hovercraft! will
generate the presentation again automati&acirc; <br>
cally. That way you don&rsquo;t have to run Hovercraft!
everytime you save a file, you only need to refresh the
browser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parameters <br>
hovercraft [-h] [-t TEMPLATE] [-c CSS] [-a] [-s] [-n] [-p
PORT] &lt;presentation&gt; [&lt;targetdir&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Positional arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;presentation&gt; <br>
The path to the reStructuredText presentation file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;targetdir&gt; <br>
The directory where the presentation is saved. Will be
created if it does not exist. If you do not specify a
targetdir Hovercraft! will instead start a webserver and
<br>
serve the presentation from that server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optional arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Show this help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t TEMPLATE, --template TEMPLATE
<br>
Specify a template. Must be a .cfg file, or a directory with
a template.cfg file. If not given it will use a default
template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c CSS, --css CSS <br>
An additional CSS file for the presentation to use. See also
the :css: settings of the presentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --auto-console <br>
Open the presenter console automatically. This is useful
when you are rehearsing and making sure the presenter notes
are correct. You can also set this by having <br>
:auto-console: true first in the presentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --skip-help <br>
Do not show the initial help popup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --skip-notes <br>
Do not include presenter notes in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p PORT, --port PORT <br>
The address and port that the server uses. Ex 8080 or
127.0.0.1:9000. Defaults to 0.0.0.0:8000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Built in templates <br>
There are two templates that come with Hovercraft! One is
called default and will be used unless you specify a
template. This is the template you will use most of the
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second is called simple and
it doesn&rsquo;t have a presenter console. This template is
especially useful if you combine it with the --skip-notes
parameter to prepare a version of <br>
your presentation to be put online.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAKING PRESENTATIONS <br>
A note on terminology <br>
Traditionally a presentation is made up of slides. Calling
them &quot;slides&quot; is not really relevant in an
impress.js context, as they can overlap and doesn&rsquo;t
necessarily slide. The <br>
name &quot;steps&quot; is better, but it&rsquo;s also more
ambiguous. Hence impress.js uses the terms &quot;slide&quot;
and &quot;step&quot; as meaning the same thing, and so does
Hovercraft!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hovercraft! syntax <br>
Presentations are reStructuredText files. If you are reading
this documentation from the source code, then you are
looking at a reStructuredText document already.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s fairly simple, you
underline headings to mark them as headings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This becomes a h1 <br>
=================</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And this a h2 <br>
-------------</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The different ways of
underlining them doesn&rsquo;t mean anything, instead the
order of them is relevant, so the first type of underline
encountered in the file will make a level 1 <br>
heading, the second type a level 2 heading and so on. In
this file = is used for level 1, and - for level 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also mark text as italic
or bold, with *single asterixes* or **double asterixes**
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also have bullet
lists:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Bullet 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Bullet 1.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Bullet 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Bullet 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And numbered lists:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Item 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.1. Item 1.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Item 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Item 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can include images:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.. image:: path/to/image.png
<br>
:height: 600px <br>
:width: 800px</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As you see you can also specify
height and width and loads of other parameters, but they are
all optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And you can mark text as being
preformatted. You do that by ending the previous row with
double colons, or have a row of double colons by itself:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">::</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This code here will be
preformatted <br>
and shown with a monospaced font <br>
and all spaces preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to add source code,
you can use the code directive, and get syntax
highlighting:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.. code:: python</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">def some_example_code(foo): <br>
return foo * foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syntax highlighting is done
by Pygments and supports lots and lots of languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You are also likely to want to
put a title on the presentation. You do that by having a ..
title:: statement before the first slide:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.. title:: This is the
presentation title</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That is the most important
things you&rsquo;ll need to know about reStructuredText for
making presentations. There is a lot more to know, and a lot
of advanced features like links, <br>
footnotes, and more. It is in fact advanced enough so you
can write a whole book in it, but for all that you need to
read the documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">External files <br>
Any image file referenced in the presentation by a relative
path will be copied to the target directory, keeping
it&rsquo;s relative path to the presentation. The same goes
for images <br>
or fonts referenced in any CSS files used by the
presentation or the template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Images or fonts referenced by
absolute paths or URI&rsquo;s will not be copied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Styling your Presentation <br>
The css that is included by the default template are three
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
impressConsole.css contains the CSS needed for the presenter
console to work,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; highlight.css
contains a default style for code syntax highlighting, as
that otherwise would be a lot of work. If you don&rsquo;t
like the default colors or styles in the highlight&acirc;
<br>
ing, this is the file you should copy and modify.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; hovercraft.css,
which only includes the bare minimum: It hides the
impress.js fallback message, the presenter notes, and sets
up a useful default of having a step width be 1000 <br>
pixels wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For this reason you want to
include your own CSS to style your slides. To include a CSS
file you add a :css:-field at the top of the
presentation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:css: css/presentation.css</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also optionally specify
that the css should be only valid for certain CSS media:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:css-screen,projection:
css/presentation.css <br>
:css-print: css/print.css</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify any number of
css files in this way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also add one extra
CSS-file via a command-line parameter: <br>
hovercraft --extra-css=my_extra.css presentationfile.rst
outdir/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Styling a specific slide <br>
If you want to have specific styling for a specific slide,
it is a good idea to give that slide a unique ID:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:id: the-slide-id</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can then style that slide
specifically with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">div#the-slide-id { <br>
/* Custom CSS here */ <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t give it a
specific ID, it will get an ID based on its sequence number.
And that means the slide&rsquo;s ID will change if you
insert or remove slides that came before it, <br>
and in that case your custom stylings of that slide will
stop working.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portable presentations <br>
Since Hovercraft! generates HTML5 presentations, you can use
any computer that has a modern browser installed to view or
show the presentation. This allows you both to put up the
<br>
presentation online and to use a borrowed computer for your
conference or customer presentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you travel you don&rsquo;t
know what equipment you have to use when you show your
presentaton, and it&rsquo;s surprisingly common to encounter
a projector that refuses to talk to your <br>
computer. It is also very easy to forget your dongle if you
have a MacBook, and there have even been cases of computers
going completely black and dead when you connect them to a
<br>
projector, even though all other computers seem to work
fine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main way of making sure your
presentation is portable is to try it on different browsers
and different computers. But the latter can be unfeasible,
not everyone has both Win&acirc; <br>
dows, Linux and OS X computers at home. To help make your
presentations portable it is a good idea to define your own
@font-face&rsquo;s and use them, so you are sure that the
target <br>
browser will use the same fonts as you do. Hovercraft! will
automatically find @font-face definitions and copy the font
files to the target directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">impress.js fields <br>
The documentation on impress.js is contained as comments in
the demo html file. It is not always very clear, so here
comes a short summary for convenience.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The different data fields that
impress.js will use in 0.5.3, which is the current version,
are the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
data-transition-duration: The time it will take to move from
one slide to another. Defaults to 1000 (1 second). This is
only valid on the presentation as a whole.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
data-perspective: Controls the &quot;perspective&quot; in
the 3d effects. It defaults to 500. Setting it to 0 disables
3D effects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; data-x: The
horizontal position of a slide in pixels. Can be
negative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; data-y: The
vertical position of a slide in pixels. Can be negative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; data-scale: Sets
the scale of a slide, which is what creates the zoom.
Defaults to 1. A value of 4 means the slide is four times
larger. In short: Lower means zooming in, <br>
higher means zooming out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; data-rotate-z:
The rotation of a slide in the x-axis, in degrees. This will
cause the slide to be rotated clockwise or
counter-clockwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; data-rotate: The
same as data-rotate-z.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; data-rotate-x:
The rotation of a slide in the x-axis, in degrees. This
means you are moving the slide in a third dimension compared
with other slides. This is generally cooll <br>
effect, if used right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; data-rotate-y:
The rotation of a slide in the x-axis, in degrees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; data-z: This
controls the position of the slide on the z-axis. Setting
this value to -3000 means it&rsquo;s positioned -3000 pixels
away. This is only useful when you use <br>
data-rotate-x or data-rotate-y, otherwise it will only give
the impression that the slide is made smaller, which
isn&rsquo;t really useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hovercraft! specialities <br>
Hovercraft! has some specific ways it uses reStructuredText.
First of all, the reStructuredText &quot;transition&quot; is
used to mark the separation between different slides or
steps. A <br>
transition is simply a line with four or more dashes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">----</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You don&rsquo;t have to use
dashes, you can use any of the characters used to underline
headings, = - &lsquo; : . &rsquo; &quot; ~ ^ _ * + #. And
just as width headings, using different characters <br>
indicates different &quot;levels&quot;. In this way you can
make a hierarchical presentation, with steps and substeps.
However, impress.js does not support that, so this is only
useful if <br>
you make your own templates that uses another Javascript
library, for example Reveal.js. If you have more than one
transition level with the templates included with
Hovercraft, <br>
the resulting presentation may behave strangely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All reStructuredText fields are
converted into attributes on the current tag. Most of these
will typically be ignored by the rendering to HTML, but
there is two places where the <br>
tags will make a difference, and that is by putting them
first in the document, or first on a slide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any fields you put first in a
document will be rendered into attributes on the main
impress.js &lt;div&gt;. This is currently only used to set
the transition-duration with data-transi&acirc; <br>
tion-duration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any fields you put first in a
slide will be rendered into attributes on the slide
&lt;div&gt;. This is used primarily to set the
position/zoom/rotation of the slide, either with the <br>
data-x, data-y and other impress.js settings, or the
hovercraft-path setting, more on that later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hovercraft! will start making
the first slide when it first encounters either a transition
or a header. Everything that comes before that will belong
to the presentation as a <br>
whole.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A presentation can therefore
look something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:data-transition-duration: 2000
<br>
:skip-help: true</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.. title: Presentation Title</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">----</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the first slide <br>
=======================</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here comes some text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">----</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:data-x: 300 <br>
:data-y: 2000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the second slide <br>
========================</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#. Here we have</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#. A numbered list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#. It will get correct</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#. Numbers automatically</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Relative positioning <br>
Hovercraft! gives you the ability to position slides
relative to each other. You do this by starting the
coordinates with &quot;r&quot;. This will position the slide
500 pixels to the <br>
right and a thousand pixels above the previous slide:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:data-x: r500 <br>
:data-y: r-1000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Relative paths allow you to
insert and remove slides and have other slides adjust
automatically. It&rsquo;s probably the most useful way of
positioning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatic positioning <br>
If you don&rsquo;t specify an attribute, the slide settings
will be the same as the previous slide. This means that if
you used a relative positioning, the next slide will move
the <br>
same distance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This gives a linear movement,
and your slides will end up in a straight line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default the movement is 1600
pixels to the right, which means that if you don&rsquo;t
position any slides at all, you get a standard presentation
where the slides will simply slide <br>
from right to left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SVG Paths <br>
Hovercraft! supports positioning slides along an SVG path.
This is handy, as you can create a drawing in a software
that supports SVG, and then copy-paste that drawings path
into <br>
your presentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You specify the SVG path with
the :hovercraft-path: field. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:hovercraft-path: m275,175 v-150
a150,150 0 0,0 -150,150 z</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every following slide that does
not have any explicit positioning will be placed on this
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are some things you need
to be careful about when using SVG paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Relative and absolute
coordinates <br>
In SVG coordinates can either be absolute, with a reference
to the page origin; or relative, which is in reference to
the last point. Hovercraft! can handle both, but what it can
<br>
not handle very well is a mixture of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifically, if you take an SVG
path that starts with a relative movement and extract that
from the SVG document, you will lose the context. All
coordinates later must then also <br>
be relative. If you have an absolute coordinate you then
suddenly regain the context, and everything after the first
absolute coordinate will be misplaced compared to the points
<br>
that come before.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most notable, the open source
software &quot;Inkscape&quot; will mix absolute and relative
coordinates, if you allow it to use relative coordinates.
You therefore need to go into it&rsquo;s set&acirc; <br>
tings and uncheck the checkbox that allows you to use
relative coordinates. This forces Inkscape to save all
coordinates as absolute, which will work fine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Start position <br>
By default the start position of the path, and hence the
start position of the first slide, will be whatever the
start position would have been if the slide had no
positioning at <br>
all. If you want to change this position then just include
:data-x: or :data-y: fields. Both relative and absolute
positioning will work here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In all cases, the first m or M
command of the SVG path is effectively ignored, but you have
to include it anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SVG transforms <br>
SVG allows you to draw up path and then transform it.
Hovercraft! has no support for these transforms, so before
you extract the path you should make sure the SVG software
<br>
doesn&rsquo;t use transforms. In Inkscape you can do this by
the &quot;Simplify&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other SVG shapes <br>
Hovercraft! doesn&rsquo;t support other SVG shapes, just the
path. This is because organising slides in squares, etc, is
quite simple anyway, and the shapes can be made into paths.
<br>
Usually in the software you will have to select the shape
and tell your software to make it into a path. In Inkscape,
transforming an object into a path will generally mean that
<br>
the whole path is made of CubicBezier curves, which are
unnecessarily complex. Using the &quot;Simplify&quot;
command in Inkscape is usually enough to make the shapes
into paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shape-scaling <br>
Hovercraft! will scale the path so that all the slides that
need to fit into the path will fit into the path. If you
therefore have several paths in your presentation, they will
<br>
not keep their relative sizes, but will be resized so the
slides fit. If you need to have the shapes keep their
relative sizes, you need to combine them into one path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples <br>
To see how to use Hovercraft! in practice, there are three
example presentations included with Hovercraft!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESIGNING YOUR PRESENTATIONS
<br>
There are several tricks to making presentations. I
certainly do not claim to be an expert, but here are some
beginners hints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Take it easy <br>
Don&rsquo;t go too heavy on the zoom. Having a difference
between two slides in scale of more than 5 is rarely going
to look good. It would make for a nice cool zooming effect
if it <br>
did, but this is not what browsers are designed for, so it
won&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And the 3D effects can be really
cool if used well. But not all the time, it gets tiring for
the audience.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Try, if you can, to use the zoom
and 3D effects when they make sense in the presentation. You
can for example mention the main topics on one slide, and
then zoom in on each topic <br>
when you discuss it in more detail. That way the effects
help clarify the presentation, rather than distract from
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Custom fonts <br>
Browsers tend to render things subtly differently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">They also have different default
fonts, and different operating systems have different
implementations of the same fonts. So to make sure you have
as much control over the design <br>
as possible, you should always include fonts with the
presentation. A good source for free fonts are Google
Webfonts. Those fonts are free and open source, so you can
use them <br>
with no cost and no risk of being sued. They can also be
downloaded or included online.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Online vs Downloaded <br>
If you are making a presentation that is going to run on
your computer at a conference or customer meeting, always
download the fonts and have them as a part of the
presentation. <br>
Put them in a folder called fonts under the folder where
your presentation is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You also need to define the
font-family in your CSS. Font Squirrel&rsquo;s webfont
generator will provide you with a platform-independent
toolkit for generating both the varius font <br>
formats and the CSS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the presentation is online
only, you can put an @include-statement in your CSS to
include Googles webfonts directly:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@import
url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Libre+Baskerville|Racing+Sans+One|Satisfy);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But don&rsquo;t use this for
things you need to show on your computer, as it requires you
to have internet access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Test with different browsers
<br>
If you are putting the presentation online, test it with a
couple of major browsers, to make sure nothing breaks and
that everything still looks good. Not only are there subtle
<br>
differences in how things may get positioned, different
browsers are also good at different things.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I&rsquo;ve tested some browsers,
all on Ubuntu, and it is likely that they behave differently
on other operating systems, so you have to try for
yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Firefox <br>
Firefox 18 is quite slow to use with impress.js, especially
for 3D stuff, so it can have very jerky movements from slide
to slide. It does keep text looking good no matter how <br>
much you zoom. On the other hand, it refuses to scale text
infinitely, so if you scale too much characters will not
grow larger, they will instead start moving around.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Firefox 19 is better, but for 3D
stuff it&rsquo;s still a bit slow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Chrome <br>
Chrome 24 is fast, but will not redraw text in different
sizes, but will instead create an image of them and rescale
them, resulting in the previous slide having a fuzzy
pixe&acirc; <br>
lated effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Epiphany <br>
Epiphany 3.4.1 is comparable to Firefox 19, possibly a bit
smoother, and the text looks good. But it has bugs in how it
handles 3D data, and the location bar is visible in <br>
fullscreen mode, making it less suitable for any sort of
presentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEMPLATES <br>
Luckily, for most cases you don&rsquo;t need to create your
own template, as the default template is very simple and
most things you need to do is doable with css. However, I
don&rsquo;t <br>
want Hovercraft! to set up a wall where it isn&rsquo;t
flexible enough for your needs, so I added support to make
your own templates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You need to create your own
template if you are unsatisfied with the HTML that
Hovercraft! generates, for example if you need to use
another version of HTML or if the reStruc&acirc; <br>
turedText you are using isn&rsquo;t being rendered in a way
that is useful for you. Although if you aren&rsquo;t happy
with the HTML generated from the reStructuredText that could
very well <br>
be a bug, so open an issue on Github for discussion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hovercraft! generates
presentations by converting the reStructuredText into XML
and then using XSLT to translate the XML into HTML.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Templates are directories with a
configuration file, a template XSL file, and any number of
CSS, JS and other resource files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The template configuration file
<br>
The configuration file is normally called template.cfg, but
if you have several configuration files in one template
directory, you can specify which one to use by specifying
the <br>
full path to the configuration file. However, if you just
specify the template directory, template.cfg will be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Template files are in
configparser format, which is an extended ini-style format.
They are very simple, and have only one section,
[hovercraft]. Any other sections will be <br>
ignored. Many of the parameters are lists that often do not
fit on one line. In that case you can split the line up over
several lines, but indenting the lines. The amount of <br>
indentation doesn&rsquo;t make any difference, except
aestethically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parameters in the
[hovercraft] section are: <br>
template The name of the xsl template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">css A list of CSS filenames
separated by whitespace. These files <br>
will get included in the final file with &quot;all&quot; as
the media specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">css-&lt;media&gt; A list of CSS
filenames separated by whitespace. These files <br>
will get included in the final file with the media given in
the parameter. So the files listed for the parameter
&quot;css-print&quot; will get &quot;print&quot; as their
media specifica&acirc; <br>
tion and a key like &quot;css-screen,print&quot; will return
media &quot;screen,print&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">js-header A list of filenames
separated by whitespace. These files <br>
will get included in the target file as header script
links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">js-body A list of filenames
separated by whitespace. These files <br>
will get included in the target file as script links at the
end of the file. The files impress.js, impressConsole.js and
hovercraft.js typically need to be included <br>
here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resource A list of filenames
separated by whitespace that will be <br>
copied to the target directory, but nothing else is done
with them. Images and fonts used by CSS will be copied
anyway, but other resources may be added here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[hovercraft] <br>
template = template.xsl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">css = css/screen.css <br>
css/impressConsole.css</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">css-print = css/print.css</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">js-header = js/dateinput.js</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">js-body = js/impress.js <br>
js/impressConsole.js <br>
js/hovercraft.js</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resource = images/back.png <br>
images/forward.png <br>
images/up.png <br>
images/down.png</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The template file <br>
The file specified with the template parameters is the
actual XSLT template that will perform the translation from
XML to HTML.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of the time you can just
copy the default template file in
hovercraft/templates/default/template.xsl and modify it.
XSLT is very complex, but modifying the templates HTML is
<br>
quite straightforward as long as you don&rsquo;t have to
touch any of the &lt;xsl:...&gt; tags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, the HTML that is generated
is XHTML compatible and quite straightforward, so for the
most case all you would need to generate another version of
HTML, for example strict <br>
XHTML, would be to change the doctype.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But if you need to add or change
the main generated HTML you can add and change HTML
statements in this main file as you like. See for example
how the little help-popup is added <br>
to the bottom of the HTML.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to change the way
the reStructuredText is rendered things get slightly more
complex. The XSLT rules that convert the reStructuredText
XML into HTML are contained in a <br>
separate file, reST.xsl. For the most part you can just
include it in the template file with the following code:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;xsl:import
href=&quot;resource:templates/reST.xsl&quot; /&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The resource: part here is not a
part of XSLT, but a part of Hovercraft! It tells the XSLT
translation that the file specified should not be looked up
on the file system, but as <br>
a Python package resource. Currently the templates/reST.xsl
file is the only XSLT resource import available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need to change the way
reStructuredText is rendered you need to make a copy of that
file and modify it. You then need to make a copy of the main
template and change the <br>
reference in it to your modified XSLT file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">None of the XSLT files need to
be copied to the target, and should not be listed as a
resource in the template configuration file.</p>
