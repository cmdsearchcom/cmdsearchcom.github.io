<p>GIT-READ-TREE(1) Git Manual GIT-READ-TREE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-read-tree - Reads tree information into the index</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git read-tree [[-m [--trivial] [--aggressive] | --reset |
--prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;] <br>
[-u [--exclude-per-directory=&lt;gitignore&gt;] | -i]] <br>
[--index-output=&lt;file&gt;] [--no-sparse-checkout] <br>
(--empty | &lt;tree-ish1&gt; [&lt;tree-ish2&gt;
[&lt;tree-ish3&gt;]])</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Reads the tree information given by &lt;tree-ish&gt; into
the index, but does not actually update any of the files it
&quot;caches&quot;. (see: git-checkout-index(1))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optionally, it can merge a tree
into the index, perform a fast-forward (i.e. 2-way) merge,
or a 3-way merge, with the -m flag. When used with -m, the
-u flag causes it to also <br>
update the files in the work tree with the result of the
merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trivial merges are done by git
read-tree itself. Only conflicting paths will be in unmerged
state when git read-tree returns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-m <br>
Perform a merge, not just a read. The command will refuse to
run if your index file has unmerged entries, indicating that
you have not finished previous merge you started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reset <br>
Same as -m, except that unmerged entries are discarded
instead of failing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u <br>
After a successful merge, update the files in the work tree
with the result of the merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i <br>
Usually a merge requires the index file as well as the files
in the working tree to be up to date with the current head
commit, in order not to lose local changes. This flag <br>
disables the check with the working tree and is meant to be
used when creating a merge of trees that are not directly
related to the current working tree status into a <br>
temporary index file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --dry-run <br>
Check if the command would error out, without updating the
index nor the files in the working tree for real.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
Show the progress of checking files out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--trivial <br>
Restrict three-way merge by git read-tree to happen only if
there is no file-level merging required, instead of
resolving merge for trivial cases and leaving conflicting
<br>
files unresolved in the index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--aggressive <br>
Usually a three-way merge by git read-tree resolves the
merge for really trivial cases and leaves other cases
unresolved in the index, so that porcelains can implement
<br>
different merge policies. This flag makes the command
resolve a few more cases internally:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; when one side
removes a path and the other side leaves the path
unmodified. The resolution is to remove that path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; when both sides
remove a path. The resolution is to remove that path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; when both sides
add a path identically. The resolution is to add that
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;/ <br>
Keep the current index contents, and read the contents of
the named tree-ish under the directory at &lt;prefix&gt;.
The command will refuse to overwrite entries that already
<br>
existed in the original index file. Note that the
&lt;prefix&gt;/ value must end with a slash.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-per-directory=&lt;gitignore&gt;
<br>
When running the command with -u and -m options, the merge
result may need to overwrite paths that are not tracked in
the current branch. The command usually refuses to <br>
proceed with the merge to avoid losing such a path. However
this safety valve sometimes gets in the way. For example, it
often happens that the other branch added a file that <br>
used to be a generated file in your branch, and the safety
valve triggers when you try to switch to that branch after
you ran make but before running make clean to remove the
<br>
generated file. This option tells the command to read
per-directory exclude file (usually .gitignore) and allows
such an untracked but explicitly ignored file to be <br>
overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--index-output=&lt;file&gt; <br>
Instead of writing the results out to $GIT_INDEX_FILE, write
the resulting index in the named file. While the command is
operating, the original index file is locked with the <br>
same mechanism as usual. The file must allow to be
rename(2)ed into from a temporary file that is created next
to the usual index file; typically this means it needs to be
on <br>
the same filesystem as the index file itself, and you need
write permission to the directories the index file and index
output file are located in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-sparse-checkout <br>
Disable sparse checkout support even if core.sparseCheckout
is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--empty <br>
Instead of reading tree object(s) into the index, just empty
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;tree-ish#&gt; <br>
The id of the tree object(s) to be read/merged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MERGING <br>
If -m is specified, git read-tree can perform 3 kinds of
merge, a single tree merge if only 1 tree is given, a
fast-forward merge with 2 trees, or a 3-way merge if 3 trees
are <br>
provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Single Tree Merge <br>
If only 1 tree is specified, git read-tree operates as if
the user did not specify -m, except that if the original
index has an entry for a given pathname, and the contents of
<br>
the path match with the tree being read, the stat info from
the index is used. (In other words, the index&acirc;s
stat()s take precedence over the merged tree&acirc;s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That means that if you do a git
read-tree -m &lt;newtree&gt; followed by a git
checkout-index -f -u -a, the git checkout-index only checks
out the stuff that really changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is used to avoid
unnecessary false hits when git diff-files is run after git
read-tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two Tree Merge <br>
Typically, this is invoked as git read-tree -m $H $M, where
$H is the head commit of the current repository, and $M is
the head of a foreign tree, which is simply ahead of $H <br>
(i.e. we are in a fast-forward situation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When two trees are specified,
the user is telling git read-tree the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The current index and work
tree is derived from $H, but the user may have local changes
in them since $H.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The user wants to
fast-forward to $M.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case, the git read-tree
-m $H $M command makes sure that no local change is lost as
the result of this &quot;merge&quot;. Here are the
&quot;carry forward&quot; rules, where &quot;I&quot; denotes
the <br>
index, &quot;clean&quot; means that index and work tree
coincide, and &quot;exists&quot;/&quot;nothing&quot; refer
to the presence of a path in the specified commit:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I H M Result <br>
------------------------------------------------------- <br>
0 nothing nothing nothing (does not happen) <br>
1 nothing nothing exists use M <br>
2 nothing exists nothing remove path from index <br>
3 nothing exists exists, use M if &quot;initial
checkout&quot;, <br>
H == M keep index otherwise <br>
exists, fail <br>
H != M</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clean I==H I==M <br>
------------------ <br>
4 yes N/A N/A nothing nothing keep index <br>
5 no N/A N/A nothing nothing keep index</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6 yes N/A yes nothing exists
keep index <br>
7 no N/A yes nothing exists keep index <br>
8 yes N/A no nothing exists fail <br>
9 no N/A no nothing exists fail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10 yes yes N/A exists nothing
remove path from index <br>
11 no yes N/A exists nothing fail <br>
12 yes no N/A exists nothing fail <br>
13 no no N/A exists nothing fail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clean (H==M) <br>
------ <br>
14 yes exists exists keep index <br>
15 no exists exists keep index</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clean I==H I==M (H!=M) <br>
------------------ <br>
16 yes no no exists exists fail <br>
17 no no no exists exists fail <br>
18 yes no yes exists exists keep index <br>
19 no no yes exists exists keep index <br>
20 yes yes no exists exists use M <br>
21 no yes no exists exists fail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In all &quot;keep index&quot;
cases, the index entry stays as in the original index file.
If the entry is not up to date, git read-tree keeps the copy
in the work tree intact when <br>
operating under the -u flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this form of git read-tree
returns successfully, you can see which of the &quot;local
changes&quot; that you made were carried forward by running
git diff-index --cached $M. Note that <br>
this does not necessarily match what git diff-index --cached
$H would have produced before such a two tree merge. This is
because of cases 18 and 19 --- if you already had the <br>
changes in $M (e.g. maybe you picked it up via e-mail in a
patch form), git diff-index --cached $H would have told you
about the change before this merge, but it would not show
<br>
in git diff-index --cached $M output after the two-tree
merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Case 3 is slightly tricky and
needs explanation. The result from this rule logically
should be to remove the path if the user staged the removal
of the path and then switching to <br>
a new branch. That however will prevent the initial checkout
from happening, so the rule is modified to use M (new tree)
only when the content of the index is empty. Otherwise <br>
the removal of the path is kept as long as $H and $M are the
same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3-Way Merge <br>
Each &quot;index&quot; entry has two bits worth of
&quot;stage&quot; state. stage 0 is the normal one, and is
the only one you&acirc;d see in any kind of normal use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, when you do git
read-tree with three trees, the &quot;stage&quot; starts out
at 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that you can do</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git read-tree -m &lt;tree1&gt;
&lt;tree2&gt; &lt;tree3&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and you will end up with an
index with all of the &lt;tree1&gt; entries in
&quot;stage1&quot;, all of the &lt;tree2&gt; entries in
&quot;stage2&quot; and all of the &lt;tree3&gt; entries in
&quot;stage3&quot;. When performing <br>
a merge of another branch into the current branch, we use
the common ancestor tree as &lt;tree1&gt;, the current
branch head as &lt;tree2&gt;, and the other branch head as
&lt;tree3&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, git read-tree has
special-case logic that says: if you see a file that matches
in all respects in the following states, it
&quot;collapses&quot; back to &quot;stage0&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; stage 2 and 3
are the same; take one or the other (it makes no difference
- the same work has been done on our branch in stage 2 and
their branch in stage 3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; stage 1 and
stage 2 are the same and stage 3 is different; take stage 3
(our branch in stage 2 did not do anything since the
ancestor in stage 1 while their branch in stage 3 <br>
worked on it)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; stage 1 and
stage 3 are the same and stage 2 is different take stage 2
(we did something while they did nothing)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The git write-tree command
refuses to write a nonsensical tree, and it will complain
about unmerged entries if it sees a single entry that is not
stage 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OK, this all sounds like a
collection of totally nonsensical rules, but it&acirc;s
actually exactly what you want in order to do a fast merge.
The different stages represent the <br>
&quot;result tree&quot; (stage 0, aka &quot;merged&quot;),
the original tree (stage 1, aka &quot;orig&quot;), and the
two trees you are trying to merge (stage 2 and 3
respectively).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The order of stages 1, 2 and 3
(hence the order of three &lt;tree-ish&gt; command line
arguments) are significant when you start a 3-way merge with
an index file that is already <br>
populated. Here is an outline of how the algorithm
works:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; if a file exists
in identical format in all three trees, it will
automatically collapse to &quot;merged&quot; state by git
read-tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a file that has
any difference what-so-ever in the three trees will stay as
separate entries in the index. It&acirc;s up to
&quot;porcelain policy&quot; to determine how to remove the
non-0 <br>
stages, and insert a merged version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the index file
saves and restores with all this information, so you can
merge things incrementally, but as long as it has entries in
stages 1/2/3 (i.e., &quot;unmerged entries&quot;) <br>
you can&acirc;t write the result. So now the merge algorithm
ends up being really simple:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; you walk the
index in order, and ignore all entries of stage 0, since
they&acirc;ve already been done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; if you find a
&quot;stage1&quot;, but no matching &quot;stage2&quot; or
&quot;stage3&quot;, you know it&acirc;s been removed from
both trees (it only existed in the original tree), and you
remove that <br>
entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; if you find a
matching &quot;stage2&quot; and &quot;stage3&quot; tree, you
remove one of them, and turn the other into a
&quot;stage0&quot; entry. Remove any matching
&quot;stage1&quot; entry if it exists too. <br>
.. all the normal trivial rules ..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You would normally use git
merge-index with supplied git merge-one-file to do this last
step. The script updates the files in the working tree as it
merges each path and at the <br>
end of a successful merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you start a 3-way merge
with an index file that is already populated, it is assumed
that it represents the state of the files in your work tree,
and you can even have files <br>
with changes unrecorded in the index file. It is further
assumed that this state is &quot;derived&quot; from the
stage 2 tree. The 3-way merge refuses to run if it finds an
entry in the <br>
original index file that does not match stage 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is done to prevent you from
losing your work-in-progress changes, and mixing your random
changes in an unrelated merge commit. To illustrate, suppose
you start from what has <br>
been committed last to your repository:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ JC=&lsquo;git rev-parse
--verify &quot;HEAD^0&quot;&lsquo; <br>
$ git checkout-index -f -u -a $JC</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You do random edits, without
running git update-index. And then you notice that the tip
of your &quot;upstream&quot; tree has advanced since you
pulled from him:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git fetch git://.... linus
<br>
$ LT=&lsquo;git rev-parse FETCH_HEAD&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Your work tree is still based on
your HEAD ($JC), but you have some edits since. Three-way
merge makes sure that you have not added or modified index
entries since $JC, and if <br>
you haven&acirc;t, then does the right thing. So with the
following sequence:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git read-tree -m -u &lsquo;git
merge-base $JC $LT&lsquo; $JC $LT <br>
$ git merge-index git-merge-one-file -a <br>
$ echo &quot;Merge with Linus&quot; | git commit-tree
&lsquo;git write-tree&lsquo; -p $JC -p $LT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">what you would commit is a pure
merge between $JC and $LT without your work-in-progress
changes, and your work tree would be updated to the result
of the merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if you have local
changes in the working tree that would be overwritten by
this merge, git read-tree will refuse to run to prevent your
changes from being lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In other words, there is no need
to worry about what exists only in the working tree. When
you have local changes in a part of the project that is not
involved in the merge, your <br>
changes do not interfere with the merge, and are kept
intact. When they do interfere, the merge does not even
start (git read-tree complains loudly and fails without
modifying <br>
anything). In such a case, you can simply continue doing
what you were in the middle of doing, and when your working
tree is ready (i.e. you have finished your
work-in-progress), <br>
attempt the merge again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPARSE CHECKOUT <br>
&quot;Sparse checkout&quot; allows populating the working
directory sparsely. It uses the skip-worktree bit (see
git-update-index(1)) to tell Git whether a file in the
working directory is <br>
worth looking at.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git read-tree and other
merge-based commands (git merge, git checkout...) can help
maintaining the skip-worktree bitmap and working directory
update. <br>
$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout is used to define the
skip-worktree reference bitmap. When git read-tree needs to
update the working directory, it resets the skip-worktree
bit in <br>
the index based on this file, which uses the same syntax as
.gitignore files. If an entry matches a pattern in this
file, skip-worktree will not be set on that entry.
Otherwise, <br>
skip-worktree will be set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then it compares the new
skip-worktree value with the previous one. If skip-worktree
turns from set to unset, it will add the corresponding file
back. If it turns from unset to <br>
set, that file will be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While
$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout is usually used to specify
what files are in, you can also specify what files are not
in, using negate patterns. For example, to remove the <br>
file unwanted:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/* <br>
!unwanted</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another tricky thing is fully
repopulating the working directory when you no longer want
sparse checkout. You cannot just disable &quot;sparse
checkout&quot; because skip-worktree bits are <br>
still in the index and your working directory is still
sparsely populated. You should re-populate the working
directory with the $GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout file
content as <br>
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then you can disable sparse
checkout. Sparse checkout support in git read-tree and
similar commands is disabled by default. You need to turn
core.sparseCheckout on in order to <br>
have sparse checkout support.</p>
