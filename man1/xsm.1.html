xsm - X Session Manager
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>xsm</b> [-display display] [-session sessionName] [-verbose]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<i>xsm</i> is a session manager. A session is a group of applications, each of
  which has a particular state. <i>xsm</i> allows you to create arbitrary
  sessions - for example, you might have a &quot;light&quot; session, a
  &quot;development&quot; session, or an &quot;xterminal&quot; session. Each
  session can have its own set of applications. Within a session, you can
  perform a &quot;checkpoint&quot; to save application state, or a
  &quot;shutdown&quot; to save state and exit the session. When you log back in
  to the system, you can load a specific session, and you can delete sessions
  you no longer want to keep.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Some session managers simply allow you to manually specify a list of
  applications to be started in a session. <i>xsm</i> is more powerful because
  it lets you run applications and have them automatically become part of the
  session. On a simple level, <i>xsm</i> is useful because it gives you this
  ability to easily define which applications are in a session. The true power
  of <i>xsm</i>, however, can be taken advantage of when more and more
  applications learn to save and restore their state.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id=".xsession_file"><a class="selflink" href="#.xsession_file">.xsession
  file</a></h2>
Using <i>xsm</i> requires a change to your <i>.xsession</i> file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
The last program executed by your <i>.xsession</i> file should be <i>xsm</i>.
  With this configuration, when the user chooses to shut down the session using
  <i>xsm</i>, the session will truly be over.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since the goal of the session manager is to restart clients when logging into a
  session, your .xsession file, in general, should not directly start up
  applications. Rather, the applications should be started within a session.
  When <i>xsm</i> shuts down the session, <i>xsm</i> will know to restart these
  applications. Note however that there are some types of applications that are
  not &quot;session aware&quot;. <i>xsm</i> allows you to manually add these
  applications to your session (see the section titled <i>Client List</i>).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="SM_SAVE_DIR_environment_variable"><a class="selflink" href="#SM_SAVE_DIR_environment_variable">SM_SAVE_DIR
  environment variable</a></h2>
If the <i>SM_SAVE_DIR</i> environment variable is defined, <i>xsm</i> will save
  all configuration files in this directory. Otherwise, they will be stored in
  the user's home directory. Session aware applications are also encouraged to
  save their checkpoint files in the <i>SM_SAVE_DIR</i> directory, although the
  user should not depend on this convention.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Default_Startup_Applications"><a class="selflink" href="#Default_Startup_Applications">Default
  Startup Applications</a></h2>
The first time <i>xsm</i> is started, it will need to locate a list of
  applications to start up. For example, this list might include a window
  manager, a session management proxy, and an xterm. <i>xsm</i> will first look
  for the file <i>.xsmstartup</i> in the user's home directory. If that file
  does not exist, it will look for the <i>system.xsm</i> file that was set up at
  installation time. Note that <i>xsm</i> provides a &quot;fail safe&quot;
  option when the user chooses a session to start up. The fail safe option
  simply loads the default applications described above.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each line in the startup file should contain a command to start an application.
  A sample startup file might look this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
&lt;start of file&gt;
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
twm
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
smproxy
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
xterm
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
&lt;end of file&gt;
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="STARTING_A_SESSION"><a class="selflink" href="#STARTING_A_SESSION">STARTING
  A SESSION</a></h1>
When <i>xsm</i> starts up, it first checks to see if the user previously saved
  any sessions. If no saved sessions exist, <i>xsm</i> starts up a set of
  default applications (as described above in the section titled <i>Default
  Startup Applications</i>). If at least one session exists, a session menu is
  presented. The <b>[-session sessionName]</b> option forces the specified
  session to be loaded, bypassing the session menu.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_session_menu"><a class="selflink" href="#The_session_menu">The
  session menu</a></h2>
The session menu presents the user with a list of sessions to choose from. The
  user can change the currently selected session with the mouse, or by using the
  up and down arrows on the keyboard. Note that sessions which are locked (i.e.
  running on a different display) can not be loaded or deleted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following operations can be performed from the session menu:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Load Session</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Pressing this button will load the currently selected
      session. Alternatively, hitting the Return key will also load the
      currently selected session, or the user can double click a session from
      the list.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Delete Session</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This operation will delete the currently selected session,
      along with all of the application checkpoint files associated with the
      session. After pressing this button, the user will be asked to press the
      button a second time in order to confirm the operation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Default/Fail Safe</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>xsm</i> will start up a set of default applications (as
      described above in the section titled <i>Default Startup
      Applications</i>). This is useful when the user wants to start a fresh
      session, or if the session configuration files were corrupted and the user
      wants a &quot;fail safe&quot; session.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Cancel</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Pressing this button will cause <i>xsm</i> to exit. It can

After <i>xsm</i> determines which session to load, it brings up its main window,
  then starts up all applications that are part of the session. The title bar
  for the session manager's main window will contain the name of the session
  that was loaded.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following options are available from <i>xsm</i>'s main window:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Client List</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Pressing this button brings up a window containing a list
      of all clients that are in the current session. For each client, the host
      machine that the client is running on is presented. As clients are added
      and removed from the session, this list is updated to reflect the changes.
      The user is able to control how these clients are restarted (see below).
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    By pressing the <b>View Properties</b> button, the user can view the session
      management properties associated with the currently selected client.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    By pressing the <b>Clone</b> button, the user can start a copy of the
      selected application.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    By pressing the <b>Kill Client</b> button, the user can remove a client from
      the session.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    By selecting a restart hint from the <b>Restart Hint</b> menu, the user can
      control the restarting of a client. The following hints are available:
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>-</b> The <b>Restart If Running</b> hint indicates that the client should
      be restarted in the next session if it is connected to the session manager
      at the end of the current session.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>-</b> The <b>Restart Anyway</b> hint indicates that the client should be
      restarted in the next session even if it exits before the current session
      is terminated.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>-</b> The <b>Restart Immediately</b> hint is similar to the <b>Restart
      Anyway</b> hint, but in addition, the client is meant to run continuously.
      If the client exits, the session manager will try to restart it in the
      current session.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>-</b> The <b>Restart Never</b> hint indicates that the client should not
      be restarted in the next session.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that all X applications may not be &quot;session aware&quot;.
      Applications that are not session aware are ones that do not support the X
      Session Management Protocol or they can not be detected by the Session
      Management Proxy (see the section titled <i>THE PROXY</i>). <i>xsm</i>
      allows the user to manually add such applications to the session. The
      bottom of the <i>Client List</i> window contains a text entry field in
      which application commands can be typed in. Each command should go on its
      own line. This information will be saved with the session at checkpoint or
      shutdown time. When the session is restarted, <i>xsm</i> will restart
      these applications in addition to the regular &quot;session aware&quot;
      applications.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Pressing the <b>Done</b> button removes the <b>Client List</b> window.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Session Log...</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The Session Log window presents useful information about
      the session. For example, when a session is restarted, all of the restart
      commands will be displayed in the log window.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Checkpoint</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">By performing a checkpoint, all applications that are in
      the session are asked to save their state. Not every application will save
      its complete state, but at a minimum, the session manager is guaranteed
      that it will receive the command required to restart the application
      (along with all command line options). A window manager participating in
      the session should guarantee that the applications will come back up with
      the same window configurations.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the session being checkpointed was never assigned a name, the user will
      be required to specify a session name. Otherwise, the user can perform the
      checkpoint using the current session name, or a new session name can be
      specified. If the session name specified already exists, the user will be
      given the opportunity to specify a different name or to overwrite the
      already existing session. Note that a session which is locked can not be
      overwritten.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When performing a checkpoint, the user must specify a <b>Save Type</b> which
      informs the applications in the session how much state they should save.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>Local</b> type indicates that the application should save enough
      information to restore the state as seen by the user. It should not affect
      the state as seen by other users. For example, an editor would create a
      temporary file containing the contents of its editing buffer, the location
      of the cursor, etc...
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>Global</b> type indicates that the application should commit all of
      its data to permanent, globally accessible storage. For example, the
      editor would simply save the edited file.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>Both</b> type indicates that the application should do both of these.
      For example, the editor would save the edited file, then create a
      temporary file with information such as the location of the cursor, etc...
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In addition to the <b>Save Type</b>, the user must specify an <b>Interact
      Style</b>.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>None</b> type indicates that the application should not interact with
      the user while saving state.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>Errors</b> type indicates that the application may interact with the
      user only if an error condition arises.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>Any</b> type indicates that the application may interact with the
      user for any purpose. Note that <i>xsm</i> will only allow one application
      to interact with the user at a time.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    After the checkpoint is completed, <i>xsm</i> will, if necessary, display a
      window containing the list of applications which did not report a
      successful save of state.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Shutdown</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A shutdown provides all of the options found in a
      checkpoint, but in addition, can cause the session to exit. Note that if
      the interaction style is <b>Errors</b> or <b>Any</b>, the user may cancel
      the shutdown. The user may also cancel the shutdown if any of the
      applications report an unsuccessful save of state.

  <i>XSM</i> RESPONDS TO SIGNALS</a></h1>
<i>xsm</i> will respond to a SIGTERM signal by performing a shutdown with the
  following options: fast, no interaction, save type local. This allows the
  user's session to be saved when the system is being shutdown. It can also be
  used to perform a remote shutdown of a session.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<i>xsm</i> will respond to a SIGUSR1 signal by performing a checkpoint with the
  following options: no interaction, save type local. This signal can be used to
  perform a remote checkpoint of a session.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_PROXY"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_PROXY">THE
  PROXY</a></h1>
Since not all applications have been ported to support the X Session Management
  Protocol, a proxy service exists to allow &quot;old&quot; clients to work with
  the session manager. In order for the proxy to detect an application joining a
  session, one of the following must be true:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
- The application maps a top level window containing the <b>WM_CLIENT_LEADER</b>
  property. This property provides a pointer to the client leader window which
  contains the <b>WM_CLASS</b>, <b>WM_NAME</b>, <b>WM_COMMAND</b>, and
  <b>WM_CLIENT_MACHINE</b> properties.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
or ...
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
- The application maps a top level window which does not contain the
  <b>WM_CLIENT_LEADER</b> property. However, this top level window contains the
  <b>WM_CLASS</b>, <b>WM_NAME</b>, <b>WM_COMMAND</b>, and
  <b>WM_CLIENT_MACHINE</b> properties.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An application that support the <b>WM_SAVE_YOURSELF</b> protocol will receive a
  <b>WM_SAVE_YOURSELF</b> client message each time the session manager issues a
  checkpoint or shutdown. This allows the application to save state. If an
  application does not support the <b>WM_SAVE_YOURSELF</b> protocol, then the
  proxy will provide enough information to the session manager to restart the
  application (using <b>WM_COMMAND</b>), but no state will be restored.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="REMOTE_APPLICATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#REMOTE_APPLICATIONS">REMOTE
  APPLICATIONS</a></h1>
<i>xsm</i> requires a remote execution protocol in order to restart applications
  on remote machines. Currently, <i>xsm</i> supports the <i>rstart</i> protocol.
  In order to restart an application on remote machine <b>X</b>, machine
  <b>X</b> must have <i>rstart</i> installed. In the future, additional remote
  execution protocols may be supported.
