<p>XSM(1) General Commands Manual XSM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xsm - X Session Manager</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xsm [-display display] [-session sessionName] [-verbose]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
xsm is a session manager. A session is a group of
applications, each of which has a particular state. xsm
allows you to create arbitrary sessions - for example, you
might have <br>
a &quot;light&quot; session, a &quot;development&quot;
session, or an &quot;xterminal&quot; session. Each session
can have its own set of applications. Within a session, you
can perform a &quot;checkpoint&quot; to <br>
save application state, or a &quot;shutdown&quot; to save
state and exit the session. When you log back in to the
system, you can load a specific session, and you can delete
sessions you <br>
no longer want to keep.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some session managers simply
allow you to manually specify a list of applications to be
started in a session. xsm is more powerful because it lets
you run applications and have <br>
them automatically become part of the session. On a simple
level, xsm is useful because it gives you this ability to
easily define which applications are in a session. The true
<br>
power of xsm, however, can be taken advantage of when more
and more applications learn to save and restore their
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-display display <br>
Causes xsm to connect to the specified X display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-session sessionName <br>
Causes xsm to load the specified session, bypassing the
session menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Turns on debugging information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETUP <br>
.xsession file <br>
Using xsm requires a change to your .xsession file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last program executed by
your .xsession file should be xsm. With this configuration,
when the user chooses to shut down the session using xsm,
the session will truly be <br>
over.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the goal of the session
manager is to restart clients when logging into a session,
your .xsession file, in general, should not directly start
up applications. Rather, the <br>
applications should be started within a session. When xsm
shuts down the session, xsm will know to restart these
applications. Note however that there are some types of
appli&acirc; <br>
cations that are not &quot;session aware&quot;. xsm allows
you to manually add these applications to your session (see
the section titled Client List).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SM_SAVE_DIR environment variable
<br>
If the SM_SAVE_DIR environment variable is defined, xsm will
save all configuration files in this directory. Otherwise,
they will be stored in the user&rsquo;s home directory.
Ses&acirc; <br>
sion aware applications are also encouraged to save their
checkpoint files in the SM_SAVE_DIR directory, although the
user should not depend on this convention.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default Startup Applications
<br>
The first time xsm is started, it will need to locate a list
of applications to start up. For example, this list might
include a window manager, a session management proxy, and
<br>
an xterm. xsm will first look for the file .xsmstartup in
the user&rsquo;s home directory. If that file does not
exist, it will look for the system.xsm file that was set up
at <br>
installation time. Note that xsm provides a &quot;fail
safe&quot; option when the user chooses a session to start
up. The fail safe option simply loads the default
applications described <br>
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each line in the startup file
should contain a command to start an application. A sample
startup file might look this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;start of file&gt; <br>
twm <br>
smproxy <br>
xterm <br>
&lt;end of file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STARTING A SESSION <br>
When xsm starts up, it first checks to see if the user
previously saved any sessions. If no saved sessions exist,
xsm starts up a set of default applications (as described
above <br>
in the section titled Default Startup Applications). If at
least one session exists, a session menu is presented. The
[-session sessionName] option forces the specified session
<br>
to be loaded, bypassing the session menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The session menu <br>
The session menu presents the user with a list of sessions
to choose from. The user can change the currently selected
session with the mouse, or by using the up and down arrows
<br>
on the keyboard. Note that sessions which are locked (i.e.
running on a different display) can not be loaded or
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following operations can be
performed from the session menu:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Load Session Pressing this
button will load the currently selected session.
Alternatively, hitting the Return key will also load the
currently selected session, or the <br>
user can double click a session from the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete Session This operation
will delete the currently selected session, along with all
of the application checkpoint files associated with the
session. After pressing <br>
this button, the user will be asked to press the button a
second time in order to confirm the operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default/Fail Safe xsm will start
up a set of default applications (as described above in the
section titled Default Startup Applications). This is useful
when the user wants <br>
to start a fresh session, or if the session configuration
files were corrupted and the user wants a &quot;fail
safe&quot; session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cancel Pressing this button will
cause xsm to exit. It can also be used to cancel a
&quot;Delete Session&quot; operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTROLLING A SESSION <br>
After xsm determines which session to load, it brings up its
main window, then starts up all applications that are part
of the session. The title bar for the session
manager&rsquo;s <br>
main window will contain the name of the session that was
loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
available from xsm&rsquo;s main window:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Client List Pressing this button
brings up a window containing a list of all clients that are
in the current session. For each client, the host machine
that the client is <br>
running on is presented. As clients are added and removed
from the session, this list is updated to reflect the
changes. The user is able to control how these <br>
clients are restarted (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By pressing the View Properties
button, the user can view the session management properties
associated with the currently selected client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By pressing the Clone button,
the user can start a copy of the selected application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By pressing the Kill Client
button, the user can remove a client from the session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By selecting a restart hint from
the Restart Hint menu, the user can control the restarting
of a client. The following hints are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The Restart If Running hint
indicates that the client should be restarted in the next
session if it is connected to the session manager at the end
of the cur&acirc; <br>
rent session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The Restart Anyway hint
indicates that the client should be restarted in the next
session even if it exits before the current session is
terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The Restart Immediately hint
is similar to the Restart Anyway hint, but in addition, the
client is meant to run continuously. If the client exits,
the ses&acirc; <br>
sion manager will try to restart it in the current
session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The Restart Never hint
indicates that the client should not be restarted in the
next session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that all X applications may
not be &quot;session aware&quot;. Applications that are not
session aware are ones that do not support the X Session
Management Protocol <br>
or they can not be detected by the Session Management Proxy
(see the section titled THE PROXY). xsm allows the user to
manually add such applications to the <br>
session. The bottom of the Client List window contains a
text entry field in which application commands can be typed
in. Each command should go on its own <br>
line. This information will be saved with the session at
checkpoint or shutdown time. When the session is restarted,
xsm will restart these applications in <br>
addition to the regular &quot;session aware&quot;
applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pressing the Done button removes
the Client List window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Session Log... The Session Log
window presents useful information about the session. For
example, when a session is restarted, all of the restart
commands will be displayed <br>
in the log window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Checkpoint By performing a
checkpoint, all applications that are in the session are
asked to save their state. Not every application will save
its complete state, but at <br>
a minimum, the session manager is guaranteed that it will
receive the command required to restart the application
(along with all command line options). A win&acirc; <br>
dow manager participating in the session should guarantee
that the applications will come back up with the same window
configurations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the session being
checkpointed was never assigned a name, the user will be
required to specify a session name. Otherwise, the user can
perform the check&acirc; <br>
point using the current session name, or a new session name
can be specified. If the session name specified already
exists, the user will be given the opportu&acirc; <br>
nity to specify a different name or to overwrite the already
existing session. Note that a session which is locked can
not be overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When performing a checkpoint,
the user must specify a Save Type which informs the
applications in the session how much state they should
save.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Local type indicates that
the application should save enough information to restore
the state as seen by the user. It should not affect the
state as seen <br>
by other users. For example, an editor would create a
temporary file containing the contents of its editing
buffer, the location of the cursor, etc...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Global type indicates that
the application should commit all of its data to permanent,
globally accessible storage. For example, the editor would
simply <br>
save the edited file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Both type indicates that the
application should do both of these. For example, the editor
would save the edited file, then create a temporary file
with <br>
information such as the location of the cursor, etc...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the Save Type,
the user must specify an Interact Style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The None type indicates that the
application should not interact with the user while saving
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Errors type indicates that
the application may interact with the user only if an error
condition arises.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Any type indicates that the
application may interact with the user for any purpose. Note
that xsm will only allow one application to interact with
the user <br>
at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the checkpoint is
completed, xsm will, if necessary, display a window
containing the list of applications which did not report a
successful save of state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shutdown A shutdown provides all
of the options found in a checkpoint, but in addition, can
cause the session to exit. Note that if the interaction
style is Errors or <br>
Any, the user may cancel the shutdown. The user may also
cancel the shutdown if any of the applications report an
unsuccessful save of state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user may choose to shutdown
the session with our without performing a checkpoint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW XSM RESPONDS TO SIGNALS <br>
xsm will respond to a SIGTERM signal by performing a
shutdown with the following options: fast, no interaction,
save type local. This allows the user&rsquo;s session to be
saved when <br>
the system is being shutdown. It can also be used to perform
a remote shutdown of a session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xsm will respond to a SIGUSR1
signal by performing a checkpoint with the following
options: no interaction, save type local. This signal can be
used to perform a remote check&acirc; <br>
point of a session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE PROXY <br>
Since not all applications have been ported to support the X
Session Management Protocol, a proxy service exists to allow
&quot;old&quot; clients to work with the session manager. In
<br>
order for the proxy to detect an application joining a
session, one of the following must be true:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The application maps a top
level window containing the WM_CLIENT_LEADER property. This
property provides a pointer to the client leader window
which contains the WM_CLASS, <br>
WM_NAME, WM_COMMAND, and WM_CLIENT_MACHINE properties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The application maps a top
level window which does not contain the WM_CLIENT_LEADER
property. However, this top level window contains the
WM_CLASS, WM_NAME, WM_COMMAND, and <br>
WM_CLIENT_MACHINE properties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An application that support the
WM_SAVE_YOURSELF protocol will receive a WM_SAVE_YOURSELF
client message each time the session manager issues a
checkpoint or shutdown. This <br>
allows the application to save state. If an application does
not support the WM_SAVE_YOURSELF protocol, then the proxy
will provide enough information to the session manager to
<br>
restart the application (using WM_COMMAND), but no state
will be restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMOTE APPLICATIONS <br>
xsm requires a remote execution protocol in order to restart
applications on remote machines. Currently, xsm supports the
rstart protocol. In order to restart an application on <br>
remote machine X, machine X must have rstart installed. In
the future, additional remote execution protocols may be
supported.</p>
