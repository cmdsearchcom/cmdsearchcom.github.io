<p>MULTIXTERM(1) General Commands Manual MULTIXTERM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
multixterm - drive multiple xterms separately or
together</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
multixterm [ args ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Multixterm creates multiple xterms that can be driven
together or separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In its simplest form, multixterm
is run with no arguments and commands are interactively
entered in the first entry field. Press return (or click the
&quot;new xterm&quot; button) to cre&acirc; <br>
ate a new xterm running that command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keystrokes in the &quot;stdin
window&quot; are redirected to all xterms started by
multixterm. xterms may be driven separately simply by
focusing on them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The stdin window must have the
focus for keystrokes to be sent to the xterms. When it has
the focus, the color changes to aquamarine. As characters
are entered, the color <br>
changes to green for a second. This provides feedback since
characters are not echoed in the stdin window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typing in the stdin window while
holding down the alt or meta keys sends an escape character
before the typed characters. This provides support for
programs such as emacs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
-xa The optional -xa argument indicates arguments to pass to
xterm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xc The optional -xc argument
indicates a command to be run in each named xterm (see -xn).
With no -xc argument, the command is the current shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xd The optional -xd argument
indicates a directory to search for files that will appear
in the Files menu. By default, the directory is:
~/lib/multixterm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xf The optional -xf argument
indicates a file to be read at startup. See FILES below for
more info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xn The optional -xn argument
indicates a name for each xterm. This name will also be
substituted for any %n in the command argument (see
-xc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xv The optional -xv flag puts
multixterm into a verbose mode where it will describe some
of the things it is doing internally. The verbose output is
not intended to be <br>
understandable to anyone but the author.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Less common options may be
changed by the startup file (see FILES below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the usual X and wish flags
are supported (i.e., -display, -name). There are so many of
them that to avoid colliding and make them easy to remember,
all the multixterm flags <br>
begin with -x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any arguments do not match
the flags above, the remainder of the command line is made
available for user processing. By default, the remainder is
used as a list of xterm <br>
names in the style of -xn. The default behavior may be
changed using the .multixtermrc file (see DOT FILE
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
<br>
The following command line starts up two xterms using ssh to
the hosts bud and dexter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">multixterm -xc &quot;ssh
%n&quot; bud dexter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Command files may be used to drive or initialize multixterm.
The File menu may be used to invoke other files. If files
exist in the command file directory (see -xd above), they
<br>
will appear in the File menu. Files may also be loaded by
using File-&gt;Open. Any filename is acceptable but the
File-&gt;Open browser defaults to files with a .mxt
suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files are written in Tcl and may
change any variables or invoke any procedures. The primary
variables of interest are &rsquo;xtermCmd&rsquo; which
identifies the command (see -xc) and <br>
&rsquo;xtermNames&rsquo; which is a list of names (see -xn).
The procedure xtermStartAll, starts xterms for each name in
the list. Other variables and procedures may be discovered
by exam&acirc; <br>
ining multixterm itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE FILE <br>
The following file does the same thing as the earlier
example command line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># start two xterms connected to
bud and dexter <br>
set xtermCmd &quot;ssh %n&quot; <br>
set xtermNames {bud dexter} <br>
xtermStartAll</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOT FILE <br>
At startup, multixterm reads ~/.multixtermrc if present.
This is similar to the command files (see FILES above)
except that .multixtermrc may not call xtermStartAll.
Instead it <br>
is called implicitly, similar to the way that it is implicit
in the command line use of -xn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example
.multixtermrc file makes every xterm run ssh to the hosts
named on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set xtermCmd &quot;ssh
%n&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then multixterm could be called
simply:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">multixterm bud dexter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any command-line argument
does not match a multixterm flag, the remainder of the
command line is made available to .multixtermrc in the argv
variable. If argv is non-empty <br>
when .multixtermrc returns, it is assigned to xtermNames
unless xtermNames is non-empty in which case, the content of
argv is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands from multixterm are
evaluated early in the initialization of multixterm.
Anything that must be done late in the initialization (such
as adding additional bindings to <br>
the user interface) may be done by putting the commands
inside a procedure called &quot;initLate&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MENUS <br>
Except as otherwise noted, the menus are self-explanatory.
Some of the menus have dashed lines as the first entry.
Clicking on the dashed lines will &quot;tear off&quot; the
menus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE SUGGESTION - ALIASES AND
COMMAND FILES <br>
Aliases may be used to store lengthy command-line
invocations. Command files can be also be used to store such
invocations as well as providing a convenient way to share
config&acirc; <br>
urations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tcl is a general-purpose
language. Thus multixterm command files can be extremely
flexible, such as loading hostnames from other programs or
files that may change from day-to- <br>
day. In addition, command files can be used for other
purposes. For example, command files may be used to prepared
common canned interaction sequences. For example, the
com&acirc; <br>
mand to send the same string to all xterms is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xtermSend &quot;a particularly
long string&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The File menu (torn-off) makes
canned sequences particularly convenient. Interactions could
also be bound to a mouse button, keystroke, or added to a
menu via the .multixtermrc <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following .multixtermrc
causes tiny xterms to tile across and down the screen. (You
may have to adjust the parameters for your screen.) This can
be very helpful when deal&acirc; <br>
ing with large numbers of xterms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set yPos 0 <br>
set xPos 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trace variable xtermArgs r
traceArgs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">proc traceArgs {args} { <br>
global xPos yPos <br>
set ::xtermArgs &quot;-geometry 80x12+$xPos+$yPos -font
6x10&quot; <br>
if {$xPos} { <br>
set xPos 0 <br>
incr yPos 145 <br>
if {$yPos &gt; 800} {set yPos 0} <br>
} else { <br>
set xPos 500 <br>
} <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The xtermArgs variable in the
code above is the variable corresponding to the -xa
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xterms can be also be created
directly. The following command file creates three xterms
overlapped horizontally:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set xPos 0 <br>
foreach name {bud dexter hotdog} { <br>
set ::xtermArgs &quot;-geometry 80x12+$xPos+0 -font
6x10&quot; <br>
set ::xtermNames $name <br>
xtermStartAll <br>
incr xPos 300 <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE SUGGESTION - SELECTING
HOSTS BY NICKNAME <br>
The following .multixtermrc shows an example of changing the
default handling of the arguments from hostnames to a
filename containing hostnames:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set xtermNames [exec cat
$argv]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following is a variation,
retrieving the host names from the yp database:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set xtermNames [exec ypcat
$argv]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following hardcodes two sets
of hosts, so that you can call multixterm with either
&quot;cluster1&quot; or &quot;cluster2&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">switch $argv { <br>
cluster1 { <br>
set xtermNames &quot;bud dexter&quot; <br>
} <br>
cluster2 { <br>
set xtermNames &quot;frank hotdog weiner&quot; <br>
} <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPARE/CONTRAST <br>
It is worth comparing multixterm to xkibitz. Multixterm
connects a separate process to each xterm. xkibitz connects
the same process to each xterm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
Multixterm provides no way to remotely control scrollbars,
resize, and most other window system related functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because xterm has no mechanism
for propagating size information to external processes,
particularly for character graphic applications (e.g., vi,
emacs), you may have to manually <br>
ensure that the spawned process behind each xterm has the
correct size. For example, if you create or set the xterm to
a size, you may have to send an explicit stty command with
<br>
the correct size to the spawned process(es). Alternatively,
you can add the correct size argument when an xterm is
created (i.e., &quot;-geometry 80x20&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multixterm can only control new
xterms that multixterm itself has started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a convenience, the File menu
shows a limited number of files. To show all the files, use
File-&gt;Open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$DOTDIR/.multixtermrc initial command file <br>
~/.multixtermrc fallback command file <br>
~/lib/multixterm/ default command file directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If multixterm is killed using an uncatchable kill, the
xterms are not killed. This appears to be a bug in xterm
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send/expect sequences can be
done in multixterm command files. However, due to the
richness of the possibilities, to document it properly would
take more time than the author <br>
has at present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIREMENTS <br>
Requires Expect 5.36.0 or later. <br>
Requires Tk 8.3.3 or later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION <br>
This man page describes version 1.8 of multixterm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The latest version of multixterm
is available from http://expect.nist.gov/example/multixterm
. If your version of Expect and Tk are too old (see
REQUIREMENTS above), download a <br>
new version of Expect from http://expect.nist.gov</p>
