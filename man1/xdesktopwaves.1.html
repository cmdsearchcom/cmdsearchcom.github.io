<p>xdesktopwaves(1) General Commands Manual
xdesktopwaves(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xdesktopwaves - simulation of water waves on the X Windows
desktop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xdesktopwaves [option]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
xdesktopwaves is a cellular automata setting the background
of your X Windows desktop under water. Windows and mouse are
like ships on the sea. Each movement of these ends up <br>
in moving water waves. You can even have rain and/or storm
stirring up the water (-rain 0-10, -storm 0-10).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In shaped mode, which is enabled
by default, xdesktopwaves usually works good together with
other desktop background programs like xfishtank, xpenguins,
xsnow and xearth. They <br>
are all under water.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xdesktopwaves has many options.
The most important ones are -quality 0-9 and -colortheme
0-9. The first one is for adjusting the balance between
display quality and system <br>
load. And the other option is for selecting a set of colors
for visualization. Choose a color theme suitable for your
background picture. There are even options for
fine-tun&acirc; <br>
ing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Window Managers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are using the KDE window
manager, please enable &quot;Allow programs in desktop
window&quot; in the KDE desktop configuration (right-click
on the desktop and choose &quot;Configure Desk&acirc; <br>
top&quot;). Otherwise xdesktopwaves may not be visible. If
you are using Enlightenment 0.16 with &quot;Multiple
Desktops&quot; instead of &quot;Virtual Desktops&quot;,
xdesktopwaves appears always on <br>
the first desktop. A solution is -wmbackdrop, but read the
comments on that option. With most other window managers
xdesktopwaves should work without difficulties. If not, try
<br>
-root, -wmbackdrop or -window, and/or -opaque.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If supported by the window
manager, you should decide to enable opaque moving and
resizing of windows (&quot;display content in moving
windows&quot; or something like that), instead of <br>
displaying just a frame. This may result in very dynamic
wave effects - try to pile up a big wave by moving a window
slowly. But: unfortunately some window managers seem to be
<br>
very CPU-intensive while moving a window opaque. In that
case xdesktopwaves does not perform very smooth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting and stopping</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a first try, open a shell
and type xdesktopwaves followed by desired options.
Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xdesktopwaves -quality 4
-colortheme 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Just press CTRL-C for
stopping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, if you want to create menu
entries in your desktop environment, window manager or
wherever: For starting, create an entry containing a command
like the example above. And <br>
for stopping, create an entry containing this command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xdesktopwaves -end</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hint: Whenever xdesktopwaves is
starting, it automatically tells other instances of
xdesktopwaves to terminate. So there cannot be more than one
instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xdesktopwaves every day?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Depending on the quality
settings, xdesktopwaves can be very CPU-intensive. To get
along with this, the program goes into an idle mode if there
are no waves on the water or if <br>
the output window is obscured. The cellular automata stops
computing in that mode. Additionally, you can give a lower
priority to the xdesktopwaves process (see -nice).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to have
xdesktopwaves automatically started when starting X Windows,
insert the start command in the file $HOME/.xinitrc (see
startx(1)). But don&rsquo;t forget to append <br>
&amp; to the command. This way, xdesktopwaves is started
before the window manager (may or may not work, depending on
the type of window manager).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL OPTIONS <br>
-h or -help <br>
Print a short help and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V or -version <br>
Print version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v or -verbose <br>
Print some information about what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vv or -veryverbose <br>
Print much information (for debugging).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d name or -display name <br>
Connect to the display named name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e or -end <br>
Exit after terminating a possibly already existing instance
of xdesktopwaves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINDOW CREATION OPTIONS <br>
-r or -root <br>
Do not create any window, draw the waves to the (virtual)
root window. This option implies -stippled if not
-opaque.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b or -backdrop (default) <br>
Create an override-redirect backdrop window on the (virtual)
root window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wmb or -wmbackdrop <br>
Create a backdrop window using the extended window manager
hints. This is not supported by every window manager. And if
it is, there&rsquo;s still the problem that it may not <br>
be possible to activate icons or menus on the desktop
background (possibly just at every second scan-line in
shaped mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w or -window <br>
Create an ordinary normal window. For some window managers
you&rsquo;ll even have to give -opaque.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRANSPARENCY OPTIONS <br>
-o or -opaque <br>
Have no transparency at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t or -stippled <br>
Have faked transparency. This lets the desktop background
picture shine through. Other desktop background programs and
desktop icons may not be visible. The window of <br>
xdesktopwaves inherits the background from the root window,
and the waves are drawn in stippled mode. This option
implies -nodoublebuffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s or -shaped (default) <br>
Have better transparency. Everything behind xdesktopwaves
shines through. The window of xdesktopwaves is shaped by
every second scan-line, using the XShape extension. <br>
This option is ignored if -root, otherwise this option
implies -doublebuffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wmo percent or -wmopacity
percent <br>
Have best transparency. This is still highly experimental!
It sets the window property _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY, which is
a hint for the window manager respectively com&acirc; <br>
posite manager to render the window with alpha blending.
This option is ignored if -root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERFORMANCE OPTIONS <br>
-q number or -quality number (default: 5) <br>
Set overall quality of the waves. number can be 0 to 9. The
higher the quality, the higher the CPU/network load. This
option is a comfortable alternative for -framer&acirc; <br>
ate, -simsperframe, -eventsperframe, -resdivision, -cellsize
and -maxcolors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fr rate or -framerate rate <br>
Set maximum frame rate in hertz. This option is overridden
by -quality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sf count or -simsperframe count
<br>
Set number of simulation steps per frame. Hereby you can
adapt the speed of the waves. This option is overridden by
-quality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ef count or -eventsperframe
count <br>
Set number of event processings per frame. This can improve
the trails of fast moving objects (mouse and windows), but
it can even incur a sensible higher CPU load, <br>
because of a worse cache utilization. Maximum is the number
of simulation steps per frame. This option is overridden by
-quality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rd rdx rdy or -resdivision rdx
rdy <br>
Set overall division of resolution in x and y direction.
These values have dramatic influence on the CPU usage on
both sides, the client and the server. This option is <br>
overridden by -quality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cs cw ch or -cellsize cw ch
<br>
Set width and height of the cells of water. These values
have dramatic influence on the CPU usage on the client side.
The water surface is made of rectangular cells. <br>
This is a kind of an image, where each pixel is a cell. For
each frame, that image is scaled up to the screen size in
two steps. In the first step it is scaled by (cw, <br>
ch) with bi-linear interpolation, and in the second step it
is scaled by (rdx, rdy) without interpolation. This option
is overridden by -quality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mc count or -maxcolors count
<br>
Set maximum number of colors for drawing the waves. The
higher the color count, the more rectangles may be sent to
the X server. count can be 2 to 128. This option is <br>
overridden by -quality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-db or -doublebuffer (default)
<br>
Draw with double buffering. This option is ignored if
-stippled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ndb or -nodoublebuffer <br>
Draw without double buffering. This option is ignored if
-shaped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n increment or -nice increment
(default: 0) <br>
Increment nice value of the xdesktopwaves process. The
higher the nice value, the lower the process priority. A
typical value for increment is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i or -idle (default) <br>
Go idle if there are no waves or if the output window is
obscured. This can spare CPU cycles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ni or -noidle <br>
Never go idle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mo number or -maxoptimization
number (default: 2) <br>
Set maximum optimization by CPU instruction set. If compiled
with GCC for x86 (32 or 64-bit), 1 means MMX and 2 means
SSE2. 0 means to have no special optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLOR OPTIONS <br>
-c number or -colortheme number (default: 0) <br>
Select a color theme. number can be 0 to 9. Just try them
through. This option is a comfortable alternative for
-watercolor, -skycolor and -lightcolor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wc color or -watercolor color
<br>
Set color of water. This option is overridden by
-colortheme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sc color or -skycolor color
<br>
Set color of sky reflections. This option is overridden by
-colortheme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lc color or -lightcolor color
<br>
Set color of light reflections. This option is overridden by
-colortheme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PHYSICS OPTIONS <br>
-wm or -wavesbymouse (default) <br>
Produce waves by mouse pointer movements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nwm or -nowavesbymouse <br>
Ignore the mouse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ww or -wavesbywindows (default)
<br>
Produce waves by client windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nww or -nowavesbywindows <br>
Ignore client windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rn intensity or -rain intensity
(default: 0) <br>
Simulate raindrops falling on the water. intensity can be 0
(no rain) to 10 (cloudburst).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-st intensity or -storm
intensity (default: 0) <br>
Simulate a storm blowing on the water. intensity can be 0
(no wind) to 10 (strong storm).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vs value or -viscosity value
(default: 3) <br>
Set viscosity of the fluid. value can be 1 to 5. The higher
the viscosity, the shorter the lifetime of waves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-si intensity or -skyintensity
intensity (default: 5) <br>
Set intensity of sky reflections. intensity can be 1 to
10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-li intensity or -lightintensity
intensity (default: 5) <br>
Set intensity of light reflections. intensity can be 1 to
10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lal degrees or -lightaltitude
degrees (default: 30) <br>
Set altitude of the source of light. degrees can be 0 to
90.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-laz degrees or -lightazimuth
degrees (default: -35) <br>
Set azimuth of the source of light. degrees can be -360 to
360.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
xdesktopwaves -quality 6 -colortheme 1 -verbose <br>
Increased quality. Blue color theme. Print information about
settings and performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xdesktopwaves -q 6 -c 1 -v <br>
Short cut of the previous example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xdesktopwaves -c 2 -rn 8 -r -o
