<p>fmerge(1) General Commands Manual fmerge(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fmerge - merge files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fmerge [ option... ] basefile fileA fileB</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fmerge -Help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fmerge -VERSion</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The fmerge program is used to compare the changes between
two different descendants of a base file, and creates an
output file which contains both sets of changes. This is
use&acirc; <br>
ful when two users both take the same version of a file and
make independent edits to it, and then later want to create
a file which contains both sets of edits. In such a use,
<br>
the original file that both sets of edits is derived from is
called the base file. The two files containing the edits are
called file A and file B.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command: <br>
fmerge basefile fileA fileB -o outputfile <br>
produces the output file which contains the edits contained
in file A and file B, based on the base file . If the
-Output option was not used, or if no outputfile is
specified, <br>
then the merged lines are typed to the standard output. The
order of specifying file A and file B is usually
unimportant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fmerge program can also be
used to remove earlier edits made to a module. To do this,
make the version containing the edits you want to delete be
the basefile. Make the <br>
version previous to the edit you want deleted be file A.
Finally, make the most recent version of the file which
contains the other edits (including the one you want
deleted) be <br>
file B. Then the result of merging will be the newest
version of the module minus the changes made by the edit you
wanted removed. For example, if three successive versions of
<br>
some module have the names edit10, edit11 and edit12, and
you want the changes done by edit11 to be undone, but still
want the changes done by edit12, then you use the command:
<br>
fmerge edit11 edit10 edit12 -o outputfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While merging the two sets of
edits, fmerge may discover conflicts. A conflict occurs when
the same line of the base file is changed by both of the two
sets of edits. The <br>
change can be due to new lines being inserted, lines being
deleted, or both. When conflicts occur, the output file
contains conflict identification lines, which are lines
con&acirc; <br>
taining the string &rsquo;/&acirc;/&acirc;/&acirc;/&rsquo;.
These lines indicate the region where the two sets of edits
are incompatible. You must then edit the output file and
remove these lines, and in <br>
addition correct the conflicts manually in order to produce
the correct result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are understood:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Conflicts [ conflictfile ] <br>
Since conflicts due to deletions are invisible in the output
file, and inserts do not specify which of the two edits
inserted the lines, there is an alternative output <br>
format from the fmerge program. This output format describes
what happens to each line of the base file, so that
conflicts are easier to detect and fix. The command: <br>
fmerge basefile fileA fileB -c conflictfile <br>
produces the file describing the results of the merge in
detail. If the -Conflicts option is specified without any
conflictfile name, then the conflicts are send to the <br>
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are conflicts, and the
-Conflicts options is not specified, the fmerge program will
exit with a status of 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The conflict file contains lines
which contain three characters and then some text. The first
three characters describe what is happening to the base file
at that point. <br>
These characters are the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IA This line was inserted by
file A.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DA This line was deleted by file
A.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IB This line was inserted by
file B.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DB This line was deleted by file
B.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;blanks&gt; <br>
This line is unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X This is a conflict
identification line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U There are unspecified
unchanged lines here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each set of conflicts is flagged
by three identification lines. The first line indicates the
beginning of the conflict, and specifies the line numbers
for the base file <br>
and two divergent files. The second conflict identification
line separates lines changed by file A from lines changed by
file B. The third conflict identification indi&acirc; <br>
cates the end of the conflict.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can edit this conflict file
to remove the conflicts. This involves deleting the conflict
identification lines, and changing the conflicting lines as
necessary to fix <br>
the conflict. While doing this, remember to leave three
blank characters at the front of any new lines you insert
while correcting the conflicts. When you are done, <br>
there should be no lines which begin with an &rsquo;X&rsquo;
in the file. All other lines can remain. Then you can use
the command: <br>
fmerge conflictfile -o outputfile <br>
to create the new output file which has the desired data.
Once again, if no -Output option or outputfile is used, the
output is send to the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Unchanged number <br>
Besides physical conflicts, there can be logical conflicts.
These are changes made to different lines in the base file
such that the program is no longer correct. Such <br>
conflicts cannot be detected by a program, and so these must
be checked manually. In order to make this process easier,
the -Unchanged option can be used to reduce the <br>
size of the conflict file to only include regions near
changed lines. This file can then be examined in order to
detect possible logical conflicts. As an example, the <br>
command: <br>
fmerge basefile fileA fileB -c -u 3 <br>
will send to the standard output all changes made by either
sets of edits, with only three unchanged lines surrounding
each edit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using the -Unchanged
option, the conflict file will contain lines starting with
&rsquo;U&rsquo;. These represent unchanged lines, and the
number following the letter is the <br>
number of unchanged lines. The resulting conflict file
cannot be read to produce an output file because of the
missing lines. If this is attempted, an error will be <br>
generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to use both
-Output and -Conflicts in the same command. Thus you can
produce the output file which you hope is correct, and also
produce the conflict file <br>
which you can use to check for logical conflicts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Verbose [ number ] <br>
This option can be specified with any other action, and
outputs status information about the progress of the action.
This is useful for debugging of problems, or just <br>
for amusement when the system is slow or a large file is
being processed. It accepts a numeric argument to indicate
the verbosity for output. The levels are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 No output at all (except for
errors).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Single&acirc;line output
describing action (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Detailed status as action
proceeds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Failures number <br>
This option restricts the number of physical conflicts that
are allowed before failing. This is used if you are not
interested in the results if there are too many con&acirc;
<br>
flicts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Help <br>
Give some help on how to use the fmerge program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ignore <br>
Ignore all conflicts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ignore_Identical_Conflicts <br>
The option may be used to suppress conflicts which make
identical deletes, or identical inserts, or identical
changes. This is often desirable when merging two source
<br>
code branches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-VERSion <br>
Show what version of fmerge is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options may be abbreviated;
the abbreviation is documented as the upper case letters,
all lower case letters and underscores (_) are optional. You
must use consecutive <br>
sequences of optional letters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options are case
insensitive, you may type them in upper case or lower case
or a combination of both, case is not important.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example: the arguments
&quot;-help, &quot;-HELP&quot; and &quot;-h&quot; are all
interpreted to mean the -Help option. The argument
&quot;-hlp&quot; will not be understood, because consecutive
optional char&acirc; <br>
acters were not supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options and other command line
arguments may be mixed arbitrarily on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GNU long option names are
understood. Since all option names for fmerge are long, this
means ignoring the extra leading &rsquo;-&rsquo;. The
&quot;-option=value&quot; convention is also under&acirc;
<br>
stood.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE NAME EXPANSION <br>
As a convenience, if a pathname begins with a period and a
environment variable exists with that name, then the value
of the environment variable will be used as the actual
path&acirc; <br>
name. For example, if a environment variable of .FOO has the
value this.is.a.long.name, then the command <br>
fmerge -o .FOO <br>
is actually equivilant to the command <br>
fmerge -o this.is.a.long.name <br>
If you want to prevent the expansion of a pathname which
begins with a period, then you can use an alternate form for
the pathname, as in: <br>
fmerge -o ./.FOO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BINARY FILES <br>
In general, fmerge can handle all text files you throw at
it, even international text with unusual encodings. However,
fmerge is unable to cope elegantly with files which
con&acirc; <br>
tain the NUL character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fcomp(1) program simply
prints a warning, and continues, you need to know that it
converts NUL characters into an 0x80 value before performing
the comparison.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fmerge(1) program also
converts the NUL character to an 0x80 value before merging,
after a warning, and any output file will contain this
value, rather than the original NUL <br>
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fhist(1) program, however,
generates a fatal error if any input file contains NUL
characters. This is intended to protect your source files
for unintentional corruption. <br>
Use -BINary for files which absolutely must contain NUL
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The fmerge program will exit with a status of 1 on any
error. The fmerge program will only exit with a status of 0
if there are no errors.</p>
