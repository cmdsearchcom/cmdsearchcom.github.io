The <i>fmerge</i> program is used to compare the changes between two different
  descendants of a base file, and creates an output file which contains both
  sets of changes. This is useful when two users both take the same version of a
  file and make independent edits to it, and then later want to create a file
  which contains both sets of edits. In such a use, the original file that both
  sets of edits is derived from is called the <i>base file</i>. The two files
  containing the edits are called <i>file A</i> and <i>file B</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The command:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">fmerge basefile fileA fileB -o
  outputfile</div>
produces the output file which contains the edits contained in <i>file A</i> and
  <i>file B</i>, based on the <i>base file .</i> If the <b>-Output</b> option
  was not used, or if no outputfile is specified, then the merged lines are
  typed to the standard output. The order of specifying <i>file A and</i>
  <i>file B</i> is usually unimportant.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>fmerge</i> program can also be used to remove earlier edits made to a
  module. To do this, make the version containing the edits you want to delete
  be the basefile. Make the version previous to the edit you want deleted be
  file A. Finally, make the most recent version of the file which contains the
  other edits (including the one you want deleted) be file B. Then the result of
  merging will be the newest version of the module minus the changes made by the
  edit you wanted removed. For example, if three successive versions of some
  module have the names <i>edit10</i>, <i>edit11</i> and <i>edit12</i>, and you
  want the changes done by <i>edit11</i> to be undone, but still want the
  changes done by <i>edit12</i>, then you use the command:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">fmerge edit11 edit10 edit12 -o
  outputfile</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
While merging the two sets of edits, fmerge may discover conflicts. A conflict
  occurs when the same line of the base file is changed by both of the two sets
  of edits. The change can be due to new lines being inserted, lines being
  deleted, or both. When conflicts occur, the output file contains conflict
  identification lines, which are lines containing the string
  <i>'/&#x2212;/&#x2212;/&#x2212;/'</i>. These lines indicate the region where
  the two sets of edits are incompatible. You must then edit the output file and
  remove these lines, and in addition correct the conflicts manually in order to
  produce the correct result.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The following options are understood:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Conflicts</b> [ <i>conflictfile</i> ]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Since conflicts due to deletions are invisible
  in the output file, and inserts do not specify which of the two edits inserted
  the lines, there is an alternative output format from the <i>fmerge</i>
  program. This output format describes what happens to each line of the base
  file, so that conflicts are easier to detect and fix. The command:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">fmerge basefile fileA fileB -c
  conflictfile</div>
produces the file describing the results of the merge in detail. If the
  <b>-Conflicts</b> option is specified without any conflictfile name, then the
  conflicts are send to the standard output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If there are conflicts, and the <b>-Conflicts</b> options is not specified, the
  <i>fmerge</i> program will exit with a status of 1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The conflict file contains lines which contain three characters and then some
  text. The first three characters describe what is happening to the base file
  at that point. These characters are the following:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">IA</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This line was inserted by file A.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">DA</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This line was deleted by file A.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">IB</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This line was inserted by file B.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">DB</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This line was deleted by file B.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&lt;blanks&gt;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This line is unchanged.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">X</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is a conflict identification line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">U</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">There are unspecified unchanged lines here.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each set of conflicts is flagged by three identification lines. The first line
  indicates the beginning of the conflict, and specifies the line numbers for
  the base file and two divergent files. The second conflict identification line
  separates lines changed by file A from lines changed by file B. The third
  conflict identification indicates the end of the conflict.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can edit this conflict file to remove the conflicts. This involves deleting
  the conflict identification lines, and changing the conflicting lines as
  necessary to fix the conflict. While doing this, remember to leave three blank
  characters at the front of any new lines you insert while correcting the
  conflicts. When you are done, there should be no lines which begin with an 'X'
  in the file. All other lines can remain. Then you can use the command:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">fmerge conflictfile -o outputfile</div>
to create the new output file which has the desired data. Once again, if no
  <i>-Output</i> option or outputfile is used, the output is send to the
  standard output.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Unchanged</b> <i>number</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Besides physical conflicts, there can be
  logical conflicts. These are changes made to different lines in the base file
  such that the program is no longer correct. Such conflicts cannot be detected
  by a program, and so these must be checked manually. In order to make this
  process easier, the <b>-Unchanged</b> option can be used to reduce the size of
  the conflict file to only include regions near changed lines. This file can
  then be examined in order to detect possible logical conflicts. As an example,
  the command:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">fmerge basefile fileA fileB -c -u 3</div>
will send to the standard output all changes made by either sets of edits, with
  only three unchanged lines surrounding each edit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When using the <b>-Unchanged</b> option, the conflict file will contain lines
  starting with 'U'. These represent unchanged lines, and the number following
  the letter is the number of unchanged lines. The resulting conflict file
  cannot be read to produce an output file because of the missing lines. If this
  is attempted, an error will be generated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is possible to use both <b>-Output</b> and <b>-Conflicts</b> in the same
  command. Thus you can produce the output file which you hope is correct, and
  also produce the conflict file which you can use to check for logical
  conflicts.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Verbose</b> [ <i>number</i> ]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option can be specified with any other
  action, and outputs status information about the progress of the action. This
  is useful for debugging of problems, or just for amusement when the system is
  slow or a large file is being processed. It accepts a numeric argument to
  indicate the verbosity for output. The levels are as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">0</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">No output at all (except for errors).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Single&#x2010;line output describing action (default).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Detailed status as action proceeds.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Failures</b> <i>number</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    This option restricts the number of physical conflicts that are allowed
      before failing. This is used if you are not interested in the results if
      there are too many conflicts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Help</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    Give some help on how to use the <i>fmerge</i> program.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Ignore</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Ignore_Identical_Conflicts</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    The option may be used to suppress conflicts which make identical deletes,
      or identical inserts, or identical changes. This is often desirable when
      merging two source code branches.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

<div class="Pp"></div>
All options may be abbreviated; the abbreviation is documented as the upper case
  letters, all lower case letters and underscores (_) are optional. You must use
  consecutive sequences of optional letters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All options are case insensitive, you may type them in upper case or lower case
  or a combination of both, case is not important.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example: the arguments &quot;-help, &quot;-HELP&quot; and &quot;-h&quot; are
  all interpreted to mean the <b>-Help</b> option. The argument &quot;-hlp&quot;
  will not be understood, because consecutive optional characters were not
  supplied.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Options and other command line arguments may be mixed arbitrarily on the command
  line.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The GNU long option names are understood. Since all option names for
  <i>fmerge</i> are long, this means ignoring the extra leading '-'. The &quot;
  <b>-</b><i>option</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>&quot; convention is also understood.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>

  NAME EXPANSION</a></h1>
As a convenience, if a pathname begins with a period and a environment variable
  exists with that name, then the value of the environment variable will be used
  as the actual pathname. For example, if a environment variable of <i>.FOO</i>
  has the value <i>this.is.a.long.name</i>, then the command
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
fmerge -o .FOO
</pre>
</div>
is actually equivilant to the command
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
fmerge -o this.is.a.long.name
</pre>
</div>
If you want to prevent the expansion of a pathname which begins with a period,
  then you can use an alternate form for the pathname, as in:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
fmerge -o ./.FOO
</pre>
</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>

In general, fmerge can handle all text files you throw at it, even international
  text with unusual encodings. However, fmerge is <i>unable</i> to cope
  elegantly with files which contain the NUL character.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>fcomp</i>(1) program simply prints a warning, and continues, you need to
  know that it converts NUL characters into an 0x80 value before performing the
  comparison.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>fmerge</i>(1) program also converts the NUL character to an 0x80 value
  before merging, after a warning, and any output file will contain this value,
  rather than the original NUL character.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>fhist</i>(1) program, however, generates a fatal error if any input file
  contains NUL characters. This is intended to protect your source files for
  unintentional corruption. Use <b>-BINary</b> for files which absolutely must
  contain NUL characters.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT

The <i>fmerge</i> program will exit with a status of 1 on any error. The
  <i>fmerge</i> program will only exit with a status of 0 if there are no
  errors.
