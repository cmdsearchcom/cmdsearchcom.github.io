<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This script launches a process that monitors the load on the
local GBrowse instance. If the load exceeds certain
predefined levels, then it uses Amazon web services to
launch one <br>
or more GBrowse slave instances. The work of rendering
tracks is then handed off to these instances, reducing the
load on the local instance. Slave instances are implemented
<br>
using Amazon&rsquo;s spot instance mechanism, which allows
you to run EC2 instances at a fraction of the price of a
standard on-demand instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Load balancing is most
convenient to run in conjunction with a GBrowse instance
running within the Amazon Web Service EC2 cloud, but it can
also be used to supplement an instance <br>
running on local hardware. The sections below describe the
configuration needed for these two scenarios.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this script requires
you to have an Amazon Web Services account, and for the
VM::EC2 Perl module to be installed on the machine that is
running this script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS <br>
Options can be abbreviated. For example, you can use -a for
--access_key:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--access_key EC2 access key <br>
--secret_key EC2 secret key <br>
--conf Path to balancer configuration file <br>
--pidfile Path to file that holds daemon process ID <br>
--logfile Path to file that records log messages <br>
--user User to run daemon under (script must be <br>
started as root) <br>
--verbosity Logging verbosity. 0=least, 3=most. <br>
--background Go into the background and run as daemon. <br>
--kill Kill a previously-launched daemon. Must provide <br>
the same --pidfile argument as used when <br>
the daemon was started. <br>
--ssh_key Enable ssh login on the slave(s) using the
specified <br>
AWS ssh keypair. Login will only be available <br>
from the host this script is run on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREREQUISITES <br>
1. You must have the Perl modules VM::EC2 (v1.21 or later),
and Parse::Apache::ServerStatus installed on the machine you
intend to run the balancer on. The balancer must run on <br>
the same machine that GBrowse is running on. To install
these modules, run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -MCPAN -e &rsquo;install
VM::EC2; install Parse::Apache::ServerStatus&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. You must have an account on
Amazon Web Services and must be familiar with using the AWS
Console to launch and terminate EC2 instances. If you run
GBrowse on local hardware, <br>
then you will need to provide the script with your access
key and secret access key when launching it. It may be safer
to create and use an IAM user (Identity and Access <br>
Management) who has more limited privileges. See
CONFIGURATION below for some suggestions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. GBrowse must be running under
Apache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Apache must be configured to
enable the mod_status module and to allow password-less
requests to this module from localhost <br>
(http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_status.html). This
is the recommended configuration:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;IfModule mod_status.c&gt;
<br>
ExtendedStatus on <br>
&lt;Location /server-status&gt; <br>
SetHandler server-status <br>
Order deny,allow <br>
Deny from all <br>
Allow from 127.0.0.1 ::1 <br>
&lt;/Location&gt; &lt;/IfModule&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. If you are running GBrowse on
local hardware, the local hardware must be connected to the
Internet or have a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) connection to
Amazon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
The balancer requires a configuration file, ordinarily named
aws_balancer.conf and located in the GBrowse configuration
directory (e.g. /etc/gbrowse2). The configuration file has
<br>
three sections:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[LOAD TABLE] <br>
This section describes the number of slave instances to
launch for different load levels. It consists of a
three-column space-delimited table with the following
columns:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;requests/sec&gt; &lt;min
instances&gt; &lt;max instances&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the first few rows
of the default table reads:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0.1 0 1 <br>
0.5 0 2 <br>
1.0 1 3 <br>
2.0 2 4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is read as meaning that
when the number of requests per second on the GBrowse server
is greater than 0.1 but less than 0.5, run at least 0 slave
servers but no more than 1 <br>
slave server. When the number of requests is between 0.5 and
1.0, run between 0 and 2 slave instances. When the rate is
between 1.0 and 2.0, run at least 1 slave instance, but no
<br>
more than 3. Load levels below the lowest value on the table
(0.1 in this case) will run no slave servers, while levels
above the highest value on the table (2.0) will launch the
<br>
minimum and maximum number of slaves for that load value
(between 2 and 4 in this case).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reason for having a range of
instance counts for each load range is to avoid unecessarily
launching and killing slaves repeatedly when the load
fluctuates around the <br>
boundary. You may wish to tune the values in this table to
maximize the performance of your GBrowse installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the server load
includes both GBrowse requests and all other requests on the
web server. If this is a problem, you may wish to run
GBrowse on a separate Apache port or <br>
virtual host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[MASTER] <br>
The options in this sections configure the master GBrowse
instance. Three options are recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">external_ip (optional) <br>
This controls the externally-visible IP address of the
GBrowse master, which is needed by the firewall rule for
master/slave communications. This option can usually be left
<br>
blank: when the master is running on EC2, then the IP
address is known; when the master is running on a local
machine, the externally-visible IP address is looked up
using a <br>
web service. It is only in the rare case that this lookup is
incorrect that you will need to configure this option
yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The external IP that the
balancer script finds can be seen in a log message when
verbosity is 2 or higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">poll_interval (required) <br>
This is the interval, in minutes, that the balancer script
will periodically check the Apache load and adjust the
number of slave instances. The suggested value is 0.5 (30s
<br>
intervals).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server_status_url (required)
<br>
This is the URL to call to fetch the server load from
Apache&rsquo;s server_status module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[SLAVE] <br>
The options in this section apply to the render slaves
launched by the balancer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">instance_type (required) <br>
This is the EC2 instance type. Faster instances give better
performance. High-IO instances give the best performance,
but cost more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spot_bid (required) <br>
This is the maximum, in US dollars, that you are willing to
pay per hour to run a slave spot instance. Typically you
will pay less than the bid price. If the spot price <br>
increases beyond the maximum bid, then the spot instances
will be terminated and the balancer will wait until the spot
price decreases below the maximum bid before launching <br>
additional slaves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ports (required) <br>
This is a space-delimited list of TCP port numbers on which
the render slaves should listen for incoming render requests
from the master. Generally it is only necessary to <br>
listen on a single port; multiple ports were supported for
performance reasons in earlier single-threaded versions of
the slave.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">region (required for local
masters) <br>
The Amazon region in which to launch slaves. When the master
is running in EC2, this is automatically chosen to be the
same as the master&rsquo;s region and can be left blank.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">image_id (required for local
masters) <br>
This is the ID of the AMI that will be used to launch
slaves. The correct value will be filled in when you run the
gbrowse_sync_aws_slave.pl. You can leave this value blank
<br>
if the GBrowse master is being run within an EC2 instance,
in which case the slave will be launched using the same AMI
that was used to launch the master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">data_snapshots (required for
local masters) <br>
Before launching the slave, attach EBS volumes created from
one or more volume snapshots listed in this option. Multiple
snapshots can be attached by providing a space- <br>
delimited list:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">data_snapshots = snap-12345
snap-abcdef</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The gbrowse_sync_aws_slave.pl
script will automatically maintain this option for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">availability_zone (optional)
<br>
This option will force the slave into the named availability
zone. If not specified, an availability zone in the current
region will be chosen at random.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subnet (optional) <br>
If you are in a VPC environment, then this option will force
the slave into the named subnet. Ordinarily the balancer
script will launch slaves into non-VPC instances if the <br>
master is running on local hardware or a non-VPC EC2
instance. The balancer will launch slaves into the same VPC
subnet as the master if the master is running on a VPC <br>
instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">security_group (optional) <br>
This specifies the security group to assign the slaves to.
If not specified, a properly-configured security group will
be created as needed and destroyed when the balancer <br>
script exits. If you choose to manage the security group
manually, be sure to configure the firewall ingress rule to
allow access to the slave port(s) (see the &quot;ports&quot;
<br>
option) from the master&rsquo;s group or IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURING AWS CREDENTIALS <br>
To work, the balancer script must be able to make spot
instance requests and to monitor and terminate instances. To
perform these operations the script must have access to the
<br>
appropriate AWS credentials (access key and secret key) on
the command line or as environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While the script does its best
to shield the credentials from prying eyes, there is still a
chance that the credentials can be intercepted by another
party with login access to <br>
the machine that the master runs on and use the credentials
to run up your AWS bill. For this reason some people will
prefer to create an EC2 account or role with limited access
<br>
to AWS resources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Your personal EC2 credentials
<br>
You may provide the balancer script with --access_key and
--secret_key command line arguments using your personal EC2
credentials or set the environment variables <br>
EC2_ACCESS_KEY and EC2_SECRET_KEY. If not provided, the
script will interactively prompt for one or both of these
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the simplest method, but
has the risk that if the credentials are intercepted by a
malicious third party, he or she gains access to all your
EC2 resources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The credentials of a
restricted IAM account <br>
You may use the Amazon AWS console to create an IAM
(Identity Access and Management) user with restricted
permissions, and provide that user&rsquo;s credentials to
the script on <br>
the command line or with environment variables. The
following IAM permission policy is the minimum needed for
the balancer script to work properly:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ <br>
&quot;Statement&quot;: [ <br>
{ <br>
&quot;Sid&quot;: &quot;BalancerPolicy&quot;, <br>
&quot;Action&quot;: [ <br>
&quot;ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress&quot;, <br>
&quot;ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress&quot;, <br>
&quot;ec2:CreateSecurityGroup&quot;, <br>
&quot;ec2:DeleteSecurityGroup&quot;, <br>
&quot;ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones&quot;, <br>
&quot;ec2:DescribeImageAttribute&quot;, <br>
&quot;ec2:DescribeImages&quot;, <br>
&quot;ec2:DescribeInstances&quot;, <br>
&quot;ec2:DescribeInstanceAttribute&quot;, <br>
&quot;ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus&quot;, <br>
&quot;ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups&quot;, <br>
&quot;ec2:DescribeVolumes&quot;, <br>
&quot;ec2:DescribeSnapshots&quot;, <br>
&quot;ec2:DescribeSpotInstanceRequests&quot;, <br>
&quot;ec2:RequestSpotInstances&quot;, <br>
&quot;ec2:CreateKeyPair&quot;, <br>
&quot;ec2:DescribeKeyPairs&quot;, <br>
&quot;ec2:DeleteKeyPair&quot;, <br>
&quot;ec2:RunInstances&quot;, <br>
&quot;ec2:TerminateInstances&quot;, <br>
&quot;ec2:CreateSnapshot&quot;, <br>
&quot;ec2:CreateVolume&quot;, <br>
&quot;ec2:CreateTags&quot;, <br>
&quot;ec2:DeleteTags&quot; <br>
], <br>
&quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;, <br>
&quot;Resource&quot;: [ <br>
&quot;*&quot; <br>
] <br>
} <br>
] <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that even with these
restrictions, an unauthorized user with access to the
credentials could still launch a large number of spot
instances or terminate bona fide <br>
instances. This is just a fundamental limitation of the
granularity of EC2&rsquo;s permissions system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Create an IAM role <br>
If the master is running on an EC2 instance, then the most
convenient way to pass credentials is by assigning the
instance an IAM role. The balancer script can then obtain
<br>
temporary credentials by making internal EC2 calls. The
credentials do not need to be provided on the command line
or in environment variables, and are only valid for short
<br>
periods of time, limiting the effect of theft.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, create an IAM role using
the Amazon Console. Select IAM-&gt;Roles-&gt;Create New
Role, and give the role the name &quot;GBrowseMaster&quot;
(or whatever you prefer).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next, when prompted for the role
type, select AWS Service Roles-&gt;Amazon EC2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the Select Role Permissions
screen, choose &quot;Custom Policy&quot;. Give the policy a
name like &quot;GBrowseBalancer&quot; and cut and paste into
the Policy Document text field the <br>
permission policy listed above in the instructions for
creating a restriced IAM account. Be sure to remove the
whitespace before the beginning of the first curly brace, or
<br>
the console will complain about an invalid policy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You only need to do this once.
After this, whenever you launch an instance that will run
the GBrowse master (typically from a GBrowse AMI), specify
the &quot;GBrowseMaster&quot; IAM <br>
role name. This can be done from the AWS console&rsquo;s
instance launch wizard, or by passing the -p option to the
ec2-run-instances command-line tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING THE INIT SCRIPT <br>
The gbrowse-aws-balancer init script can be used on Ubuntu
and Debian-based systems to simplify launching the balancer
at boot time. It can be found in /etc/init.d by default,
<br>
and is called in the following manner:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start the service <br>
% sudo /etc/init.d/gbrowse-aws-balancer start</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop the service <br>
% sudo /etc/init.d/gbrowse-aws-balancer stop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop and restart the service
<br>
% sudo /etc/init.d/gbrowse-aws-balancer restart</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show the status of the service
(running, stopped) <br>
% sudo /etc/init.d/gbrowse-aws-balancer status</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The various script options are
all set in a single configuration file named
/etc/default/gbrowse-aws-balancer. The distribution contents
of this file looks like this:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">DAEMON=/usr/local/bin/gbrowse_aws_balancer.pl
<br>
USER=www-data <br>
RUNDIR=/var/run/gbrowse <br>
LOGDIR=/var/log/gbrowse <br>
CONFFILE=/etc/gbrowse2/aws_balancer.conf <br>
ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_EC2_ACCESS_KEY_HERE <br>
SECRET_KEY=YOUR_EC2_SECRET_KEY_HERE <br>
VERBOSITY=3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The variables in this file set
the location of the balancer script, the location of its
configuration file, the verbosity to run with, and where to
write the script&rsquo;s process ID <br>
and log information. In addition, you can place your (or
another authorized user&rsquo;s) EC2 access and secret key
in this file. Please make sure that this file is only
readable by <br>
root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUGGING SLAVE PROBLEMS <br>
If slaves are returning track renderinge errors, then there
is likely an issue with data synchronization. This typically
happens when the data on the master differs from the data
<br>
on the slave, or path names are different on the two
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To debug this, launch the script
with the -ssh_key option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% gbrowse_aws_balancer.pl --conf
/etc/gbrowse2/aws_balancer.conf --access_key XYZZY
--secret_key Plugh --ssh_key John_Doe_default</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may then ssh into the slave
using the specified ssh key and the username
&quot;admin&quot;. A useful thing to do is to tail the slave
log file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssh -i .ssh/John_Doe_default
admin@54.280.19.203 tail -f
/var/log/gbrowse/gbrowse_slave</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replace the IP number with the
correct IP number of one of the running slaves, which you
can find in /etc/gbrowse2/renderfarm.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE GBROWSE_SYNC_AWS_SLAVE.PL
SCRIPT <br>
The gbrowse_sync_aws_script.pl script should be run on the
master each time you add a new database to an existing data
source, or if you add a whole new data source. What it does
<br>
is to prepare a new Amazon EBS snapshot containing a copy of
all the data needed for the GBrowse slave to run. This
snapshot is then attached to new slave instances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After running, it updates the
conf file with the current versions of the slave AMI and the
data snapshot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% sudo
gbrowse_sync_aws_script.pl --conf
/etc/gbrowse2/aws_balancer.conf --mysql /var/lib/mysql
--postgres /var/lib/postgresql</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --conf argument is required.
The script will create a snapshot of the appropriate size,
mount it on a temporary staging instance, and rsync a copy
of your gbrowse databases <br>
directory (e.g. /var/lib/gbrowse2/databases) to the
snapshot. If you have created mysql or postgres databases,
you must also give the paths to their database file
directories, as <br>
shown in the example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that ALL your mysql and
postgres data files located on the server will be copied;
not just those used for track display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables are used if the
corresponding command line options are not present:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EC2_ACCESS_KEY AWS EC2 access
key <br>
EC2_SECRET_KEY AWS EC2 secret key</p>
