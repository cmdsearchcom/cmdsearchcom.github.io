<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This script launches a process that monitors the load on the local GBrowse
  instance. If the load exceeds certain predefined levels, then it uses Amazon
  web services to launch one or more GBrowse slave instances. The work of
  rendering tracks is then handed off to these instances, reducing the load on
  the local instance. Slave instances are implemented using Amazon's spot
  instance mechanism, which allows you to run EC2 instances at a fraction of the
  price of a standard on-demand instance.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Load balancing is most convenient to run in conjunction with a GBrowse instance
  running within the Amazon Web Service EC2 cloud, but it can also be used to
  supplement an instance running on local hardware. The sections below describe
  the configuration needed for these two scenarios.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that this script requires you to have an Amazon Web Services account, and
  for the VM::EC2 Perl module to be installed on the machine that is running
  this script.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMMAND-LINE_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#COMMAND-LINE_OPTIONS">COMMAND-LINE
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
Options can be abbreviated. For example, you can use -a for --access_key:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
      --access_key   EC2 access key
      --secret_key   EC2 secret key
      --conf         Path to balancer configuration file
      --pidfile      Path to file that holds daemon process ID
      --logfile      Path to file that records log messages
      --user         User to run daemon under (script must be
                         started as root)
      --verbosity    Logging verbosity. 0=least, 3=most.
      --background   Go into the background and run as daemon.
      --kill         Kill a previously-launched daemon. Must provide
                         the same --pidfile argument as used when
                         the daemon was started.
      --ssh_key      Enable ssh login on the slave(s) using the specified
                         AWS ssh keypair. Login will only be available
                         from the host this script is run on.
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PREREQUISITES"><a class="selflink" href="#PREREQUISITES">PREREQUISITES</a></h1>
1. You must have the Perl modules VM::EC2 (v1.21 or later), and
  Parse::Apache::ServerStatus installed on the machine you intend to run the
  balancer on. The balancer must run on the same machine that GBrowse is running
  on. To install these modules, run:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 perl -MCPAN -e 'install VM::EC2; install Parse::Apache::ServerStatus'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
2. You must have an account on Amazon Web Services and must be familiar with
  using the AWS Console to launch and terminate EC2 instances. If you run
  GBrowse on local hardware, then you will need to provide the script with your
  access key and secret access key when launching it. It may be safer to create
  and use an IAM user (Identity and Access Management) who has more limited
  privileges. See CONFIGURATION below for some suggestions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
3. GBrowse must be running under Apache.
<div class="Pp"></div>
4. Apache must be configured to enable the mod_status module and to allow
  password-less requests to this module from localhost
  (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_status.html). This is the
  recommended configuration:
<div class="Pp"></div>
&lt;IfModule mod_status.c&gt;
<br/>
 ExtendedStatus on
<br/>
 &lt;Location /server-status&gt;
<br/>
 SetHandler server-status
<br/>
 Order deny,allow
<br/>
 Deny from all
<br/>
 Allow from 127.0.0.1 ::1
<br/>
 &lt;/Location&gt; &lt;/IfModule&gt;
<div class="Pp"></div>
5. If you are running GBrowse on local hardware, the local hardware must be
  connected to the Internet or have a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) connection to
  Amazon.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_CONFIGURATION_FILE"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_CONFIGURATION_FILE">THE
  CONFIGURATION FILE</a></h1>
The balancer requires a configuration file, ordinarily named aws_balancer.conf
  and located in the GBrowse configuration directory (e.g. /etc/gbrowse2). The
  configuration file has three sections:
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="[LOAD_TABLE]"><a class="selflink" href="#[LOAD_TABLE]">[LOAD
  TABLE]</a></h2>
This section describes the number of slave instances to launch for different
  load levels. It consists of a three-column space-delimited table with the
  following columns:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 &lt;requests/sec&gt;    &lt;min instances&gt;    &lt;max instances&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, the first few rows of the default table reads:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 0.1     0   1
 0.5     0   2
 1.0     1   3
 2.0     2   4
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is read as meaning that when the number of requests per second on the
  GBrowse server is greater than 0.1 but less than 0.5, run at least 0 slave
  servers but no more than 1 slave server. When the number of requests is
  between 0.5 and 1.0, run between 0 and 2 slave instances. When the rate is
  between 1.0 and 2.0, run at least 1 slave instance, but no more than 3. Load
  levels below the lowest value on the table (0.1 in this case) will run no
  slave servers, while levels above the highest value on the table (2.0) will
  launch the minimum and maximum number of slaves for that load value (between 2
  and 4 in this case).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The reason for having a range of instance counts for each load range is to avoid
  unecessarily launching and killing slaves repeatedly when the load fluctuates
  around the boundary. You may wish to tune the values in this table to maximize
  the performance of your GBrowse installation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the server load includes both GBrowse requests and all other requests
  on the web server. If this is a problem, you may wish to run GBrowse on a
  separate Apache port or virtual host.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="[MASTER]"><a class="selflink" href="#[MASTER]">[MASTER]</a></h2>
The options in this sections configure the master GBrowse instance. Three
  options are recognized:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">external_ip (optional)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This controls the externally-visible IP address of the
      GBrowse master, which is needed by the firewall rule for master/slave
      communications. This option can usually be left blank: when the master is
      running on EC2, then the IP address is known; when the master is running
      on a local machine, the externally-visible IP address is looked up using a
      web service. It is only in the rare case that this lookup is incorrect
      that you will need to configure this option yourself.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The external IP that the balancer script finds can be seen in a log message
      when verbosity is 2 or higher.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">poll_interval (required)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is the interval, in minutes, that the balancer script
      will periodically check the Apache load and adjust the number of slave
      instances. The suggested value is 0.5 (30s intervals).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">server_status_url (required)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is the URL to call to fetch the server load from
      Apache's server_status module.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="[SLAVE]"><a class="selflink" href="#[SLAVE]">[SLAVE]</a></h2>
The options in this section apply to the render slaves launched by the balancer.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">instance_type (required)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is the EC2 instance type. Faster instances give better
      performance. High-IO instances give the best performance, but cost
    more.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">spot_bid (required)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is the maximum, in US dollars, that you are willing to
      pay per hour to run a slave spot instance. Typically you will pay less
      than the bid price. If the spot price increases beyond the maximum bid,
      then the spot instances will be terminated and the balancer will wait
      until the spot price decreases below the maximum bid before launching
      additional slaves.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">ports (required)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is a space-delimited list of TCP port numbers on which
      the render slaves should listen for incoming render requests from the
      master. Generally it is only necessary to listen on a single port;
      multiple ports were supported for performance reasons in earlier
      single-threaded versions of the slave.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">region (required for local masters)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The Amazon region in which to launch slaves. When the
      master is running in EC2, this is automatically chosen to be the same as
      the master's region and can be left blank.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">image_id (required for local masters)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is the ID of the AMI that will be used to launch
      slaves. The correct value will be filled in when you run the
      gbrowse_sync_aws_slave.pl. You can leave this value blank if the GBrowse
      master is being run within an EC2 instance, in which case the slave will
      be launched using the same AMI that was used to launch the master.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">data_snapshots (required for local masters)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Before launching the slave, attach EBS volumes created from
      one or more volume snapshots listed in this option. Multiple snapshots can
      be attached by providing a space-delimited list:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
 data_snapshots = snap-12345 snap-abcdef
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The gbrowse_sync_aws_slave.pl script will automatically maintain this option
      for you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">availability_zone (optional)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option will force the slave into the named
      availability zone. If not specified, an availability zone in the current
      region will be chosen at random.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">subnet (optional)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If you are in a VPC environment, then this option will
      force the slave into the named subnet. Ordinarily the balancer script will
      launch slaves into non-VPC instances if the master is running on local
      hardware or a non-VPC EC2 instance. The balancer will launch slaves into
      the same VPC subnet as the master if the master is running on a VPC
      instance.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">security_group (optional)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This specifies the security group to assign the slaves to.
      If not specified, a properly-configured security group will be created as
      needed and destroyed when the balancer script exits. If you choose to
      manage the security group manually, be sure to configure the firewall
      ingress rule to allow access to the slave port(s) (see the
      &quot;ports&quot; option) from the master's group or IP address.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURING_AWS_CREDENTIALS"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURING_AWS_CREDENTIALS">CONFIGURING
  AWS CREDENTIALS</a></h1>
To work, the balancer script must be able to make spot instance requests and to
  monitor and terminate instances. To perform these operations the script must
  have access to the appropriate AWS credentials (access key and secret key) on
  the command line or as environment variables.
<div class="Pp"></div>
While the script does its best to shield the credentials from prying eyes, there
  is still a chance that the credentials can be intercepted by another party
  with login access to the machine that the master runs on and use the
  credentials to run up your AWS bill. For this reason some people will prefer
  to create an EC2 account or role with limited access to AWS resources.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1. Your personal EC2 credentials</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You may provide the balancer script with --access_key and
      --secret_key command line arguments using your personal EC2 credentials or
      set the environment variables EC2_ACCESS_KEY and EC2_SECRET_KEY. If not
      provided, the script will interactively prompt for one or both of these
      values.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This is the simplest method, but has the risk that if the credentials are
      intercepted by a malicious third party, he or she gains access to all your
      EC2 resources.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2. The credentials of a restricted IAM account</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You may use the Amazon AWS console to create an IAM
      (Identity Access and Management) user with restricted permissions, and
      provide that user's credentials to the script on the command line or with
      environment variables. The following IAM permission policy is the minimum
      needed for the balancer script to work properly:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
 {
  &quot;Statement&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;Sid&quot;: &quot;BalancerPolicy&quot;,
      &quot;Action&quot;: [
        &quot;ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress&quot;,
        &quot;ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress&quot;,

      &quot;Resource&quot;: [
        &quot;*&quot;
      ]
    }
  ]
 }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that even with these restrictions, an unauthorized user with access to
      the credentials could still launch a large number of spot instances or
      terminate bona fide instances. This is just a fundamental limitation of
      the granularity of EC2's permissions system.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3. Create an IAM role</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the master is running on an EC2 instance, then the most
      convenient way to pass credentials is by assigning the instance an IAM
      role. The balancer script can then obtain temporary credentials by making
      internal EC2 calls. The credentials do not need to be provided on the
      command line or in environment variables, and are only valid for short
      periods of time, limiting the effect of theft.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    First, create an IAM role using the Amazon Console. Select
      IAM-&gt;Roles-&gt;Create New Role, and give the role the name
      &quot;GBrowseMaster&quot; (or whatever you prefer).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Next, when prompted for the role type, select AWS Service Roles-&gt;Amazon
      EC2.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    On the Select Role Permissions screen, choose &quot;Custom Policy&quot;.
      Give the policy a name like &quot;GBrowseBalancer&quot; and cut and paste
      into the Policy Document text field the permission policy listed above in
      the instructions for creating a restriced IAM account. Be sure to remove
      the whitespace before the beginning of the first curly brace, or the
      console will complain about an invalid policy.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You only need to do this once. After this, whenever you launch an instance
      that will run the GBrowse master (typically from a GBrowse AMI), specify
      the &quot;GBrowseMaster&quot; IAM role name. This can be done from the AWS
      console's instance launch wizard, or by passing the -p option to the
      ec2-run-instances command-line tool.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USING_THE_INIT_SCRIPT"><a class="selflink" href="#USING_THE_INIT_SCRIPT">USING
  THE INIT SCRIPT</a></h1>
The gbrowse-aws-balancer init script can be used on Ubuntu and Debian-based
  systems to simplify launching the balancer at boot time. It can be found in
  /etc/init.d by default, and is called in the following manner:
<div class="Pp"></div>
start the service
<br/>
 % sudo /etc/init.d/gbrowse-aws-balancer start
<div class="Pp"></div>
stop the service
<br/>
 % sudo /etc/init.d/gbrowse-aws-balancer stop
<div class="Pp"></div>
stop and restart the service
<br/>
 % sudo /etc/init.d/gbrowse-aws-balancer restart
<div class="Pp"></div>
show the status of the service (running, stopped)
<br/>
 % sudo /etc/init.d/gbrowse-aws-balancer status
<div class="Pp"></div>
The various script options are all set in a single configuration file named
  /etc/default/gbrowse-aws-balancer. The distribution contents of this file
  looks like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 DAEMON=/usr/local/bin/gbrowse_aws_balancer.pl
 USER=www-data
 RUNDIR=/var/run/gbrowse
 LOGDIR=/var/log/gbrowse
 CONFFILE=/etc/gbrowse2/aws_balancer.conf
 ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_EC2_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
 SECRET_KEY=YOUR_EC2_SECRET_KEY_HERE
 VERBOSITY=3
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The variables in this file set the location of the balancer script, the location
  of its configuration file, the verbosity to run with, and where to write the
  script's process ID and log information. In addition, you can place your (or
  another authorized user's) EC2 access and secret key in this file. Please make
  sure that this file is only readable by root.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DEBUGGING_SLAVE_PROBLEMS"><a class="selflink" href="#DEBUGGING_SLAVE_PROBLEMS">DEBUGGING
  SLAVE PROBLEMS</a></h1>
If slaves are returning track renderinge errors, then there is likely an issue
  with data synchronization. This typically happens when the data on the master
  differs from the data on the slave, or path names are different on the two
  systems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To debug this, launch the script with the -ssh_key option:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  % gbrowse_aws_balancer.pl --conf         /etc/gbrowse2/aws_balancer.conf \
                           --access_key   XYZZY \
                           --secret_key   Plugh \
                           --ssh_key      John_Doe_default
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may then ssh into the slave using the specified ssh key and the username
  &quot;admin&quot;. A useful thing to do is to tail the slave log file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 ssh -i .ssh/John_Doe_default admin@54.280.19.203 \
        tail -f /var/log/gbrowse/gbrowse_slave
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Replace the IP number with the correct IP number of one of the running slaves,
  which you can find in /etc/gbrowse2/renderfarm.conf.

The gbrowse_sync_aws_script.pl script should be run on the master each time you
  add a new database to an existing data source, or if you add a whole new data
  source. What it does is to prepare a new Amazon EBS snapshot containing a copy
  of all the data needed for the GBrowse slave to run. This snapshot is then
  attached to new slave instances.

After running, it updates the conf file with the current versions of the slave
  AMI and the data snapshot.

<pre>
 % sudo gbrowse_sync_aws_script.pl --conf     /etc/gbrowse2/aws_balancer.conf \
                                   --mysql    /var/lib/mysql \
                                   --postgres /var/lib/postgresql
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The --conf argument is required. The script will create a snapshot of the
  appropriate size, mount it on a temporary staging instance, and rsync a copy
  of your gbrowse databases directory (e.g. /var/lib/gbrowse2/databases) to the
  snapshot. If you have created mysql or postgres databases, you must also give
  the paths to their database file directories, as shown in the example.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that ALL your mysql and postgres data files located on the server will be
  copied; not just those used for track display.
