<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
btyacc &acirc; an LALR(1) parser generator with support for
backtracking</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
btyacc [-b prefix] [-d] [-DNAME ...] [-E] [-l] [-r] [-S
x.ske] [-t] [-v] filename.y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description <br>
btyacc is a modified version of byacc (Berkeley YACC), which
in turn is a public domain version of the original AT&amp;T
YACC parser generator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">btyacc reads the grammar
specification in the file filename.y and generates an LR(1)
parser for it. The parser consists of a set of LALR(1)
parsing tables and a driver routine <br>
written in the C programming language. btyacc normally
writes the parse tables and the driver routine to the file
prefix.tab.c, where prefix defaults to &lsquo;y&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a detailed description of
the format of a grammar specification, and an excellent
tutorial on how to use YACC-like tools, see the info manual
for GNU bison. btyacc-specific <br>
extensions are explained below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The parser skeleton
supplied by btyacc&rsquo;s upstream author only compiles as
C++. Use the skeleton /usr/doc/btyacc/examples/btyacc-c.ske
to generate a parser that compiles <br>
both as C and C++. (Unfortunately, this alternative skeleton
does not currently check malloc() return values.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
-b prefix Change the prefix prepended to the output file
names to the string denoted by prefix. The default prefix is
the character &lsquo;y&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Create a header file called
prefix.tab.h along with prefix.tab.c, containing the symbol
definitions and a declaration for YYSTYPE and yylval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-DNAME Define the btyacc
preprocessor variable NAME, for use with %ifdef NAME
directives in the grammar file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Print the preprocessed
grammar to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Do not insert #line
directives into the generated parser code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Write the parser code and the
associated tables to different files. Whereas the tables can
be found in prefix.tab.c as before, the code now gets
written to pre&acirc; <br>
fix.code.c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S x.ske Select a different
parser skeleton. The default skeleton is hardwired into the
program, but a copy can be found in the file
btyaccpa.ske.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Cause debugging code to be
compiled into the generated parser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Write a human-readable
description of the generated parser to y.output. It includes
parser states, actions for a look-ahead token and
information about any conflicts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BTYACC extensions <br>
Backtracking support <br>
Whenever a btyacc generated parser runs into a shift-reduce
or reduce-reduce error in the parse table, it remembers the
current parse point (stack and input stream state), and <br>
goes into trial parse mode. It then continues parsing,
ignoring most rule actions. If it runs into an error (either
through the parse table or through an action calling
YYERROR), <br>
it backtracks to the most recent conflict point and tries a
different alternative. If it finds a successful path
(reaches the end of the input or an action calls YYVALID),
it <br>
backtracks to the point where it first entered trial parse
mode, and continues with a full parse (executing all
actions), following the path of the successful trial.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Actions in btyacc come in two
flavors: {} actions, which are only executed when not in
trial mode, and [] actions, which are executed regardless of
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: In YACC grammars for C,
a standard hack known as the &quot;lexer feedback hack&quot;
is used to find typedef names. The lexer uses semantic
information to decide if any given <br>
identifier is a typedef name or not and returns a special
token. With btyacc, you no longer need to do this; the lexer
should just always return an identifier. The btyacc grammar
<br>
then needs a rule of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typename: ID [ if
(!IsTypeName(LookupId($1))) YYERROR; ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, note that adding
backtracking rules slows down the parser. In practice, you
should try to restrict the number of conflicts in the
grammar to what is absolutely neces&acirc; <br>
sary. Consider using the &quot;lexer feedback hack&quot; if
it is a clean solution, and reserve backtracking for a few
special cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">btyacc runs its trials using the
rule &quot;try shifting first, then try reducing in the
order that the conflicting rules appear in the input
file&quot;. This means you can implement <br>
semantic disambiguation rules like, for example: (1) If it
looks like a declaration it is, otherwise (2) If it looks
like an expression it is, otherwise (3) it is a syntax error
<br>
[Ellis &amp; Stroustrup, Annotated C++ Reference Manual,
p93]. To achieve this, put all the rules for declarations
before the rules for expressions in the grammar file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backtracking is only triggered
when the parse hits a shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflict
in the table. If you have no conflicts in your grammar,
there is no extra cost, other <br>
than some extra code which will never be invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, the generated parser
performs no pruning of alternate parsing paths. To avoid an
exponential explosion of possible paths (and parsing time),
you need to manually tell <br>
the parser when it can throw away saved paths using the
YYVALID statement. In practice, this turns out to be fairly
easy to do. For example, a C++ parser can just contain <br>
[YYVALID;] after every complete declaration and statement
rule, resulting in the backtracking state being pruned after
seeing a &lsquo;;&rsquo; or &lsquo;}&rsquo; - there will
never be a situation in <br>
which it is useful to backtrack past either of these.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Improved token position handling
<br>
Compilers often need to build ASTs (abstract syntax trees)
such that every node in a tree can relate to the parsed
program source it came from. The YYPOSN mechanism sup&acirc;
<br>
ported by btyacc helps you in automating the text position
computation and in assigning the computed text positions to
the AST nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In standard YACCs every token
and every non-terminal has an YYSTYPE semantic value
attached to it. With btyacc, every token and every
non-terminal also has an YYPOSN text posi&acirc; <br>
tion attached to it. YYPOSN is a user-defined type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">btyacc maintains a stack of text
position values in the same way that it maintains a stack of
semantic values. To make use of the text position feature,
you need to #define the <br>
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YYPOSN Preprocessor symbol for
the C/C++ type of the text position attached to every token
and non-terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yyposn Global variable of type
YYPOSN. The lexer must assign the text position of the
returned token to yyposn, just like it assigns the semantic
value of the returned token <br>
to yylval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YYREDUCEPOSNFUNC <br>
Preprocessor symbol for a function that is called
immediately after the regular grammar rule reduction has
been performed, to reduce text positions located on the <br>
stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typically, this function
extracts text positions from the right-hand side rule
components and either assigns them to the returned $$
structure/tree or, if no $$ value <br>
is returned, puts them into the ret text position where it
will be picked up by other rules later. Its prototype
is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void ReducePosn( <br>
YYPOSN&amp; ret, <br>
YYPOSN* term_posns, <br>
YYSTYPE* term_vals, <br>
int term_no, <br>
int stk_pos, <br>
int yychar, <br>
YYPOSN&amp; yyposn, <br>
UserType extra);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ret Reference to the text
position returned by the rule. You must overwrite this with
the computed text position that the rule yields, analogous
to the $$ semantic <br>
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">term_posns <br>
Array of the right-hand side rule components&rsquo; YYPOSN
text positions, analogous to $1, $2, ..., $N for the
semantic values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">term_vals Array of the
right-hand side rule components&rsquo; YYSTYPE values. These
are the $1, ..., $N themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">term_no Number of components in
the right hand side of the reduced rule, i.e. the size of
the term_posns and term_vals arrays. Also equal to N in $1,
..., $N.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stk_pos YYSTYPE/YYPOSN stack
position before the reduction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yychar Lookahead token that
immediately follows the reduced right hand side
components.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yyposn YYPOSN of the token that
immediately follows the reduced right hand side
components.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extra User-defined extra
argument passed to ReducePosn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YYREDUCEPOSNFUNCARG <br>
Extra argument passed to the ReducePosn function. This
argument can be any variable defined in btyaccpa.ske.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Token deallocation during error
recovery <br>
For most YACC-like parser generators, the action of the
generated parser upon encountering a parse error is to throw
away semantic values and input tokens until a rule
containing <br>
the special non-terminal error can be matched. Discarding of
tokens is simply performed by overwriting variables and
array entries of type YYSTYPE with new values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately, this approach
leads to a memory leak if YYSTYPE is a pointer type. btyacc
allows you to supply functions for cleaning up the semantic
and text position values, by <br>
#defineing the following symbols in the preamble of your
grammar file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YYDELETEVAL <br>
Preprocessor symbol for a function to call before the
semantic value of a token or non-terminal is discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YYDELETEPOSN <br>
Preprocessor symbol for a function to call before the text
position of a token or non-terminal is discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both functions are called with
two arguments. The first argument of type YYSTYPE or YYPOSN
is the value that will be discarded. The second argument is
of type int and is one of <br>
three values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 discarding input token</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 discarding state on stack</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 cleaning up stack when
aborting</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Detailed syntax error reporting
<br>
If you #define the preprocessor variable YYERROR_DETAILED in
your grammar file, you must also define the following error
processing function:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void yyerror_detailed( <br>
char* text, <br>
int errt, <br>
YYSTYPE&amp; <br>
errt_value, <br>
YYPOSN&amp; errt_posn);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">text error message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">errt code of the token that
caused the error</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">errt_value <br>
value of the token that caused the error</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">errt_posn text position of token
that caused error</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Preprocessor directives <br>
btyacc supports defining symbols and acting on them with
conditional directives inside grammar files, not unlike the
C preprocessor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%define NAME <br>
Define the preprocessor symbol NAME. Equivalent to the
command line switch -DNAME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%ifdef NAME <br>
If preprocessor variable NAME is defined, process the text
from this %ifdef to the closing %endif, otherwise skip
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%endif Closing directive for
%ifdef. %ifdefs cannot be nested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%include FILENAME <br>
Process contents of the file named FILENAME. Only one
nesting level of %include is allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%ident STRING <br>
Insert an &lsquo;#ident STRING&rsquo; directive into the
output file. STRING must be a string constant enclosed in
&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inherited attributes <br>
Inherited attributes are undocumented. (See the README and
the btyacc source code for a little information.) If you
work out how they work, contact me at
&lt;atterer@debian.org&gt;!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bugs <br>
The worst-case complexity of parsing is exponential for any
grammar which allows backtracking to take place. In other
words, a btyacc-generated parser constitutes a denial-of-
<br>
service bug if used in applications where an attacker is
able to supply specially crafted data as input to the
parser. (For all &quot;regular&quot; input data, the
potentially exponential <br>
complexity is not normally an issue.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bison&rsquo;s %expect directive
is not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no %else and %ifndef.
%ifdefs and %includes cannot be nested.</p>
