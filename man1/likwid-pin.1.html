<p>LIKWID-PIN(1) General Commands Manual LIKWID-PIN(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
likwid-pin - pin a sequential or threaded application to
dedicated processors</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
likwid-pin [-vhSpqi] [-V verbosity] [-c corelist] [-s
skip_mask]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
likwid-pin is a command line application to pin a sequential
or multithreaded application to dedicated processors. It can
be used as replacement for taskset. Opposite to taskset <br>
no affinity mask but single processors are specified. For
multithreaded applications based on the pthread library the
pthread_create library call is overloaded through <br>
LD_PRELOAD and each created thread is pinned to a dedicated
processor as specified in core_list .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Per default every generated
thread is pinned to the core in the order of calls to
pthread_create it is possible to skip single threads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The OpenMP implementations of
GCC and ICC compilers are explicitly supported.
Clang&rsquo;s OpenMP backend should also work as it is built
on top of Intel&rsquo;s OpenMP runtime library. <br>
Others may also work likwid-pin sets the environment
variable OMP_NUM_THREADS for you if not already present. It
will set as many threads as present in the pin expression.
Be <br>
aware that with pthreads the parent thread is always pinned.
If you create for example 4 threads with pthread_create and
do not use the parent process as worker you still have to
<br>
provide num_threads+1 processor ids.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">likwid-pin supports different
numberings for pinning. See section CPU EXPRESSION for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For applications where first
touch policy on NUMA systems cannot be employed likwid-pin
can be used to turn on interleave memory placement. This can
significantly speed up the <br>
performance of memory bound multithreaded codes. All NUMA
nodes the user pinned threads to are used for
interleaving.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h,--help <br>
prints a help message to standard output, then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v,--version <br>
prints version information to standard output, then
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --verbose &lt;level&gt; <br>
verbose output during execution for debugging. 0 for only
errors, 1 for informational output, 2 for detailed output
and 3 for developer output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c &lt;cpu expression&gt; <br>
specify a numerical list of processors. The list may contain
multiple items, separated by comma, and ranges. For example
0,3,9-11. Other format are available, see the CPU <br>
EXPRESSION section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --skip &lt;mask&gt; <br>
Specify skip mask as HEX number. For each set bit the
corresponding thread is skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S,--sweep <br>
All ccNUMA memory domains belonging to the specified thread
list will be cleaned before the run. Can solve file buffer
cache problems on Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p prints the available thread
domains for logical pinning</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i set NUMA memory policy to
interleave involving all NUMA nodes involved in pinning</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q,--quiet <br>
silent execution without output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPU EXPRESSION <br>
1. The most intuitive CPU selection method is a
comma-separated list of physical CPU IDs. An example for
this is 0,2 which schedules the threads on CPU cores 0 and
2. The phys&acirc; <br>
ical numbering also allows the usage of ranges like 0-2
which results in the list 0,1,2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The CPUs can be selected by
their indices inside of an affinity domain. The affinity
domain is optional and if not given, Likwid assumes the
domain &rsquo;N&rsquo; for the whole node. <br>
The format is L:&lt;indexlist&gt; for selecting the CPUs
inside of domain &rsquo;N&rsquo; or
L:&lt;domain&gt;:&lt;indexlist&gt; for selecting the CPUs
inside the given domain. Assuming an virtual affinity <br>
domain &rsquo;P&rsquo; that contains the CPUs
0,4,1,5,2,6,3,7. After sorting it to have physical cores
first we get: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. The logical numbering L:P:0-2
results in the <br>
selection 0,1,2 from the physical cores first list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The expression syntax enables
the selection according to an selection function with
variable input parameters. The format is either
E:&lt;affinity domain&gt;:&lt;numberOfThreads&gt; to <br>
use the first &lt;numberOfThreads&gt; threads in affinity
domain &lt;affinity domain&gt; or E:&lt;affinity
domain&gt;:&lt;numberOfThreads&gt;:&lt;chunksize&gt;:&lt;stride&gt;
to use &lt;numberOfThreads&gt; threads <br>
with &lt;chunksize&gt; threads selected in row while
skipping &lt;stride&gt; threads in affinity domain
&lt;affinity domain&gt;. Examples are E:N:4:1:2 for
selecting the first four physical <br>
CPUs on a system with 2 SMT threads per core or E:P:4:2:4
for choosing the first two threads in affinity domain P,
skipping 2 threads and selecting again two threads. The <br>
resulting CPU list for virtual affinity domain P is
0,4,2,6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The last format schedules the
threads not only in a single affinity domain but distributed
them evenly over all available affinity domains of the same
kind. In contrast to <br>
the other formats, the selection is done using the physical
cores first and then the SMT threads. The format is
&lt;affinity domain without number&gt;:scatter like
M:scatter to <br>
schedule the threads evenly in all available memory affinity
domains. Assuming the two socket domains S0 = 0,4,1,5 and S1
= 2,6,3,7 the expression S:scatter results in the <br>
CPU list 0,2,1,3,4,6,5,7</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
1. For standard pthread application:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">likwid-pin -c 0,2,4-6
./myApp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parent process is pinned to
processor 0 which is likely to be thread 0 in ./myApp.
Thread 1 is pinned to processor 2, thread 2 to processor 4,
thread 3 to processor 5 and <br>
thread 4 to processor 6. If more threads are created than
specified in the processor list, these threads are pinned to
processor 0 as fallback.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. For selection of CPUs inside
of a CPUset only the logical numbering is allowed. Assuming
CPUset 0,4,1,5:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">likwid-pin -c L:1,3 ./myApp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command pins ./myApp on CPU
4 and the thread started by ./myApp on CPU 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. A common use-case for the
numbering by expression is pinning of an application on the
Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor with its 60 cores each having 4
SMT threads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">likwid-pin -c E:N:60:1:4
./myApp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command schedules one
thread per physical CPU core for ./myApp.</p>
