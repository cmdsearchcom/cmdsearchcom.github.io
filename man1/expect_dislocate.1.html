<p>DISLOCATE(1) General Commands Manual DISLOCATE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Dislocate - disconnect and reconnect processes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dislocate [ program args... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION <br>
Dislocate allows processes to be disconnected and
reconnected to the terminal. Possible uses:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You can
disconnect a process from a terminal at work and reconnect
from home, to continue working.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; After having
your line be dropped due to noise, you can get back to your
process without having to restart it from scratch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you have a
problem that you would like to show someone, you can set up
the scenario at your own terminal, disconnect, walk down the
hall, and reconnect on another <br>
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you are in
the middle of a great game (or whatever) that does not allow
you to save, and someone else kicks you off the terminal,
you can disconnect, and reconnect <br>
later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
When run with no arguments, Dislocate tells you about your
disconnected processes and lets you reconnect to one.
Otherwise, Dislocate runs the named program along with any
argu&acirc; <br>
ments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, ^] is an escape that
lets you talk to Dislocate itself. At that point, you can
disconnect (by pressing ^D) or suspend Dislocate (by
pressing ^Z).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any Tcl or Expect command is
also acceptable at this point. For example, to insert the
contents of a the file /etc/motd as if you had typed it,
say:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">send -i $out [exec cat
/etc/motd]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To send the numbers 1 to 100 in
response to the prompt &quot;next #&quot;, say:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for {set i 0} {$i&lt;100} {incr
i} { <br>
expect -i $in &quot;next #&quot;&quot; <br>
send -i $out &quot;$i <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scripts can also be prepared and
sourced in so that you don&rsquo;t have to type them on the
spot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dislocate is actually just a
simple Expect script. Feel free to make it do what you want
it to do or just use Expect directly, without going through
Dislocate. Dislocate under&acirc; <br>
stands a few special arguments. These should appear before
any program name. Each should be separated by whitespace. If
the arguments themselves takes arguments, these should <br>
also be separated by whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -escape flag sets the escape
to whatever follows. The default escape is ^].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
This program was written by the author as an exercise to
show that communicating with disconnected processes is easy.
There are many features that could be added, but that is
<br>
not the intent of this program.</p>
