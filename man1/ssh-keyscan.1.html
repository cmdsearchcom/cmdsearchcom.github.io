<p>SSH-KEYSCAN(1) BSD General Commands Manual
SSH-KEYSCAN(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ssh-keyscan &acirc; gather ssh public keys</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ssh-keyscan [-46Hv] [-f file] [-p port] [-T timeout] [-t
type] [host | addrlist namelist] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ssh-keyscan is a utility for gathering the public ssh host
keys of a number of hosts. It was designed to aid in
building and verifying ssh_known_hosts files. ssh-keyscan
provides <br>
a minimal interface suitable for use by shell and perl
scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssh-keyscan uses non-blocking
socket I/O to contact as many hosts as possible in parallel,
so it is very efficient. The keys from a domain of 1,000
hosts can be collected in tens <br>
of seconds, even when some of those hosts are down or do not
run ssh. For scanning, one does not need login access to the
machines that are being scanned, nor does the scanning <br>
process involve any encryption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 Forces ssh-keyscan to use
IPv4 addresses only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Forces ssh-keyscan to use
IPv6 addresses only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f file <br>
Read hosts or &acirc;addrlist namelist&acirc; pairs from
file, one per line. If - is supplied instead of a filename,
ssh-keyscan will read hosts or &acirc;addrlist
namelist&acirc; pairs from the <br>
standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Hash all hostnames and
addresses in the output. Hashed names may be used normally
by ssh and sshd, but they do not reveal identifying
information should the file&rsquo;s con&acirc; <br>
tents be disclosed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
Port to connect to on the remote host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T timeout <br>
Set the timeout for connection attempts. If timeout seconds
have elapsed since a connection was initiated to a host or
since the last time anything was read from that <br>
host, then the connection is closed and the host in question
considered unavailable. Default is 5 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t type <br>
Specifies the type of the key to fetch from the scanned
hosts. The possible values are &acirc;rsa1&acirc; for
protocol version 1 and &acirc;dsa&acirc;,
&acirc;ecdsa&acirc;, &acirc;ed25519&acirc;, or
&acirc;rsa&acirc; for protocol <br>
version 2. Multiple values may be specified by separating
them with commas. The default is to fetch &acirc;rsa&acirc;
and &acirc;ecdsa&acirc; keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose mode. Causes
ssh-keyscan to print debugging messages about its
progress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
If an ssh_known_hosts file is constructed using ssh-keyscan
without verifying the keys, users will be vulnerable to man
in the middle attacks. On the other hand, if the security
<br>
model allows such a risk, ssh-keyscan can help in the
detection of tampered keyfiles or man in the middle attacks
which have begun after the ssh_known_hosts file was
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Input format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.2.3.4,1.2.4.4
name.my.domain,name,n.my.domain,n,1.2.3.4,1.2.4.4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output format for rsa1 keys:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host-or-namelist bits exponent
modulus</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output format for rsa, dsa and
ecdsa keys:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host-or-namelist keytype
base64-encoded-key</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where keytype is either
&acirc;ecdsa-sha2-nistp256&acirc;,
&acirc;ecdsa-sha2-nistp384&acirc;,
&acirc;ecdsa-sha2-nistp521&acirc;,
&acirc;ssh-ed25519&acirc;, &acirc;ssh-dss&acirc; or
&acirc;ssh-rsa&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Print the rsa host key for machine hostname:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ ssh-keyscan hostname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Find all hosts from the file
ssh_hosts which have new or different keys from those in the
sorted file ssh_known_hosts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa,dsa,ecdsa
-f ssh_hosts | sort -u - ssh_known_hosts | diff
ssh_known_hosts -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
ssh(1), sshd(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
David Mazieres &lt;dm@lcs.mit.edu&gt; wrote the initial
version, and Wayne Davison
&lt;wayned@users.sourceforge.net&gt; added support for
protocol version 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
It generates &quot;Connection closed by remote host&quot;
messages on the consoles of all the machines it scans if the
server is older than version 2.9. This is because it opens a
connec&acirc; <br>
tion to the ssh port, reads the public key, and drops the
connection as soon as it gets the key.</p>
