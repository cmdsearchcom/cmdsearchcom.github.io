The first synopsis form is denoted by two operands, neither of which are
  existing files of type directory. The <i>cp</i> utility shall copy the

The second synopsis form is denoted by two or more operands where the
  <b>&#x2212;R</b> option is not specified and the first synopsis form is not
  applicable. It shall be an error if any <i>source_file</i> is a file of type
  directory, if <i>target</i> does not exist, or if <i>target</i> does not name
  a directory. The <i>cp</i> utility shall copy the contents of each
  <i>source_file</i> (or, if <i>source_file</i> is a file of type symbolic link,
  the contents of the file referenced by <i>source_file</i>) to the destination

If <i>cp</i> is prematurely terminated by a signal or error, files or file
  hierarchies may be only partially copied and files and directories may have
  incorrect permissions or access and modification times.

  USAGE</a></h1>
The set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits are explicitly cleared when files are
  created. This is to prevent users from creating programs that are set-user-ID
  or set-group-ID to them when copying files or to make set-user-ID or
  set-group-ID files accessible to new groups of users. For example, if a file
  is set-user-ID and the copy has a different group ID than the source, a new
  group of users has execute permission to a set-user-ID program than did
  previously. In particular, this is a problem for superusers copying users'
  trees.

The <b>&#x2212;i</b> option exists on BSD systems, giving applications and users
  a way to avoid accidentally removing files when copying. Although the 4.3 BSD
  version does not prompt if the standard input is not a terminal, the standard
  developers decided that use of <b>&#x2212;i</b> is a request for interaction,
  so when the destination path exists, the utility takes instructions from
  whatever responds on standard input.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The exact format of the interactive prompts is unspecified. Only the general
  nature of the contents of prompts are specified because implementations may
  desire more descriptive prompts than those used on historical implementations.
  Therefore, an application using the <b>&#x2212;i</b> option relies on the
  system to provide the most suitable dialog directly with the user, based on
  the behavior specified.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>&#x2212;p</b> option is historical practice on BSD systems, duplicating
  the time of last data modification and time of last access. This volume of
  POSIX.1&#x2010;2008 extends it to preserve the user and group IDs, as well as
  the file permissions. This requirement has obvious problems in that the
  directories are almost certainly modified after being copied. This volume of
  POSIX.1&#x2010;2008 requires that the modification times be preserved. The
  statement that the order in which the characteristics are duplicated is
  unspecified is to permit implementations to provide the maximum amount of
  security for the user. Implementations should take into account the obvious
  security issues involved in setting the owner, group, and mode in the wrong
  order or creating files with an owner, group, or mode different from the final
  value.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is unspecified whether <i>cp</i> writes diagnostic messages when the user and
  group IDs cannot be set due to the widespread practice of users using
  <b>&#x2212;p</b> to duplicate some portion of the file characteristics,
  indifferent to the duplication of others. Historic implementations only write
  diagnostic messages on errors other than <b>[EPERM]</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Earlier versions of this standard included support for the <b>&#x2212;r</b>
  option to copy file hierarchies. The <b>&#x2212;r</b> option is historical
  practice on BSD and BSD-derived systems. This option is no longer specified by
  POSIX.1&#x2010;2008 but may be present in some implementations. The
  <b>&#x2212;R</b> option was added as a close synonym to the <b>&#x2212;r</b>
  option, selected for consistency with all other options in this volume of
  POSIX.1&#x2010;2008 that do recursive directory descent.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The difference between <b>&#x2212;R</b> and the removed <b>&#x2212;r</b> option
  is in the treatment by <i>cp</i> of file types other than regular and
  directory. It was implementation-defined how the <b>&#x2212;</b> option
  treated special files to allow both historical implementations and those that
  chose to support <b>&#x2212;r</b> with the same abilities as <b>&#x2212;R</b>
  defined by this volume of POSIX.1&#x2010;2008. The original <b>&#x2212;r</b>
  flag, for historic reasons, did not handle special files any differently from
  regular files, but always read the file and copied its contents. This had
  obvious problems in the presence of special file types; for example, character
  devices, FIFOs, and sockets.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a failure occurs during the copying of a file hierarchy, <i>cp</i> is
  required to attempt to copy files that are on the same level in the hierarchy
  or above the file where the failure occurred. It is unspecified if <i>cp</i>
  shall attempt to copy files below the file where the failure occurred (which
  cannot succeed in any case).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Permissions, owners, and groups of created special file types have been
  deliberately left as implementation-defined. This is to allow systems to
  satisfy special requirements (for example, allowing users to create character
  special devices, but requiring them to be owned by a certain group). In
  general, it is strongly suggested that the permissions, owner, and group be
  the same as if the user had run the historical <i>mknod</i>, <i>ln</i>, or
  other utility to create the file. It is also probable that additional
  privileges are required to create block, character, or other
  implementation-defined special file types.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Additionally, the <b>&#x2212;p</b> option explicitly requires that all
  set-user-ID and set-group-ID permissions be discarded if any of the owner or
  group IDs cannot be set. This is to keep users from unintentionally giving
  away special privilege when copying programs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When creating regular files, historical versions of <i>cp</i> use the mode of
  the source file as modified by the file mode creation mask. Other choices
  would have been to use the mode of the source file unmodified by the creation
  mask or to use the same mode as would be given to a new file created by the
  user (plus the execution bits of the source file) and then modify it by the
  file mode creation mask. In the absence of any strong reason to change
  historic practice, it was in large part retained.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When creating directories, historical versions of <i>cp</i> use the mode of the
  source directory, plus read, write, and search bits for the owner, as modified
  by the file mode creation mask. This is done so that <i>cp</i> can copy trees
  where the user has read permission, but the owner does not. A side-effect is
  that if the file creation mask denies the owner permissions, <i>cp</i> fails.
  Also, once the copy is done, historical versions of <i>cp</i> set the
  permissions on the created directory to be the same as the source directory,
  unmodified by the file creation mask.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This behavior has been modified so that <i>cp</i> is always able to create the
  contents of the directory, regardless of the file creation mask. After the
  copy is done, the permissions are set to be the same as the source directory,
  as modified by the file creation mask. This latter change from historical
  behavior is to prevent users from accidentally creating directories with
  permissions beyond those they would normally set and for consistency with the
  behavior of <i>cp</i> in creating files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is not a requirement that <i>cp</i> detect attempts to copy a file to itself;
  however, implementations are strongly encouraged to do so. Historical
  implementations have detected the attempt in most cases.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are two methods of copying subtrees in this volume of POSIX.1&#x2010;2008.
  The other method is described as part of the <i>pax</i> utility (see
  <i><i>pax</i></i>). Both methods are historical practice. The <i>cp</i>
  utility provides a simpler, more intuitive interface, while <i>pax</i> offers
  a finer granularity of control. Each provides additional functionality to the
  other; in particular, <i>pax</i> maintains the hard-link structure of the
  hierarchy, while <i>cp</i> does not. It is the intention of the standard
  developers that the results be similar (using appropriate option combinations
  in both utilities). The results are not required to be identical; there seemed
  insufficient gain to applications to balance the difficulty of implementations
  having to guarantee that the results would be exactly identical.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The wording allowing <i>cp</i> to copy a directory to implementation-defined
  file types not specified by the System Interfaces volume of
  POSIX.1&#x2010;2008 is provided so that implementations supporting symbolic
  links are not required to prohibit copying directories to symbolic links.
  Other extensions to the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1&#x2010;2008 file
  types may need to use this loophole as well.
