<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cp &acirc; copy files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cp [&acirc;Pfip] source_file target_file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cp [&acirc;Pfip] source_file...
target</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cp &acirc;R
[&acirc;H|&acirc;L|&acirc;P] [&acirc;fip] source_file...
target</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The first synopsis form is denoted by two operands, neither
of which are existing files of type directory. The cp
utility shall copy the contents of source_file (or, if <br>
source_file is a file of type symbolic link, the contents of
the file referenced by source_file) to the destination path
named by target_file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second synopsis form is
denoted by two or more operands where the &acirc;R option is
not specified and the first synopsis form is not applicable.
It shall be an error if any <br>
source_file is a file of type directory, if target does not
exist, or if target does not name a directory. The cp
utility shall copy the contents of each source_file (or, if
<br>
source_file is a file of type symbolic link, the contents of
the file referenced by source_file) to the destination path
named by the concatenation of target, a single &lt;slash&gt;
<br>
character if target did not end in a &lt;slash&gt;, and the
last component of source_file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third synopsis form is
denoted by two or more operands where the &acirc;R option is
specified. The cp utility shall copy each file in the file
hierarchy rooted in each source_file <br>
to a destination path named as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If target exists and names an
existing directory, the name of the corresponding
destination path for each file in the file hierarchy shall
be the concatenation of target, a <br>
single &lt;slash&gt; character if target did not end in a
&lt;slash&gt;, and the pathname of the file relative to the
directory containing source_file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If target does not exist and
two operands are specified, the name of the corresponding
destination path for source_file shall be target; the name
of the corresponding desti&acirc; <br>
nation path for all other files in the file hierarchy shall
be the concatenation of target, a &lt;slash&gt; character,
and the pathname of the file relative to source_file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It shall be an error if target
does not exist and more than two operands are specified, or
if target exists and does not name a directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following description,
the term dest_file refers to the file named by the
destination path. The term source_file refers to the file
that is being copied, whether specified <br>
as an operand or a file in a file hierarchy rooted in a
source_file operand. If source_file is a file of type
symbolic link:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If the &acirc;R option was not
specified, cp shall take actions based on the type and
contents of the file referenced by the symbolic link, and
not by the symbolic link itself, <br>
unless the &acirc;P option was specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If the &acirc;R option was
specified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- If none of the options
&acirc;H, &acirc;L, nor &acirc;P were specified, it is
unspecified which of &acirc;H, &acirc;L, or &acirc;P will be
used as a default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- If the &acirc;H option was
specified, cp shall take actions based on the type and
contents of the file referenced by any symbolic link
specified as a source_file operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- If the &acirc;L option was
specified, cp shall take actions based on the type and
contents of the file referenced by any symbolic link
specified as a source_file operand or any <br>
symbolic links encountered during traversal of a file
hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- If the &acirc;P option was
specified, cp shall copy any symbolic link specified as a
source_file operand and any symbolic links encountered
during traversal of a file hierar&acirc; <br>
chy, and shall not follow any symbolic links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each source_file, the
following steps shall be taken:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If source_file references the
same file as dest_file, cp may write a diagnostic message to
standard error; it shall do nothing more with source_file
and shall go on to any <br>
remaining files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If source_file is of type
directory, the following steps shall be taken:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. If the &acirc;R option was
not specified, cp shall write a diagnostic message to
standard error, do nothing more with source_file, and go on
to any remaining files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. If source_file was not
specified as an operand and source_file is dot or dot-dot,
cp shall do nothing more with source_file and go on to any
remaining files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c. If dest_file exists and it is
a file type not specified by the System Interfaces volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008, the behavior is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d. If dest_file exists and it is
not of type directory, cp shall write a diagnostic message
to standard error, do nothing more with source_file or any
files below <br>
source_file in the file hierarchy, and go on to any
remaining files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e. If the directory dest_file
does not exist, it shall be created with file permission
bits set to the same value as those of source_file, modified
by the file creation mask <br>
of the user if the &acirc;p option was not specified, and
then bitwise-inclusively OR&rsquo;ed with S_IRWXU. If
dest_file cannot be created, cp shall write a diagnostic
message to <br>
standard error, do nothing more with source_file, and go on
to any remaining files. It is unspecified if cp attempts to
copy files in the file hierarchy rooted in <br>
source_file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f. The files in the directory
source_file shall be copied to the directory dest_file,
taking the four steps (1 to 4) listed here with the files as
source_files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g. If dest_file was created, its
file permission bits shall be changed (if necessary) to be
the same as those of source_file, modified by the file
creation mask of the user <br>
if the &acirc;p option was not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h. The cp utility shall do
nothing more with source_file and go on to any remaining
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If source_file is of type
regular file, the following steps shall be taken:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. The behavior is unspecified
if dest_file exists and was written by a previous step.
Otherwise, if dest_file exists, the following steps shall be
taken:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i. If the &acirc;i option is in
effect, the cp utility shall write a prompt to the standard
error and read a line from the standard input. If the
response is not affirmative, <br>
cp shall do nothing more with source_file and go on to any
remaining files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ii. A file descriptor for
dest_file shall be obtained by performing actions equivalent
to the open() function defined in the System Interfaces
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 <br>
called using dest_file as the path argument, and the
bitwise-inclusive OR of O_WRONLY and O_TRUNC as the oflag
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iii. If the attempt to obtain a
file descriptor fails and the &acirc;f option is in effect,
cp shall attempt to remove the file by performing actions
equivalent to the unlink() <br>
function defined in the System Interfaces volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 called using dest_file as the path
argument. If this attempt succeeds, cp shall continue with
step <br>
3b.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. If dest_file does not exist,
a file descriptor shall be obtained by performing actions
equivalent to the open() function defined in the System
Interfaces volume of <br>
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 called using dest_file as the path
argument, and the bitwise-inclusive OR of O_WRONLY and
O_CREAT as the oflag argument. The file permission bits of
<br>
source_file shall be the mode argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c. If the attempt to obtain a
file descriptor fails, cp shall write a diagnostic message
to standard error, do nothing more with source_file, and go
on to any remaining <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d. The contents of source_file
shall be written to the file descriptor. Any write errors
shall cause cp to write a diagnostic message to standard
error and continue to step <br>
3e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e. The file descriptor shall be
closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f. The cp utility shall do
nothing more with source_file. If a write error occurred in
step 3d, it is unspecified if cp continues with any
remaining files. If no write <br>
error occurred in step 3d, cp shall go on to any remaining
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Otherwise, the &acirc;R
option was specified, and the following steps shall be
taken:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. The dest_file shall be
created with the same file type as source_file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. If source_file is a file of
type FIFO, the file permission bits shall be the same as
those of source_file, modified by the file creation mask of
the user if the &acirc;p option <br>
was not specified. Otherwise, the permissions, owner ID, and
group ID of dest_file are implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this creation fails for any
reason, cp shall write a diagnostic message to standard
error, do nothing more with source_file, and go on to any
remaining files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c. If source_file is a file of
type symbolic link, and the options require the symbolic
link itself to be acted upon, the pathname contained in
dest_file shall be the same <br>
as the pathname contained in source_file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this fails for any reason, cp
shall write a diagnostic message to standard error, do
nothing more with source_file, and go on to any remaining
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the implementation provides
additional or alternate access control mechanisms (see the
Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 4.4,
File Access Permissions), their <br>
effect on copies of files is implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The cp utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;f If a file descriptor
for a destination file cannot be obtained, as described in
step 3.a.ii., attempt to unlink the destination file and
proceed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;H Take actions based on
the type and contents of the file referenced by any symbolic
link specified as a source_file operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;i Write a prompt to
standard error before copying to any existing non-directory
destination file. If the response from the standard input is
affirmative, the copy shall <br>
be attempted; otherwise, it shall not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;L Take actions based on
the type and contents of the file referenced by any symbolic
link specified as a source_file operand or any symbolic
links encountered during tra&acirc; <br>
versal of a file hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;P Take actions on any
symbolic link specified as a source_file operand or any
symbolic link encountered during traversal of a file
hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;p Duplicate the following
characteristics of each source file in the corresponding
destination file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The time of last data
modification and time of last access. If this duplication
fails for any reason, cp shall write a diagnostic message to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The user ID and group ID. If
this duplication fails for any reason, it is unspecified
whether cp writes a diagnostic message to standard
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The file permission bits and
the S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits. Other, implementation-defined,
bits may be duplicated as well. If this duplication fails
for any reason, <br>
cp shall write a diagnostic message to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the user ID or the group ID
cannot be duplicated, the file permission bits S_ISUID and
S_ISGID shall be cleared. If these bits are present in the
source file but are <br>
not duplicated in the destination file, it is unspecified
whether cp writes a diagnostic message to standard
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The order in which the preceding
characteristics are duplicated is unspecified. The dest_file
shall not be deleted if these characteristics cannot be
preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;R Copy file
hierarchies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying more than one of the
mutually-exclusive options &acirc;H, &acirc;L, and &acirc;P
shall not be considered an error. The last option specified
shall determine the behavior of the utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source_file <br>
A pathname of a file to be copied. If a source_file operand
is &rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;, it shall refer to a file named
&acirc;; implementations shall not treat it as meaning
standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target_file <br>
A pathname of an existing or nonexistent file, used for the
output when a single file is copied. If a target_file
operand is &rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;, it shall refer to a file
named &acirc;; <br>
implementations shall not treat it as meaning standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target A pathname of a directory
to contain the copied files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be used to read an input line in
response to each prompt specified in the STDERR section.
Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The input files specified as operands may be of any file
type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of cp:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_COLLATE <br>
Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges, equivalence
classes, and multi-character collating elements used in the
extended regular expression defined for the <br>
yesexpr locale keyword in the LC_MESSAGES category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments <br>
and input files) and the behavior of character classes used
in the extended regular expression defined for the yesexpr
locale keyword in the LC_MESSAGES category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale used to process affirmative responses,
and the locale used to affect the format and contents of
diagnostic messages and prompts written to standard <br>
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
A prompt shall be written to standard error under the
conditions specified in the DESCRIPTION section. The prompt
shall contain the destination pathname, but its format is
other&acirc; <br>
wise unspecified. Otherwise, the standard error shall be
used only for diagnostic messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
The output files may be of any type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 All files were copied
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
If cp is prematurely terminated by a signal or error, files
or file hierarchies may be only partially copied and files
and directories may have incorrect permissions or access
<br>
and modification times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits are explicitly cleared
when files are created. This is to prevent users from
creating programs that are set-user-ID or set-group-ID to
them <br>
when copying files or to make set-user-ID or set-group-ID
files accessible to new groups of users. For example, if a
file is set-user-ID and the copy has a different group ID
<br>
than the source, a new group of users has execute permission
to a set-user-ID program than did previously. In particular,
this is a problem for superusers copying users&rsquo;
trees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The &acirc;i option exists on BSD systems, giving
applications and users a way to avoid accidentally removing
files when copying. Although the 4.3 BSD version does not
prompt if the <br>
standard input is not a terminal, the standard developers
decided that use of &acirc;i is a request for interaction,
so when the destination path exists, the utility takes
instructions <br>
from whatever responds on standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exact format of the
interactive prompts is unspecified. Only the general nature
of the contents of prompts are specified because
implementations may desire more descriptive <br>
prompts than those used on historical implementations.
Therefore, an application using the &acirc;i option relies
on the system to provide the most suitable dialog directly
with the <br>
user, based on the behavior specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;p option is
historical practice on BSD systems, duplicating the time of
last data modification and time of last access. This volume
of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 extends it to preserve <br>
the user and group IDs, as well as the file permissions.
This requirement has obvious problems in that the
directories are almost certainly modified after being
copied. This vol&acirc; <br>
ume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 requires that the modification
times be preserved. The statement that the order in which
the characteristics are duplicated is unspecified is to
permit imple&acirc; <br>
mentations to provide the maximum amount of security for the
user. Implementations should take into account the obvious
security issues involved in setting the owner, group, and
<br>
mode in the wrong order or creating files with an owner,
group, or mode different from the final value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is unspecified whether cp
writes diagnostic messages when the user and group IDs
cannot be set due to the widespread practice of users using
&acirc;p to duplicate some portion of <br>
the file characteristics, indifferent to the duplication of
others. Historic implementations only write diagnostic
messages on errors other than [EPERM].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Earlier versions of this
standard included support for the &acirc;r option to copy
file hierarchies. The &acirc;r option is historical practice
on BSD and BSD-derived systems. This option is <br>
no longer specified by POSIX.1&acirc;2008 but may be present
in some implementations. The &acirc;R option was added as a
close synonym to the &acirc;r option, selected for
consistency with all <br>
other options in this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 that do
recursive directory descent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The difference between &acirc;R
and the removed &acirc;r option is in the treatment by cp of
file types other than regular and directory. It was
implementation-defined how the &acirc; option <br>
treated special files to allow both historical
implementations and those that chose to support &acirc;r
with the same abilities as &acirc;R defined by this volume
of POSIX.1&acirc;2008. The origi&acirc; <br>
nal &acirc;r flag, for historic reasons, did not handle
special files any differently from regular files, but always
read the file and copied its contents. This had obvious
problems in <br>
the presence of special file types; for example, character
devices, FIFOs, and sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a failure occurs during the
copying of a file hierarchy, cp is required to attempt to
copy files that are on the same level in the hierarchy or
above the file where the <br>
failure occurred. It is unspecified if cp shall attempt to
copy files below the file where the failure occurred (which
cannot succeed in any case).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Permissions, owners, and groups
of created special file types have been deliberately left as
implementation-defined. This is to allow systems to satisfy
special requirements (for <br>
example, allowing users to create character special devices,
but requiring them to be owned by a certain group). In
general, it is strongly suggested that the permissions,
owner, <br>
and group be the same as if the user had run the historical
mknod, ln, or other utility to create the file. It is also
probable that additional privileges are required to create
<br>
block, character, or other implementation-defined special
file types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, the &acirc;p
option explicitly requires that all set-user-ID and
set-group-ID permissions be discarded if any of the owner or
group IDs cannot be set. This is to keep <br>
users from unintentionally giving away special privilege
when copying programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When creating regular files,
historical versions of cp use the mode of the source file as
modified by the file mode creation mask. Other choices would
have been to use the mode <br>
of the source file unmodified by the creation mask or to use
the same mode as would be given to a new file created by the
user (plus the execution bits of the source file) and <br>
then modify it by the file mode creation mask. In the
absence of any strong reason to change historic practice, it
was in large part retained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When creating directories,
historical versions of cp use the mode of the source
directory, plus read, write, and search bits for the owner,
as modified by the file mode creation <br>
mask. This is done so that cp can copy trees where the user
has read permission, but the owner does not. A side-effect
is that if the file creation mask denies the owner
permis&acirc; <br>
sions, cp fails. Also, once the copy is done, historical
versions of cp set the permissions on the created directory
to be the same as the source directory, unmodified by the
<br>
file creation mask.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This behavior has been modified
so that cp is always able to create the contents of the
directory, regardless of the file creation mask. After the
copy is done, the permissions <br>
are set to be the same as the source directory, as modified
by the file creation mask. This latter change from
historical behavior is to prevent users from accidentally
creating <br>
directories with permissions beyond those they would
normally set and for consistency with the behavior of cp in
creating files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not a requirement that cp
detect attempts to copy a file to itself; however,
implementations are strongly encouraged to do so. Historical
implementations have detected the <br>
attempt in most cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two methods of copying
subtrees in this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008. The other
method is described as part of the pax utility (see pax).
Both methods are historical prac&acirc; <br>
tice. The cp utility provides a simpler, more intuitive
interface, while pax offers a finer granularity of control.
Each provides additional functionality to the other; in
par&acirc; <br>
ticular, pax maintains the hard-link structure of the
hierarchy, while cp does not. It is the intention of the
standard developers that the results be similar (using
appropriate <br>
option combinations in both utilities). The results are not
required to be identical; there seemed insufficient gain to
applications to balance the difficulty of implementations
<br>
having to guarantee that the results would be exactly
identical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The wording allowing cp to copy
a directory to implementation-defined file types not
specified by the System Interfaces volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 is provided so that implementations <br>
supporting symbolic links are not required to prohibit
copying directories to symbolic links. Other extensions to
the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 file
types may need <br>
to use this loophole as well.</p>
