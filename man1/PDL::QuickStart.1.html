Perl is an extremely good and versatile scripting language, well suited to
  beginners and allows rapid prototyping. However until recently it did not
  support data structures which allowed it to do fast number crunching.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However with the development of Perl v5, Perl acquired 'Objects'. To put it
  simply users can define their own special data types, and write custom
  routines to manipulate them either in low level languages (C and Fortran) or
  in Perl itself.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This has been fully exploited by the PerlDL developers. The 'PDL' module is a
  complete Object-Oriented extension to Perl (although you don't have to know
  what an object is to use it) which allows large N-dimensional data sets, such
  as large images, spectra, time series, etc to be stored <b>efficiently</b> and
  manipulated <b>en masse</b>. For example with the PDL module we can write the
  Perl code &quot;$a = $b + $c&quot;, where $b and $c are large datasets (e.g.
  2048x2048 images), and get the result in only a fraction of a second.
<div class="Pp"></div>
PDL variables (or 'piddles' as they have come to be known) support a wide range
  of fundamental data types - arrays can be bytes, short integers (signed or
  unsigned), long integers, floats or double precision floats. And because of
  the Object-Oriented nature of PDL new customised datatypes can be derived from
  them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As well as the PDL modules, that can be used by normal Perl programs, PerlDL
  comes with a command line Perl shell, called 'perldl', which supports command
  line editing. In combination with the various PDL graphics modules this allows
  data to be easily played with and visualised.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Help"><a class="selflink" href="#Help">Help</a></h2>
PDL contains extensive documentation, available both within the <i>perldl</i> or
  <i>pdl2</i> shells and from the command line, using the &quot;pdldoc&quot;
  program. For further information try either of:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 pdl&gt; help help
 $ pdldoc
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
HTML copies of the documentation should also be available. To find their
  location, try the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 pdl&gt; foreach ( map{&quot;$_/PDL/HtmlDocs&quot;}@INC ) { p &quot;$_\n&quot; if -d $_ }
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Perl_Datatypes_and_how_PDL_extends_them"><a class="selflink" href="#Perl_Datatypes_and_how_PDL_extends_them">Perl
  Datatypes and how PDL extends them</a></h2>
The fundamental Perl data structures are scalar variables, e.g. $x, which can
  hold numbers or strings, lists or arrays of scalars, e.g. @x, and associative
  arrays/hashes of scalars, e.g. %x.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl v5 introduces to Perl data structures and objects. A simple scalar variable
  $x now be a user-defined data type or full blown object (it actually holds a
  reference (a smart &quot;pointer&quot;) to this but that is not relevant for
  ordinary use of perlDL)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The fundamental idea behind perlDL is to allow $x to hold a whole 1D spectrum,
  or a 2D image, a 3D data cube, and so on up to large N-dimensional data sets.
  These can be manipulated all at once, e.g. &quot;$a = $b + 2&quot; does a
  vector operation on each value in the spectrum/image/etc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may well ask: &quot;Why not just store a spectrum as a simple Perl @x style
  list with each pixel being a list item?&quot; The two key answers to this are
  <i>memory</i> and <i>speed</i>. Because we know our spectrum consists of pure
  numbers we can compactly store them in a single block of memory corresponding
  to a C style numeric array. This takes up a LOT less memory than the
  equivalent Perl list. It is then easy to pass this block of memory to a fast
  addition routine, or to any other C function which deals with arrays. As a
  result perlDL is very fast --- for example one can multiply a 2048*2048 image
  in exactly the same time as it would take in C or FORTRAN (0.1 sec on my
  SPARC). A further advantage of this is that for simple operations (e.g.
  &quot;$x += 2&quot;) one can manipulate the whole array without caring about
  its dimensionality.
<div class="Pp"></div>
I find when using perlDL it is most useful to think of standard Perl @x
  variables as &quot;lists&quot; of generic &quot;things&quot; and PDL variables
  like $x as &quot;arrays&quot; which can be contained in lists or hashes. Quite
  often in my perlDL scripts I have @x contain a list of spectra, or a list of
  images (or even a mix!). Or perhaps one could have a hash (e.g. %x) of
  images... the only limit is memory!
<div class="Pp"></div>
perlDL variables support a range of data types - arrays can be bytes, short
  integers (signed or unsigned), long integers, floats or double precision
  floats.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Usage"><a class="selflink" href="#Usage">Usage</a></h2>
PerlDL is loaded into your Perl script using this command:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 use PDL;  # in Perl scripts: use the standard perlDL modules
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are also a lot of extension modules, e.g. PDL::Graphics::TriD. Most of
  these (but not all as sometimes it is not appropriate) follow a standard
  convention. If you say:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 use PDL::Graphics::TriD;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You import everything in a standard list from the module. Sometimes you might
  want to import nothing (e.g. if you want to use OO syntax all the time and
  save the import tax). For these you say:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 use PDL::Graphics::TriD qw();
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And the empty &quot;qw()&quot; quotes are recognised as meaning 'nothing'. You
  can also specify a list of functions to import in the normal Perl way.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is also an interactive shell, &quot;perldl&quot; or &quot;pdl2&quot;, see
  <i>perldl</i> or pdl2 for details.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="To_create_a_new_PDL_variable"><a class="selflink" href="#To_create_a_new_PDL_variable">To
  create a new PDL variable</a></h2>
Here are some ways of creating a PDL variable:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 $a = pdl [1..10];             # 1D array
 $a = pdl (1,2,3,4);           # Ditto
 $a = pdl '[1 2 3 4]';         # Ditto
 $b = pdl [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]];   # 2D 3x2 array
 $b = pdl '[1 2 3; 4 5 6]';    # Ditto
 $b = pdl q[1,2,3; 4,5,6];     # Ditto
 $b = pdl &lt;&lt;NEWPDL             # Ditto
   [1 2 3]
   [4 5 6]
 NEWPDL
 $c = pdl q[1 -2];             # 2-element piddle containing 1 and -2
 $c = pdl q[1 - 2];            # 2-element piddle containing 1 and -2
 $b = pdl 42                   # 0-dimensional scalar
 $c = pdl $a;                  # Make a new copy
 
 $d = byte [1..10];            # See &quot;Type conversion&quot;
 $e = zeroes(3,2,4);           # 3x2x4 zero-filled array
 
 $c = rfits $file;             # Read FITS file
 
 @x = ( pdl(42), zeroes(3,2,4), rfits($file) ); # Is a LIST of PDL variables!
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>pdl()</i> function is used to initialise a PDL variable from a scalar,
  list, list reference, another PDL variable, or a properly formatted string.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition all PDL functions automatically convert normal Perl scalars to PDL
  variables on-the-fly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
(also see &quot;Type Conversion&quot; and &quot;Input/Output&quot; sections
  below)
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Arithmetic_(and_boolean_expressions)"><a class="selflink" href="#Arithmetic_(and_boolean_expressions)">Arithmetic
  (and boolean expressions)</a></h2>
<pre>
 $a = $b + 2; $a++; $a = $b / $c; # Etc.
 $c=sqrt($a); $d = log10($b+100); # Etc
 $e = $a&gt;42; # Vector conditional
 $e = 42*($a&gt;42) + $a*($a&lt;=42); # Cap top
 $b = $a-&gt;log10 unless any ($a &lt;= 0); # avoid floating point error
 $a = $a / ( max($a) - min($a) );
 $f = where($a, $a &gt; 10); # where returns a piddle of elements for
                          # which the condition is true
 print $a; # $a in string context prints it in a N-dimensional format
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(and other Perl operators/functions)
<div class="Pp"></div>
When using piddles in conditional expressions (i.e. &quot;if&quot;,
  &quot;unless&quot; and &quot;while&quot; constructs) only piddles with exactly
  one element are allowed, e.g.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 $a = pdl (1,0,0,1);
 print &quot;is set&quot; if $a-&gt;index(2);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the boolean operators return in general multi-element piddles.
  Therefore, the following will raise an error
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 print &quot;is ok&quot; if $a &gt; 3;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
since &quot;$a &gt; 3&quot; is a piddle with 4 elements. Rather use all or any
  to test if all or any of the elements fulfill the condition:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 print &quot;some are &gt; 3&quot; if any $a&gt;3;
 print &quot;can't take logarithm&quot; unless all $a&gt;0;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are also many predefined functions, which are described on other man
  pages. Check PDL::Index.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Matrix_functions"><a class="selflink" href="#Matrix_functions">Matrix
  functions</a></h2>
'x' is hijacked as the matrix multiplication operator. e.g. &quot;$c = $a x
  $b&quot;;
<div class="Pp"></div>
perlDL is row-major not column major so this is actually &quot;c(i,j) = sum_k
  a(k,j) b(i,k)&quot; - but when matrices are printed the results will look
  right. Just remember the indices are reversed. e.g.:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 $a = [                   $b = [
       [ 1  2  3  0]            [1 1]
       [ 1 -1  2  7]            [0 2]
       [ 1  0  0  1]            [0 2]
      ]                         [1 1]
                               ]
 gives $c = [
             [ 1 11]
             [ 8 10]
             [ 2  2]
            ]
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note: <i>transpose()</i> does what it says and is a convenient way to turn row
  vectors into column vectors.

 sub dotproduct {
     my ($a,$b) = @_;
     return sum($a*$b) ;
 }
 1;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If put in file dotproduct.pdl would be autoloaded if you are using
  PDL::AutoLoader (see below).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Of course, this function is already available as the inner function, see
  PDL::Primitive.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Type_Conversion"><a class="selflink" href="#Type_Conversion">Type

Default for <i>pdl()</i> is double. Conversions are:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 $a = float($b);
 $c = long($d);   # &quot;long&quot; is generally a 4 byte int
 $d = byte($a);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Also <i>double()</i>, <i>short()</i>, <i>ushort()</i>, <i>indx()</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  NOTE: The indx() routine is a special integer type that
  is the correct size for a PDL index value (dimension size,
  index, or offest) which can be either a 32bit (long) or
  64bit (longlong) quantity depending on whether the perl
  is built with 32bit or 64bit support.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
These routines also automatically convert Perl lists to allow the convenient
  shorthand:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 $a = byte [[1..10],[1..10]];  # Create 2D byte array
 $a = float [1..1000];         # Create 1D float array
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
etc.

PDL has very powerful multidimensional slicing and sectioning operators; see the
  <i>PDL::Slices</i>(3) man page for details; we'll describe the most important
  one here.
<div class="Pp"></div>
PDL shows its Perl/C heritage in that arrays are zero-offset. Thus a 100x100
  image has indices &quot;0..99,0..99&quot;. (The convention is that the
  <i>center</i> of pixel (0,0) is at coordinate (0.0,0.0). All PDL graphics
  functions conform to this definition and hide away the unit offsets of, for
  example, the PGPLOT FORTRAN library.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Following the usual convention coordinate (0,0) is displayed at the bottom left
  when displaying an image. It appears at the top left when using
  &quot;&quot;print $a&quot;&quot; etc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Simple sectioning uses a syntax extension to Perl, PDL::NiceSlice, that allows
  you to specify subranges via a null-method modifier to a PDL:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  $b = $a-&gt;($x1:$x2,$y1:$y2,($z1)); # Take subsection
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here, $a is a 3-dimensional variable, and $b gets a planar cutout that is
  defined by the limits $x1, $x2, $y1, $y2, at the location $z1. The parenthesis
  around $z1 cause the trivial index to be omitted -- otherwise $b would be
  three-dimensional with a third dimension of order 1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can put PDL slices on either side of the element-wise assignment operator
  &quot;.=&quot;, like so:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  # Set part of $bigimage to values from $smallimage
  $bigimage-&gt;($xa:$xb,$ya:$yb) .= $smallimage;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some other miscellany:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 $c  = nelem($a); # Number of pixels
 $val = at($object, $x,$y,$z...)    # Pixel value at position, as a Perl scalar
 $val = $object-&gt;at($x,$y,$z...)    # equivalent (method syntax OK)
 $b = xvals($a); # Fill array with X-coord values (also yvals(), zvals(),
                 # axisvals($x,$axis) and rvals() for radial distance
                 # from centre).
</pre>

The philosophy behind perlDL is to make it work with a variety of existing
  graphics libraries since no single package will satisfy all needs and all
  people and this allows one to work with packages one already knows and likes.
  Obviously there will be some overlaps in functionality and some lack of
  consistency and uniformity. However this allows PDL to keep up with a rapidly
  developing field - the latest PDL modules provide interfaces to OpenGL and
  VRML graphics!

PDL operations are available as functions and methods. Thus one can derive new
  types of object, to represent custom data classes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By using overloading one can make mathematical operators do whatever you please,
  and PDL has some built-in tricks which allow existing PDL functions to work
  unchanged, even if the underlying data representation is vastly changed! See
  PDL::Objects

Messing around with really huge data arrays may require some care. perlDL
  provides many facilities to let you perform operations on big arrays without
  generating extra copies though this does require a bit more thought and care
  from the programmer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
NOTE: On some most systems it is better to configure Perl (during the build
  options) to use the system &quot;malloc()&quot; function rather than Perl's
  built-in one. This is because Perl's one is optimised for speed rather than
  consumption of virtual memory - this can result in a factor of two improvement
  in the amount of memory storage you can use. The Perl malloc in 5.004 and
  later does have a number of compile-time options you can use to tune the
  behaviour.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Simple arithmetic</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If $a is a big image (e.g. occupying 10MB) then the command
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
 $a = $a + 1;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    eats up another 10MB of memory. This is because the expression
      &quot;$a+1&quot; creates a temporary copy of $a to hold the result, then
      $a is assigned a reference to that. After this, the original $a is
      destroyed so there is no <i>permanent</i> memory waste. But on a small
      machine, the growth in the memory footprint can be considerable. It is
      obviously done this way so &quot;$c=$a+1&quot; works as expected.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Also if one says:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
 $b = $a;     # $b and $a now point to same data
 $a = $a + 1;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Then $b and $a end up being different, as one naively expects, because a new
      reference is created and $a is assigned to it.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    However if $a was a huge memory hog (e.g. a 3D volume) creating a copy of it
      may not be a good thing. One can avoid this memory overhead in the above
      example by saying:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
 $a++;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The operations &quot;++,+=,--,-=&quot;, etc. all call a special
      &quot;in-place&quot; version of the arithmetic subroutine. This means no
      more memory is needed - the downside of this is that if &quot;$b=$a&quot;
      then $b is also incremented. To force a copy explicitly:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
 $b = pdl $a; # Real copy
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    or, alternatively, perhaps better style:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
 $b = $a-&gt;copy;
    </pre>

  <dd class="It-tag">Most functions, e.g. &quot;log()&quot;, return a result

      programming practice. However many operations can be done
      &quot;in-place&quot; and this may be required when large arrays are in use
      and memory is at a premium. For these circumstances the operator
      <i>inplace()</i> is provided which prevents the extra copy and allows the
      argument to be modified. e.g.:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
 $x = log($array);          # $array unaffected
 log( inplace($bigarray) ); # $bigarray changed in situ

If you have written a simple function and you don't want it to blow up in your
  face if you pass it a simple number rather than a PDL variable. Simply call
  the function <i>topdl()</i> first to make it safe. e.g.:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 sub myfiddle { my $pdl = topdl(shift); $pdl-&gt;fiddle_foo(...); ... }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;topdl()&quot; does NOT perform a copy if a pdl variable is passed - it
  just falls through - which is obviously the desired behaviour. The routine is
  not of course necessary in normal user defined functions which do not care
  about internals.
