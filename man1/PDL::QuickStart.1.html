<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
PDL::QuickStart - Quick introduction to PDL features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
A brief summary of the main PDL features and how to use
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Introduction <br>
Perl is an extremely good and versatile scripting language,
well suited to beginners and allows rapid prototyping.
However until recently it did not support data structures
which <br>
allowed it to do fast number crunching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However with the development of
Perl v5, Perl acquired &rsquo;Objects&rsquo;. To put it
simply users can define their own special data types, and
write custom routines to manipulate them <br>
either in low level languages (C and Fortran) or in Perl
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This has been fully exploited by
the PerlDL developers. The &rsquo;PDL&rsquo; module is a
complete Object-Oriented extension to Perl (although you
don&rsquo;t have to know what an object is to use <br>
it) which allows large N-dimensional data sets, such as
large images, spectra, time series, etc to be stored
efficiently and manipulated en masse. For example with the
PDL <br>
module we can write the Perl code &quot;$a = $b + $c&quot;,
where $b and $c are large datasets (e.g. 2048x2048 images),
and get the result in only a fraction of a second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL variables (or
&rsquo;piddles&rsquo; as they have come to be known) support
a wide range of fundamental data types - arrays can be
bytes, short integers (signed or unsigned), long <br>
integers, floats or double precision floats. And because of
the Object-Oriented nature of PDL new customised datatypes
can be derived from them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As well as the PDL modules, that
can be used by normal Perl programs, PerlDL comes with a
command line Perl shell, called &rsquo;perldl&rsquo;, which
supports command line editing. In <br>
combination with the various PDL graphics modules this
allows data to be easily played with and visualised.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help <br>
PDL contains extensive documentation, available both within
the perldl or pdl2 shells and from the command line, using
the &quot;pdldoc&quot; program. For further information try
either <br>
of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdl&gt; help help <br>
$ pdldoc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTML copies of the documentation
should also be available. To find their location, try the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdl&gt; foreach (
map{&quot;$_/PDL/HtmlDocs&quot;}@INC ) { p &quot;$_0 if -d
$_ }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl Datatypes and how PDL
extends them <br>
The fundamental Perl data structures are scalar variables,
e.g. $x, which can hold numbers or strings, lists or arrays
of scalars, e.g. @x, and associative arrays/hashes of <br>
scalars, e.g. %x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl v5 introduces to Perl data
structures and objects. A simple scalar variable $x now be a
user-defined data type or full blown object (it actually
holds a reference (a smart <br>
&quot;pointer&quot;) to this but that is not relevant for
ordinary use of perlDL)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fundamental idea behind
perlDL is to allow $x to hold a whole 1D spectrum, or a 2D
image, a 3D data cube, and so on up to large N-dimensional
data sets. These can be <br>
manipulated all at once, e.g. &quot;$a = $b + 2&quot; does a
vector operation on each value in the
spectrum/image/etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may well ask: &quot;Why not
just store a spectrum as a simple Perl @x style list with
each pixel being a list item?&quot; The two key answers to
this are memory and speed. Because we <br>
know our spectrum consists of pure numbers we can compactly
store them in a single block of memory corresponding to a C
style numeric array. This takes up a LOT less memory than
<br>
the equivalent Perl list. It is then easy to pass this block
of memory to a fast addition routine, or to any other C
function which deals with arrays. As a result perlDL is very
<br>
fast --- for example one can multiply a 2048*2048 image in
exactly the same time as it would take in C or FORTRAN (0.1
sec on my SPARC). A further advantage of this is that for
<br>
simple operations (e.g. &quot;$x += 2&quot;) one can
manipulate the whole array without caring about its
dimensionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I find when using perlDL it is
most useful to think of standard Perl @x variables as
&quot;lists&quot; of generic &quot;things&quot; and PDL
variables like $x as &quot;arrays&quot; which can be
contained in <br>
lists or hashes. Quite often in my perlDL scripts I have @x
contain a list of spectra, or a list of images (or even a
mix!). Or perhaps one could have a hash (e.g. %x) of <br>
images... the only limit is memory!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlDL variables support a range
of data types - arrays can be bytes, short integers (signed
or unsigned), long integers, floats or double precision
floats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usage <br>
PerlDL is loaded into your Perl script using this
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use PDL; # in Perl scripts: use
the standard perlDL modules</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are also a lot of
extension modules, e.g. PDL::Graphics::TriD. Most of these
(but not all as sometimes it is not appropriate) follow a
standard convention. If you say:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use PDL::Graphics::TriD;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You import everything in a
standard list from the module. Sometimes you might want to
import nothing (e.g. if you want to use OO syntax all the
time and save the import tax). For <br>
these you say:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use PDL::Graphics::TriD
qw();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And the empty &quot;qw()&quot;
quotes are recognised as meaning &rsquo;nothing&rsquo;. You
can also specify a list of functions to import in the normal
Perl way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also an interactive
shell, &quot;perldl&quot; or &quot;pdl2&quot;, see perldl or
pdl2 for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create a new PDL variable
<br>
Here are some ways of creating a PDL variable:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$a = pdl [1..10]; # 1D array
<br>
$a = pdl (1,2,3,4); # Ditto <br>
$a = pdl &rsquo;[1 2 3 4]&rsquo;; # Ditto <br>
$b = pdl [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]; # 2D 3x2 array <br>
$b = pdl &rsquo;[1 2 3; 4 5 6]&rsquo;; # Ditto <br>
$b = pdl q[1,2,3; 4,5,6]; # Ditto <br>
$b = pdl &lt;&lt;NEWPDL # Ditto <br>
[1 2 3] <br>
[4 5 6] <br>
NEWPDL <br>
$c = pdl q[1 -2]; # 2-element piddle containing 1 and -2
<br>
$c = pdl q[1 - 2]; # 2-element piddle containing 1 and -2
<br>
$b = pdl 42 # 0-dimensional scalar <br>
$c = pdl $a; # Make a new copy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$d = byte [1..10]; # See
&quot;Type conversion&quot; <br>
$e = zeroes(3,2,4); # 3x2x4 zero-filled array</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$c = rfits $file; # Read FITS
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@x = ( pdl(42), zeroes(3,2,4),
rfits($file) ); # Is a LIST of PDL variables!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pdl() function is used to
initialise a PDL variable from a scalar, list, list
reference, another PDL variable, or a properly formatted
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition all PDL functions
automatically convert normal Perl scalars to PDL variables
on-the-fly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(also see &quot;Type
Conversion&quot; and &quot;Input/Output&quot; sections
below)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arithmetic (and boolean
expressions) <br>
$a = $b + 2; $a++; $a = $b / $c; # Etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$c=sqrt($a); $d = log10($b+100);
# Etc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$e = $a&gt;42; # Vector
conditional</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$e = 42*($a&gt;42) +
$a*($a&lt;=42); # Cap top</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$b = $a-&gt;log10 unless any ($a
&lt;= 0); # avoid floating point error</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$a = $a / ( max($a) - min($a)
);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$f = where($a, $a &gt; 10); #
where returns a piddle of elements for <br>
# which the condition is true</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print $a; # $a in string context
prints it in a N-dimensional format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(and other Perl
operators/functions)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using piddles in
conditional expressions (i.e. &quot;if&quot;,
&quot;unless&quot; and &quot;while&quot; constructs) only
piddles with exactly one element are allowed, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$a = pdl (1,0,0,1); <br>
print &quot;is set&quot; if $a-&gt;index(2);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the boolean operators
return in general multi-element piddles. Therefore, the
following will raise an error</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;is ok&quot; if $a
&gt; 3;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">since &quot;$a &gt; 3&quot; is a
piddle with 4 elements. Rather use all or any to test if all
or any of the elements fulfill the condition:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;some are &gt;
3&quot; if any $a&gt;3; <br>
print &quot;can&rsquo;t take logarithm&quot; unless all
$a&gt;0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are also many predefined
functions, which are described on other man pages. Check
PDL::Index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Matrix functions <br>
&rsquo;x&rsquo; is hijacked as the matrix multiplication
operator. e.g. &quot;$c = $a x $b&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlDL is row-major not column
major so this is actually &quot;c(i,j) = sum_k a(k,j)
b(i,k)&quot; - but when matrices are printed the results
will look right. Just remember the indices are <br>
reversed. e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$a = [ $b = [ <br>
[ 1 2 3 0] [1 1] <br>
[ 1 -1 2 7] [0 2] <br>
[ 1 0 0 1] [0 2] <br>
] [1 1] <br>
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gives $c = [ <br>
[ 1 11] <br>
[ 8 10] <br>
[ 2 2] <br>
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: transpose() does what it
says and is a convenient way to turn row vectors into column
vectors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How to write a simple function
<br>
sub dotproduct { <br>
my ($a,$b) = @_; <br>
return sum($a*$b) ; <br>
} <br>
1;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If put in file dotproduct.pdl
would be autoloaded if you are using PDL::AutoLoader (see
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course, this function is
already available as the inner function, see
PDL::Primitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Type Conversion <br>
Default for pdl() is double. Conversions are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$a = float($b); <br>
$c = long($d); # &quot;long&quot; is generally a 4 byte int
<br>
$d = byte($a);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also double(), short(),
ushort(), indx().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: The indx() routine is a
special integer type that <br>
is the correct size for a PDL index value (dimension size,
<br>
index, or offest) which can be either a 32bit (long) or <br>
64bit (longlong) quantity depending on whether the perl <br>
is built with 32bit or 64bit support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These routines also
automatically convert Perl lists to allow the convenient
shorthand:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$a = byte [[1..10],[1..10]]; #
Create 2D byte array <br>
$a = float [1..1000]; # Create 1D float array</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Printing <br>
Automatically expands array in N-dimensional format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print $a;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$b = &quot;Answer is = $a
&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sections <br>
PDL has very powerful multidimensional slicing and
sectioning operators; see the PDL::Slices(3) man page for
details; we&rsquo;ll describe the most important one
here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL shows its Perl/C heritage in
that arrays are zero-offset. Thus a 100x100 image has
indices &quot;0..99,0..99&quot;. (The convention is that the
center of pixel (0,0) is at coordinate <br>
(0.0,0.0). All PDL graphics functions conform to this
definition and hide away the unit offsets of, for example,
the PGPLOT FORTRAN library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Following the usual convention
coordinate (0,0) is displayed at the bottom left when
displaying an image. It appears at the top left when using
&quot;&quot;print $a&quot;&quot; etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simple sectioning uses a syntax
extension to Perl, PDL::NiceSlice, that allows you to
specify subranges via a null-method modifier to a PDL:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$b =
$a-&gt;($x1:$x2,$y1:$y2,($z1)); # Take subsection</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here, $a is a 3-dimensional
variable, and $b gets a planar cutout that is defined by the
limits $x1, $x2, $y1, $y2, at the location $z1. The
parenthesis around $z1 cause the <br>
trivial index to be omitted -- otherwise $b would be
three-dimensional with a third dimension of order 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can put PDL slices on either
side of the element-wise assignment operator &quot;.=&quot;,
like so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Set part of $bigimage to
values from $smallimage <br>
$bigimage-&gt;($xa:$xb,$ya:$yb) .= $smallimage;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some other miscellany:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$c = nelem($a); # Number of
pixels</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$val = at($object, $x,$y,$z...)
# Pixel value at position, as a Perl scalar <br>
$val = $object-&gt;at($x,$y,$z...) # equivalent (method
syntax OK)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$b = xvals($a); # Fill array
with X-coord values (also yvals(), zvals(), <br>
# axisvals($x,$axis) and rvals() for radial distance <br>
# from centre).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input/Output <br>
The &quot;PDL::IO&quot; modules implement several useful IO
format functions. It would be too much to give examples of
each, but you can find a nice overview at PDL::IO. Here is a
sample <br>
of some of the supported IO formats in PDL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL::IO::Misc <br>
Ascii, FITS and FIGARO/NDF IO routines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL::IO::FastRaw <br>
Using the raw data types of your machine, an unportable but
blindingly fast IO format. Also supports memory mapping to
conserve memory as well as get more speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL::IO::FlexRaw <br>
General raw data formats. Like FastRaw, only better.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL::IO::Browser <br>
A Curses browser for arrays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL::IO::Pnm <br>
Portaple bitmap and pixmap support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL::IO::Pic <br>
Using the previous module and netpbm, makes it possible to
easily write GIF, jpeg and whatever with simple
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Graphics <br>
The philosophy behind perlDL is to make it work with a
variety of existing graphics libraries since no single
package will satisfy all needs and all people and this
allows one to <br>
work with packages one already knows and likes. Obviously
there will be some overlaps in functionality and some lack
of consistency and uniformity. However this allows PDL to
<br>
keep up with a rapidly developing field - the latest PDL
modules provide interfaces to OpenGL and VRML graphics!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT <br>
PGPLOT provides a simple library for line graphics and image
display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is an easy interface to
this in the internal module PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT, which
calls routines in the separately available PGPLOT top-level
module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL::Graphics::PLplot <br>
PLplot provides a simple library for creating graphics with
multiple output drivers, including a direct-to-piddle
driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This module provides both
high-level and low-level functionality built on PLplot. The
low-level commands are pretty much direct bindings to
PLplot&rsquo;s C interface. Read more at <br>
PDL::Graphics::PLplot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL::Graphics::IIS <br>
Many astronomers like to use SAOimage and Ximtool (or there
derivations/clones). These are useful free widgets for
inspection and visualisation of images. (They are not <br>
provided with perlDL but can easily be obtained from their
official sites off the Net.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PDL::Graphics::IIS package
provides allows one to display images in these
(&quot;IIS&quot; is the name of an ancient item of image
display hardware whose protocols these tools <br>
conform to.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL::Graphics::TriD <br>
See PDL::Graphics::TriD, this is a collection of 3D routines
for OpenGL and (soon) VRML and other 3D formats which allow
3D point, line, and surface plots from PDL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Autoloading <br>
See PDL::AutoLoader. This allows one to autoload functions
on demand, in a way perhaps familiar to users of MatLab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One can also write PDL
extensions as normal Perl modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL shells <br>
The Perl script &quot;pdl2&quot; (or &quot;perldl&quot;)
provides a simple command line interface to PDL. If the
latest Readlines/ReadKey modules have been installed
&quot;pdl2&quot; detects this and enables <br>
command line recall and editing. See the man page for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous shell
features:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p The shell aliases
&quot;p&quot; to be a convenient short form of
&quot;print&quot;, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdl&gt; p ones 5,3 <br>
[ <br>
[1 1 1 1 1] <br>
[1 1 1 1 1] <br>
[1 1 1 1 1] <br>
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Initialization <br>
The files &quot;~/.perldlrc&quot; and
&quot;local.perldlrc&quot; (in the current directory) are
sourced if found. This allows the user to have global and
local PDL code for startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help <br>
Type &rsquo;help&rsquo;! One can search the PDL
documentation, and look up documentation on any
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Escape <br>
Any line starting with the &quot;#&quot; character is
treated as a shell escape. This character is configurable by
setting the Perl variable $PERLDL_ESCAPE. This could, for
example, be <br>
set in &quot;~/.perldlrc&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overload operators <br>
The following builtin Perl operators and functions have been
overloaded to work on PDL variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ - * / &gt; &lt; &gt;= &lt;=
&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; &amp; | ^ == != &lt;=&gt; ** % ! ~ <br>
sin log abs atan2 sqrt cos exp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[All the unary functions (sin
etc.) may be used with inplace() - see &quot;Memory&quot;
below.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Object-Orientation and perlDL
<br>
PDL operations are available as functions and methods. Thus
one can derive new types of object, to represent custom data
classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By using overloading one can
make mathematical operators do whatever you please, and PDL
has some built-in tricks which allow existing PDL functions
to work unchanged, even if <br>
the underlying data representation is vastly changed! See
PDL::Objects</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Memory usage and references <br>
Messing around with really huge data arrays may require some
care. perlDL provides many facilities to let you perform
operations on big arrays without generating extra copies
<br>
though this does require a bit more thought and care from
the programmer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: On some most systems it is
better to configure Perl (during the build options) to use
the system &quot;malloc()&quot; function rather than
Perl&rsquo;s built-in one. This is because Perl&rsquo;s <br>
one is optimised for speed rather than consumption of
virtual memory - this can result in a factor of two
improvement in the amount of memory storage you can use. The
Perl <br>
malloc in 5.004 and later does have a number of compile-time
options you can use to tune the behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simple arithmetic <br>
If $a is a big image (e.g. occupying 10MB) then the
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$a = $a + 1;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eats up another 10MB of memory.
This is because the expression &quot;$a+1&quot; creates a
temporary copy of $a to hold the result, then $a is assigned
a reference to that. After this, <br>
the original $a is destroyed so there is no permanent memory
waste. But on a small machine, the growth in the memory
footprint can be considerable. It is obviously done this
<br>
way so &quot;$c=$a+1&quot; works as expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also if one says:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$b = $a; # $b and $a now point
to same data <br>
$a = $a + 1;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then $b and $a end up being
different, as one naively expects, because a new reference
is created and $a is assigned to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However if $a was a huge memory
hog (e.g. a 3D volume) creating a copy of it may not be a
good thing. One can avoid this memory overhead in the above
example by saying:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$a++;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The operations
&quot;++,+=,--,-=&quot;, etc. all call a special
&quot;in-place&quot; version of the arithmetic subroutine.
This means no more memory is needed - the downside of this
is that if <br>
&quot;$b=$a&quot; then $b is also incremented. To force a
copy explicitly:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$b = pdl $a; # Real copy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or, alternatively, perhaps
better style:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$b = $a-&gt;copy;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Functions <br>
Most functions, e.g. &quot;log()&quot;, return a result
which is a transformation of their argument. This makes for
good programming practice. However many operations can be
done &quot;in- <br>
place&quot; and this may be required when large arrays are
in use and memory is at a premium. For these circumstances
the operator inplace() is provided which prevents the extra
<br>
copy and allows the argument to be modified. e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$x = log($array); # $array
unaffected <br>
log( inplace($bigarray) ); # $bigarray changed in situ</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNINGS:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The usual caveats about
duplicate references apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Obviously when used with some
functions which can not be applied in situ (e.g.
&quot;convolve()&quot;) unexpected effects may occur! We try
to indicate &quot;inplace()&quot;-safe functions <br>
in the documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Type conversions, such
as&quot;float()&quot;, may cause hidden copying.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ensuring piddleness <br>
If you have written a simple function and you don&rsquo;t
want it to blow up in your face if you pass it a simple
number rather than a PDL variable. Simply call the function
topdl() <br>
first to make it safe. e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub myfiddle { my $pdl =
topdl(shift); $pdl-&gt;fiddle_foo(...); ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;topdl()&quot; does NOT
perform a copy if a pdl variable is passed - it just falls
through - which is obviously the desired behaviour. The
routine is not of course necessary in normal <br>
user defined functions which do not care about
internals.</p>
