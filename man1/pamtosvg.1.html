<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pamtosvg - convert a Netpbm image to a SVG (Scalable Vector
Graphics) image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pamtosvg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-background-color=colorname]
[-centerline] [-corner-threshold=angle]
[-corner-always-threshold=angle] [-corner-surround=integer]

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimum unique abbreviation of
option is acceptable. You may use double hyphens instead of
single hyphen to denote options. You may use white space in
place of the equals sign <br>
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamtosvg reads a PNM image as
input and produce an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) image as
output. Thus, it traces curves in the input image and
creates a set of splines that <br>
represent the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SVG is a vector image format,
which means it describes curves that compose an image. By
contrast, PNM is a raster format, which means it describes
dots that compose an image. <br>
The main practical difference between the two types is that
you can scale vector images better. A vector image also
takes a lot less data to describe an image if the image is
<br>
composed of simple curves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That means it is really an
understatement to say that pamtosvg is an image format
converter. It&rsquo;s really an image tracer. Its main job
is to trace a raster image and find the <br>
lines in it. It then represents its findings in SVG
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamtosvg does the same kind of
thing that StreamLine, CorelTrace, and Autotrace do. It is
in fact derived from Autotrace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SVG is a gigantic format,
capable of amazing things. pamtosvg exploits only a morsel
of it. The SVG image produced by pamtosvg consists of a
single &lt;svg&gt; element, which has a <br>
&rsquo;width&rsquo; attribute and a &rsquo;height&rsquo;
attribute. The value of that element is composed of
&lt;path&gt; elements. That&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the SVG output, distances are
unitless, with one unit corresponding to one pixel of the
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So that pamtosvg will find
simple curves in the image, you may want to remove speckles
from it with pbmclean and consolidate multiple shades into
single colors with pnmquant <br>
first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information on SVG, see
the Worldwide Web Consortium&rsquo;s SVG web page
&acirc;&uml;http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/&acirc;&copy;
.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-background-color=colorname <br>
Treat the specified color as the background color and ignore
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t specify this
option, pamtosvg does not recognize any background
color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify the color (colorname) as
described for the argument of the ppm_parsecolor() library
routine &acirc;&uml;libppm.html#colorname&acirc;&copy; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-centerline <br>
Trace an object&rsquo;s centerline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, pamtosvg traces an
object&rsquo;s outline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-corner-always-threshold=angle
<br>
Consider any angle at a pixel which falls below angle angle
(in decimal floating point degrees) as a corner, even if it
is bordered by other corner pixels. Default is 60 <br>
degrees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-corner-surround=integer <br>
Consider the specified number of pixels on either side of a
point when determining if that point is a corner. Default is
4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-corner-threshold=angle <br>
Consider any pixel which forms an angle with its
predecessors and successors that is smaller than angle (in
decimal floating point degrees) as a corner. Default is
100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-error-threshold=float <br>
Subdivide fitted curves that are offset by a number of
pixels exceeding the specified number. Default is 2.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-filter-iterations=integer <br>
Smooth the curve the specified number of times prior to
fitting Default is 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-line-reversion-threshold=float
<br>
When a spline is closer to a straight line than the
specified real number weighted by the square of the curve
length, maintain it as a straight line, even if it is a list
<br>
with curves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default is .01.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-line-threshold=float <br>
If a spline does not deviate from the straight line defined
by its endpoints by more than the specified number of
pixels, then treat it as a straight line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-log Create a log of the curve
tracing process (suitable for debugging). Put it in the file
named inputfile.log in the current directory, where
inputfile is the root of the <br>
input file name, or &rsquo;pamtosvg&rsquo; if the input is
from Standard Input or a file with a weird name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-preserve-width <br>
Preserve line width prior to thinning. Meaningful only with
-centerline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove-adjacent-corners <br>
Remove adjacent corners.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-report-progress <br>
Report the progress of the tracing to Standard Error as it
happens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tangent-surround <br>
Consider the specified number of points to either side of a
point when computing the tangent at that point. Default is
3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-width-weight-factor <br>
Weight factor for fitting the linewidth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Application Notes <br>
A convenient way to view an SVG document is with a web
browser. Many understand a file whose name ends in
&rsquo;.svg&rsquo; to be an SVG image and can render it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
pamtosvg was added to Netpbm in Version 10.33 (March
2006).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The core of pamtosvg -- the
curve tracing logic -- was taken nearly unmodified from
Martin Weber&rsquo;s Autotrace program. That program
duplicates a lot of Netpbm function, so pam&acirc; <br>
tosvg is a much leaner program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bryan Henderson created
pamtosvg, basically just by adapting Autotrace to
Netpbm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Autotrace was first released in
2000 and updates were released through 2002. A number of
people wrote the code in it, but Masatake Yamato and Martin
Weber appear to be the prin&acirc; <br>
cipal creators of it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of June 2006, there was a
Sourceforge project
&acirc;&uml;http://autotrace.sourceforge.net&acirc;&copy;
for it.</p>
