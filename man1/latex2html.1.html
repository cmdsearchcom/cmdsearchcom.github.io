This manual page explains the <b>LaTeX2HTML</b> utility, which is a <b>Perl</b>
  program that translates <b>LaTeX</b> document into <b>HTML</b> format. For
  each source file given as an argument the translator will create a directory
  containing the corresponding HTML files. For details and examples, please
  consult the online html documentation, a copy of which should be available in
  <i>/usr/share/doc/latex2html/manual.ps.gz</i> or
  <i>/usr/share/doc/latex2html/html/</i>

      systems a file of this name will be used, if it exists, when a browser
      tries to view a URL which points to a directory. On other systems a
      different value for <i>$LINKNAME</i> may be appropriate. Typically
      <i>$LINKPOINT</i> has value <i>$FILE.html,</i> but this may also be
      changed to match whichever HTML page is to become the target of the

      (default is 8)</i> The level at which to stop splitting sections is
      calculated ``relative to'' the shallowest level of sectioning that occurs
      within the document. For example, if the document contains \section
      commands, but no \part or \chapter commands, then -split +1 will cause
      splitting at each \section but not at any deeper level; whereas -split +2
      or -split +3 also split down to \subsection and \subsubsection commands
      respectively. Specifying -split +0 puts the entire document into a single

  <dd class="It-tag">Same as setting: <i>$MAX_LINK_DEPTH = &lt;num&gt;; (default
      is 4)</i> For each node, create links to child nodes down to this much
      deeper than the node's sectioning-level. Specifying -link 0 will show no
      links to child nodes from that page, -link 1 will show only the immediate
      descendents, etc. A value at least as big as that of the -split
      &lt;num&gt; depth will produce a mini table-of-contents (when not empty)
      on each page, for the tree structure rooted at that node. When the page
      has a sectioning-level less than the -split depth, so that the a mini
      table-of-contents has links to other <b>HTML</b> pages, this table is
      located at the bottom of the page, unless placed elsewhere using the

  <dd class="It-tag">Same as setting: <i>$UNSEGMENT = 1;</i> Treat a segmented
      document (see the section about document segmentation) like it were not
      segmented. This will cause the translator to concatenate all segments and
      process them as a whole. You might find this useful to check a segmented
      document for consistency. For all documents the sectioning levels referred
      to above are:</dd>

  controlling Extensions and Special Features</a></h1>
The switches described here govern the type of <b>HTML</b> code that can be
  generated, and how to choose between the available options when there are
  alternative strategies for implementing portions of <b>LaTeX</b> code.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-html_version
    (2.0|3.0|3.2)[,(math|i18n|table)]*</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Same as setting: <i>$HTML_VERSION = ... ;</i> This
      specifies both the <b>HTML</b> version to generate, and any extra
      (non-standard) <b>HTML</b> features that may be required. The version
      number corresponds to a published DTD for an <b>HTML</b> standard
      (although 3.0 was never accepted and subsequently withdrawn). A
      corresponding <b>Perl</b> file in the versions/ subdirectory is loaded;
      these files are named `html&lt;num&gt;.pl'. Following the version number,
      a comma-separated list of extensions can be given. Each corresponds to a
      file `&lt;name&gt;.pl' also located in the versions/ subdirectory. When
      such a file is loaded the resulting HTML code can no longer be expected to
      validate with the specified DTD. An exception is math when the -no_math
      switch is also used, which should still validate. Currently, versions 2.0,
      3.2 and 4.0 are available. (and also 2.1, 2.2, 3.0 and 3.1, for
      hoistorical reasons). The extensions i18n, tables, math correspond roughly
      to what used to be called versions `2.1', `2.2', `3.1' respectively, in
      releases of <b>LaTeX2HTML</b> up to 1996. Now these extensions can be
      loaded with any of `2.0', `3.2' or `4.0' as the specified standard. The
      default version is usually set to be `3.2', within latex2html.config.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-no_tex_defs</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Same as setting: <i>$TEXDEFS = 0; (default is 1)</i> When
      <i>$TEXDEFS</i> is set (default) the file texdefs.perl will be read. This
      provides code to allow common TEX commands like \def, \newbox, \newdimen
      and others, to be recognised, especially within the document preamble. In
      the case of \def, the definition may even be fully interpreted, but this
      requires the pattern-matching to be not too complicated. If
      <i>$TEXDEFS</i> is `0' or empty, then texdefs.perl will not be loaded; the
      translator will make no attempt to interpret any raw TEX commands. This
      feature is intended to enable sophisticated authors the ability to insert
      arbitrary TEX commands in environments that are destined to be processed
      by <b>LaTeX</b> anyway; e.g. figures, theorems, pictures, etc. However
      this should rarely be needed, as now there is better support for these
      types of environment. There are now other methods to specify which chunks
      of code are to be passed to <b>LaTeX</b> for explicit image-generation;
      see the discussion of the makeimage environment.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-external_file &lt;filename&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Same as setting: <i>$EXTERNAL_FILE = &lt;filename&gt; ;</i>
      Specifies the prefix of the .aux file that this document should read. The
      .aux extension will be appended to this prefix to get the complete
      filename, with directory path if needed. This file could contain necessary
      information regarding citations, figure, table and section numbers from
      <b>LaTeX</b> and perhaps other information also. Use of this switch is
      vital for document segments, processed separately and linked to appear as
      if generated from a single LaTeX document.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-font_size &lt;size&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Same as setting: <i>$FONT_SIZE = &lt;size&gt; ;</i> This
      option provides better control over the font size of environments made
      into images using <b>LaTeX.</b> &lt;size&gt; must be one of the font sizes
      that <b>LaTeX</b> recognizes; i.e. `10pt', `11pt', `12pt', etc. Default is
      `10pt', or whatever option may have been specified on the \documentclass
      or \documentstyle line. Whatever size is selected, it will be magnified by
      the installation variables <i>$MATH_SCALE_FACTOR,</i>
      <i>$FIGURE_SCALE_FACTOR</i> and <i>$DISP_SCALE_FACTOR</i> as appropriate.
      Note: This switch provides no control over the size of text on the HTML
      pages. Such control is subject entirely to the user's choices of settings
      for the browser windows.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-scalable_fonts</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Same as setting: <i>$SCALABLE_FONTS = 1;</i> This is used
      when scalable fonts, such as PostScript versions of the TEX fonts, are
      available for image-generation. It has the effect of setting
      <i>$PK_GENERATION</i> to `1', and <i>$DVIPS_MODE</i> to be empty,
      overriding any previous settings for these variables.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-no_math</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Same as setting: <i>$NO_SIMPLE_MATH = 1;</i> Ordinarily
      simple mathematical expressions are set using the ordinary text font, but
      italiced. When part of the expression can not be represented this way, an
      image is made of the whole formula. This is called ``simple math''. When
      <i>$NO_SIMPLE_MATH</i> is set, then all mathematics is made into images,
      whether simple or not. However, if the math extension is loaded, using the
      -html_version switch described earlier, then specifying -no_math produces
      a quite different effect. Now it is the special &lt;MATH&gt; tags and
      entities which are cancelled. In their place a sophisticated scheme for
      parsing mathematical expressions is used. Images are made of those
      sub-parts of a formula which cannot be adequately expressed using
      (italiced) text characters and &lt;SUB&gt; and &lt;SUP&gt; tags. See the
      subsection on mathematics for more details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-local_icons</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Same as setting: <i>$LOCAL_ICONS = 1;</i> A copy of each of
      the icons actually used within the document is placed in the directory
      along with the <b>HTML</b> files and generated images. This allows the
      whole document to be fully self-contained, within this directory;
      otherwise the icons must be retrieved from a (perhaps remote) server. The
      icons are normally copied from a subdirectory of the
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>$LATEX2HTMLDIR,</b>
    <br/>
     set within latex2html.config. An alternative set of icons can be used by

      file will be loaded after loading <i>$HOME/.latex2html-init,</i> or
      .latex2html-init in the local directory, if either file exists. It is read
      at the time the switch is processed, so the contents of the file may

  <dd class="It-tag">Same as setting: <i>$NOFORK = 1;</i> When set this disables
      a feature in the early part of the processing whereby some
      memory-intensive operations are performed by `forked' child processes.
      Some single-task operating systems, such as DOS, do not support this
      feature. Having <i>$NOFORK</i> set then ensures that unnecessary
      file-handles that are needed with the forked processes, are not consumed
      unnecessarily, perhaps resulting in a fatal <b>Perl</b> error.</dd>

      used, it is frequently desirable to change the style of the marker used to
      indicate the presence of a footnote. This is done as in <b>LaTeX,</b>

When processing a single stand-alone document, the switches described in this
  section should not be needed at all, since the automatically generated
  navigation panels, described on the previous page should generate all the
  required navigation links. However if a document is to be regarded as part of
  a much larger document, then links from its first and final pages, to
  locations in other parts of the larger (virtual) document, need to be provided
  explicitly for some of the buttons in the navigation panel. The following
  switches allow for such links to other documents, by providing the title and
  URL for navigation panel hyperlinks. In particular, the ``Document
  Segmentation'' feature necessarily makes great use of these switches. It is
  usual for the text and targets of these navigation hyperlinks to be recorded
  in a Makefile, to avoid tedious typing of long command-lines having many
  switches.
