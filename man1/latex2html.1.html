<p>LaTeX2HTML(1) Debian GNU/Linux manual LaTeX2HTML(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
latex2html - translate LaTeX files to HTML (HyperText Markup
Language)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
latex2html [options] [target [target ...]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page explains the LaTeX2HTML utility, which is a
Perl program that translates LaTeX document into HTML
format. For each source file given as an argument the
transla&acirc; <br>
tor will create a directory containing the corresponding
HTML files. For details and examples, please consult the
online html documentation, a copy of which should be
available <br>
in /usr/share/doc/latex2html/manual.ps.gz or
/usr/share/doc/latex2html/html/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEAT <br>
This documetation has been derived from the TeX manual, and
may not be uptodate. Please refer to the online manual for
authoritative documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options controlling Titles,
File-Names and Sectioning <br>
-t &lt;top-page-title&gt; <br>
Same as setting: $TITLE = &lt;top-page-title&gt; ; Name the
document using this title.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-short_extn <br>
Same as setting: $SHORTEXTN = 1; Use a filename prefix of
.htm for the produced HTML files. This is particularly
useful for creating pages to be stored on CD-ROM or other
<br>
media, to be used with operating systems that require a
3-character extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-long_titles &lt;num&gt; <br>
Same as setting: $LONG_TITLES = &lt;num&gt;; Instead of the
standard names: node1.html, node2.html,... the filenames for
each HTML page are constructed from the first &lt;num&gt;
<br>
words of the section heading for that page, separated by the
&lsquo;_&rsquo; character. Commas and common short words (a
an to by of and for the) are omitted from both title and
<br>
word-count. Warning: Use this switch with great caution.
Currently there are no checks for uniqueness of names or
overall length. Very long names can easily result from <br>
using this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-custom_titles <br>
Same as setting: $CUSTOM_TITLES = 1; Instead of the standard
names: node1.html, node2.html, ... the filenames for each
HTML page are constructed using a Perl subroutine <br>
named custom_title_hook . The user may define his/her own
version of this subroutine, within a .latex2html-init file
say, to override the default (which uses the standard <br>
names). This subroutine takes the section-heading as a
parameter and must return the required name, or the empty
string (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dir &lt;output-directory&gt;
<br>
Same as setting: $DESTDIR = &lt;output-directory&gt; ;
Redirect the output to the specified directory. The default
behaviour is to create (or reuse) a directory having the
same <br>
name as the prefix of the document being processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_subdir <br>
Same as setting: $NO_SUBDIR = 1; Place the generated HTML
files into the current directory. This overrides any
$DESTDIR setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-prefix &lt;filename-prefix&gt;
<br>
Same as setting: $PREFIX = &lt;filename-prefix&gt; ; The
&lt;filename-prefix&gt; will be prepended to all .gif, .pl
and .html files produced, except for the top-level .html
file; it <br>
may include a (relative) directory path. This will enable
multiple products of LaTeX2HTML to peacefully coexist in the
same directory. However, do not attempt to simulta&acirc;
<br>
neously run multiple instances of LaTeX2HTML using the same
output directory, else various temporary files will
overwrite each other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-auto_prefix <br>
Same as setting: $AUTO_PREFIX = 1; Constructs the prefix as
&lsquo;&lt;title&gt;-&rsquo; to be prepended to all the
files produced, where &lt;title&gt; is the name of the LaTeX
file being pro&acirc; <br>
cessed. (Note the &lsquo;-&rsquo; in this prefix.) This
overrides any $PREFIX setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_auto_link <br>
Same as setting: $NO_AUTO_LINK = 1; If $NO_AUTO_LINK is
empty and variables $LINKPOINT and $LINKNAME are defined
appropriately (as is the default in the latex2html.config
<br>
file), then a hard link to the main HTML page is produced,
using the name supplied in $LINKNAME. Typically this is
index.html; on many systems a file of this name will be <br>
used, if it exists, when a browser tries to view a URL which
points to a directory. On other systems a different value
for $LINKNAME may be appropriate. Typically $LINK&acirc;
<br>
POINT has value $FILE.html, but this may also be changed to
match whichever HTML page is to become the target of the
automatic link. Use of the -no_auto_link switch can&acirc;
<br>
cels this automatic linking facility, when not required for
a particular document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-split &lt;num&gt; <br>
Same as setting: $MAX_SPLIT_DEPTH = &lt;num&gt;; (default is
8) Stop splitting sections into separate files at this
depth. Specifying -split 0 will put the entire document into
<br>
a single HTML file. See below for the different levels of
sectioning. Also see the next item for how to set a
&lsquo;&lsquo;relative&rsquo;&rsquo; depth for
splitting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-split +&lt;num&gt; <br>
Same as setting: $MAX_SPLIT_DEPTH = -&lt;num&gt;; (default
is 8) The level at which to stop splitting sections is
calculated &lsquo;&lsquo;relative to&rsquo;&rsquo; the
shallowest level of sectioning <br>
that occurs within the document. For example, if the
document contains tion commands, but no art or tion but not
at any deeper level; whereas -split +2 or -split +3 also
split down to section and subsection commands respectively.
Specifying -split +0 puts the <br>
entire document into a single HTML file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-link &lt;num&gt; <br>
Same as setting: $MAX_LINK_DEPTH = &lt;num&gt;; (default is
4) For each node, create links to child nodes down to this
much deeper than the node&rsquo;s sectioning-level.
Specifying <br>
-link 0 will show no links to child nodes from that page,
-link 1 will show only the immediate descendents, etc. A
value at least as big as that of the -split &lt;num&gt;
depth <br>
will produce a mini table-of-contents (when not empty) on
each page, for the tree structure rooted at that node. When
the page has a sectioning-level less than the -split <br>
depth, so that the a mini table-of-contents has links to
other HTML pages, this table is located at the bottom of the
page, unless placed elsewhere using the able&acirc; <br>
ofchildlinks command. On pages having a sectioning-level
just less than the -split depth the mini table-of-contents
contains links to subsections etc. occurring on the <br>
same HTML page. Now the table is located at the top of this
page, unless placed elsewhere using the ableofchildlinks
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-toc_depth &lt;num&gt; <br>
Same as setting: $TOC_DEPTH = &lt;num&gt;; (default is 4)
Sectioning levels down to &lt;num&gt; are to be included
within the Table-of-Contents tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-toc_stars <br>
Same as setting: $TOC_STARS = 1; Sections created using the
starred-form of sectioning commands are included within the
Table-of-Contents. As with LaTeX, normally such <br>
sections are not listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-show_section_numbers <br>
Same as setting: $SHOW_SECTION_NUMBERS = 1; Show section
numbers. By default section numbers are not shown, so as to
encourage the use of particular sections as stand- <br>
alone documents. In order to be shown, section titles must
be unique and must not contain inlined graphics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-unsegment <br>
Same as setting: $UNSEGMENT = 1; Treat a segmented document
(see the section about document segmentation) like it were
not segmented. This will cause the translator to <br>
concatenate all segments and process them as a whole. You
might find this useful to check a segmented document for
consistency. For all documents the sectioning levels <br>
referred to above are: <br>
0 document <br>
1 part <br>
2 chapter <br>
3 section <br>
4 subsection <br>
5 subsubsection <br>
6 paragraph <br>
7 subparagraph <br>
8 subsubparagraph</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These levels apply even when the
document contains no sectioning for the shallower levels;
e.g. no art or cle document-class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options controlling Extensions
and Special Features <br>
The switches described here govern the type of HTML code
that can be generated, and how to choose between the
available options when there are alternative strategies for
imple&acirc; <br>
menting portions of LaTeX code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-html_version
(2.0|3.0|3.2)[,(math|i18n|table)]* <br>
Same as setting: $HTML_VERSION = ... ; This specifies both
the HTML version to generate, and any extra (non-standard)
HTML features that may be required. The version <br>
number corresponds to a published DTD for an HTML standard
(although 3.0 was never accepted and subsequently
withdrawn). A corresponding Perl file in the versions/
subdi&acirc; <br>
rectory is loaded; these files are named
&lsquo;html&lt;num&gt;.pl&rsquo;. Following the version
number, a comma-separated list of extensions can be given.
Each corresponds to a file <br>
&lsquo;&lt;name&gt;.pl&rsquo; also located in the versions/
subdirectory. When such a file is loaded the resulting HTML
code can no longer be expected to validate with the
specified DTD. An <br>
exception is math when the -no_math switch is also used,
which should still validate. Currently, versions 2.0, 3.2
and 4.0 are available. (and also 2.1, 2.2, 3.0 and 3.1, <br>
for hoistorical reasons). The extensions i18n, tables, math
correspond roughly to what used to be called versions
&lsquo;2.1&rsquo;, &lsquo;2.2&rsquo;, &lsquo;3.1&rsquo;
respectively, in releases of <br>
LaTeX2HTML up to 1996. Now these extensions can be loaded
with any of &lsquo;2.0&rsquo;, &lsquo;3.2&rsquo; or
&lsquo;4.0&rsquo; as the specified standard. The default
version is usually set to be &lsquo;3.2&rsquo;, <br>
within latex2html.config.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_tex_defs <br>
Same as setting: $TEXDEFS = 0; (default is 1) When $TEXDEFS
is set (default) the file texdefs.perl will be read. This
provides code to allow common TEX commands like ef, <br>
0wbox, 0wdimen and others, to be recognised, especially
within the document preamble. In the case of ef, the
definition may even be fully interpreted, but this <br>
requires the pattern-matching to be not too complicated. If
$TEXDEFS is &lsquo;0&rsquo; or empty, then texdefs.perl will
not be loaded; the translator will make no attempt to
inter&acirc; <br>
pret any raw TEX commands. This feature is intended to
enable sophisticated authors the ability to insert arbitrary
TEX commands in environments that are destined to be <br>
processed by LaTeX anyway; e.g. figures, theorems, pictures,
etc. However this should rarely be needed, as now there is
better support for these types of environment. <br>
There are now other methods to specify which chunks of code
are to be passed to LaTeX for explicit image-generation; see
the discussion of the makeimage environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-external_file &lt;filename&gt;
<br>
Same as setting: $EXTERNAL_FILE = &lt;filename&gt; ;
Specifies the prefix of the .aux file that this document
should read. The .aux extension will be appended to this
prefix to <br>
get the complete filename, with directory path if needed.
This file could contain necessary information regarding
citations, figure, table and section numbers from LaTeX <br>
and perhaps other information also. Use of this switch is
vital for document segments, processed separately and linked
to appear as if generated from a single LaTeX docu&acirc;
<br>
ment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-font_size &lt;size&gt; <br>
Same as setting: $FONT_SIZE = &lt;size&gt; ; This option
provides better control over the font size of environments
made into images using LaTeX. &lt;size&gt; must be one of
the font <br>
sizes that LaTeX recognizes; i.e. &lsquo;10pt&rsquo;,
&lsquo;11pt&rsquo;, &lsquo;12pt&rsquo;, etc. Default is
&lsquo;10pt&rsquo;, or whatever option may have been
specified on the ocumentclass or ocumentstyle line. <br>
Whatever size is selected, it will be magnified by the
installation variables $MATH_SCALE_FACTOR,
$FIGURE_SCALE_FACTOR and $DISP_SCALE_FACTOR as appropriate.
Note: This <br>
switch provides no control over the size of text on the HTML
pages. Such control is subject entirely to the user&rsquo;s
choices of settings for the browser windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-scalable_fonts <br>
Same as setting: $SCALABLE_FONTS = 1; This is used when
scalable fonts, such as PostScript versions of the TEX
fonts, are available for image-generation. It has the <br>
effect of setting $PK_GENERATION to &lsquo;1&rsquo;, and
$DVIPS_MODE to be empty, overriding any previous settings
for these variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_math <br>
Same as setting: $NO_SIMPLE_MATH = 1; Ordinarily simple
mathematical expressions are set using the ordinary text
font, but italiced. When part of the expression can not be
<br>
represented this way, an image is made of the whole formula.
This is called &lsquo;&lsquo;simple math&rsquo;&rsquo;. When
$NO_SIMPLE_MATH is set, then all mathematics is made into
images, whether <br>
simple or not. However, if the math extension is loaded,
using the -html_version switch described earlier, then
specifying -no_math produces a quite different effect. Now
<br>
it is the special &lt;MATH&gt; tags and entities which are
cancelled. In their place a sophisticated scheme for parsing
mathematical expressions is used. Images are made of <br>
those sub-parts of a formula which cannot be adequately
expressed using (italiced) text characters and &lt;SUB&gt;
and &lt;SUP&gt; tags. See the subsection on mathematics for
more <br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-local_icons <br>
Same as setting: $LOCAL_ICONS = 1; A copy of each of the
icons actually used within the document is placed in the
directory along with the HTML files and generated images.
<br>
This allows the whole document to be fully self-contained,
within this directory; otherwise the icons must be retrieved
from a (perhaps remote) server. The icons are nor&acirc;
<br>
mally copied from a subdirectory of the</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$LATEX2HTMLDIR, <br>
set within latex2html.config. An alternative set of icons
can be used by specifying a (relative) directory path in
$ALTERNATIVE_ICONS to where the customised images can <br>
be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-init_file &lt;file&gt; <br>
Load the specified initialisation file. This Perl file will
be loaded after loading $HOME/.latex2html-init, or
.latex2html-init in the local directory, if either file <br>
exists. It is read at the time the switch is processed, so
the contents of the file may change any of the values of any
of the variables that were previously established, <br>
as well as any default options. More than one initialisation
file can be read in this way. [change_begin]98.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_fork <br>
Same as setting: $NOFORK = 1; When set this disables a
feature in the early part of the processing whereby some
memory-intensive operations are performed by
&lsquo;forked&rsquo; child <br>
processes. Some single-task operating systems, such as DOS,
do not support this feature. Having $NOFORK set then ensures
that unnecessary file-handles that are needed with <br>
the forked processes, are not consumed unnecessarily,
perhaps resulting in a fatal Perl error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iso_language &lt;type&gt; <br>
This enables you to specify a different language type than
&rsquo;EN&rsquo; to be used in the DTD entries of the HTML
document, e.g. &rsquo;EN.US&rsquo;. [change_end] 98.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-short_index <br>
Same as setting: $SHORT_INDEX = 1; Creates shorter Index
listings, using codified links; this is fully compatible
with the makeidx package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_footnode <br>
Same as setting: $NO_FOOTNODE = 1; Suppresses use of a
separate file for footnotes; instead these are placed at the
bottom of the HTML pages where the references occur. <br>
When this option is used, it is frequently desirable to
change the style of the marker used to indicate the presence
of a footnote. This is done as in LaTeX, using code <br>
such as follows.enewcommand{hefootnote}{rabic{footnote}} All
the styles rabic, oman, 0able. [change_begin]98.1 lph,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-numbered_footnotes <br>
Same as setting: $NUMBERED_FOOTNOTES = 1; If this is set you
will get every footnote applied with a subsequent number, to
ease readability. [change_end] 98.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-address &lt;author-address&gt;
<br>
Same as setting: $ADDRESS = &lt;author-address&gt; ; Sign
each page with this address. See latex2html.config for an
example using Perl code to automatically include the date.
<br>
A user-defined Perl subroutine called &amp;custom_address
can be used instead, if defined; it takes the value of
$ADDRESS as a parameter, which may be used or ignored as
<br>
desired. At the time when this subroutine will be called,
variables named $depth, $title, $file hold the
sectioning-level, title and filename of the HTML page being
pro&acirc; <br>
duced; $FILE holds the name of the filename for the
title-page of the whole document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-info &lt;string&gt; <br>
Same as setting: $INFO = &lt;string&gt; ; Generate a new
section &lsquo;&lsquo;About this document&rsquo;&rsquo;
containing information about the document being translated.
The default is to generate <br>
such a section with information on the original document,
the date, the user and the translator. An empty string (or
the value &lsquo;0&rsquo;) disables the creation of this
extra <br>
section. If a non-empty string is given, it will be placed
as the contents of the &lsquo;&lsquo;About this
document&rsquo;&rsquo; page instead of the default
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switches controlling Image
Generation <br>
These switches affect whether images are created at all,
whether old images are reused on subsequent runs or new ones
created afresh, and whether anti-aliasing effects are used
<br>
within the images themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ascii_mode <br>
Same as setting: $ASCII_MODE = $EXTERNAL_IMAGES = 1; Use
only ASCII characters and do not include any images in the
final output. With -ascii_mode the output of the
trans&acirc; <br>
lator can be used on character-based browsers, such as lynx,
which do not support inlined images (via the &lt;IMG&gt;
tag).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nolatex <br>
Same as setting: $NOLATEX = 1; Disable the mechanism for
passing unknown environments to LaTeX for processing. This
can be thought of as &lsquo;&lsquo;draft mode&rsquo;&rsquo;
which allows faster <br>
translation of the basic document structure and text,
without fancy figures, equations or tables. (This option has
been superseded by the -no_images option, see below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-external_images <br>
Same as setting: $EXTERNAL_IMAGES = 1; Instead of including
any generated images inside the document, leave them outside
the document and provide hypertext links to them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ps_images <br>
Same as setting: $PS_IMAGES = $EXTERNAL_IMAGES = 1; Use
links to external PostScript files rather than inlined
images in the chosen graphics format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-discard <br>
Same as setting: $DISCARD_PS = 1; The temporary PostScript
files are discarded immediately after they have been used to
create the image in the desired graphics format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_images <br>
Same as setting: $NO_IMAGES = 1; Do not attempt to produce
any inlined images. The missing images can be generated
&lsquo;&lsquo;off-line&rsquo;&rsquo; by restarting
LaTeX2HTML with the option <br>
-images_only .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-images_only <br>
Same as setting: $IMAGES_ONLY = 1; Try to convert any
inlined images that were left over from previous runs of
LaTeX2HTML.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-reuse &lt;reuse_option&gt; <br>
Same as setting: $REUSE = &lt;reuse_option&gt;; This switch
specifies the extent to which image files are to be shared
or recycled. There are three valid options: [*] 0 Do not
<br>
ever share or recycle image files. This choice also invokes
an interactive session prompting the user about what to do
about a pre-existing HTML directory, if it exists. <br>
[*] 1 Recycle image files from a previous run if they are
available, but do not share identical images that must be
created in this run. [*] 2 Recycle image files from a <br>
previous run and share identical images from this run. This
is the default. A later section provides additional
information about image-reuse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_reuse <br>
Same as setting: $REUSE = 0; Do not share or recycle images
generated during previous translations. This is equivalent
to -reuse 0 . (This will enable the initial inter&acirc;
<br>
active session during which the user is asked whether to
reuse the old directory, delete its contents or quit.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-antialias <br>
Same as setting: $ANTI_ALIAS = 1; (Default is 0.) Generated
images of figure environments and external PostScript files
should use anti-aliasing. By default anti-aliasing <br>
is not used with these images, since this may interfere with
the contents of the images themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-antialias_text <br>
Same as setting: $ANTI_ALIAS_TEXT = 1; (Default is 1.)
Generated images of typeset material such as text,
mathematical formulas, tables and the content of makeimage
envi&acirc; <br>
ronments, should use anti-aliasing effects. The default is
normally to use anti-aliasing for text, since the resulting
images are much clearer on-screen. However the <br>
default may have been changed locally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_antialias <br>
Same as setting: $ANTI_ALIAS = 0; (Default is 0.) Generated
images of figure environments and external PostScript files
should not use anti-aliasing with images, though <br>
the local default may have been changed to use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_antialias_text <br>
Same as setting: $ANTI_ALIAS_TEXT = 0; (Default is 1.)
Generated images of typeset material should not use
anti-aliasing effects. Although on-screen images of text are
<br>
definitely improved using anti-aliasing, printed images can
be badly blurred, even at 300dpi. Higher resolution printers
do a much better job with the resulting grey-scale <br>
images. [change_begin]98.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-white Same as setting:
$WHITE_BACKGROUND = 1; (Default is 1.) Ensures that images
of figure environments have a white background. Otherwise
transparency effects may not work <br>
correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_white <br>
Same as setting: $WHITE_BACKGROUND = &rsquo;&rsquo;;
(Default is 1.) Cancels the requirement that figure
environments have a white background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ldump Same as setting:
$LATEX_DUMP = 1; (Default is 0.) Use this if you want to
speed up image processing during the 2nd and subsequent runs
of LaTeX2HTML on the same document. <br>
The translator now produces a LaTeX format-dump of the
preamble to images.tex which is used on subsequent runs.
This significantly reduces the startup time when LaTeX <br>
reads the images.tex file for image-generation. This process
actually consumes additional time on the first run, since
LaTeX is called twice -- once to create the format- <br>
dump, then again to load and use it. The pay-off comes with
the faster loading on subsequent runs. Approximately 1 Meg
of disk space is consumed by the dump file. <br>
[change_end] 98.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switches controlling Navigation
Panels <br>
The following switches govern whether to include one or more
navigation panels on each HTML page, also which buttons to
include within such a panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_navigation <br>
Same as setting: $NO_NAVIGATION = 1; Disable the mechanism
for putting navigation links in each page. This overrides
any settings of the $TOP_NAVIGATION, $BOTTOM_NAVIGA&acirc;
<br>
TION and $AUTO_NAVIGATION variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-top_navigation <br>
Same as setting: $TOP_NAVIGATION = 1; Put navigation links
at the top of each page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bottom_navigation <br>
Same as setting: $BOTTOM_NAVIGATION = 1; Put navigation
links at the bottom of each page as well as the top.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-auto_navigation <br>
Same as setting: $AUTO_NAVIGATION = 1; Put navigation links
at the top of each page. Also put one at the bottom of the
page, if the page exceeds $WORDS_IN_PAGE number of <br>
words (default = 450).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-next_page_in_navigation <br>
Same as setting: $NEXT_PAGE_IN_NAVIGATION = 1; Put a link to
the next logical page in the navigation panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-previous_page_in_navigation
<br>
Same as setting: $PREVIOUS_PAGE_IN_NAVIGATION = 1; Put a
link to the previous logical page in the navigation
panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-contents_in_navigation <br>
Same as setting: $CONTENTS_IN_NAVIGATION = 1; Put a link to
the table-of-contents in the navigation panel if there is
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-index_in_navigation <br>
Same as setting: $INDEX_IN_NAVIGATION = 1; Put a link to the
index-page in the navigation panel if there is an index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switches for Linking to other
documents <br>
When processing a single stand-alone document, the switches
described in this section should not be needed at all, since
the automatically generated navigation panels, described
<br>
on the previous page should generate all the required
navigation links. However if a document is to be regarded as
part of a much larger document, then links from its first
and <br>
final pages, to locations in other parts of the larger
(virtual) document, need to be provided explicitly for some
of the buttons in the navigation panel. The following
switches <br>
allow for such links to other documents, by providing the
title and URL for navigation panel hyperlinks. In
particular, the &lsquo;&lsquo;Document
Segmentation&rsquo;&rsquo; feature necessarily makes <br>
great use of these switches. It is usual for the text and
targets of these navigation hyperlinks to be recorded in a
Makefile, to avoid tedious typing of long command-lines
hav&acirc; <br>
ing many switches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-up_url &lt;URL&gt; <br>
Same as setting: $EXTERNAL_UP_LINK = &lt;URL&gt; ; Specifies
a universal resource locator (URL) to associate with the
&lsquo;&lsquo;UP&rsquo;&rsquo; button in the navigation
panel(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-up_title &lt;string&gt; <br>
Same as setting: $EXTERNAL_UP_TITLE = &lt;string&gt; ;
Specifies a title associated with this URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-prev_url &lt;URL&gt; <br>
Same as setting: $EXTERNAL_PREV_LINK = &lt;URL&gt; ;
Specifies a URL to associate with the
&lsquo;&lsquo;PREVIOUS&rsquo;&rsquo; button in the
navigation panel(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-prev_title &lt;string&gt; <br>
Same as setting: $EXTERNAL_PREV_TITLE = &lt;string&gt; ;
Specifies a title associated with this URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-down_url &lt;URL&gt; <br>
Same as setting: $EXTERNAL_DOWN_LINK = &lt;URL&gt; ;
Specifies a URL for the &lsquo;&lsquo;NEXT&rsquo;&rsquo;
button in the navigation panel(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-down_title &lt;string&gt; <br>
Same as setting: $EXTERNAL_DOWN_TITLE = &lt;string&gt; ;
Specifies a title associated with this URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-contents &lt;URL&gt; <br>
Same as setting: $EXTERNAL_CONTENTS = &lt;URL&gt; ;
Specifies a URL for the &lsquo;&lsquo;CONTENTS&rsquo;&rsquo;
button, for document segments that would not otherwise have
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-index &lt;URL&gt; <br>
Same as setting: $EXTERNAL_INDEX = &lt;URL&gt; ; Specifies a
URL for the &lsquo;&lsquo;INDEX&rsquo;&rsquo; button, for
document segments that otherwise would not have an
index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-biblio &lt;URL&gt; <br>
Same as setting: $EXTERNAL_BIBLIO = &lt;URL&gt; ; Specifies
the URL for the bibliography page to be used, when not
explicitly part of the document itself. Warning: On some
sys&acirc; <br>
tems it is difficult to give text-strings &lt;string&gt;
containing space characters, on the command-line or via a
Makefile. One way to overcome this is to use the
corresponding <br>
variable. Another way is to replace the spaces with
underscores (_).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switches for Help and Tracing
<br>
The first two of the following switches are
self-explanatory. When problems arise in processing a
document, the switches -debug and -verbosity will each cause
LaTeX2HTML to gen&acirc; <br>
erate more output to the screen. These extra messages should
help to locate the cause of the problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tmp &lt;path&gt; <br>
Define a temporary directory to use for image generation. If
&lt;path&gt; is 0, the standard temporary directory /tmp is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h(elp) <br>
Print out the list of all command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print the current version of
LaTeX2HTML.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-debug Same as setting: $DEBUG =
1; Run in debug-mode, displaying messages and/or diagnostic
information about files read, and utilities called by
LaTeX2HTML. Shows any messages <br>
produced by these calls. More extensive diagnostics, from
the Perl debugger, can be obtained by appending the string
&lsquo;-w-&rsquo; to the 1st line of the latex2html (and
other) <br>
Perl script(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbosity &lt;num&gt; <br>
Same as setting: $VERBOSITY = &lt;num&gt;; Display messages
revealing certain aspects of the processing performed by
LaTeX2HTML on the provided input file(s). The &lt;num&gt;
parame&acirc; <br>
ter can be an integer in the range 0 to 8. Each higher value
adds to the messages produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0. No special tracing; as for
versions of LaTeX2HTML prior to V97.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. (This is the default.) Show
section-headings and the corresponding HTML file names, and
indicators that major stages in the processing have been
completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Print environment names and
identifier numbers, and new theorem-types. Show warnings as
they occur, and indicators for more stages of processing.
Print names of files for <br>
storing auxiliary data arrays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Print command names as they
are encountered and processed; also any unknown commands
encountered while pre-processing. Show names of new
commands, environments, theorems, <br>
counters and counter-dependencies, for each document
partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Indicate command-substitution
the pre-process of math-environments. Print the contents of
unknown environments for processing in LaTeX, both before
and after reverting to <br>
LaTeX source. Show all operations affecting the values of
counters. Also show links, labels and sectioning keys, at
the stages of processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Detail the processing in the
document preamble. Show substitutions of new environments.
Show the contents of all recognised environments, both
before and after processing. <br>
Show the cached/encoded information for the image keys,
allowing two images to be tested for equality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Show replacements of new
commands, accents and wrapped commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. Trace the processing of
commands in math mode; both before and after.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. Trace the processing of all
commands, both before and after. The command-line option
sets an initial value only. During processing the value of
$VERBOSITY can be set <br>
dynamically using the ltracing{...} command, whose argument
is the desired value, or by using the more general Lset
command as follows: Lset{VERBOSITY}{&lt;num&gt;}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other Configuration Variables,
without switches <br>
The configuration variables described here do not warrant
having a command-line switch to assign values. Either they
represent aspects of LaTeX2HTML that are specific to the
<br>
local site, or they govern properties that should apply to
all documents, rather than something that typically would
change for the different documents within a particular sub-
<br>
directory. Normally these variables have their value set
within the latex2html.config file. In the following listing
the defaults are shown, as the lines of Perl code used to
<br>
establish these values. If a different value is required,
then these can be assigned from a local .latex2html-init
initialisation file, without affecting the defaults for
other <br>
users, or documents processed from other directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$dd holds the string to be used
in file-names to delimit directories; it is set internally
to &lsquo;/&rsquo;, unless the variable has already been
given a value within latex2html.config <br>
. Note: This value cannot be set within a .latex2html-init
initialisation file, since its value needs to be known in
order to find such a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$LATEX2HTMLDIR <br>
Read by the install-test script from latex2html.config, its
value is inserted into the latex2html Perl script as part of
the installation process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$LATEX2HTMLSTYLES =
$LATEX2HTMLDIR/styles ; <br>
Read from the latex2html.config file by install-test, its
value is checked to locate the styles/ directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$LATEX2HTMLVERSIONS =
$LATEX2HTMLDIR/versions ; <br>
The value of this variable should be set within
latex2html.config to specify the directory path where the
version and extension files can be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ALTERNATIVE_ICONS =
&rsquo;&rsquo;; <br>
This may contain the (relative) directory path to a set of
customised icons to be used in conjunction with the
-local_icons switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$TEXEXPAND =
$LATEX2HTMLDIR/texexpand ; <br>
Read by the install-test Perl script from latex2html.config,
its value is used to locate the texexpand Perl script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PSTOIMG =
$LATEX2HTMLDIR/pstoimg ; <br>
Read by the install-test Perl script from latex2html.config,
its value is used to locate the pstoimg Perl script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$IMAGE_TYPE =
&rsquo;&lt;image-type&gt;&rsquo;; <br>
Set in latex2html.config, the currently supported
&lt;image-type&gt;s are: gif and png.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$DVIPS = &rsquo;dvips&rsquo;;
<br>
Read from latex2html.config by install-test, its value is
checked to locate the dvips program or script. There could
be several reasons to change the value here: o add a <br>
switch -P&lt;printer&gt; to load a specific
configuration-file; e.g. to use a specific set of PostScript
fonts, for improved image-generation. o to prepend a path to
a differ&acirc; <br>
ent version of dvips than normally available as the system
default (e.g. the printing requirements are different). o to
append debugging switches, in case of poor quality <br>
images; one can see which paths are being searched for fonts
and other resources. o to prepend commands for setting path
variables that dvips may need in order to locate <br>
fonts or other resources. If automatic generation of fonts
is required, using Metafont, the following configuration
variables are important.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PK_GENERATION = 1; <br>
This variable must be set, to initiate font-generation;
otherwise fonts will be scaled from existing resources on
the local system. In particular this variable <br>
must not be set, if one wishes to use PostScript fonts or
other scalable font resources (see the -scalable_fonts
switch).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$DVIPS_MODE =
&rsquo;toshiba&rsquo;; <br>
The mode given here must be available in the modes.mf file,
located with the Metafont resource files, perhaps in the
misc/ subdirectory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$METAFONT_DPI = 180; <br>
The required resolution, in dots-per-inch, should be listed
specifically within the MakeTeXPK script, called by dvips to
invoke Metafont with the correct parameters <br>
for the required fonts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$LATEX = &rsquo;latex&rsquo;;
<br>
Read from latex2html.config by install-test, its value is
checked to locate the latex program or script. If LaTeX is
having trouble finding style-files and/or packages, <br>
then the default command can be prepended with other
commands to set environment variables intended to resolve
these difficulties; e.g. $LATEX = &rsquo;setenv TEXINPUTS
&lt;path <br>
to search&gt; ; latex&rsquo; . There are several variables
to help control exactly which files are read by LaTeX2HTML
and by LaTeX when processing images:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$TEXINPUTS <br>
This is normally set from the environment variable of the
same name. If difficulties occur so that styles and packages
are not being found, then extra paths can be <br>
specified here, to resolve these difficulties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$DONT_INCLUDE <br>
This provides a list of filenames and extensions to not
include, even if requested to do so by an input or include
command. (Consult latex2html.config for the <br>
default list.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$DO_INCLUDE = &rsquo;&rsquo;;
<br>
List of exceptions within the $DONT_INCLUDE list. These
files are to be read if requested by an input or include
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ICONSERVER =
&rsquo;&lt;URL&gt;&rsquo;; <br>
This is used to specify a URL to find the standard icons, as
used for the navigation buttons. Names for the specific
images size, as well as size information, can be <br>
found in latex2html.config. The icons themselves can be
replaced by customised versions, provided this information
is correctly updated and the location of the customised <br>
images specified as the value of $ICONSERVER. When the
-local_icons switch is used, so that a copy of the icons is
placed with the HTML files and other generated images, <br>
the value of $ICONSERVER is not needed within the HTML files
themselves. However it is needed to find the original icons
to be copied to the local directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$NAV_BORDER = &lt;num&gt;; <br>
The value given here results in a border, measured in
points, around each icon. A value of &lsquo;0&rsquo; is
common, to maintain strict alignment of inactive and active
buttons in <br>
the control panels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$LINKNAME =
&rsquo;&quot;index.$EXTN&quot;&rsquo;; <br>
This is used when the $NO_AUTO_LINK variable is empty, to
allow a URL to the working directory to be sufficient to
reach the main page of the completed document. It
speci&acirc; <br>
fies the name of the HTML file which will be automatically
linked to the directory name. The value of $EXTN is .html
unless $SHORTEXTN is set, in which case it is .htm .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$LINKPOINT =
&rsquo;&quot;$FILE$EXTN&quot;&rsquo;; <br>
This specifies the name of the HTML file to be duplicated,
or symbolically linked, with the name specified in
$LINKNAME. At the appropriate time the value of $FILE is the
<br>
document name, which usually coincides with the name of the
working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$CHARSET =
&rsquo;iso_8859_1&rsquo;; <br>
This specifies the character set used within the HTML pages
produced by LaTeX2HTML. If no value is set in a
configuration or initialisation file, the default value will
<br>
be assumed. The lowercase form $charset is also recognised,
but this is overridden by the uppercase form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ACCENT_IMAGES =
&rsquo;large&rsquo;; <br>
Accented characters that are not part of the ISO-Latin fonts
can be generated by making an image using LaTeX. This
variable contains a (comma-separated) list of LaTeX <br>
commands for setting the style to be used when these images
are made. If the value of this variable is empty then the
accent is simply ignored, using an un-accented font <br>
character (not an image) instead. Within the color.perl
package, the following variables are used to identify the
names of files containing specifications for named
col&acirc; <br>
ors. Files having these names are provided, in the
$LATEX2HTMLSTYLES directory, but they could be moved
elsewhere, or replaced by alternative files having different
names. <br>
In such a case the values of these variables should be
altered accordingly. <br>
$RGBCOLORFILE = &rsquo;rgb.txt&rsquo;; <br>
$CRAYOLAFILE = &rsquo;crayola.txt&rsquo;; The following
variables may well be altered from the system defaults, but
this is best done using a local .latex2html-init
initialisation <br>
file, for overall consistency of style within documents
located at the same site, or sites in close proximity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$default_language =
&rsquo;english&rsquo;; <br>
This establishes which language code is to be placed within
the &lt;!DOCTYPE ... &gt; tag that may appear at the
beginning of the HTML pages produced. Loading a package for
an <br>
alternative language can be expected to change the value of
this variable. See also the $TITLES_LANGUAGE variable,
described next.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$TITLES_LANGUAGE =
&rsquo;english&rsquo;; <br>
This variable is used to specify the actual strings used for
standard document sections, such as
&lsquo;&lsquo;Contents&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;References&rsquo;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&lsquo;Table
of Contents&rsquo;&rsquo;, etc. Support for <br>
French and German titles is available in corresponding
packages. Loading such a package will normally alter the
value of this variable, as well as the $default_language
<br>
variable described above.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$WORDS_IN_NAVIGATION_PANEL_TITLES
= 4; <br>
Specifies how many words to use from section titles, within
the textual hyperlinks which accompany the navigation
buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$WORDS_IN_PAGE = 450; <br>
Specifies the minimum page length required before a
navigation panel is placed at the bottom of a page, when the
$AUTO_NAVIGATION variable is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$CHILDLINE =
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;HR&gt;; <br>
This gives the HTML code to be placed between the
child-links table and the ordinary contents of the page on
which it occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$NETSCAPE_HTML = 0; <br>
When set, this variable specifies that HTML code may be
present which does not conform to any official standard.
This restricts the contents of any &lt;!DOCTYPE ... &gt; tag
<br>
which may be placed at the beginning of the HTML pages
produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$BODYTEXT = &rsquo;&rsquo;; <br>
The value of this variable is used within the &lt;BODY ...
&gt; tag; e.g. to set text and/or background colors.
It&rsquo;s value d y t is overridden by the emmand, and can
be x t c <br>
added-to or parts changed using the lbody command or <br>
$INTERLACE = 1; <br>
When set, interlaced images should be produced. This
requires graphics utilities to be available to perform the
interlacing operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$TRANSPARENT_FIGURES = 1; <br>
When set, the background of images should be made
transparent; otherwise it is white. This requires graphics
utilities to be available which can specify the color to be
<br>
made transparent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$FIGURE_SCALE_FACTOR = 1.6; <br>
Scale factor applied to all images of figure and other
environments, when being made into an image. Note that this
does not apply to recognised mathematics environments, <br>
which instead use the contents of $MATH_SCALE_FACTOR and
$DISP_SCALE_FACTOR to specify scaling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$MATH_SCALE_FACTOR = 1.6; <br>
Scale factor applied to all images of mathematics, both
inline and displayed. A value of 1.4 is a good alternative,
with anti-aliased images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$DISP_SCALE_FACTOR = 1; <br>
Extra scale factor applied to images of displayed math
environments. When set, this value multiplies
$MATH_SCALE_FACTOR to give the total scaling. A value of
&lsquo;1.2&rsquo; is a <br>
good choice to accompany $MATH_SCALE_FACTOR = 1.4;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$EXTRA_IMAGE_SCALE <br>
This may hold an extra scale factor that can be applied to
all generated images. When set, it specifies that a scaling
of $EXTRA_IMAGE_SCALE be applied when images are <br>
created, but to have their height and width recorded as the
un-scaled size. This is to coax browsers into scaling the
(usually larger) images to fit the desired size; when <br>
printed a better quality can be obtained. Values of
&lsquo;1.5&rsquo; and &lsquo;2&rsquo; give good print
quality at 600dpi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PAPERSIZE = &rsquo;a5&rsquo;;
<br>
Specifies the size of a page for typesetting figures or
displayed math, when an image is to be generated. This
affects the lengths of lines of text within images. Since
<br>
images of text or mathematics should use larger sizes than
when printed, else clarity is lost at screen resolutions,
then a smaller paper-size is generally advisable. This <br>
is especially so if both the $MATH_SCALE_FACTOR and
$DISP_SCALE_FACTOR scaling factors are being used, else some
images may become excessively large, including a lot of <br>
blank space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$LINE_WIDTH = 500; <br>
Formerly specified the width of an image, when the contents
were to be right- or center-justified. (No longer used.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following variables are used
to access the utilities required during image-generation.
File and program locations on the local system are
established by the configure-pstoimg <br>
Perl script and stored within $LATEX2HTMLDIR/local.pm as
Perl code, to be read by pstoimg when required. After
running the configure-pstoimg Perl script it should not be
neces&acirc; <br>
sary to alter the values obtained. Those shown below are
what happens on the author&rsquo;s system; they are for
illustration only and do not represent default values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$GS_LIB =
