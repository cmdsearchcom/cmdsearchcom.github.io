<p>vdr(1) Video Disk Recorder vdr(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
vdr - the Video Disk Recorder</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
vdr [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
vdr implements a complete digital Set-Top Box and Video
Recorder. It can work with signals received from satellites
(DVB-S) as well as cable (DVB-C) and terrestrial (DVB-T)
sig&acirc; <br>
nals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At least one DVB card is
required to run vdr. With it you can watch live TV while
recording one or more other broadcasts from the same
transponder. It is also possible to start <br>
watching a recorded programme before the live broadcast has
ended (time shifting). In order to record from different
transponders simultaneously two or more DVB cards are
neces&acirc; <br>
sary. By default vdr can support up to eight DVB cards. The
primary DVB card (the one your TV set is connected to) can
either be a &quot;full featured&quot; card, which means it
contains <br>
an MPEG decoder and provides audio and video signal outputs,
or you can use some third party plugin that implements
software decoding of the MPEG data and displays it via the
<br>
system&rsquo;s graphics adapter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vdr uses an On Screen Display
(OSD) to display its menus. It can be controlled by the PC
keyboard, the &quot;Linux Infrared Remote Control&quot;
(LIRC), or any other means of remote con&acirc; <br>
trol, implemented by a third party plugin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remote access is possible via
the &quot;Simple Video Disk Recorder Protocol&quot; (SVDRP),
which can be accessed on port 6419, for instance by
telnet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a cmd, --audio=cmd <br>
Send Dolby Digital audio to stdin of command cmd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cachedir=dir <br>
Save cache files in dir (default is to save them in the
video directory).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--chartab=character_table <br>
Set the character table to use for strings in the DVB data
stream that don&rsquo;t begin with a character table
indicator, but don&rsquo;t use the standard default
character table <br>
(for instance ISO-8859-9).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c dir, --config=dir <br>
Read config files from directory dir (default is to read
them from /etc/vdr).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --daemon <br>
Run in daemon mode (implies --no-kbd).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D num, --device=num <br>
Use only the given DVB device (num = 0, 1, 2...). There may
be several -D options (by default all DVB devices will be
used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dirnames=path[,name[,enc]]
<br>
Set the maximum directory path length to path (default is
the maximum value allowed on the system). If name is also
given, it defines the maximum directory name length <br>
(default is the maximum value allowed on the system). The
optional enc can be 0 or 1, and controls whether special
characters in directory names are encoded as hex values <br>
(default: 0). If path or name are left empty (as in
&quot;,,1&quot; to only set enc), the defaults apply. The
length of the video directory name and that of the actual
recording <br>
directory is subtracted from path, to make sure the
directory path will never become too long.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--edit=rec <br>
Edit the given recording. rec must be the full path name of
an existing recording. The program will return immediately
after editing the recording.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E file, --epgfile=file <br>
Write the EPG data into the given file (default is epg.data
in the cache directory). Use -E- to disable this. If file is
a directory, the file epg.data will be created <br>
in that directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--filesize=size <br>
Limit video files to size bytes (default is 2000M). This
option is only useful in conjunction with --edit, and must
precede that option to have an effect. size is an <br>
integer number and may be followed by one of the letters K,
M, G or T to abbreviate Kilo-, Mega-, Giga- or Terabyte,
respectively. The given value is silently limited to <br>
the program&rsquo;s internal minimum and maximum values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--genindex=rec <br>
Generate the index file for the given recording. rec must be
the full path name of an existing recording. The recording
must be in TS format. If the recording already <br>
has an index file, it will be deleted before creating the
new one. The program will return immediately after
generating the index. Note that using this option while <br>
another instance of VDR is currently replaying the given
recording, or if the recording has not been finished yet,
may lead to unexpected results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --grab=dir <br>
Write images from the SVDRP command GRAB into the given
directory dir. dir must be the full path name of an existing
directory, without any &quot;..&quot;, double
&rsquo;/&rsquo; or symlinks. <br>
By default, or if -g- is given, grabbing images to disk is
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a help message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i instance, --instance=instance
<br>
Use instance as the id of this VDR instance (default is 0).
In an environment where several instances of VDR use the
same video directory, this parameter can be set to a <br>
positive integer value that&rsquo;s unique for each
instance, so that they won&rsquo;t interfere with each other
in case they record exactly the same broadcast. The number
given here <br>
will be part of the directory name in which the recordings
will be stored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l level, --log=level <br>
Set logging to level. 0 = no logging, 1 = errors only, 2 =
errors and info, 3 = errors, info and debug. The default
logging level is 3. If logging should be done to <br>
LOG_LOCALn instead of LOG_USER, add &rsquo;.n&rsquo; to
LEVEL, as in 3.7 (n=0..7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L dir, --lib=dir <br>
Search for plugins in directory dir (default is
/usr/lib/vdr). There can be several -L options with
different dir values. Each of them will apply to the -P
options fol&acirc; <br>
lowing it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lirc[=path] <br>
Use a LIRC remote control device. If path is omitted, vdr
uses /var/run/lirc/lircd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--localedir=dir <br>
Search for locale files in dir (default is ./locale).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mute <br>
Mute audio of the primary DVB device at startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-kbd <br>
Don&rsquo;t use the keyboard as an input device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port, --port=port <br>
Use port for SVDRP. A value of 0 turns off SVDRP. The
default SVDRP port is 6419. You need to edit the file
svdrphosts.conf in order to enable access to the SVDRP
port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P options, --plugin=options
<br>
Load a plugin, defined by the given options. The first word
in options must be the name of an existing vdr plugin,
optionally followed by a blank separated list of com&acirc;
<br>
mand line options for that plugin. If options contains any
blanks, you need to enclose it in quotes, like for
example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vdr -P &quot;abc -a -b
xyz&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which would load a plugin named
abc, giving it the command line options -a -b xyz. If you
want to load all available plugins (without any particular
options) you can use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vdr -P &quot;*&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(note the quotes around the
asterisk to prevent wildcard expansion).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r cmd, --record=cmd <br>
Call cmd before and after a recording. See the file INSTALL
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resdir=dir <br>
Read resource files from dir (default is to read them from
the config directory).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--showargs[=dir] <br>
Read command line arguments from dir (default is
/etc/vdr/conf.d), display them to the console and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s cmd, --shutdown=cmd <br>
Call cmd to shutdown the computer. See the file INSTALL for
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--split <br>
Split edited files at the editing marks. This option is only
useful in conjunction with --edit, and must precede that
option to have an effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t tty, --terminal=tty <br>
Set the controlling terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u user, --user=user <br>
Run as user user in case vdr was started as user
&rsquo;root&rsquo;. Starting vdr as &rsquo;root&rsquo; is
necessary if the system time shall be set from the
transponder data, but for security <br>
reasons vdr can switch to a lesser privileged user id during
normal operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--updindex=rec <br>
Update the index file for the given recording. rec must be
the full path name of an existing recording. The recording
must be in TS format. If the recording already has <br>
an index file, it will be checked whether it is complete,
and will be updated if it isn&rsquo;t. If there is no index
file yet, a new one will be generated. The program will <br>
return immediately after updating the index. Note that using
this option while another instance of VDR is currently
replaying the given recording, or if the recording has <br>
not been finished yet, may lead to unexpected results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--userdump <br>
Allow coredumps if -u is given (only for debugging).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--vfat For backwards
compatibility (same as --dirnames= 250,40,1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v dir, --video=dir <br>
Use dir as video directory. The default is
/var/lib/vdr/video.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w sec, --watchdog=sec <br>
Activate the watchdog timer with a timeout of sec seconds. A
value of 0 (default) disables the watchdog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If started without any options,
vdr tries to read command line options from files named
&rsquo;*.conf&rsquo; in the directory /etc/vdr/conf.d. Files
are read in alphabetical order. See <br>
vdr(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
SIGINT, SIGTERM <br>
Program exits with status 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP Program exits with status
1. This can be used to force a reload, for example if an
update has been installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 Successful program execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 An error has been detected
which requires the DVB driver and vdr to be reloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 An non-recoverable error has
been detected, vdr has given up.</p>
