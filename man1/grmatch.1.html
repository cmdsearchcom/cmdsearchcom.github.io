grmatch - pairing lines by involving identifier or cross matching

<b>grmatch</b> [ <i>options</i>] <i>-r &lt;reference&gt; -i &lt;input&gt;
  </i>[<i>-o &lt;output&gt;</i>]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The program `grmatch` matches lines read from two input files, namely from a
  reference and from an input file. All implemented algorithms are symmetric, in
  the manner that the result should be the same if these two files are swapped.
  The only case when the order of these files is important is when a geometrical
  transformation is also returned (see point matching below), in this case the
  swapping of the files results the inverse form of the original transformation.
  The lines (rows) can be matched using various criteria. 1. Lines can be
  matched by identifier, where the identifier can be any concatenation of
  arbitrary, space-separated columns found in the files. Generally, the
  identifier is represented by a single column (e.g. it is an astronomical
  catalog identifier). The behaviour of the program can be tuned for the cases
  when there are more than one rows with the same identifier. 2. Lines can be
  matched using a 2-dimensional point matchig algorithm. In this method, the
  program expects two-two columns both from the reference and input files which
  can be treated as X and Y coordinates. If both point lists are known, the
  program tries to find the appropriate geometrical transformation which
  transforms the points from the frame of the reference list to the frame of the
  input list and, simultaneously, tries to find as many pairs as possible. The
  parameters of the geometrical transformation and the whole algorithm can be
  fine-tuned. 3. Lines can be matched using arbitrary- (N-) dimensional
  coordinate matching algorithm. This method expects N-N columns both from the
  reference and input files which can be treated as X_1, ..., X_N Cartesian
  coordinates and the method assumes both of the point sets in the same
  reference frame. The point 'A' from the reference list and the point 'P' from
  the input list forms a pair if the closest point to 'A' from the input list is
  'P' and vice versa.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">delaunay, level=&lt;level&gt;, full, auto,
    unitarity=&lt;U&gt;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These directives specify the triangulation level used for
      point matching. &quot;delaunay&quot; forces the usage only of the
      Delaunay-triangles. This is the fastest method, however, it is only
      working if the points in the reference and input lists are almost
      competely overlapping and describe almost the same point sets (within a
      ratio of common points above 60-70%). The &quot;level&quot; specifies the
      level of the expansion of the Delaunay-triangulation (see [1] for more
      details). In practice, the lower the ratio of common points and/or the
      ratio of the overlapping, the higher level should be used. Specifying
      &quot;level=1&quot; or &quot;level=2&quot; gives a robust but still fast
      method for general usage. The directive &quot;full&quot; forces full
      triangulation. This can be overwhelmingly slow and annoying and requires
      tons of memory if there are more than 40-50 points (the amounts of these
      resources are proportional to the 6th(!) and 3rd power of the number of
      the points, respectively). The directive &quot;auto&quot; increases the
      level of the triangulation expansion automatically until a proper match is
      found. A match is considered as a good match if the unitarity of the
      transformation is less than the unitarity U specified by the

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">mixed, conformable, reverse</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These directives define the chirality of the triangle

      whether the input and reference lists are inverted respecting to each
      other, one should use &quot;mixed&quot; triangle space. If we are sure
      about that the input and reference lists are not inverted, we can use
      &quot;conformable&quot; triangle space. If we know that the input and
      reference lists are inverted, we can use &quot;reverse&quot; space. Note
      that although &quot;mixed&quot; triangle space can always result a good
      match, it is a wise idea to fix the chirality by specifying
      &quot;conformable&quot; or &quot;reverse&quot; if we really know that the
      point sets are not inverted or inverted respecting to each other. If the
      chirality is fixed, the program yields more matched pairs, the appropriate

      first &lt;mr&gt; points from the reference and the first &lt;mi&gt; points

      select the first &quot;maxref&quot; and &quot;maxinp&quot; points (see
      above) for the generation of the two triangle meshes. Both columns should
      contain valid real numbers, otherwise the whole(!) line is excluded (not
      only from sorting but from the whole matching procedure). If there is no
      negative sign before the column index, the data are sorted in
      descending(!) order, therefore the lines with the lines with the
      highest(!) values are selected for triangulation. If there is a negative
      sign before the index, the data are sorted in ascending order by these
      values, therefore the lines with the smallest(!) values are selected for
      triangulation. For example, if we want to match star lists, we might want
      to use only the brightest ones to generate the triangle sets. If the
      brightnesses of the stars are specified by their fluxes, we should not use
      the negative sign (the list should be sorted in descending order to select
      the first few lines as the brightest stars), and if the brightness is

      useful in the following situation. We try to match star lists, then the
      fainter stars are believed to have higher astrometrical errors, therefore
      they should have smaller influence in the fit. We can take the weights
      from the reference (specify &quot;reference&quot;) and from the input
      (specify &quot;input&quot;), from the column specified by the
      weight-index. The weights can be derived from stellar magnitudes, if so,
      specify &quot;magnitude&quot; to convert the read values in magnitude to
      flux. The real weights then is the &quot;power&quot;th power of the flux.
      The default value of the &quot;power&quot; is 1, however, for the
      maximum-likelihood estimation of an assumed Gaussian distribution, the
      weights should be the second power of the fluxes.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some notes on unitarity. The unitarity of a geometrical transformation measures
  how it differs from the closest transformation which is affine and a
  combination of dilation, rotation and shift. For such a transformation the
  unitarity is 0 and if the second-order terms in a transformation distort a
  such unitary transformation, the unitarity will have the same magnitude like
  the magnitude of this second-order effect. For example, to map a part of a
  sphere with the size of d degrees will have an unitarity of 1-cos(d).
  Therefore, for astrometrical purposes, a reasonable value of the critical
  unitarity in &quot;auto&quot; triangulation mode can be estimated as 2 or 3
  times 1-cos(d/2) where d is the size of the field in which astrometry should
  be performed.
