<p>DB5.3_VERIFY(1) General Commands Manual
DB5.3_VERIFY(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
db5.3_verify - Verifies the structure databases</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
db5.3_verify [-NoqV] [-h home] [-P password] file ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The db5.3_verify utility verifies the structure of one or
more files and the databases they contain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Specify a home directory for the database environment; by
default, the current working directory is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Skip the database checks for
btree and duplicate sort order and for hashing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file being verified
contains databases with non-default comparison or hashing
configurations, calling the db5.3_verify utility without the
-o flag will usually <br>
return failure. The -o flag causes db5.3_verify to ignore
database sort or hash ordering and allows db5.3_verify to be
used on these files. To fully verify these files, <br>
verify them explicitly using the DB-&gt;verify method, after
configuring the correct comparison or hashing functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Do not acquire shared region
mutexes while running. Other problems, such as potentially
fatal errors in Berkeley DB, will be ignored as well. This
option is intended <br>
only for debugging errors, and should not be used under any
other circumstances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Specify an environment
password. Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite password
strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a window
of vulnerability on systems <br>
where unprivileged users can see command-line arguments or
where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
containing the command-line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Suppress the printing of any
error descriptions, simply exit success or failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Write the library version
number to the standard output, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_verify utility does
not perform any locking, even in Berkeley DB environments
that are configured with a locking subsystem. As such, it
should only be used on files <br>
that are not being modified by another thread of
control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_verify utility may be
used with a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the -h
option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the
utility was run in a direc&acirc; <br>
tory containing a Berkeley DB environment). In order to
avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB
environment, db5.3_verify should always be given the chance
to <br>
detach from the environment and exit gracefully. To cause
db5.3_verify to release all environment resources and exit
cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_verify utility exits 0
on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DB_HOME <br>
If the -h option is not specified and the environment
variable DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the
database home, as described in DB_ENV-&gt;open.</p>
