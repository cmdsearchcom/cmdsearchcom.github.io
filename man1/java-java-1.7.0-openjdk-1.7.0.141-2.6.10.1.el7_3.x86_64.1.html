<p>java(1) General Commands Manual java(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name <br>
java - the Java application launcher</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
java [ options ] class [ argument ... ] <br>
java [ options ] -jar file.jar [ argument ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">options <br>
Command-line options. See Options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">class <br>
The name of the class to be called.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.jar <br>
The name of the JAR file to be called. Used only with the
-jar command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">argument <br>
The arguments passed to the main function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The java command starts a Java application. It does this by
starting a Java runtime environment, loading a specified
class, and calling that class&rsquo;s main method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The method must be declared
public and static, it must not return any value, and it must
accept a String array as a parameter. The method declaration
has the following form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">public static void main(String
args[])</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the first argument
without an option is the name of the class to be called. A
fully qualified class name should be used. If the -jar
option is specified, then the <br>
first non-option argument is the name of a JAR file
containing class and resource files for the application,
with the startup class indicated by the Main-Class manifest
header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Java runtime searches for
the startup class, and other classes used, in three sets of
locations: the bootstrap class path, the installed
extensions, and the user class path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-option arguments after the
class name or JAR file name are passed to the main
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The launcher has a set of standard options that are
supported in the current runtime environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, the current
implementations of the virtual machines support a set of
nonstandard options that are subject to change in future
releases. See Nonstandard Options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard Options <br>
-client <br>
Selects the Java HotSpot Client VM. A 64-bit capable JDK
currently ignores this option and instead uses the Java
Hotspot Server VM. <br>
For default Java VM selection, see Server-Class Machine
Detection at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/vm/server-class.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-server <br>
Selects the Java HotSpot Server VM. On a 64-bit capable JDK,
only the Java Hotspot Server VM is supported so the -server
option is implicit. <br>
For default a Java VM selection, see Server-Class Machine
Detection at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/vm/server-class.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-agentlib:libname[=options] <br>
Loads native agent library libname, for example: <br>
-agentlib:hprof</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-agentlib:jdwp=help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-agentlib:hprof=help <br>
See JVMTI Agent Command-Line Options at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/platform/jvmti/jvmti.html#starting</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-agentpath:pathname[=options]
<br>
Loads a native agent library by full pathname. See JVMTI
Command-Line Options at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/platform/jvmti/jvmti.html#starting</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-classpath classpath, -cp
classpath <br>
Specifies a list of directories, JAR files, and ZIP archives
to search for class files. Separate class path entries with
colons (:). Specifying -classpath or -cp overrides <br>
any setting of the CLASSPATH environment variable. <br>
If -classpath and -cp are not used and CLASSPATH is not set,
then the user class path consists of the current directory
(.). <br>
As a special convenience, a class path element that contains
a base name of * is considered equivalent to specifying a
list of all the files in the directory with the <br>
extension .jar or .JAR. A Java program cannot tell the
difference between the two invocations. <br>
For example, if directory mydir contains a.jar and b.JAR,
then the class path element mydir/* is expanded to a
A.jar:b.JAR, except that the order of jar files is
unspeci&acirc; <br>
fied. All jar files in the specified directory, even hidden
ones, are included in the list. A class path entry
consisting simply of * expands to a list of all the jar
files <br>
in the current directory. The CLASSPATH environment
variable, where defined, will be similarly expanded. Any
class path wildcard expansion occurs before the Java VM is
<br>
started. No Java program will ever see wild cards that are
not expanded except by querying the environment. For
example, by calling
System.getenv(&quot;CLASSPATH&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dproperty=value <br>
Sets a system property value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d32 <br>
Run the application in a 32-bit environment. If a 32-bit
environment is not installed or is not supported, an error
will be reported. By default, the application is run in <br>
a 32-bit environment unless a 64-bit only system is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d64 <br>
Run the application in a 64-bit environment. If a 64-bit
environment is not installed or is not supported, an error
will be reported. By default, the application is run in <br>
a 32-bit environment unless a 64-bit only system is used.
<br>
Currently only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports 64-bit
operation, and the -server option is implicit with the use
of -d64. The -client option is ignored with the use of <br>
-d64. This is subject to change in a future release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-disableassertions[:package
name&quot;...&quot; | :class name ], -da[:package
name&quot;...&quot; | :class name ] <br>
Disable assertions. This is the default. <br>
With no arguments, -disableassertions or -da disables
assertions. With one argument ending in &quot;...&quot;, the
switch disables assertions in the specified package and any
sub&acirc; <br>
packages. If the argument is &quot;...&quot;, then the
switch disables assertions in the unnamed package in the
current working directory. With one argument not ending in
&quot;...&quot;, the <br>
switch disables assertions in the specified class. <br>
To run a program with assertions enabled in package
com.wombat.fruitbat but disabled in class
com.wombat.fruitbat.Brickbat, the following command could be
used: <br>
java -ea:com.wombat.fruitbat...
-da:com.wombat.fruitbat.Brickbat &lt;Main Class&gt; <br>
The -disableassertions and -da switches apply to all class
loaders and to system classes (which do not have a class
loader). There is one exception to this rule: in their <br>
no-argument form, the switches do not apply to system. This
makes it easy to turn on asserts in all classes except for
system classes. The -disablesystemassertions option <br>
provides a separate swith to enable assertions in all system
classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-enableassertions[:package
name&quot;...&quot; | :class name ], -ea[:package
name&quot;...&quot; | :class name ] <br>
Enable assertions. Assertions are disabled by default. <br>
With no arguments, -enableassertions or -ea enables
assertions. With one argument ending in &quot;...&quot;, the
switch enables assertions in the specified package and any
subpack&acirc; <br>
ages. If the argument is &quot;...&quot;, then the switch
enables assertions in the unnamed package in the current
working directory. With one argument not ending in
&quot;...&quot;, the <br>
switch enables assertions in the specified class. <br>
If a single command contains multiple instances of these
switches, then they are processed in order before loading
any classes. So, for example, to run a program with <br>
assertions enabled only in package com.wombat.fruitbat (and
any subpackages), the following command could be used: <br>
java -ea:com.wombat.fruitbat... &lt;Main Class&gt; <br>
The -enableassertions and -ea switches apply to all class
loaders and to system classes (which do not have a class
loader). There is one exception to this rule: in their <br>
no-argument form, the switches do not apply to system. This
makes it easy to turn on asserts in all classes except for
system classes. The -enablesystemassertions option <br>
provides a separate switch to enable assertions in all
system classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-enablesystemassertions, -esa
<br>
Enable assertions in all system classes (sets the default
assertion status for system classes to true).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-disablesystemassertions, -dsa
<br>
Disables assertions in all system classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help or -? <br>
Displays usage information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jar <br>
Executes a program encapsulated in a JAR file. The first
argument is the name of a JAR file instead of a startup
class name. For this option to work, the manifest of the
<br>
JAR file must contain a line in the form Main-Class:
classname. Here, classname identifies the class with the
public static void main(String[] args) method that serves as
<br>
your application&rsquo;s starting point. <br>
When you use this option, the JAR file is the source of all
user classes, and other user class path settings are
ignored. <br>
JAR files that can be run with the java -jar option can have
their execute permissions set so they can be run without
using java -jar. See JAR File Overview at <br>

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jarGuide.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-javaagent:jarpath[=options]
<br>
Loads a Java programming language agent. For more
information about instrumenting Java applications, see the
java.lang.instrument package description in the Java API
docu&acirc; <br>
mentation at <br>

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html
@ <br>

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jre-restrict-search <br>
Includes user-private JREs in the version search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-jre-restrict-search <br>
Excludes user-private JREs in the version search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-showversion <br>
Displays version information and continues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-splash:imagepath <br>
Shows splash screen with image specified by imagepath.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose, -verbose:class <br>
Displays information about each class loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose:gc <br>
Reports on each garbage collection event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose:jni <br>
Reports information about use of native methods and other
Java Native Interface activity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Displays version information and exits. See also the
-showversion option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version:release <br>
Specifies that the version specified by the release is
required by the class or JAR file specified on the command
line. If the version of the java command called does not
<br>
meet this specification and an appropriate implementation is
found on the system, then the appropriate implementation
will be used. <br>
The release option specifies an exact version and a list of
versions called a version string. A version string is an
ordered list of version ranges separated by spaces. A <br>
version range is either a version-id, a version-id followed
by an asterisk (*), a version-id followed by a plus sign
(+), or a version range that consists of two ver&acirc; <br>
sion-ids combined using an ampersand (&amp;). The asterisk
means prefix match, the plus sign means this version or
greater, and the ampersand means the logical and of the two
<br>
version-ranges, for example: <br>
-version:&quot;1.6.0_13 1.6*&amp;1.6.0_10+&quot; <br>
The meaning of the previous example is that the class or JAR
file requires either version 1.6.0_13, or a version with 1.6
as a version-id prefix and that is not less than <br>
1.6.0_10. The exact syntax and definition of version strings
can be found in Appendix A of the Java Network Launching
Protocol &amp; API Specification (JSR-56). <br>
For JAR files, the preference is to specify version
requirements in the JAR file manifest rather than on the
command line. <br>
See Notes for important policy information on the use of
this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-Standard Options <br>
-X Displays information about nonstandard options and
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xint <br>
Operates in interpreted-only mode. Compilation to native
code is disabled, and all bytecode is executed by the
interpreter. The performance benefits offered by the Java
<br>
HotSpot Client VM adaptive compiler is not present in this
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xbatch <br>
Disables background compilation. Typically, the Java VM
compiles the method as a background task, running the method
in interpreter mode until the background compilation is <br>
finished. The -Xbatch flag disables background compilation
so that compilation of all methods proceeds as a foreground
task until completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xbootclasspath:bootclasspath
<br>
Specifies a colon-separated list of directories, JAR files,
and ZIP archives to search for boot class files. These are
used in place of the boot class files included in the <br>
Java platform JDK. <br>
Applications that use this option for the purpose of
overriding a class in rt.jar should not be deployed because
doing so would contravene the Java Runtime Environment <br>
binary code license.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xbootclasspath/a:path <br>
Specifies a colon-separated path of directories, JAR files,
and ZIP archives to append to the default bootstrap class
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xbootclasspath/p:path <br>
Specifies a colon-separated path of directories, JAR files,
and ZIP archives to add in front of the default bootstrap
class path. <br>
Do not deploy applications that use this option to override
a class in rt.jar because this violates the Java Runtime
Environment binary code license.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xcheck:jni <br>
Performs additional checks for Java Native Interface (JNI)
functions. Specifically, the Java Virtual Machine validates
the parameters passed to the JNI function and the <br>
runtime environment data before processing the JNI request.
Any invalid data encountered indicates a problem in the
native code, and the Java Virtual Machine will terminate
<br>
with a fatal error in such cases. Expect a performance
degradation when this option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xfuture <br>
Performs strict class-file format checks. For backward
compatibility, the default format checks performed by the
Java virtual machine are no stricter than the checks
per&acirc; <br>
formed by 1.1.x versions of the JDK software. The -Xfuture
option turns on stricter class-file format checks that
enforce closer conformance to the class-file format
speci&acirc; <br>
fication. Developers are encouraged to use this flag when
developing new code because the stricter checks will become
the default in future releases of the Java application <br>
launcher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xnoclassgc <br>
Disables class garbage collection. Use of this option preven
memory recovery from loaded classes thus increasing overall
memory usage. This could cause OutOfMemoryError to <br>
be thrown in some applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xincgc <br>
Enables the incremental garbage collector. The incremental
garbage collector, which is turned off by default, will
reduce the occasional long garbage-collection pauses
dur&acirc; <br>
ing program execution. The incremental garbage collector
will at times execute concurrently with the program and
during such times will reduce the processor capacity
avail&acirc; <br>
able to the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xloggc:file <br>
Reports on each garbage collection event, as with
-verbose:gc, but logs this data to a file. In addition to
the information -verbose:gc gives, each reported event will
be <br>
preceded by the time (in seconds) since the first
garbage-collection event. <br>
Always use a local file system for storage of this file to
avoid stalling the Java VM due to network latency. The file
may be truncated in the case of a full file system <br>
and logging will continue on the truncated file. This option
overrides -verbose:gc when both are specified on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xmnsize or -XX:NewSize <br>
Sets the size of the young generation (nursery).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xmsn <br>
Specifies the initial size, in bytes, of the memory
allocation pool. This value must be a multiple of 1024
greater than 1 MB. Append the letter k or K to indicate
kilo&acirc; <br>
bytes, or m or M to indicate megabytes. The default value is
chosen at runtime based on system configuration. See Garbage
Collector Ergonomics at http://docs.ora&acirc; <br>

cle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gc-ergonomics.html
<br>
Examples: <br>
-Xms6291456 <br>
-Xms6144k <br>
-Xms6m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xmxn <br>
Specifies the maximum size, in bytes, of the memory
allocation pool. This value must a multiple of 1024 greater
than 2 MB. Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes,
<br>
or m or M to indicate megabytes. The default value is chosen
at runtime based on system configuration. <br>
For server deployments, -Xms and -Xmx are often set to the
same value. See Garbage Collector Ergonomics at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/tech&acirc; <br>
notes/guides/vm/gc-ergonomics.html <br>
Examples: <br>
-Xmx83886080 <br>
-Xmx81920k <br>
-Xmx80m <br>
On Solaris 7 and Solaris 8 SPARC platforms, the upper limit
for this value is approximately 4000 m minus overhead
amounts. On Solaris 2.6 and x86 platforms, the upper limit
<br>
is approximately 2000 m minus overhead amounts. On Linux
platforms, the upper limit is approximately 2000 m minus
overhead amounts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xprof <br>
Profiles the running program, and sends profiling data to
standard output. This option is provided as a utility that
is useful in program development and is not intended to <br>
be used in production systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xrs <br>
Reduces use of operating-system signals by the Java VM. <br>
In an earlier release, the Shutdown Hooks facility was added
to enable orderly shutdown of a Java application. The intent
was to enable user cleanup code (such as closing <br>
database connections) to run at shutdown, even if the Java
VM terminates abruptly. <br>
The Java VM catches signals to implement shutdown hooks for
unexpected Java VM termination. The Java VM uses SIGHUP,
SIGINT, and SIGTERM to initiate the running of shutdown <br>
hooks. <br>
The JVM uses a similar mechanism to implement the feature of
dumping thread stacks for debugging purposes. The JVM uses
SIGQUIT to perform thread dumps. <br>
Applications embedding the Java VM frequently need to trap
signals such as SIGINT or SIGTERM, which can lead to
interference with the Java VM signal handlers. The -Xrs
com&acirc; <br>
mand-line option is available to address this issue. When
-Xrs is used on the Java VM, the signal masks for SIGINT,
SIGTERM, SIGHUP, and SIGQUIT are not changed by the Java
<br>
VM, and signal handlers for these signals are not installed.
<br>
There are two consequences of specifying -Xrs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o SIGQUIT thread dumps are not
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o User code is responsible for
causing shutdown hooks to run, for example by calling
System.exit() when the Java VM is to be terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xssn <br>
Sets the thread stack size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:AllocationPrefetchStyle=n
<br>
Sets the style of prefetch used during allocation.
default=2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+AggressiveOpts <br>
Enables aggressive optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+|-DisableAttachMechanism
<br>
Specifies whether commands (such as jmap and jconsole) can
attach to the Java VM. By default, this feature is disabled.
That is, attaching is enabled, for example: <br>
java -XX:+DisableAttachMechanism</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XXLargePageSizeInBytes=n <br>
Specifies the maximum size for large pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=n <br>
Sets a target for the maximum GC pause time. <br>
This is a soft goal, and the Java VM will make its best
effort to achieve it. There is no maximum value set by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:NewSize <br>
Sets the size of the young generation (nursery). Sames as
-Xmnsize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:ParallelGCThreads=n <br>
Sets the number of GC threads in the parallel
collectors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:PredictedClassLoadCount=n
<br>
This option requires that the UnlockExperimentalVMOptions
flag be set first. Use the PredictedClassLoadCount flag if
your application loads a lot of classes and especially <br>
if class.forName() is used heavily. The recommended value is
the number of classes loaded as shown in the output from
-verbose:class. <br>
Example: <br>
java -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions
-XX:PredictedClassLoadCount=60013</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+PrintCompilation <br>
Prints verbose output from the Java HotSpot VM dynamic
runtime compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+PrintGCDetails
-XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps <br>
Prints garbage collection output along with time stamps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=0
<br>
This flag enables aggressive processing of software
references. Use this flag if the software reference count
has an impact on the Java HotSpot VM garbage collector.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:TLABSize=n <br>
Thread local allocation buffers (TLAB) are enabled by
default in the Java HotSpot VM. The Java HotSpot VM sizes
TLABs based on allocation patterns. The -XX:TLABSize option
<br>
enables fine-tuning the size of TLABs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseAltSigs <br>
The Java VM uses SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 by default, which can
sometimes conflict with applications that signal-chain
SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2. The -XX:+UseAltSigs option causes the
<br>
Java VM to use signals other than SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 as the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+|-UseCompressedOops <br>
Enables compressed references in 64-bit Java VMs. <br>
This option is true by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC or
-XX:+UseG1GC <br>
Enables either the Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) or the G1
garbage collectors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+|-UseLargePages <br>
Enables large page support. <br>
Large pages are enabled by default on Solaris.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseParallelOldGC <br>
Enables the parallel garbage collectors, which are optimized
for throughput and average response time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The -version:release option places no restrictions on the
complexity of the release specification. However, only a
restricted subset of the possible release specifications
repre&acirc; <br>
sent sound policy and only these are fully supported. These
policies are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Any version, represented by
not using this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Any version greater than an
arbitrarily precise version-id value, for example: <br>
&quot;1.6.0_10+&quot; <br>
This would utilize any version greater than 1.6.0_10. This
is useful for a case where an interface was introduced (or a
bug fixed) in the release specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. A version greater than an
arbitrarily precise version-id, bounded by the upper bound
of that release family, for example: <br>
&quot;1.6.0_10+&amp;1.6*&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. An or expressions of items 2
or 3, for example: <br>
&quot;1.6.0_10+&amp;1.6* 1.7+&quot; <br>
Similar to item 2. This is useful when a change was
introduced in a release (1.7) but also made available in
updates to earlier releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Performance Tuning Examples <br>
The following examples show how to use experimental tuning
flags to optimize either throughput or faster response
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 1, Tuning for Higher
Throughput <br>
java -d64 -server -XX:+AggressiveOpts -XX:+UseLargePages
-Xmn10g -Xms26g -Xmx26g</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 2, Tuning for Lower
Response Time <br>
java -d64 -XX:+UseG1GC -Xms26g Xmx26g
-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=500 -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values are typically returned by the
launcher, typically when the launcher is called with the
wrong arguments, serious errors, or exceptions thrown from
the <br>
Java Virtual Machine. However, a Java application may choose
to return any value using the API call
System.exit(exitValue).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o 0: Successful completion</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o &gt;0: An error occurred</p>
