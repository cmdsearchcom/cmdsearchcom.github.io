<p>UCFR(1) Debian GNU/Linux manual UCFR(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ucfr - Update Configuration File Registry: associate
packages with configuration files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ucfr [options] &lt;Package&gt; &lt;Path to configuration
file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Where Package is the package associated with the
configuration file (and, in some sense, its owner), and Path
to configuration file is the full path to the location
(usually <br>
under /etc) where the configuration file lives, and is
potentially modified by the end user. Please note that
usually this means that we register actual files, and not
symbolic <br>
links to files. ucfr will follow symbolic links and register
the real file, and not the symbolic link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This script maintains an
association between configuration files and packages, and is
meant to help provide facilities that dpkg provides
conffiles for configuration files and <br>
not shipped in a Debian package, but handled by the postinst
by ucf instead. This script is idempotent, associating a
package to a file multiple times is not an error. It is <br>
normally an error to try to associate a file which is
already associated with another package, but this can be
over ridden by using the --force option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h, --help <br>
Print a short usage message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-action <br>
Dry run. Print the actions that would be taken if the script
is invoked, but take no action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d [n], --debug [n] <br>
Set the debug level to the (optional) level n (n defaults to
1). This turns on copious debugging information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --purge <br>
Removes all vestiges of the association between the named
package and the configuration file from the registry. The
association must already exist; if the configuration <br>
file is associated with some other package, an error
happens, unless the option --force is also given. In that
case, the any associations for the configuration file are
<br>
removed from the registry, whether or not the package name
matches. This action is idempotent, asking for an
association to be purged multiple times does not result in
an <br>
error, since attempting to remove an non-existent
association is silently ignored unless the --verbose option
is used (in which case it just issues a diagnostic).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Make the script be very verbose about setting internal
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
This option forces operations requested even if the
configuration file in consideration is owned by another
package. This allows a package to hijack a configuration
file <br>
from another package, or to purge the association between
the file and some other package in the registry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--state-dir /path/to/dir <br>
Set the state directory to /path/to/dir instead of the
default /var/lib/ucf. Used mostly for testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
The most common case usage is pretty simple: a single line
invocation in the postinst on configure, and another single
line in the postrm to tell ucfr to forget about the
associ&acirc; <br>
ation with the configuration file on purge (using the
--purge option) is all that is needed (assuming ucfr is
still on the system).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/lib/ucf/registry, and /var/lib/ucf/registry.X, where X
is a small integer, where previous versions of the registry
are stored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ucf.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
If the package foo wants to use ucfr to associate itself
with a configuration file foo.conf, a simple invocation of
ucfr in the postinst file is all that is needed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ucfr foo /etc/foo.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On purge, one should tell ucf to
forget about the file (see detailed examples in
/usr/share/doc/examples):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ucfr --purge foo
/etc/foo.conf</p>
