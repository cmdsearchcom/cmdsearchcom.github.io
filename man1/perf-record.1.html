<p>PERF-RECORD(1) perf Manual PERF-RECORD(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perf-record - Run a command and record its profile into
perf.data</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
perf record [-e &lt;EVENT&gt; | --event=EVENT] [-l] [-a]
&lt;command&gt; <br>
perf record [-e &lt;EVENT&gt; | --event=EVENT] [-l] [-a]
&acirc; &lt;command&gt; [&lt;options&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This command runs a command and gathers a performance
counter profile from it, into perf.data - without displaying
anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This file can then be inspected
later on, using perf report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
&lt;command&gt;... <br>
Any command you can specify in a shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --event= <br>
Select the PMU event. Selection can be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a symbolic event
name (use perf list to list all events)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a raw PMU event
(eventsel+umask) in the form of rNNN where NNN is a
hexadecimal event descriptor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a symbolically
formed PMU event like pmu/param1=0x3,param2/ where param1,
param2, etc are defined as formats for the PMU in
/sys/bus/event_sources/devices/&lt;pmu&gt;/format/*.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a symbolically
formed event like pmu/config=M,config1=N,config3=K/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where M, N, K are numbers (in
decimal, hex, octal format). Acceptable <br>
values for each of &rsquo;config&rsquo;,
&rsquo;config1&rsquo; and &rsquo;config2&rsquo; are defined
by <br>
corresponding entries in
/sys/bus/event_sources/devices/&lt;pmu&gt;/format/* <br>
param1 and param2 are defined as formats for the PMU in:
<br>
/sys/bus/event_sources/devices/&lt;pmu&gt;/format/*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are also some params which
are not defined in .../&lt;pmu&gt;/format/*. <br>
These params can be used to overload default config values
per event. <br>
Here is a list of the params. <br>
- &rsquo;period&rsquo;: Set event sampling period <br>
- &rsquo;freq&rsquo;: Set event sampling frequency <br>
- &rsquo;time&rsquo;: Disable/enable time stamping.
Acceptable values are 1 for <br>
enabling time stamping. 0 for disabling time stamping. <br>
The default is 1. <br>
- &rsquo;call-graph&rsquo;: Disable/enable callgraph.
Acceptable str are &quot;fp&quot; for <br>
FP mode, &quot;dwarf&quot; for DWARF mode, &quot;lbr&quot;
for LBR mode and <br>
&quot;no&quot; for disable callgraph. <br>
- &rsquo;stack-size&rsquo;: user stack size for dwarf mode
<br>
Note: If user explicitly sets options which conflict with
the params, <br>
the value set by the params will be overridden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a hardware
breakpoint event in the form of m:addr[/len][:access] where
addr is the address in memory you want to break in. Access
is the memory access type (read, <br>
write, execute) it can be passed as follows:
m:addr[:[r][w][x]]. len is the range, number of bytes from
specified addr, which the breakpoint will cover. If you want
to <br>
profile read-write accesses in 0x1000, just set
mem:0x1000:rw. If you want to profile write accesses in
[0x1000~1008), just set mem:0x1000/8:w.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a group of
events surrounded by a pair of brace
(&quot;{event1,event2,...}&quot;). Each event is separated
by commas and the group should be quoted to prevent the
shell <br>
interpretation. You also need to use --group on &quot;perf
report&quot; to view group events together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--filter=&lt;filter&gt; <br>
Event filter. This option should follow a event selector
(-e) which selects tracepoint event(s). Multiple --filter
options are combined using &amp;&amp;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-perf <br>
Don&acirc;t record events issued by perf itself. This option
should follow a event selector (-e) which selects tracepoint
event(s). It adds a filter expression common_pid != <br>
$PERFPID to filters. If other --filter exists, the new
filter expression will be combined with them by
&amp;&amp;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --all-cpus <br>
System-wide collection from all CPUs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pid= <br>
Record events on existing process ID (comma separated
list).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --tid= <br>
Record events on existing thread ID (comma separated list).
This option also disables inheritance by default. Enable it
by adding --inherit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --uid= <br>
Record events in threads owned by uid. Name or number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --realtime= <br>
Collect data with this RT SCHED_FIFO priority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-buffering <br>
Collect data without buffering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --count= <br>
Event period to sample.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --output= <br>
Output file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --no-inherit <br>
Child tasks do not inherit counters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --freq= <br>
Profile at this frequency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mmap-pages= <br>
Number of mmap data pages (must be a power of two) or size
specification with appended unit character - B/K/M/G. The
size is rounded up to have nearest pages power of two <br>
value. Also, by adding a comma, the number of mmap pages for
AUX area tracing can be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--group <br>
Put all events in a single event group. This precedes the
--event option and remains only for backward compatibility.
See --event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g <br>
Enables call-graph (stack chain/backtrace) recording.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--call-graph <br>
Setup and enable call-graph (stack chain/backtrace)
recording, implies -g. Default is &quot;fp&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allows specifying &quot;fp&quot;
(frame pointer) or &quot;dwarf&quot; <br>
(DWARF&rsquo;s CFI - Call Frame Information) or
&quot;lbr&quot; <br>
(Hardware Last Branch Record facility) as the method to
collect <br>
the information used to show the call graphs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some systems, where binaries
are build with gcc <br>
--fomit-frame-pointer, using the &quot;fp&quot; method will
produce bogus <br>
call graphs, using &quot;dwarf&quot;, if available (perf
tools linked to <br>
the libunwind or libdw library) should be used instead. <br>
Using the &quot;lbr&quot; method doesn&rsquo;t require any
compiler options. It <br>
will produce call graphs from the hardware LBR registers.
The <br>
main limition is that it is only available on new Intel <br>
platforms, such as Haswell. It can only get user call chain.
It <br>
doesn&rsquo;t work with branch stack sampling at the same
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When &quot;dwarf&quot; recording
is used, perf also records (user) stack dump <br>
when sampled. Default size of the stack dump is 8192
(bytes). <br>
User can change the size by passing the size after comma
like <br>
&quot;--call-graph dwarf,4096&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Don&acirc;t print any message, useful for scripting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Be more verbose (show counter open errors, etc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --stat <br>
Record per-thread event counts. Use it with perf report -T
to see the values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --data <br>
Record the sample addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --timestamp <br>
Record the sample timestamps. Use it with perf report -D to
see the timestamps, for instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --period <br>
Record the sample period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-samples <br>
Don&acirc;t sample.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --raw-samples <br>
Collect raw sample records from all opened counters (default
for tracepoint counters).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --cpu <br>
Collect samples only on the list of CPUs provided. Multiple
CPUs can be provided as a comma-separated list with no
space: 0,1. Ranges of CPUs are specified with -: 0-2. In
<br>
per-thread mode with inheritance mode on (default), samples
are captured only when the thread executes on the designated
CPUs. Default is to monitor all CPUs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --no-buildid <br>
Do not save the build ids of binaries in the perf.data
files. This skips post processing after recording, which
sometimes makes the final step in the recording process to
<br>
take a long time, as it needs to process all events looking
for mmap records. The downside is that it can misresolve
symbols if the workload binaries used when recording get
<br>
locally rebuilt or upgraded, because the only key available
in this case is the pathname. You can also set the
&quot;record.build-id&quot; config variable to &rsquo;skip
to have this <br>
behaviour permanently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --no-buildid-cache <br>
Do not update the buildid cache. This saves some overhead in
situations where the information in the perf.data file
(which includes buildids) is sufficient. You can also set
<br>
the &quot;record.build-id&quot; config variable to no-cache
to have the same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G name,..., --cgroup name,...
<br>
monitor only in the container (cgroup) called
&quot;name&quot;. This option is available only in per-cpu
mode. The cgroup filesystem must be mounted. All threads
belonging to container <br>
&quot;name&quot; are monitored when they run on the
monitored CPUs. Multiple cgroups can be provided. Each
cgroup is applied to the corresponding event, i.e., first
cgroup to first <br>
event, second cgroup to second event and so on. It is
possible to provide an empty cgroup (monitor all the time)
using, e.g., -G foo,,bar. Cgroups must have corresponding
<br>
events, i.e., they always refer to events defined earlier on
the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --branch-any <br>
Enable taken branch stack sampling. Any type of taken branch
may be sampled. This is a shortcut for --branch-filter any.
See --branch-filter for more infos.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j, --branch-filter <br>
Enable taken branch stack sampling. Each sample captures a
series of consecutive taken branches. The number of branches
captured with each sample depends on the underlying <br>
hardware, the type of branches of interest, and the executed
code. It is possible to select the types of branches
captured by enabling filters. The following filters are <br>
defined:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; any: any type of
branches</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; any_call: any
function call or system call</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; any_ret: any
function return or system call return</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; ind_call: any
indirect branch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; call: direct
calls, including far (to/from kernel) calls</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; u: only when the
branch target is at the user level</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; k: only when the
branch target is in the kernel</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; hv: only when
the target is at the hypervisor level</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; in_tx: only when
the target is in a hardware transaction</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; no_tx: only when
the target is not in a hardware transaction</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; abort_tx: only
when the target is a hardware transaction abort</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; cond:
conditional branches</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option requires at least one
branch type among any, any_call, any_ret, ind_call, cond.
The privilege levels may be omitted, in which case, the
privilege levels of the <br>
associated event are applied to the branch filter. Both
kernel (k) and hypervisor (hv) privilege levels are subject
to permissions. When sampling on multiple events, branch
<br>
stack sampling is enabled for all the sampling events. The
sampled branch type is the same for all events. The various
filters must be specified as a comma separated list: <br>
--branch-filter any_ret,u,k Note that this feature may not
be available on all processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--weight <br>
Enable weightened sampling. An additional weight is recorded
per sample and can be displayed with the weight and
local_weight sort keys. This currently works for TSX abort
<br>
events and some memory events in precise mode on modern
Intel CPUs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--transaction <br>
Record transaction flags for transaction related events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--per-thread <br>
Use per-thread mmaps. By default per-cpu mmaps are created.
This option overrides that and uses per-thread mmaps. A
side-effect of that is that inheritance is automatically
<br>
disabled. --per-thread is ignored with a warning if combined
with -a or -C options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --delay= <br>
After starting the program, wait msecs before measuring.
This is useful to filter out the startup phase of the
program, which is often very different.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --intr-regs <br>
Capture machine state (registers) at interrupt, i.e., on
counter overflows for each sample. List of captured
registers depends on the architecture. This option is off by
<br>
default. It is possible to select the registers to sample
using their symbolic names, e.g. on x86, ax, si. To list the
available registers use --intr-regs= registers, pass a comma
separated list such as --intr-regs=ax,bx. The list of
register is architecture dependent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--running-time <br>
Record running and enabled time for read events (:S)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --snapshot <br>
Select AUX area tracing Snapshot Mode. This option is valid
only with an AUX area tracing event. Optionally the number
of bytes to capture per snapshot can be specified. In <br>
Snapshot Mode, trace data is captured only when signal
SIGUSR2 is received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--proc-map-timeout <br>
When processing pre-existing threads /proc/XXX/mmap, it may
take a long time, because the file may be huge. A time out
is needed in such cases. This option sets the time out <br>
limit. The default value is 500 ms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--switch-events <br>
Record context switch events i.e. events of type
PERF_RECORD_SWITCH or PERF_RECORD_SWITCH_CPU_WIDE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--buildid-all <br>
Record build-id of all DSOs regardless whether it&acirc;s
actually hit or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--all-kernel <br>
Configure all used events to run in kernel space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--all-user <br>
Configure all used events to run in user space.</p>
