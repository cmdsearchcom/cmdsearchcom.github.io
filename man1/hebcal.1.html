<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
With no arguments, hebcal will print to stdout the dates of
the Jewish holidays in the current secular year. Each line
is prefixed with a gregorian date of the form
mm/dd/yyyy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By specifying month, day, or
year, output can be limited to a particular month or date in
a particular year. Note that year is usually a four-digit
integer, So 92 is during the <br>
Roman period, not the late twentieth century. In if the
hebrew dates option is turned on, this number represents th
Jewish calendar year. month is a number from 1..12, or the
<br>
name of a Jewish calendar month.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">day is a number from 1..31.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the command <br>
hebcal 10 1992 <br>
will print out the holidays occurring in October of 1992
C.E., while the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hebcal Tish 5752</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will print dates of interest in
the month of Tishrei in Jewish calendar year 5752.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: hebcal 92 is not the same
as hebcal 1992. The year is assumed to be complete, so the
former calendar preceeds the latter by nineteen
centuries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A few other bells and whistles
include the weekly sedra as well as the day of the week, the
count of the omer, and the Hebrew date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output from hebcal can be used
to drive calendar(1). Day-to-day use for hebcal is provided
for in the -T and -t switches, which print out Jewish
calendar entries for the current <br>
date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To get a quick-reference on-line
help, type <br>
hebcal help <br>
at the command prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-8 Use 8-bit Hebrew (ISO-8859-8-Logical).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Use Ashkenazis hebrew.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Add approximate
candle-lighting times. See below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Print the Hebrew date for the
entire date range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Print the hebrew date for
dates with some event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Change the output format to
European-style dates: dd.mm.yyyy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Suppress holidays in output.
User defined calendar events are unaffected by this
switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H When the -H switch is used,
all dates specified on the command line are assumed to be
hebrew dates. So for instance,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example% hebcal -H 5754</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will print data for 5754,
Starting in Tishrei, and ending in Elul. Hebcal is smart
enough to detect a Hebrew month and infer that you want a
Hebrew date range, so you <br>
could type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">example% hebcal tish 5754</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -H switch would be
superfluous in this case. Invoking hebcal with just the -H
switch by itself will print data for the current Hebrew
year, starting in Tishrei.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Use the Israeli sedra scheme
when used in conjunction with -S or -s. This has no effect
if the -S or -s switches are unused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I file <br>
Read extra events from file. These events are printed
regardless of the -h suppress holidays switch. <br>
There is one holiday per line in file, each with the format
<br>
month day description <br>
where month is a string identifying the Jewish month in
question day is a number from 1 to 30, and description is a
newline-terminated string describing the holiday. An <br>
example might be <br>
Adar 1 Start cleaning kitchen for Passover. <br>
Adar 1 Start cleaning kitchen for Passover.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l deg,min <br>
Set the latitude for solar calculations to deg degrees and
min</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L deg,min <br>
Set the longitude for solar calculations to deg degrees and
min minutes. NOTE: Negative values are EAST longitude.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Add the count of the omer to
the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Use a tab-delineated format,
and somewhat terser strings. Instead of saying &rsquo; 13th
day of the omer &rsquo; hebcal will say &rsquo; Omer: 13
&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Add the weekly sedra to the
output on Saturdays. See -i.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Add the weekly sedra to the
output every day. When this option is invoked, every time a
day is printed, the torah reading for the Saturday on or
immediately following <br>
that date is printed. If there is no reading for the next
Saturday, then nothing is printed. See -i.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Print calendar information
for today&rsquo;s date only. -d and -o are asserted with
this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Same as -t, only without the
gregorian date. This option is useful in login scripts, just
to see what&rsquo;s happening today in the Jewish
calendar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Add the day of the week to
the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Print only the last two
digits of the year.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y file <br>
Read a table of yahrtzeit dates from file. These events are
printed regardless of the -h suppress holidays switch. <br>
There is one death-date per line in file, each with the
format <br>
month day year description <br>
where month, day and year form the gregorian date of death.
description is a newline-terminated string to be printed on
the yahrtzeit. An example might be</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">12 29 1957 Menachem
Mendel&rsquo;s yahrtzeit. <br>
5 15 1930 Benjamin&rsquo;s yahrtzeit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CANDLE-LIGHTING TIMES <br>
Hebcal&rsquo;s candlelighting times are only approximations.
If you ever have any doubts about it&rsquo;s times, consult
your local halachic authority. If you enter geographic
coordinates <br>
above the artic circle or antarctic circle, the times are
guaranteed to be wrong.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hebcal contains a small database
of cities with their associated geographic information and
time-zone information. The geographic and time information
necessary to calculate <br>
sundown times can come to hebcal any of three ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) The default: the system
manager sets a default city when the program is compiled.
<br>
2) Hebcal looks in the environment variable HEBCAL_CITY for
the name of a city in hebcal&rsquo;s database, and if it
finds one, hebcal will make that the new default city. <br>
3) 1 and 2 may be overridden by command line arguments,
including those specified in the HEBCAL_OPTS environment
variable. The most natural way to do this is to use the -c
city <br>
command. This will localize hebcal to city. A list of the
cities hebcal knows about can be obtained by typing <br>
hebcal cities <br>
at the command prompt. If the city you want isn&rsquo;t on
that list, you can directly control hebcal&rsquo;s
geographic information with the -l, -L -z and -Z DST
switches. Note that <br>
changing the geographic coordinates causes the timezone to
default to Zulu and the daylight savings time processor to
default to &rsquo;none.&rsquo; To get a list of possible
values for DST, <br>
type <br>
hebcal DST <br>
at the command prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a status report on
customizations, type type <br>
hebcal info <br>
at the command prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To find the days of the omer in 1997, printing the days of
the week: <br>
example% hebcal -how 1997 <br>
4/23/97 Wed, 1st day of the Omer <br>
4/24/97 Thu, 2nd day of the Omer <br>
4/25/97 Fri, 3rd day of the Omer <br>
. <br>
. <br>
. <br>
6/9/97 Mon, 48th day of the Omer <br>
6/10/97 Tue, 49th day of the Omer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To print only the weekly sedrot
of Nisan 5770 <br>
example% hebcal -hs Nisan 5770 <br>
3/20/2010 Parashat Vayikra <br>
3/27/2010 Parashat Tzav <br>
4/10/2010 Parashat Shmini</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To find out what&rsquo;s
happening in the Jewish calendar today , use <br>
example% hebcal -TS <br>
19 of Nisan, 5752 <br>
Parshat Achrei Mot <br>
Pesach V (CH&quot;M) <br>
4th day of the Omer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Hebcal uses two environment variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HEBCAL_CITY <br>
Hebcal uses this value as the default city for sunset
calculations. A list of available cities is available with
from hebcal with the command: <br>
hebcal cities</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HEBCAL_OPTS <br>
The value of this variable is automatically processed as if
it were typed at the command line before any other actual
command-line-arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The latest version of the code
will be available from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/hebcal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The original motivation for the
algorithms in this program was the Tur Shulchan Aruch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For version 3, much of the
program was rewritten using Emacs 19&rsquo;s calendar
routines by Edward M. Reingold and Nachum Dershowitz. Their
program is extremely clear and provides <br>
many instructive examples of fine calendar code in
emacs-LISP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A well written treatment of the
Jewish calendar for the layman can be found in Understanding
the Jewish Calendar by Rabbi Nathan Bushwick. A more
complete bibliography on the <br>
topic can be found there, as well as in the Encyclopedia
Judaica entry on the calendar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
hebcal help <br>
Prints a shorter version of this manpage, with comments on
each option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hebcal info <br>
Prints the version number and default values of the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hebcal DST <br>
Prints a list of available daylight savings time schemes,
suitable as arguments to the -Z DST option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hebcal cities <br>
Prints a list of cities which hebcal knows about, suitable
as arguments to the -C city option. If your city does not
appear on this list, put the necessary defaults in <br>
the DST_OPTS environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hebcal copying <br>
Prints the GNU license, with information about copying the
program. See below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hebcal warranty <br>
Tells you how there&rsquo;s NO WARRANTY for hebcal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISCLAIMER <br>
This is just a program I wrote during summer school and
while avoiding my senior project. It should not be invested
with any sort of halachic authority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Hebrew dates are only valid before sundown on that secular
date. An option to control this will be added in a later
release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Negative longitudes are EAST of
Greenwich.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some combinations of options
produce weird results, e.g. <br>
hebcal -dH nisan 5744 <br>
hebcal -dH 5744 <br>
This comes into play when you use the ENV_OPT environment
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sunup/sundown routines
aren&rsquo;t accurate enough. If you enter geographic
coordinates above the artic circle or antarctic circle, the
times are guaranteed to be wrong.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hebcal only translates between
the Gregorian calendar and the Jewish calendar. This means
that the results will be at least partly useless where and
when the gregorian calendar <br>
was not used, i.e. before the 1752 in Britain and before
circa 1918 in Russia. See the wikipedia entry for a splendid
chart of the changeover from the Julian to the Gregorian
<br>
calendars in various places.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hebcal cannot handle date
computations before 2 C.E. sorry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Daylight-Savings time rules are
as up-to-date as a nonpaying job allows. US DST rules are
correct only back to 1966.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hebcal assumes that the Energy
Policy Act of 2005, which changes the DST rules in the US
will go into effect, even though congress may still revert
it.</p>
