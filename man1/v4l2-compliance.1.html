<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
v4l2-compliance - An application to test video4linux
drivers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
v4l2-compliance [-h] [-d &lt;dev&gt;] [-r &lt;dev&gt;] [-V
&lt;dev&gt;] [-S &lt;dev&gt;] [-e &lt;dev&gt;] [-s
&lt;count&gt;] [-f] [-a] [-c
color=&lt;color&gt;,skip=&lt;skip&gt;,perc=&lt;perc&gt;]
[-n] [-T] [-v] [-w]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The v4l2-compliance tool is used to test video4linux
devices, either video, vbi, radio or swradio, both input and
output. It attempts to test almost all aspects of a V4L2
device <br>
and it covers almost all V4L2 ioctls. It has very good
support for video capture and output, VBI capture and output
and (software) radio tuning and transmitting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The support for memory-to-memory
devices is limited at the moment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have questions about
v4l2-compliance then mail those to the
linux-media@vger.kernel.org mailinglist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When testing a driver always
compile the utility from the latest source code from the git
repository (http://git.linuxtv.org/cgit.cgi/v4l-utils.git/).
The version supplied by <br>
linux distributions is almost certainly too old.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, if a test fails
then it will output the source and line where the failure
occurred, so you often need access to the source code to see
what that test is all about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that v4l2-compliance not
only tests for compliance against the V4L2 API, but also
whether the driver is using all the correct frameworks.
These frameworks often automati&acirc; <br>
cally provide ioctls that are strictly speaking optional,
but that come for free if you use those frameworks. By
requiring their presence the v4l2-compliance utility will
enforce <br>
their use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to submit a new V4L2
driver, then that driver must pass the v4l2-compliance tests
without fails. The best method of using this tool to test
your driver is to first <br>
test without any streaming options and fix any failures from
the first reported failure to the last. Sometimes earlier
failures can generate later failures, so just start fixing
<br>
them in order and test again after each fix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next test your driver with the
-s option to do the basic streaming tests. This requires
that there is a valid input or output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whenever you run v4l2-compliance
it will save the current driver state and restore it after
all tests are done (including when you press Ctrl-C). All
the streaming tests are per&acirc; <br>
formed using the saved configuration. This makes it possible
to prepare for the streaming tests by configuring the device
before calling v4l2-compliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally you should test your
driver using the -f and -c options to verify that all video
pixel formats are correctly supported. You need to perform
all three streaming tests for <br>
all inputs and outputs. You can use the -a option to
automate that if that is possible for your hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your driver passes all tests,
then your can be confident that your driver is in very good
shape!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d, --device=&lt;dev&gt; <br>
Use device &lt;dev&gt; as the video device. If &lt;dev&gt;
is a number, then /dev/video&lt;dev&gt; is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --vbi-device=&lt;dev&gt;
<br>
Use device &lt;dev&gt; as the vbi device. If &lt;dev&gt; is
a number, then /dev/vbi&lt;dev&gt; is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --radio-device=&lt;dev&gt;
<br>
Use device &lt;dev&gt; as the radio device. If &lt;dev&gt;
is a number, then /dev/radio&lt;dev&gt; is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --sdr-device=&lt;dev&gt;
<br>
Use device &lt;dev&gt; as the SDR device. If &lt;dev&gt; is
a number, then /dev/swradio&lt;dev&gt; is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --exp-buf-device=&lt;dev&gt;
<br>
Use device &lt;dev&gt; as the video device used to export
DMABUFfers for doing DMABUF streaming tests. If &lt;dev&gt;
is a number, then /dev/video&lt;dev&gt; is used. If this
option is not <br>
specified, then the DMABUF streaming tests will be
skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --streaming=&lt;count&gt;
<br>
Enable the streaming tests. Set &lt;count&gt; to the number
of frames to stream (default 60). This requires that before
v4l2-compliance is called the device has been configured
<br>
with a valid input (or output) and frequency (when the
device has a tuner). For DMABUF testing --expbuf-device
needs to be set as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration of the driver
at the time v4l2-compliance was called will be used for the
streaming tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --stream-all-formats <br>
Test whether all available formats can be streamed. This
attempts to stream using MMAP mode or read/write (if
V4L2_MEMORY_MMAP is not available) for one second for all
<br>
formats, at all sizes, at all intervals and with all field
values. In addition, if the driver supports scaling,
cropping or composing it will test that as well in various
<br>
combinations. If the driver supports a lot of combinations
then this test can take a long time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration of the driver
at the time v4l2-compliance was called will be used for the
streaming tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c,
--stream-all-color=color=red|green|blue,skip=&lt;skip&gt;,perc=&lt;perc&gt;
<br>
For all supported, non-compressed formats stream &lt;skip +
1&gt; frames. For the last frame go over all pixels and
calculate which of the R, G and B color components of a
pixel <br>
has the highest value and count that as a red, green or blue
pixel. The test succeeds if at least perc percent of the
frame has the given color. This requires that a <br>
valid and predominantly red, green or blue video signal is
present on the input(s). If skip is not specified, then just
capture the first frame. A non-zero skip value is <br>
useful if it takes a few frames for the device to calibrate.
If perc is not specified, then this defaults to 90%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most signal generators are able
to generate pure red, blue or green video. For cameras you
can print a completely red, green or blue picture and hold
it before the camera.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The goal of this test is to
determine if all pixel formats will interpret the red, green
and blue colors correctly and that no color components are
swapped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration of the driver
at the time v4l2-compliance was called will be used for the
streaming tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --stream-all-io <br>
Do the -s, -c and -f streaming tests for all inputs or
outputs instead of just the current input or output. This
requires that a valid video signal is present on all <br>
inputs or that all outputs are hooked up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-warnings <br>
Turn off warning messages. They are still counted in the
summary, but you won&rsquo;t see them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --trace <br>
Trace all called ioctls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Turn on verbose reporting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --wrapper <br>
Use the libv4l2 wrapper library for all V4L2 device
accesses. Note that doing this will cause some tests to fail
because the libv4l2 library isn&rsquo;t fully V4L2
compliant. By <br>
default v4l2-compliance will bypass libv4l2 and access the
V4L2 devices directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Prints the help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
On success, it returns 0. Otherwise, it will return the
error code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
This is a work in progress, and every so often it turns out
that some tests done by v4l2-compliance are too strict or
plain wrong. If you suspect that might be the case, then
<br>
report such bugs to the linux-media@vger.kernel.org
mailinglist.</p>
