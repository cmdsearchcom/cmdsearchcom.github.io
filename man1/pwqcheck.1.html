<p>PWQCHECK(1) BSD General Commands Manual PWQCHECK(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pwqcheck &acirc; Check passphrase quality</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pwqcheck [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The pwqcheck program checks passphrase quality using the
libpasswdqc library. By default, it expects to read 3 lines
from standard input:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">first line is a new password,
<br>
second line is an old password, and <br>
third line is either an existing account name or a passwd(5)
entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a number of supported
options, which can be used to control the pwqcheck
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pwqcheck prints OK on success.
Scripts invoking pwqcheck are suggested to check for both a
zero exit status and the OK line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
min=N0,N1,N2,N3,N4 <br>
(default: min=disabled,24,11,8,7) The minimum allowed
password lengths for different kinds of
passwords/passphrases. The keyword disabled can be used to
disallow passwords <br>
of a given kind regardless of their length. Each subsequent
number is required to be no larger than the preceding
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N0 is used for passwords
consisting of characters from one character class only. The
character classes are: digits, lower-case letters,
upper-case letters, and other char&acirc; <br>
acters. There is also a special class for non-ASCII
characters, which could not be classified, but are assumed
to be non-digits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N1 is used for passwords
consisting of characters from two character classes that do
not meet the requirements for a passphrase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N2 is used for passphrases. Note
that besides meeting this length requirement, a passphrase
must also consist of a sufficient number of words (see the
passphrase option <br>
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N3 and N4 are used for passwords
consisting of characters from three and four character
classes, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When calculating the number of
character classes, upper-case letters used as the first
character and digits used as the last character of a
password are not counted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to being
sufficiently long, passwords are required to contain enough
different characters for the character classes and the
minimum length they have been <br>
checked against.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max=N (default: max=40) The
maximum allowed password length. This can be used to prevent
users from setting passwords that may be too long for some
system services. The value 8 <br>
is treated specially: if max is set to 8, passwords longer
than 8 characters will not be rejected, but will be
truncated to 8 characters for the strength checks and the
<br>
user will be warned. This is to be used with the traditional
DES-based password hashes, which truncate the password at 8
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important that you do set
max=8 if you are using the traditional hashes, or some weak
passwords will pass the checks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">passphrase=N <br>
(default: passphrase=3) The number of words required for a
passphrase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">match=N <br>
(default: match=4) The length of common substring required
to conclude that a password is at least partially based on
information found in a character string, or 0 to dis&acirc;
<br>
able the substring search. Note that the password will not
be rejected once a weak substring is found; it will instead
be subjected to the usual strength requirements with <br>
the weak substring partially discounted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The substring search is
case-insensitive and is able to detect and remove a common
substring spelled backwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">config=FILE <br>
Load config FILE in the passwdqc.conf format. This file may
define any options described in passwdqc.conf(5), but only
the min, max, passphrase, match, and config options <br>
are honored by pwqcheck.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 Read just 1 line (new
passphrase). This is needed to use pwqcheck as the
passwordcheck program on OpenBSD - e.g., with
&quot;:passwordcheck=/usr/bin/pwqcheck -1: <br>
&quot;default&quot; section in /etc/login.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2 Read just 2 lines (new and
old passphrases).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--multi <br>
Check multiple passphrases (until EOF). This option may be
used on its own or along with the -1 or -2 options. pwqcheck
will read 1, 2, or 3 lines and will output one <br>
line per passphrase to check. The lines will start with
either OK or a message explaining why the passphrase did not
pass the checks, followed by a colon and a space, and <br>
finally followed by the passphrase. The explanatory message
is guaranteed to not include a colon. With this option, the
exit status of pwqcheck depends solely on whether <br>
there were any errors preventing the strength of passphrases
from being fully checked or not. A primary use for this
option is to test different policies and/or different <br>
versions of passwdqc on large passphrase lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Output pwqcheck program version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Output pwqcheck help text and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
pwqcheck exits with non-zero status when it encounters
invalid config file, invalid option, invalid parameter
value, invalid data in standard input, and in any case when
it fails <br>
to check passphrase strength. Without the --multi option,
pwqcheck also exits with non-zero status when it detects a
weak passphrase.</p>

The pam_passwdqc module was written for Openwall GNU/*/Linux
by Solar Designer. The pwqcheck program was originally
written for ALT GNU/*/Linux by Dmitry V. Levin, indirectly
<br>
reusing code from pam_passwdqc (via libpasswdqc). This
manual page (derived from the pam_passwdqc documentation)
was written for Openwall GNU/*/Linux by Dmitry V. Levin.</p>
