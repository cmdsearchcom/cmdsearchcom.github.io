perldelta - what is new for perl v5.16.3
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes differences between the 5.16.2 release and the 5.16.3
  release.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.16.1, first read
  perl5162delta, which describes differences between 5.16.1 and 5.16.2.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Core_Enhancements"><a class="selflink" href="#Core_Enhancements">Core
  Enhancements</a></h1>
No changes since 5.16.0.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Security"><a class="selflink" href="#Security">Security</a></h1>
This release contains one major and a number of minor security fixes. These
  latter are included mainly to allow the test suite to pass cleanly with the
  clang compiler's address sanitizer facility.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="CVE-2013-1667:_memory_exhaustion_with_arbitrary_hash_keys"><a class="selflink" href="#CVE-2013-1667:_memory_exhaustion_with_arbitrary_hash_keys">CVE-2013-1667:
  memory exhaustion with arbitrary hash keys</a></h2>
With a carefully crafted set of hash keys (for example arguments on a URL), it
  is possible to cause a hash to consume a large amount of memory and CPU, and
  thus possibly to achieve a Denial-of-Service.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This problem has been fixed.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="wrap-around_with_IO_on_long_strings"><a class="selflink" href="#wrap-around_with_IO_on_long_strings">wrap-around
  with IO on long strings</a></h2>
Reading or writing strings greater than 2**31 bytes in size could segfault due
  to integer wraparound.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This problem has been fixed.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="memory_leak_in_Encode"><a class="selflink" href="#memory_leak_in_Encode">memory
  leak in Encode</a></h2>
The UTF-8 encoding implementation in Encode.xs had a memory leak which has been
  fixed.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Incompatible_Changes"><a class="selflink" href="#Incompatible_Changes">Incompatible
  Changes</a></h1>
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.16.0. If any exist, they
  are bugs and reports are welcome.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Deprecations"><a class="selflink" href="#Deprecations">Deprecations</a></h1>
There have been no deprecations since 5.16.0.

Perl 5.16.3 represents approximately 4 months of development since Perl 5.16.2
  and contains approximately 870 lines of changes across 39 files from 7
  authors.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community
  of users and developers. The following people are known to have contributed
  the improvements that became Perl 5.16.3:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Andy Dougherty, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dave Rolsky, David Mitchell, Michael
  Schroeder, Ricardo Signes, Yves Orton.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
  from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of
  the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
  tracker.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see
  the <i>AUTHORS</i> file in the Perl source distribution.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Reporting_Bugs"><a class="selflink" href="#Reporting_Bugs">Reporting
  Bugs</a></h1>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at
  http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
  included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
  sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl
  -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
  porting team.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
  inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
  to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
  unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
  able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
  co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
  platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
  security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
  CPAN.
