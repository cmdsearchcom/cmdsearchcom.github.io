<p>DIFF(1plan9) DIFF(1plan9)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
diff - differential file comparator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
diff [ -acefmnbwr ] file1 ... file2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Diff tells what lines must be changed in two files to bring
them into agreement. If one file is a directory, then a file
in that directory with basename the same as that of the <br>
other file is used. If both files are directories, similarly
named files in the two directories are compared by the
method of diff for text files and cmp(1) otherwise. If more
<br>
than two file names are given, then each argument is
compared to the last argument as above. The -r option causes
diff to process similarly named subdirectories recursively.
<br>
When processing more than one file, diff prefixes file
differences with a single line listing the two differing
files, in the form of a diff command line. The -m flag
causes <br>
this behavior even when processing single files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The normal output contains lines
of these forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n1 a n3,n4 <br>
n1,n2 d n3 <br>
n1,n2 c n3,n4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These lines resemble ed commands
to convert file1 into file2. The numbers after the letters
pertain to file2. In fact, by exchanging &lsquo;a&rsquo; for
&lsquo;d&rsquo; and reading backward one may <br>
ascertain equally how to convert file2 into file1. As in ed,
identical pairs where n1 = n2 or n3 = n4 are abbreviated as
a single number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Following each of these lines
come all the lines that are affected in the first file
flagged by &lsquo;&lt;&rsquo;, then all the lines that are
affected in the second file flagged by
&lsquo;&gt;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -b option causes trailing
blanks (spaces and tabs) to be ignored and other strings of
blanks to compare equal. The -w option causes all
white-space to be removed from input <br>
lines before applying the difference algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -n option prefixes each
range with file: and inserts a space around the a, c, and d
verbs. The -e option produces a script of a, c and d
commands for the editor ed, which <br>
will recreate file2 from file1. The -f option produces a
similar script, not useful with ed, in the opposite order.
It may, however, be useful as input to a stream-oriented
<br>
post-processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -c option includes three
lines of context around each change, merging changes whose
contexts overlap. The -a flag displays the entire file as
context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Except in rare circumstances,
diff finds a smallest sufficient set of file
differences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/tmp/diff[12]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOURCE <br>
/src/cmd/diff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
cmp(1), comm(1), ed(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Exit status is the empty string for no differences, for
some, and for trouble.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Editing scripts produced under the -e or -f option are naive
about creating lines consisting of a single
&lsquo;.&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running diff on
directories, the notion of what is a text file is open to
debate.</p>
