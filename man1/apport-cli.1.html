<p>apport-cli(1) General Commands Manual apport-cli(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
apport-cli, apport-gtk, apport-kde - Apport user interfaces
for reporting problems</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
apport-cli</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apport-cli [ --save file ]
symptom | pid | package | program path | .apport/.crash
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apport-cli -f</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apport-cli -f -p package -P
pid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apport-cli -u report-number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same options/arguments for
apport-gtk and apport-kde.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
apport automatically collects data from crashed processes
and compiles a problem report in /var/crash/. This is a
command line frontend for reporting those crashes to the
devel&acirc; <br>
opers. It can also be used to report bugs about packages or
running processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If symptom scripts are
available, it can also be given the name of a symptom, or be
called with just -f to display a list of known symptoms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When being called without any
options, it processes the pending crash reports and offers
to report them one by one. You can also display the entire
report to see what is sent to <br>
the software developers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When being called with exactly
one argument and no option, apport-cli uses some heuristics
to find out &quot;what you mean&quot; and reports a bug
against the given symptom name, package <br>
name, program path, or PID. If the argument is a .crash or
.apport file, it uploads the stored problem report to the
bug tracking system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For desktop systems with a
graphical user interface, you should consider installing the
GTK or KDE user interface (apport-gtk or apport-kde). They
accept the very same options <br>
and arguments. apport-cli is mainly intended to be used on
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f, --file-bug <br>
Report a (non-crash) problem. If neither --package,
--symptom, or --pid are specified, then it displays a list
of available symptoms. If none are available, it aborts with
<br>
an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will automatically attach
information about your operating system and the package
version etc. to the bug report, so that the developers have
some important context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s symptom, --symptom=symptom
<br>
When being used in --file-bug mode, specify the symptom to
report the problem about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p package, --package=package
<br>
When being used in --file-bug mode, specify the package to
report the problem against.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P pid, --pid=pid <br>
When being used in --file-bug mode, specify the PID (process
ID) of a running program to report the problem against. This
can be determined with e. g. ps -ux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c report, --crash-file=report
<br>
Upload a previously processed stored report in an arbitrary
file location. This is useful for copying a crash report to
a machine with internet connection and reporting <br>
it from there. Files must end in .crash or .apport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u report-number,
--update-report report-number <br>
Run apport information collection on an already existing
problem report. The affected package is taken from the
report by default, but you can explicitly specify one with
<br>
--package to collect information for a different package
(this is useful if the report is assigned to the wrong
package).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--save filename <br>
In --file-bug mode, save the collected information into a
file instead of reporting it. This file can then be reported
with --crash-file later on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --window <br>
Point and click at the application window against which you
wish to report the bug. Apport will automatically find the
package name and generate a report for you. This <br>
option can be specially useful in situations when you do not
know the name of the package, or if the application window
has stopped responding and you cannot report the <br>
problem from the &quot;Help&quot; menu of the
application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
APPORT_IGNORE_OBSOLETE_PACKAGES <br>
Apport refuses to create bug reports if the package or any
dependency is not current. If this environment variable is
set, this check is waived. Experts who will thor&acirc; <br>
oughly check the situation before filing a bug report can
define this in their ~/.bashrc or temporarily when calling
the apport frontend (-cli, -gtk, or -kde).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/share/apport/symptoms/*.py <br>
Symptom scripts. These ask a set of interactive questions to
determine the package which is responsible for a particular
problem. (For some problems like sound or storage <br>
device related bugs there are many places where things can
go wrong, and it&rsquo;s not immediately obvious for a bug
reporter where the problem is.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
apport and the accompanying tools are developed by Martin
Pitt &lt;martin.pitt@ubuntu.com&gt;.</p>
