<p>jdb(1) Basic Tools jdb(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
jdb - Finds and fixes bugs in Java platform programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
jdb [options] [classname] [arguments]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">options <br>
Command-line options. See Options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">classname <br>
Name of the main class to debug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arguments <br>
Arguments passed to the main() method of the class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The Java Debugger (JDB) is a simple command-line debugger
for Java classes. The jdb command and its options call the
JDB. The jdb command demonstrates the Java Platform Debugger
<br>
Architecture (JDBA) and provides inspection and debugging of
a local or remote Java Virtual Machine (JVM). See Java
Platform Debugger Architecture (JDBA) at <br>

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jpda/index.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">START A JDB SESSION <br>
There are many ways to start a JDB session. The most
frequently used way is to have JDB launch a new JVM with the
main class of the application to be debugged. Do this by
<br>
substituting the jdb command for the java command in the
command line. For example, if your application&rsquo;s main
class is MyClass, then use the following command to debug it
under <br>
JDB:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jdb MyClass</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When started this way, the jdb
command calls a second JVM with the specified parameters,
loads the specified class, and stops the JVM before
executing that class&rsquo;s first <br>
instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another way to use the jdb
command is by attaching it to a JVM that is already running.
Syntax for starting a JVM to which the jdb command attaches
when the JVM is running is as <br>
follows. This loads in-process debugging libraries and
specifies the kind of connection to be made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">java
-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n
MyClass</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can then attach the jdb
command to the JVM with the following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jdb -attach 8000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The MyClass argument is not
specified in the jdb command line in this case because the
jdb command is connecting to an existing JVM instead of
launching a new JVM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are many other ways to
connect the debugger to a JVM, and all of them are supported
by the jdb command. The Java Platform Debugger Architecture
has additional documentation <br>
on these connection options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BASIC JDB COMMANDS <br>
The following is a list of the basic jdb commands. The JDB
supports other commands that you can list with the -help
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help or ? <br>
The help or ? commands display the list of recognized
commands with a brief description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">run After you start JDB and set
breakpoints, you can use the run command to execute the
debugged application. The run command is available only when
the jdb command starts the <br>
debugged application as opposed to attaching to an existing
JVM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cont Continues execution of the
debugged application after a breakpoint, exception, or
step.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print Displays Java objects and
primitive values. For variables or fields of primitive
types, the actual value is printed. For objects, a short
description is printed. See the <br>
dump command to find out how to get more information about
an object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: To display local
variables, the containing class must have been compiled with
the javac -g option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The print command supports many
simple Java expressions including those with method
invocations, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print MyClass.myStaticField <br>
print myObj.myInstanceField <br>
print i + j + k (i, j, k are primities and either fields or
local variables) <br>
print myObj.myMethod() (if myMethod returns a non-null) <br>
print new java.lang.String(&quot;Hello&quot;).length()</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump For primitive values, the
dump command is identical to the print command. For objects,
the dump command prints the current value of each field
defined in the object. <br>
Static and instance fields are included. The dump command
supports the same set of expressions as the print
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">threads <br>
List the threads that are currently running. For each
thread, its name and current status are printed and an index
that can be used in other commands. In this example, the
<br>
thread index is 4, the thread is an instance of
java.lang.Thread, the thread name is main, and it is
currently running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. (java.lang.Thread)0x1 main
running</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">thread Select a thread to be the
current thread. Many jdb commands are based on the setting
of the current thread. The thread is specified with the
thread index described in the <br>
threads command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where The where command with no
arguments dumps the stack of the current thread. The
whereall command dumps the stack of all threads in the
current thread group. The <br>
wherethreadindex command dumps the stack of the specified
thread.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the current thread is
suspended either through an event such as a breakpoint or
through the suspend command, then local variables and fields
can be displayed with the <br>
print and dump commands. The up and down commands select
which stack frame is the current stack frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BREAKPOINTS <br>
Breakpoints can be set in JDB at line numbers or at the
first instruction of a method, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The command stop
at MyClass:22 sets a breakpoint at the first instruction for
line 22 of the source file containing MyClass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The command stop
in java.lang.String.length sets a breakpoint at the
beginning of the method java.lang.String.length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The command stop
in MyClass.&lt;clinit&gt; uses &lt;clinit&gt; to identify
the static initialization code for MyClass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a method is overloaded, you
must also specify its argument types so that the proper
method can be selected for a breakpoint. For example, <br>
MyClass.myMethod(int,java.lang.String) or
MyClass.myMethod().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The clear command removes
breakpoints using the following syntax: clear MyClass:45.
Using the clear or stop command with no argument displays a
list of all breakpoints currently <br>
set. The cont command continues execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STEPPING <br>
The step command advances execution to the next line whether
it is in the current stack frame or a called method. The
next command advances execution to the next line in the <br>
current stack frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXCEPTIONS <br>
When an exception occurs for which there is not a catch
statement anywhere in the throwing thread&rsquo;s call
stack, the JVM typically prints an exception trace and
exits. When <br>
running under JDB, however, control returns to JDB at the
offending throw. You can then use the jdb command to
diagnose the cause of the exception.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the catch command to cause
the debugged application to stop at other thrown exceptions,
for example: catch java.io.FileNotFoundException or <br>
catchmypackage.BigTroubleException. Any exception that is an
instance of the specified class or subclass stops the
application at the point where it is thrown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ignore command negates the
effect of an earlier catch command. The ignore command does
not cause the debugged JVM to ignore specific exceptions,
but only to ignore the <br>
debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
When you use the jdb command instead of the java command on
the command line, the jdb command accepts many of the same
options as the java command, including -D, -classpath, and
<br>
-X options. The following list contains additional options
that are accepted by the jdb command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other options are supported to
provide alternate mechanisms for connecting the debugger to
the JVM it is to debug. For additional documentation about
these connection <br>
alternatives, see Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA)
at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jpda/index.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help <br>
Displays a help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sourcepath dir1:dir2: . . .
<br>
Uses the specified path to search for source files in the
specified path. If this option is not specified, then use
the default path of dot (.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-attach address <br>
Attaches the debugger to a running JVM with the default
connection mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-listen address <br>
Waits for a running JVM to connect to the specified address
with a standard connector.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-launch <br>
Starts the debugged application immediately upon startup of
JDB. The -launch option removes the need for the run
command. The debugged application is launched and then <br>
stopped just before the initial application class is loaded.
At that point, you can set any necessary breakpoints and use
the cont command to continue execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-listconnectors <br>
List the connectors available in this JVM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-connect
connector-name:name1=value1 <br>
Connects to the target JVM with the named connector and
listed argument values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dbgtrace [flags] <br>
Prints information for debugging the jdb command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tclient <br>
Runs the application in the Java HotSpot VM client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tserver <br>
Runs the application in the Java HotSpot VM server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Joption <br>
Passes option to the JVM, where option is one of the options
described on the reference page for the Java application
launcher. For example, -J-Xms48m sets the startup <br>
memory to 48 MB. See java(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS FORWARDED TO THE
DEBUGGER PROCESS <br>
-v -verbose[:class|gc|jni] <br>
Turns on verbose mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dname=value <br>
Sets a system property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-classpath dir <br>
Lists directories separated by colons in which to look for
classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xoption <br>
Nonstandard target JVM option.</p>
