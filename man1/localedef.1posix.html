<p>LOCALEDEF(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
LOCALEDEF(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
localedef &acirc; define locale environment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
localedef [&acirc;c] [&acirc;f charmap] [&acirc;i
sourcefile] [&acirc;u code_set_name] name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The localedef utility shall convert source definitions for
locale categories into a format usable by the functions and
utilities whose operational behavior is determined by the
<br>
setting of the locale environment variables defined in the
Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Chapter 7,
Locale. It is implementation-defined whether users have the
capa&acirc; <br>
bility to create new locales, in addition to those supplied
by the implementation. If the symbolic constant
POSIX2_LOCALEDEF is defined, the system supports the
creation of new <br>
locales. On XSI-conformant systems, the symbolic constant
POSIX2_LOCALEDEF shall be defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The utility shall read source
definitions for one or more locale categories belonging to
the same locale from the file named in the &acirc;i option
(if specified) or from standard <br>
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name operand identifies the
target locale. The utility shall support the creation of
public, or generally accessible locales, as well as private,
or restricted-access <br>
locales. Implementations may restrict the capability to
create or modify public locales to users with appropriate
privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each category source definition
shall be identified by the corresponding environment
variable name and terminated by an END category-name
statement. The following categories <br>
shall be supported. In addition, the input may contain
source for implementation-defined categories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Defines character
classification and case conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_COLLATE <br>
Defines collation rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MONETARY <br>
Defines the format and symbols used in formatting of
monetary information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_NUMERIC <br>
Defines the decimal delimiter, grouping, and grouping symbol
for non-monetary numeric editing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_TIME Defines the format and
content of date and time information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Defines the format and values of affirmative and negative
responses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The localedef utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;c Create permanent output
even if warning messages have been issued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;f charmap <br>
Specify the pathname of a file containing a mapping of
character symbols and collating element symbols to actual
character encodings. The format of the charmap is <br>
described in the Base Definitions volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 6.4, Character Set Description
File. The application shall ensure that this option is
specified if <br>
symbolic names (other than collating symbols defined in a
collating-symbol keyword) are used. If the &acirc;f option
is not present, an implementation-defined character
map&acirc; <br>
ping shall be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;i inputfile <br>
The pathname of a file containing the source definitions. If
this option is not present, source definitions shall be read
from standard input. The format of the input&acirc; <br>
file is described in the Base Definitions volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 7.3, Locale Definition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;u code_set_name <br>
Specify the name of a codeset used as the target mapping of
character symbols and collating element symbols whose
encoding values are defined in terms of the <br>
ISO/IEC 10646&acirc;1:2000 standard position constant
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name Identifies the locale; see
the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Chapter
7, Locale for a description of the use of this name. If the
name contains one or more <br>
&lt;slash&gt; characters, name shall be interpreted as a
pathname where the created locale definitions shall be
stored. If name does not contain any &lt;slash&gt;
characters, the <br>
interpretation of the name is implementation-defined and the
locale shall be public. The ability to create public locales
in this way may be restricted to users with <br>
appropriate privileges. (As a consequence of specifying one
name, although several categories can be processed in one
execution, only categories belonging to the same <br>
locale can be processed.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Unless the &acirc;i option is specified, the standard input
shall be a text file containing one or more locale category
source definitions, as described in the Base Definitions
volume <br>
of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 7.3, Locale Definition. When
lines are continued using the escape character mechanism,
there is no limit to the length of the accumulated continued
<br>
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The character set mapping file specified as the charmap
option-argument is described in the Base Definitions volume
of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 6.4, Character Set
Description File. <br>
If a locale category source definition contains a copy
statement, as defined in the Base Definitions volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Chapter 7, Locale, and the copy
statement names a <br>
valid, existing locale, then localedef shall behave as if
the source definition had contained a valid category source
definition for the named locale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of localedef:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_COLLATE <br>
(This variable has no affect on localedef; the POSIX locale
is used for this category.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments <br>
and input files). This variable has no affect on the
processing of localedef input data; the POSIX locale is used
for this purpose, regardless of the value of this <br>
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The utility shall report all categories successfully
processed, in an unspecified format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
The format of the created output is unspecified. If the name
operand does not contain a &lt;slash&gt;, the existence of
an output file for the locale is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
When the &acirc;u option is used, the code_set_name
option-argument shall be interpreted as an
implementation-defined name of a codeset to which the
ISO/IEC 10646&acirc;1:2000 standard posi&acirc; <br>
tion constant values shall be converted via an
implementation-defined method. Both the ISO/IEC
10646&acirc;1:2000 standard position constant values and
other formats (decimal, hexadec&acirc; <br>
imal, or octal) shall be valid as encoding values within the
charmap file. The codeset represented by the
implementation-defined name can be any codeset that is
supported by the <br>
implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When conflicts occur between the
charmap specification of &lt;code_set_name&gt;,
&lt;mb_cur_max&gt;, or &lt;mb_cur_min&gt; and the
implementation-defined interpretation of these respective
items <br>
for the codeset represented by the &acirc;u option-argument
code_set_name, the result is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When conflicts occur between the
charmap encoding values specified for symbolic names of
characters of the portable character set and the
implementation-defined assignment of <br>
character encoding values, the result is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a non-printable character in
the charmap has a width specified that is not &acirc;1, the
result will be undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 No errors occurred and the
locales were successfully created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Warnings occurred and the
locales were successfully created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 The locale specification
exceeded implementation limits or the coded character set or
sets used were not supported by the implementation, and no
locale was created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 The capability to create new
locales is not supported by the implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;3 Warnings or errors
occurred and no output was created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
If an error is detected, no permanent output shall be
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If warnings occur, permanent
output shall be created if the &acirc;c option was
specified. The following conditions shall cause warning
messages to be issued:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If a symbolic name not found
in the charmap file is used for the descriptions of the
LC_CTYPE or LC_COLLATE categories (for other categories,
this shall be an error condi&acirc; <br>
tion).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If the number of operands to
the order keyword exceeds the {COLL_WEIGHTS_MAX} limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If optional keywords not
supported by the implementation are present in the
source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other implementation-defined
conditions may also cause warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The charmap definition is optional, and is contained outside
the locale definition. This allows both completely
self-defined source files, and generic sources (applicable
to more <br>
than one codeset). To aid portability, all charmap
definitions must use the same symbolic names for the
portable character set. As explained in the Base Definitions
volume of <br>
POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 6.4, Character Set Description
File, it is implementation-defined whether or not users or
applications can provide additional character set
description <br>
files. Therefore, the &acirc;f option might be operable only
when an implementation-defined charmap is named.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The output produced by the localedef utility is
implementation-defined. The name operand is used to identify
the specific locale. (As a consequence, although several
categories <br>
can be processed in one execution, only categories belonging
to the same locale can be processed.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
