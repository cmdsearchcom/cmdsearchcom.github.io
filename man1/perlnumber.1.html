<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlnumber - semantics of numbers and numeric operations in
Perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
$n = 1234; # decimal integer <br>
$n = 0b1110011; # binary integer <br>
$n = 01234; # octal integer <br>
$n = 0x1234; # hexadecimal integer <br>
$n = 12.34e-56; # exponential notation <br>
$n = &quot;-12.34e56&quot;; # number specified as a string
<br>
$n = &quot;1234&quot;; # number specified as a string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes how Perl internally handles numeric
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl&rsquo;s operator
overloading facility is completely ignored here. Operator
overloading allows user-defined behaviors for numbers, such
as operations over arbitrarily large <br>
integers, floating points numbers with arbitrary precision,
operations over &quot;exotic&quot; numbers such as modular
arithmetic or p-adic arithmetic, and so on. See overload for
<br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Storing numbers <br>
Perl can internally represent numbers in 3 different ways:
as native integers, as native floating point numbers, and as
decimal strings. Decimal strings may have an exponential
<br>
notation part, as in &quot;12.34e-56&quot;. Native here
means &quot;a format supported by the C compiler which was
used to build perl&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The term &quot;native&quot; does
not mean quite as much when we talk about native integers,
as it does when native floating point numbers are involved.
The only implication of the term <br>
&quot;native&quot; on integers is that the limits for the
maximal and the minimal supported true integral quantities
are close to powers of 2. However, &quot;native&quot; floats
have a most <br>
fundamental restriction: they may represent only those
numbers which have a relatively &quot;short&quot;
representation when converted to a binary fraction. For
example, 0.9 cannot be <br>
represented by a native float, since the binary fraction for
0.9 is infinite:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">binary0.1110011001100...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">with the sequence 1100 repeating
again and again. In addition to this limitation, the
exponent of the binary number is also restricted when it is
represented as a floating <br>
point number. On typical hardware, floating point values can
store numbers with up to 53 binary digits, and with binary
exponents between -1024 and 1024. In decimal <br>
representation this is close to 16 decimal digits and
decimal exponents in the range of -304..304. The upshot of
all this is that Perl cannot store a number like <br>
12345678901234567 as a floating point number on such
architectures without loss of information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, decimal strings can
represent only those numbers which have a finite decimal
expansion. Being strings, and thus of arbitrary length,
there is no practical limit for <br>
the exponent or number of decimal digits for these numbers.
(But realize that what we are discussing the rules for just
the storage of these numbers. The fact that you can <br>
store such &quot;large&quot; numbers does not mean that the
operations over these numbers will use all of the
significant digits. See &quot;Numeric operators and numeric
conversions&quot; for <br>
details.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In fact numbers stored in the
native integer format may be stored either in the signed
native form, or in the unsigned native form. Thus the limits
for Perl numbers stored as <br>
native integers would typically be -2**31..2**32-1, with
appropriate modifications in the case of 64-bit integers.
Again, this does not mean that Perl can do operations only
<br>
over integers in this range: it is possible to store many
more integers in floating point format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Summing up, Perl numeric values
can store only those numbers which have a finite decimal
expansion or a &quot;short&quot; binary expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Numeric operators and numeric
conversions <br>
As mentioned earlier, Perl can store a number in any one of
three formats, but most operators typically understand only
one of those formats. When a numeric value is passed as <br>
an argument to such an operator, it will be converted to the
format understood by the operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Six such conversions are
possible:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">native integer --&gt; native
floating point (*) <br>
native integer --&gt; decimal string <br>
native floating_point --&gt; native integer (*) <br>
native floating_point --&gt; decimal string (*) <br>
decimal string --&gt; native integer <br>
decimal string --&gt; native floating point (*)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These conversions are governed
by the following general rules:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the source
number can be represented in the target form, that
representation is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the source
number is outside of the limits representable in the target
form, a representation of the closest limit is used. (Loss
of information)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the source
number is between two numbers representable in the target
form, a representation of one of these numbers is used.
(Loss of information)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In &quot;native
floating point --&gt; native integer&quot; conversions the
magnitude of the result is less than or equal to the
magnitude of the source. (&quot;Rounding to zero&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the
&quot;decimal string --&gt; native integer&quot; conversion
cannot be done without loss of information, the result is
compatible with the conversion sequence &quot;decimal_string
--&gt; <br>
native_floating_point --&gt; native_integer&quot;. In
particular, rounding is strongly biased to 0, though a
number like &quot;0.99999999999999999999&quot; has a chance
of being rounded to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTION: The conversions
marked with &quot;(*)&quot; above involve steps performed by
the C compiler. In particular, bugs/features of the compiler
used may lead to breakage of some of <br>
the above rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flavors of Perl numeric
operations <br>
Perl operations which take a numeric argument treat that
argument in one of four different ways: they may force it to
one of the integer/floating/ string formats, or they may
<br>
behave differently depending on the format of the operand.
Forcing a numeric value to a particular format does not
change the number stored in the value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the operators which need an
argument in the integer format treat the argument as in
modular arithmetic, e.g., &quot;mod 2**32&quot; on a 32-bit
architecture. &quot;sprintf &quot;%u&quot;, -1&quot; <br>
therefore provides the same result as &quot;sprintf
&quot;%u&quot;, ~0&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arithmetic operators <br>
The binary operators &quot;+&quot; &quot;-&quot;
&quot;*&quot; &quot;/&quot; &quot;%&quot; &quot;==&quot;
&quot;!=&quot; &quot;&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;&quot;
&quot;&gt;=&quot; &quot;&lt;=&quot; and the unary operators
&quot;-&quot; &quot;abs&quot; and &quot;--&quot; will
attempt to convert arguments to integers. If both <br>
conversions are possible without loss of precision, and the
operation can be performed without loss of precision then
the integer result is used. Otherwise arguments are <br>
converted to floating point format and the floating point
result is used. The caching of conversions (as described
above) means that the integer conversion does not throw <br>
away fractional parts on floating point numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">++ &quot;++&quot; behaves as the
other operators above, except that if it is a string
matching the format &quot;/^[a-zA-Z]*[0-9]*&quot; the string
increment described in perlop is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arithmetic operators during
&quot;use integer&quot; <br>
In scopes where &quot;use integer;&quot; is in force, nearly
all the operators listed above will force their argument(s)
into integer format, and return an integer result. The <br>
exceptions, &quot;abs&quot;, &quot;++&quot; and
&quot;--&quot;, do not change their behavior with &quot;use
integer;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other mathematical operators
<br>
Operators such as &quot;**&quot;, &quot;sin&quot; and
&quot;exp&quot; force arguments to floating point
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bitwise operators <br>
Arguments are forced into the integer format if not
strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bitwise operators during
&quot;use integer&quot; <br>
forces arguments to integer format. Also shift operations
internally use signed integers rather than the default
unsigned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operators which expect an
integer <br>
force the argument into the integer format. This is
applicable to the third and fourth arguments of
&quot;sysread&quot;, for example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operators which expect a string
<br>
force the argument into the string format. For example, this
is applicable to &quot;printf &quot;%s&quot;,
$value&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Though forcing an argument into
a particular form does not change the stored number, Perl
remembers the result of such conversions. In particular,
though the first such <br>
conversion may be time-consuming, repeated operations will
not need to redo the conversion.</p>
