<p>tofrodos(1) General Commands Manual tofrodos(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tofrodos - Converts text files between DOS and Unix
formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fromdos [ options ] [file...] <br>
todos [ options ] [file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
DOS text files traditionally have carriage return and line
feed pairs as their newline characters while Unix text files
have the line feed as their newline character. fromdos <br>
converts ASCII and Unicode UTF-8 text files from the DOS
format to the Unix format, while todos converts them from
the Unix format to the DOS format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The programs accept multiple
filenames and wildcards as their arguments. You may also use
them in a pipe. If either program finds its input
redirected, it will process stdin <br>
and place the output on stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a This option is deprecated. Do not use it unless you know
what you&rsquo;re doing. By default, Tofrodos does the
expected thing for text files. That is, when converting from
DOS <br>
to Unix, it will remove carriage returns only if they are
followed by line feeds. When converting from Unix to DOS, it
will add carriage returns only if the linefeeds are <br>
not already preceeded by carriage returns. When Tofrodos is
run on a normal text file that has already been converted,
the resulting file should be identical to the origi&acirc;
<br>
nal. However, if you use this option, the program will
always remove carriage returns in the DOS to Unix mode and
always add carriage returns in the Unix to DOS mode even
<br>
if it is not appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Make a backup of original
file. The original file with a .bak extension appended to
the original filename, silently replacing any existing file
of that name. For example, <br>
a file called &quot;filename.ext&quot; becomes
&quot;filename.ext.bak&quot; replacing any existing file
having the name &quot;filename.ext.bak&quot;. Important: the
program behaves differently if it <br>
is compiled for DOS (as compared to being compiled for
Windows, Linux, Mac OS X or other systems). In view of the
filename restrictions present on DOS, the DOS executable
<br>
will strip the original file extension, if any, from the
file before appending the .bak extension. For example,
&quot;filename.ext&quot; becomes
&quot;filename.bak&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Convert from DOS to Unix.
This forces the program to convert the file in a particular
direction. By default, if the program is named fromdos or
dos2unix, it will assume <br>
that the input file is in a DOS format and convert it to a
Unix format. If the program is named todos or unix2dos, it
will assume that the input file is in a Unix format <br>
and convert it to a DOS format. Using the -d option forces
the program to convert from a DOS format to a Unix format
regardless of how the program is named. Likewise, <br>
using the -u option forces the program to convert from a
Unix format to a DOS format regardless of the name of the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Abort processing on any error
in any file. Normally, the program will simply skip to
process the next file on the command line when it encounters
any errors. This option <br>
causes it to abort on errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Force: convert even if the
file is not writeable (read-only). By default, if the
program finds that the file does not have write permission,
it will not process that file. <br>
This option forces the conversion even if the file is
read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display a short help screen
on the program usage and quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l&lt;logfile&gt; <br>
Log error messages to &lt;logfile&gt;. Note that if your
command line has an error, such as when you specify an
unknown option, the error message for the command line
option <br>
error will be issued to stderr instead and not logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Overwrite the original file
(no backup). This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Preserve file ownership and
time on Unix-type systems (like Linux). On Windows and
MSDOS, it only preserves the file time. Note that on many
Unix-type systems, including <br>
Linux, the file ownership will only be preserved if the
program is run as root, otherwise it will just set the file
time and silently fail the change of file ownership. On <br>
such systems, if you want a warning message when the file
ownership cannot be changed, use -v (the verbose flag) as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Convert from Unix to DOS. See
the -d option above for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Show version message and
quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODE <br>
Tofrodos terminates with an exit code of 0 on success and 1
on error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the program is invoked with
multiple files on the command line, the default behaviour is
to skip to the next file in the list if an error is
encountered with any file. In such <br>
a case, the exit code returned will the status of the last
file processed (ie, 0 on success, 1 on failure). If this is
not desirable, use the -e option, which will force the
pro&acirc; <br>
gram to abort immediately with the appropriate exit code on
encountering any error.</p>
