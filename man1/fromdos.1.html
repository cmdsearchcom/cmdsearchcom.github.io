tofrodos - Converts text files between DOS and Unix formats.

DOS text files traditionally have carriage return and line feed pairs as their
  newline characters while Unix text files have the line feed as their newline
  character. <i>fromdos</i> converts ASCII and Unicode UTF-8 text files from the
  DOS format to the Unix format, while <i>todos</i> converts them from the Unix
  format to the DOS format.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The programs accept multiple filenames and wildcards as their arguments. You may
  also use them in a pipe. If either program finds its input redirected, it will
  process stdin and place the output on stdout.

  <dd class="It-tag">This option is deprecated. Do not use it unless you know
      what you're doing. By default, Tofrodos does the expected thing for text
      files. That is, when converting from DOS to Unix, it will remove carriage
      returns only if they are followed by line feeds. When converting from Unix
      to DOS, it will add carriage returns only if the linefeeds are not already
      preceeded by carriage returns. When Tofrodos is run on a normal text file
      that has already been converted, the resulting file should be identical to
      the original. However, if you use this option, the program will always
      remove carriage returns in the DOS to Unix mode and always add carriage
      returns in the Unix to DOS mode even if it is not appropriate.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">Make a backup of original file. The original file with a

      &quot;filename.ext&quot; becomes &quot;filename.ext.bak&quot; replacing
      any existing file having the name &quot;filename.ext.bak&quot;. Important:
      the program behaves differently if it is compiled for DOS (as compared to
      being compiled for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X or other systems). In view of
      the filename restrictions present on DOS, the DOS executable will strip
      the original file extension, if any, from the file before appending the
      <i>.bak</i> extension. For example, &quot;filename.ext&quot; becomes
      &quot;filename.bak&quot;.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">Convert from DOS to Unix. This forces the program to
      convert the file in a particular direction. By default, if the program is
      named <i>fromdos</i> or <i>dos2unix,</i> it will assume that the input
      file is in a DOS format and convert it to a Unix format. If the program is
      named <i>todos</i> or <i>unix2dos,</i> it will assume that the input file
      is in a Unix format and convert it to a DOS format. Using the <i>-d</i>
      option forces the program to convert from a DOS format to a Unix format
      regardless of how the program is named. Likewise, using the <i>-u</i>
      option forces the program to convert from a Unix format to a DOS format
      regardless of the name of the program.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_CODE"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_CODE">EXIT
  CODE</a></h1>
Tofrodos terminates with an exit code of 0 on success and 1 on error.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the program is invoked with multiple files on the command line, the default
  behaviour is to skip to the next file in the list if an error is encountered
  with any file. In such a case, the exit code returned will the status of the
  last file processed (ie, 0 on success, 1 on failure). If this is not
  desirable, use the -e option, which will force the program to abort
  immediately with the appropriate exit code on encountering any error.
