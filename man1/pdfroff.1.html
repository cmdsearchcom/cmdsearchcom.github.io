<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pdfroff is a wrapper program for the GNU text processing
system, groff. It transparently handles the mechanics of
multiple pass groff processing, when applied to suitably
marked <br>
up groff source files, such that tables of contents and body
text are formatted separately, and are subsequently combined
in the correct order, for final publication as a single <br>
PDF document. A further optional &acirc;style sheet&acirc;
capability is provided; this allows for the definition of
content which is required to precede the table of contents,
in the pub&acirc; <br>
lished document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each invocation of pdfroff,
the ultimate groff output stream is post-processed by the
GhostScript interpreter, to produce a finished PDF
document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdfroff makes no assumptions
about, and imposes no restrictions on, the use of any groff
macro packages which the user may choose to employ, in order
to achieve a desired docu&acirc; <br>
ment format; however, it does include specific built in
support for the pdfmark macro package, should the user
choose to employ it. Specifically, if the pdfhref macro,
defined <br>
in the pdfmark.tmac package, is used to define public
reference marks, or dynamic links to such reference marks,
then pdfroff performs as many preformatting groff passes as
<br>
required, up to a maximum limit of four, in order to compile
a document reference dictionary, to resolve references, and
to expand the dynamically defined content of links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
The command line is parsed in accordance with normal GNU
conventions, but with one exception &acirc; when specifying
any short form option (i.e., a single character option
introduced <br>
by a single hyphen), and if that option expects an argument,
then it must be specified independently (i.e., it may not be
appended to any group of other single character short <br>
form options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Long form option names (i.e.,
those introduced by a double hyphen) may be abbreviated to
their minimum length unambiguous initial substring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, pdfroff usage closely
mirrors that of groff itself. Indeed, with the exception of
the -h, -v, and -T dev short form options, and all long form
options, which are <br>
parsed internally by pdfroff, all options and file name
arguments specified on the command line are passed on to
groff, to control the formatting of the PDF document.
Conse&acirc; <br>
quently, pdfroff accepts all options and arguments, as
specified in groff(1), which may also be considered as the
definitive reference for all standard pdfroff options and
argu&acirc; <br>
ment usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
pdfroff accepts all of the short form options (i.e., those
introduced by a single hyphen), which are available with
groff itself. In most cases, these are simply passed
trans&acirc; <br>
parently to groff; the following, however, are handled
specially by pdfroff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Same as --help; see
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Process standard input, after
all other specified input files. This is passed
transparently to groff, but, if grouped with other options,
it must be the first in the <br>
group. Hiding it within a group breaks standard input
processing, in the multiple pass groff processing context of
pdfroff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T dev Only -T ps is supported
by pdfroff. Attempting to specify any other device causes
pdfroff to abort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Same as --version; see
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See groff(1) for a description
of all other short form options, which are transparently
passed through pdfroff to groff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All long form options (i.e.,
those introduced by a double hyphen) are interpreted locally
by pdfroff; they are not passed on to groff, unless
otherwise stated below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Causes pdfroff to display
a summary of the its usage syntax, and supported options,
and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--emit-ps <br>
Suppresses the final output conversion step, causing pdfroff
to emit PostScript output instead of PDF. This may be
useful, to capture intermediate PostScript output, when <br>
using a specialised postprocessor, such as gpresent for
example, in place of the default GhostScript PDF writer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keep-temporary-files <br>
Suppresses the deletion of temporary files, which normally
occurs after pdfroff has completed PDF document formatting;
this may be useful, when debugging formatting prob&acirc;
<br>
lems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See section FILES, for a
description of the temporary files used by pdfroff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-pdf-output <br>
May be used with the --reference-dictionary=name option
(described below) to eliminate the overhead of PDF
formatting, when running pdfroff to create a reference
dictio&acirc; <br>
nary, for use in a different document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-reference-dictionary <br>
May be used to eliminate the overhead of creating a
reference dictionary, when it is known that the target PDF
document contains no public references, created by the <br>
pdfhref macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-toc-relocation <br>
May be used to eliminate the extra groff processing pass,
which is required to generate a table of contents, and
relocate it to the start of the PDF document, when
pro&acirc; <br>
cessing any document which lacks an automatically generated
table of contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-kill-null-pages <br>
While preparing for simulation of the manual collation step,
which is traditionally required to relocate of a table of
contents to the start of a document, pdfroff accumu&acirc;
<br>
lates a number of empty page descriptions into the
intermediate PostScript output stream. During the final
collation step, these empty pages are normally discarded
from <br>
the finished document; this option forces pdfroff to leave
them in place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pdf-output=name <br>
Specifies the name to be used for the resultant PDF
document; if unspecified, the PDF output is written to
standard output. A future version of pdfroff may use this
<br>
option, to encode the document name in a generated reference
dictionary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reference-dictionary=name <br>
Specifies the name to be used for the generated reference
dictionary file; if unspecified, the reference dictionary is
created in a temporary file, which is deleted when <br>
pdfroff completes processing of the current document. This
option must be specified, if it is desired to save the
reference dictionary, for use in references placed in <br>
other PDF documents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--report-progress <br>
Causes pdfroff to display an informational message on
standard error, at the start of each groff processing
pass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stylesheet=name <br>
Specifies the name of an input file, to be used as a style
sheet for formatting of content, which is to be placed
before the table of contents, in the formatted PDF
docu&acirc; <br>
ment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Causes pdfroff to display a version identification message.
The entire command line is then passed transparently to
groff, in a one pass operation only, in order to dis&acirc;
<br>
play the associated groff version information, before
exiting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The following environment variables may be set, and
exported, to modify the behaviour of pdfroff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDFROFF_COLLATE <br>
Specifies the program to be used for collation of the
finshed PDF document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This collation step may be
required to move tables of contents to the start of the
finished PDF document, when formatting with traditional
macro packages, which print them <br>
at the end. However, users should not normally need to
specify PDFROFF_COLLATE, (and indeed, are not encouraged to
do so). If unspecified, pdfroff uses sed(1) by <br>
default, which normally suffices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If PDFROFF_COLLATE is specified,
then it must act as a filter, accepting a list of file name
arguments, and write its output to the stdout stream, whence
it is piped to <br>
the PDFROFF_POSTPROCESSOR_COMMAND, to produce the finished
PDF output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When specifying PDFROFF_COLLATE,
it is normally necessary to also specify
PDFROFF_KILL_NULL_PAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDFROFF_COLLATE is ignored, if
pdfroff is invoked with the --no-kill-null-pages option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDFROFF_KILL_NULL_PAGES <br>
Specifies options to be passed to the PDFROFF_COLLATE
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It should not normally be
necessary to specify PDFROFF_KILL_NULL_PAGES. The internal
default is a sed(1) script, which is intended to remove
completely blank pages from <br>
the collated output stream, and which should be appropriate
in most applications of pdfroff. However, if any alternative
to sed(1) is specified for PDFROFF_COLLATE, then <br>
it is likely that a corresponding alternative specification
for PDFROFF_KILL_NULL_PAGES is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As in the case of
PDFROFF_COLLATE, PDFROFF_KILL_NULL_PAGES is ignored, if
pdfroff is invoked with the --no-kill-null-pages option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDFROFF_POSTPROCESSOR_COMMAND
<br>
Specifies the command to be used for the final document
conversion from PostScript intermediate output to PDF. It
must behave as a filter, writing its output to the
std&acirc; <br>
out stream, and must accept an arbitrary number of files ...
arguments, with the special case of - representing the stdin
stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If unspecified,
PDFROFF_POSTPROCESSOR_COMMAND defaults to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gs -dBATCH -dQUIET -dNOPAUSE
-dSAFER -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=-</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GROFF_TMPDIR <br>
Identifies the directory in which pdfroff should create a
subdirectory for its temporary files. If GROFF_TMPDIR is not
specified, then the variables TMPDIR, TMP and TEMP <br>
are considered in turn, as possible temporary file
repositories. If none of these are set, then temporary files
are created in a subdirectory of /tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GROFF_GHOSTSCRIPT_INTERPRETER
<br>
Specifies the program to be invoked, when pdfroff converts
groff PostScript output to PDF. If
PDFROFF_POSTPROCESSOR_COMMAND is specified, then the command
name it speci&acirc; <br>
fies is implicitly assigned to
GROFF_GHOSTSCRIPT_INTERPRETER, overriding any explicit
setting specified in the environment. If
GROFF_GHOSTSCRIPT_INTERPRETER is not speci&acirc; <br>
fied, then pdfroff searches the process PATH, looking for a
program with any of the well known names for the GhostScript
interpreter; if no GhostScript interpreter can be <br>
found, pdfroff aborts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GROFF_AWK_INTERPRETER <br>
Specifies the program to be invoked, when pdfroff is
extracting reference dictionary entries from a groff
intermediate message stream. If GROFF_AWK_INTERPRETER is not
<br>
specified, then pdfroff searches the process PATH, looking
for any of the preferred programs, &lsquo;gawk&rsquo;,
&lsquo;mawk&rsquo;, &lsquo;nawk&rsquo; and
&lsquo;awk&rsquo;, in this order; if none of these are
found, <br>
pdfroff issues a warning message, and continue processing;
however, in this case, no reference dictionary is
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OSTYPE Typically defined
automatically by the operating system, OSTYPE is used on
Microsoft Win32/MS-DOS platforms only, to infer the default
PATH_SEPARATOR character, which is <br>
used when parsing the process PATH to search for external
helper programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH_SEPARATOR <br>
If set, PATH_SEPARATOR overrides the default separator
character, (&lsquo;:&rsquo; on POSIX/UNIX systems, inferred
from OSTYPE on Microsoft Win32/MS-DOS), which is used when
parsing <br>
the process PATH to search for external helper programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHOW_PROGRESS <br>
If this is set to a non-empty value, then pdfroff always
behaves as if the --report-progress option is specified, on
the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Input and output files for pdfroff may be named according to
any convention of the user&rsquo;s choice. Typically, input
files may be named according to the choice of the principal
<br>
formatting macro package, e.g., file.ms might be an input
file for formatting using the ms macros (s.tmac); normally,
the final output file should be named file.pdf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Temporary files, created by
pdfroff, are placed in the file system hierarchy, in or
below the directory specified by environment variables (see
section ENVIRONMENT). If mk&acirc; <br>
temp(1) is available, it is invoked to create a private
subdirectory of the nominated temporary files directory,
(with subdirectory name derived from the template pdfroff-
<br>
XXXXXXXXXX); if this subdirectory is successfully created,
the temporary files will be placed within it, otherwise they
will be placed directly in the directory nominated in the
<br>
environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All temporary files themselves
are named according to the convention pdf$$.*, where $$ is
the standard shell variable representing the process ID of
the pdfroff process itself, <br>
and * represents any of the extensions used by pdfroff to
identify the following temporary and intermediate files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdf$$.tmp <br>
A scratch pad file, used to capture reference data emitted
by groff, during the reference dictionary compilation
phase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdf$$.ref <br>
The reference dictionary, as compiled in the last but one
pass of the reference dictionary compilation phase; (at the
start of the first pass, this file is created empty; <br>
in successive passes, it contains the reference dictionary
entries, as collected in the preceding pass).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the
--reference-dictionary=name option is specified, this
intermediate file becomes permanent, and is named name,
rather than pdf$$.ref.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdf$$.cmp <br>
Used to collect reference dictionary entries during the
active pass of the reference dictionary compilation phase.
At the end of any pass, when the content of pdf$$.cmp <br>
compares as identical to pdf$$.ref, (or the corresponding
file named by the --reference-dictionary=name option), then
reference dictionary compilation is terminated, and <br>
the document reference map is appended to this intermediate
file, for inclusion in the final formatting passes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdf$$.tc <br>
An intermediate PostScript file, in which &acirc;Table of
Contents&acirc; entries are collected, to facilitate
relocation before the body text, on ultimate output to the
GhostScript <br>
postprocessor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdf$$.ps <br>
An intermediate PostScript file, in which the body text is
collected prior to ultimate output to the GhostScript
postprocessor, in the proper sequence, after pdf$$.tc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
See groff(1) for the definitive reference to document
formatting with groff. Since pdfroff provides a superset of
all groff capabilities, groff(1) may also be considered to
be <br>
the definitive reference to all standard capabilities of
pdfroff, with this document providing the reference to
pdfroff&rsquo;s extended features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While pdfroff imposes neither
any restriction on, nor any requirement for, the use of any
specific groff macro package, a number of supplied macro
packages, and in particular <br>
those associated with the package pdfmark.tmac, are best
suited for use with pdfroff as the preferred formatter.
Detailed documentation on the use of these packages may be
<br>
found, in PDF format, in the reference guide &acirc;Portable
Document Format Publishing with GNU Troff&acirc;, included
in the installed documentation set as <br>
