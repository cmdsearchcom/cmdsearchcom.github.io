<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
nettee - a network &quot;tee&quot; program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
nettee [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
nettee passes a data stream to one or more child nodes using
a daisychain method. On each node nettee may also direct the
stream to a file or pipe. nettee allows large amounts <br>
of data to be quickly distributed to multiple nodes on a
network at a rate limited only by the network bandwidth. The
distribution chain is typically linear for each network <br>
switch but may branch when nodes utilize multiple switches.
For maximum throughput only one instance of nettee should
utilize each network interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When nettee starts it waits for
a connection from the upstream node before attempting to
connect to its downstream nodes. Consequently nettee may be
started on the nodes in any <br>
order (by a script, rsh, ssh, and so forth.) Typically only
the node that reads the data stream for stdin or a file will
be set to log messages, so that the progress of the <br>
transfer may be monitored. Transmission errors are detected
by comparing the total number of bytes read by each child
node with the number of bytes transmitted to that child.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Error Handling <br>
By default severe errors cause the entire chain to abort. By
utilizing the -conwf and -colwf options nettee may be
instructed to do its best to continue processing in the
event <br>
of certain write failures of the data stream. Note that
failures which occur while the distribution chain is forming
are still fatal events. To allow the program to continue
<br>
with a truncated or alternate chain if chain formation
errors are encountered utilize the -connf option, and
optionally specify alternate targets in each hostlist. If
the node <br>
above the failed node is allowed to emit messages and errors
( for instance: -v 5 ) messages similar to these will be
sent to the log destination ( -log ):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Failures detected in child 0
[node34]: NWF <br>
Failures detected in child 1 [node35]: NONE <br>
Failures detected in chain: NWF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first type of message
describes the failures that were detected in the named child
node, that is, those named in the -next option. The second
message describes failures that <br>
were detected anywhere further on in the chain. The error
codes currently defined are: NONE no errors, NWF network
write failure, LWF local write failure, BBC child returned
<br>
incorrect byte count, BSTAT child returned unknown or bad
status, and NNF could not connect to (one or more)
downstream chain nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exit Status <br>
nettee will normally emit an EXIT_SUCCESS status. (0 on
Unix.) This is true even if the errors were detected and
handled in the node itself or in a child node. nettee will
<br>
emit an EXIT_FAILURE status if it was forced to close by an
unhandled event such as a timeout, write failure, or
unexpected socket closure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Print help information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hexamples <br>
Print examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-herrors <br>
Print error status codes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Print version, license, and
copyright information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-in &lt;SRC&gt; <br>
Reads data from &lt;SRC&gt; which may have one of three
values: nettee reads from the upstream node; - reads from
stdin; socket read the output of a command from a socket;
file&acirc; <br>
name reads from a file. If no -in option is present the
programs reads data from the upstream node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-out &lt;DST&gt; <br>
Writes data locally to &lt;DST&gt; which may have one of
three values: none writes nothing locally; - writes to
stdout; socket write the datastream to a command through a
<br>
socket; filename writes to a file. If no -out option is
present the program writes data to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-next &lt;HOSTLISTS&gt; <br>
Writes data to downstream destination[s]
hostlist1(,hostlist2(,hostlist3(...))) where the hostlist
entries are separated by commas or spaces. A hostlist
consists of <br>
either a single hostname, or a comma separated list of
hostnames enclosed in square brackets. Example:
node1,[node2,node3],[node4,node5,node6],node7. The bracketed
form <br>
allows for automatic failover if unreachable nodes are
encountered and if -connf is specified. The first hostname
in the list is tried, then the next, and so on. There <br>
may be 1-8 hostlists. The number of hostlists controls the
topology of the distribution chain. Use a linear
distribution chain (a single hostlist) when all nodes share
a <br>
single network switch. Use a forked distribution chain
(multiple hostlist) when nodes are connected to two or more
network switches. The End of Chain condition (no down&acirc;
<br>
stream write) is indicated by a &lt;HOSTS&gt; value of . ,
&quot;&quot; , or _EOC_ . An End of Chain condition is also
indicated by the absence of an -next option. If End of Chain
is <br>
indicated there may not be any other hostslists
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cmd &lt;COMMAND&gt; <br>
Specifies the command to use in conjunction with an -in
socket or -out socket option. Since only a single
&lt;COMMAND&gt; may be specified socket may not be applied
to both -in <br>
and -out at the same time. When -cmd is used with -in socket
a child process running &lt;COMMAND&gt; reads data from a
disk or other device and writes the resulting data stream
<br>
to stdout. When -cmd is used with -out socket a child
process running &lt;COMMAND&gt; reads the datastream from
stdin and writes the processed data to a disk or other
device. <br>
Typically the &lt;COMMAND&gt; string invokes tar or some
other archiving program. In some instances using sockets and
-cmd will be faster than using the same command in a pipe
<br>
due to the larger buffer size used for the socket. Run
nettee -hexamples to see a usage example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stm &lt;EOS&gt; <br>
stream text through a nettee chain until the string
&lt;EOS&gt; is encountered, then exit. This allows short
text messages to traverse the chain without waiting for a
buffer to <br>
fill. Since the text message can very rapidly traverse the
nettee chain it can be piped into execinput (or any other
program that will execute its stdin as commands) to <br>
produce essentially simultaneous execution on all target
nodes. The &lt;EOS&gt; string is not passed through the data
chain and its length is ignored. When used to start
fur&acirc; <br>
ther nettee processes on the target nodes &lt;PORT&gt;
values must be chosen to avoid interference. While this mode
may be convenient for setting up Beowulf nodes it is
exceed&acirc; <br>
ingly dangerous for general use since any command introduced
into the command stream will execute on all chain nodes as
if submitted by the owner of the nettee process on <br>
that node. Run nettee -hexamples to see a usage example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-name &lt;STRING&gt; <br>
Specify the node name used in messages (&lt;=127
characters). If not supplied the values of the environmental
variables MYHOSTNAME and HOSTNAME are first checked, and if
<br>
those are not defined, the result of a gethostname() call is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-log &lt;LDST&gt; <br>
Errors and messages are written to &lt;LDST&gt; which may
have one of two values: - writes to stderr or filename
writes to a file. If no -log option is present the program
<br>
writes messages to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p,-port &lt;PORT&gt; <br>
First of two consecutive ports use for communication. If no
-port option is present the program uses the default value
of 9997.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v &lt;VERBOSE&gt; <br>
&lt;VERBOSE&gt; is a bit mask which controls the types of
warning and error messages which are sent to the -log
destination. Bit values indicate: 1 show error messages; 2
show <br>
command line settings; 4 show messages; 8 show periodic
status messages during transfer; 16 prepend nodename to all
messages. Use a &lt;VERBOSE&gt; value of 0 to eliminate all
<br>
messages. If no -v is present the program uses a default
&lt;VERBOSE&gt; value of 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Suppresss &quot;ignored
signal&quot; messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t &lt;WAIT&gt; <br>
Wait up to &lt;WAIT&gt; seconds for a connection from
upstream in the chain to form or data to be received. If
neither of these events occur exit with an error. A value of
0 <br>
waits forever and will only exit on an end of data
condition. If no -t is present the program uses a default
&lt;WAIT&gt; value of 0. The -iconnf&lt;WAIT&gt; and -w
options control <br>
timeouts for downstream connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Wait for the next node to
boot or attach to the network. If not specified and the next
node is not reachable nettee will exit with an error no
matter what the -t &lt;WAIT&gt; <br>
and -iconnf &lt;WAIT&gt; timeout values are.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-colwf Continue on Local Write
Failure. Normally the failure of a write of the data stream
to the local output will be fatal and the entire
distribution chain will collapse <br>
immediately. (Typically this happens when data is written to
disk and a partition fills or there is an ownership problem.
A complete disk failure may initially present <br>
this way but often goes on to crash the node, resulting also
in a network write failure.) When -colwf is set and a local
write failure occurs on a node that node will <br>
continue to relay data down the chain. The node that failed
will not have correctly processed the data stream locally
but all other nodes will be unaffected by this fail&acirc;
<br>
ure. The top node will emit an error message when this
occurs so that a subsequent analysis with other tools may
locate the node(s) which failed. This option may only be
<br>
employed on a node that reads data from an upstream
node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-conwf Continue on Network Write
Failure. Normally the failure of a write of the data stream
to the next node will be fatal and the entire distribution
chain will collapse imme&acirc; <br>
diately. (Typically this happens when a node crashes while
nettee is running.) When -conwf is set and a network write
failure occurs on a node (indicating that the next <br>
node has failed) the node will continue to process the data
stream locally but will make no further attempts to transfer
data to the next node in the chain. This allows <br>
the data transfer to complete on a chain down to the node
above a failed node. The top node will emit an error message
when this occurs so that a subsequent analysis with <br>
other tools may locate the node(s) which failed. This option
may only be employed on a node that reads data from an
upstream node</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-connf &lt;WAIT&gt; <br>
Continue on Next Node Failure. Give each node in a hostlist
&lt;WAIT&gt; seconds to join the chain. After that each
successive host in the hostlist is given &lt;WAIT&gt;
seconds to <br>
join, and if none succeed, no data will be sent to any of
those hosts. If -connf is not specified or the wait time is
set to zero seconds, the program will wait forever <br>
for a connection to the first node in each hostlist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-progress &lt;INTERVAL&gt; <br>
If -v 8 is used a status message is emitted every
&lt;INTERVAL&gt; bytes transferred. The default value of
10000000 will be too small for a very fast network.</p>
