POSTGRES(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
postgres - PostgreSQL database server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
postgres [option...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
postgres is the PostgreSQL database server. In order for a
client application to access a database it connects (over a
network or locally) to a running postgres instance. The <br>
postgres instance then starts a separate server process to
handle the connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One postgres instance always
manages the data of exactly one database cluster. A database
cluster is a collection of databases that is stored at a
common file system location <br>
(the &acirc;data area&acirc;). More than one postgres
instance can run on a system at one time, so long as they
use different data areas and different communication ports
(see below). When <br>
postgres starts it needs to know the location of the data
area. The location must be specified by the -D option or the
PGDATA environment variable; there is no default. <br>
Typically, -D or PGDATA points directly to the data area
directory created by initdb(1). Other possible file layouts
are discussed in Section 18.2, &acirc;File Locations&acirc;,
in the <br>
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default postgres starts in
the foreground and prints log messages to the standard error
stream. In practical applications postgres should be started
as a background process, <br>
perhaps at boot time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The postgres command can also be
called in single-user mode. The primary use for this mode is
during bootstrapping by initdb(1). Sometimes it is used for
debugging or disaster <br>
recovery; note that running a single-user server is not
truly suitable for debugging the server, since no realistic
interprocess communication and locking will happen. When
<br>
invoked in single-user mode from the shell, the user can
enter queries and the results will be printed to the screen,
but in a form that is more useful for developers than end
<br>
users. In the single-user mode, the session user will be set
to the user with ID 1, and implicit superuser powers are
granted to this user. This user does not actually have to
<br>
exist, so the single-user mode can be used to manually
recover from certain kinds of accidental damage to the
system catalogs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
postgres accepts the following command-line arguments. For a
detailed discussion of the options consult Chapter 18,
Server Configuration, in the documentation. You can save
<br>
typing most of these options by setting up a configuration
file. Some (safe) options can also be set from the
connecting client in an application-dependent way to apply
only for <br>
that session. For example, if the environment variable
PGOPTIONS is set, then libpq-based clients will pass that
string to the server, which will interpret it as postgres
<br>
command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General Purpose <br>
-A 0|1 <br>
Enables run-time assertion checks, which is a debugging aid
to detect programming mistakes. This option is only
available if assertions were enabled when PostgreSQL was
<br>
compiled. If so, the default is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B nbuffers <br>
Sets the number of shared buffers for use by the server
processes. The default value of this parameter is chosen
automatically by initdb. Specifying this option is
equivalent <br>
to setting the shared_buffers configuration parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c name=value <br>
Sets a named run-time parameter. The configuration
parameters supported by PostgreSQL are described in Chapter
18, Server Configuration, in the documentation. Most of the
<br>
other command line options are in fact short forms of such a
parameter assignment. -c can appear multiple times to set
multiple parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C name <br>
Prints the value of the named run-time parameter, and exits.
(See the -c option above for details.) This can be used on a
running server, and returns values from <br>
postgresql.conf, modified by any parameters supplied in this
invocation. It does not reflect parameters supplied when the
cluster was started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is meant for other
programs that interact with a server instance, such as
pg_ctl(1), to query configuration parameter values.
User-facing applications should <br>
instead use SHOW(7) or the pg_settings view.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d debug-level <br>
Sets the debug level. The higher this value is set, the more
debugging output is written to the server log. Values are
from 1 to 5. It is also possible to pass -d 0 for a <br>
specific session, which will prevent the server log level of
the parent postgres process from being propagated to this
session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D datadir <br>
Specifies the file system location of the data directory or
configuration file(s). See Section 18.2, &acirc;File
Locations&acirc;, in the documentation for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e <br>
Sets the default date style to &acirc;European&acirc;, that
is DMY ordering of input date fields. This also causes the
day to be printed before the month in certain date output
formats. <br>
See Section 8.5, &acirc;Date/Time Types&acirc;, in the
documentation for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F <br>
Disables fsync calls for improved performance, at the risk
of data corruption in the event of a system crash.
Specifying this option is equivalent to disabling the fsync
<br>
configuration parameter. Read the detailed documentation
before using this!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h hostname <br>
Specifies the IP host name or address on which postgres is
to listen for TCP/IP connections from client applications.
The value can also be a comma-separated list of <br>
addresses, or * to specify listening on all available
interfaces. An empty value specifies not listening on any IP
addresses, in which case only Unix-domain sockets can be
<br>
used to connect to the server. Defaults to listening only on
localhost. Specifying this option is equivalent to setting
the listen_addresses configuration parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i <br>
Allows remote clients to connect via TCP/IP (Internet
domain) connections. Without this option, only local
connections are accepted. This option is equivalent to
setting <br>
listen_addresses to * in postgresql.conf or via -h.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is deprecated since
it does not allow access to the full functionality of
listen_addresses. It&rsquo;s usually better to set
listen_addresses directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k directory <br>
Specifies the directory of the Unix-domain socket on which
postgres is to listen for connections from client
applications. The value can also be a comma-separated list
of <br>
directories. An empty value specifies not listening on any
Unix-domain sockets, in which case only TCP/IP sockets can
be used to connect to the server. The default value is <br>
normally /tmp, but that can be changed at build time.
Specifying this option is equivalent to setting the
unix_socket_directories configuration parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l <br>
Enables secure connections using SSL. PostgreSQL must have
been compiled with support for SSL for this option to be
available. For more information on using SSL, refer to <br>
Section 17.9, &acirc;Secure TCP/IP Connections with
SSL&acirc;, in the documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N max-connections <br>
Sets the maximum number of client connections that this
server will accept. The default value of this parameter is
chosen automatically by initdb. Specifying this option is
<br>
equivalent to setting the max_connections configuration
parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o extra-options <br>
The command-line-style options specified in extra-options
are passed to all server processes started by this postgres
process. If the option string contains any spaces, the <br>
entire string must be quoted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of this option is
obsolete; all command-line options for server processes can
be specified directly on the postgres command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
Specifies the TCP/IP port or local Unix domain socket file
extension on which postgres is to listen for connections
from client applications. Defaults to the value of the <br>
PGPORT environment variable, or if PGPORT is not set, then
defaults to the value established during compilation
(normally 5432). If you specify a port other than the
default <br>
port, then all client applications must specify the same
port using either command-line options or PGPORT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s <br>
Print time information and other statistics at the end of
each command. This is useful for benchmarking or for use in
tuning the number of buffers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S work-mem <br>
Specifies the amount of memory to be used by internal sorts
and hashes before resorting to temporary disk files. See the
description of the work_mem configuration parameter <br>
in Section 18.4.1, &acirc;Memory&acirc;, in the
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print the postgres version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--name=value <br>
Sets a named run-time parameter; a shorter form of -c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--describe-config <br>
This option dumps out the server&rsquo;s internal
configuration variables, descriptions, and defaults in
tab-delimited COPY format. It is designed primarily for use
by <br>
administration tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Show help about postgres command line arguments, and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Semi-internal Options <br>
The options described here are used mainly for debugging
purposes, and in some cases to assist with recovery of
severely damaged databases. There should be no reason to use
them <br>
in a production database setup. They are listed here only
for use by PostgreSQL system developers. Furthermore, these
options might change or be removed in a future release <br>
without notice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f { s | i | o | b | t | n | m |
h } <br>
Forbids the use of particular scan and join methods: s and i
disable sequential and index scans respectively, o, b and t
disable index-only scans, bitmap index scans, and TID <br>
scans respectively, while n, m, and h disable nested-loop,
merge and hash joins respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Neither sequential scans nor
nested-loop joins can be disabled completely; the -fs and
-fn options simply discourage the optimizer from using those
plan types if it has any <br>
other alternative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n <br>
This option is for debugging problems that cause a server
process to die abnormally. The ordinary strategy in this
situation is to notify all other server processes that they
<br>
must terminate and then reinitialize the shared memory and
semaphores. This is because an errant server process could
have corrupted some shared state before terminating. <br>
This option specifies that postgres will not reinitialize
shared data structures. A knowledgeable system programmer
can then use a debugger to examine shared memory and <br>
semaphore state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O <br>
Allows the structure of system tables to be modified. This
is used by initdb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P <br>
Ignore system indexes when reading system tables, but still
update the indexes when modifying the tables. This is useful
when recovering from damaged system indexes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t pa[rser] | pl[anner] |
e[xecutor] <br>
Print timing statistics for each query relating to each of
the major system modules. This option cannot be used
together with the -s option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T <br>
This option is for debugging problems that cause a server
process to die abnormally. The ordinary strategy in this
situation is to notify all other server processes that they
<br>
must terminate and then reinitialize the shared memory and
semaphores. This is because an errant server process could
have corrupted some shared state before terminating. <br>
This option specifies that postgres will stop all other
server processes by sending the signal SIGSTOP, but will not
cause them to terminate. This permits system programmers
<br>
to collect core dumps from all server processes by hand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v protocol <br>
Specifies the version number of the frontend/backend
protocol to be used for a particular session. This option is
for internal use only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W seconds <br>
A delay of this many seconds occurs when a new server
process is started, after it conducts the authentication
procedure. This is intended to give an opportunity to attach
to <br>
the server process with a debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for Single-User Mode
<br>
The following options only apply to the single-user
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--single <br>
Selects the single-user mode. This must be the first
argument on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">database <br>
Specifies the name of the database to be accessed. This must
be the last argument on the command line. If it is omitted
it defaults to the user name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E <br>
Echo all commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j <br>
Disables use of newline as a statement delimiter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r filename <br>
Send all server log output to filename. In normal multiuser
mode, this option is ignored, and stderr is used by all
processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
PGCLIENTENCODING <br>
Default character encoding used by clients. (The clients can
override this individually.) This value can also be set in
the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PGDATA <br>
Default data directory location</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PGDATESTYLE <br>
Default value of the DateStyle run-time parameter. (The use
of this environment variable is deprecated.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PGPORT <br>
Default port number (preferably set in the configuration
file)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
A failure message mentioning semget or shmget probably
indicates you need to configure your kernel to provide
adequate shared memory and semaphores. For more discussion
see <br>
Section 17.4, &acirc;Managing Kernel Resources&acirc;, in
the documentation. You might be able to postpone
reconfiguring your kernel by decreasing shared_buffers to
reduce the shared memory <br>
consumption of PostgreSQL, and/or by reducing
max_connections to reduce the semaphore consumption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A failure message suggesting
that another server is already running should be checked
carefully, for example by using the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ ps ax | grep postgres</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ ps -ef | grep postgres</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">depending on your system. If you
are certain that no conflicting server is running, you can
remove the lock file mentioned in the message and try
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A failure message indicating
inability to bind to a port might indicate that that port is
already in use by some non-PostgreSQL process. You might
also get this error if you <br>
terminate postgres and immediately restart it using the same
port; in this case, you must simply wait a few seconds until
the operating system closes the port before trying <br>
again. Finally, you might get this error if you specify a
port number that your operating system considers to be
reserved. For example, many versions of Unix consider port
<br>
numbers under 1024 to be &acirc;trusted&acirc; and only
permit the Unix superuser to access them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The utility command pg_ctl(1) can be used to start and shut
down the postgres server safely and comfortably.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If at all possible, do not use
SIGKILL to kill the main postgres server. Doing so will
prevent postgres from freeing the system resources (e.g.,
shared memory and semaphores) <br>
that it holds before terminating. This might cause problems
for starting a fresh postgres run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To terminate the postgres server
normally, the signals SIGTERM, SIGINT, or SIGQUIT can be
used. The first will wait for all clients to terminate
before quitting, the second will <br>
forcefully disconnect all clients, and the third will quit
immediately without proper shutdown, resulting in a recovery
run during restart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SIGHUP signal will reload
the server configuration files. It is also possible to send
SIGHUP to an individual server process, but that is usually
not sensible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To cancel a running query, send
the SIGINT signal to the process running that command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The postgres server uses SIGTERM
to tell subordinate server processes to quit normally and
SIGQUIT to terminate without the normal cleanup. These
signals should not be used by <br>
users. It is also unwise to send SIGKILL to a server process
&acirc; the main postgres process will interpret this as a
crash and will force all the sibling processes to quit as
part <br>
of its standard crash-recovery procedure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The -- options will not work on FreeBSD or OpenBSD. Use -c
instead. This is a bug in the affected operating systems; a
future release of PostgreSQL will provide a workaround if
<br>
this is not fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
To start a single-user mode server, use a command like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">postgres --single -D
/usr/local/pgsql/data other-options my_database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Provide the correct path to the
database directory with -D, or make sure that the
environment variable PGDATA is set. Also specify the name of
the particular database you want to <br>
work in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, the single-user mode
server treats newline as the command entry terminator; there
is no intelligence about semicolons, as there is in psql. To
continue a command across <br>
multiple lines, you must type backslash just before each
newline except the last one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But if you use the -j command
line switch, then newline does not terminate command entry.
In this case, the server will read the standard input until
the end-of-file (EOF) <br>
marker, then process the input as a single command string.
Backslash-newline is not treated specially in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To quit the session, type EOF
(Control+D, usually). If you&rsquo;ve used -j, two
consecutive EOFs are needed to exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the single-user mode
server does not provide sophisticated line-editing features
(no command history, for example). Single-User mode also
does not do any background <br>
processing, like automatic checkpoints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To start postgres in the background using default values,
type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ nohup postgres &gt;logfile
2&gt;&amp;1 &lt;/dev/null &amp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start postgres with a
specific port, e.g. 1234:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ postgres -p 1234</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To connect to this server using
psql, specify this port with the -p option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ psql -p 1234</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or set the environment variable
PGPORT:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ export PGPORT=1234 <br>
$ psql</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Named run-time parameters can be
set in either of these styles:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ postgres -c work_mem=1234 <br>
$ postgres --work-mem=1234</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Either form overrides whatever
setting might exist for work_mem in postgresql.conf. Notice
that underscores in parameter names can be written as either
underscore or dash on the <br>
command line. Except for short-term experiments, it&rsquo;s
probably better practice to edit the setting in
postgresql.conf than to rely on a command-line switch to set
a parameter.</p>
