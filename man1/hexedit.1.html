-s, --sector <br>
Format the display to have entire sectors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --maximize <br>
Try to maximize the display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--color <br>
Display colors. This feature is only available if your
operating system supports it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Show the usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS (quickly) <br>
Moving <br>
&lt;, &gt; : go to start/end of the file <br>
Right: next character <br>
Left: previous character <br>
Down: next line <br>
Up: previous line <br>
Home: beginning of line <br>
End: end of line <br>
PUp: page forward <br>
PDown: page backward</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous <br>

Return: go to <br>
Backspace: undo previous character <br>
Ctrl-U: undo all <br>
Ctrl-S: search forward <br>
Ctrl-R: search backward</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cut&amp;Paste <br>
Ctrl-Space: set mark <br>
Esc-W: copy <br>
Ctrl-Y: paste <br>
Esc-Y: paste into a file <br>
Esc-I: fill</p>

o F10, Ctrl+X - quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the Esc commands, it
sometimes works to use Alt instead of Esc. Funny things here
(especially for froggies :) egrave = Alt+H , ccedilla =
Alt+G, Alt+Y = ugrave.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modeline <br>
At the bottom of the display you have the modeline (copied
from emacs). As in emacs, you have the indications --, **
and %% meaning unmodified, modified and read-only. Then you
<br>
have the name of the file you&rsquo;re currently editing.
Next to it is the current position of the cursor in the file
followed by the total file size. The total file size
isn&rsquo;t quite <br>
correct for devices. <br>
While in --sector mode, it shows the sector the cursor is
in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Editing <br>
You can edit in ASCII or in hexadecimal. You can switch
between the two with Tab. When the file is read-only, you
can&rsquo;t edit it. When trying to edit a read-only file, a
message <br>
(&lsquo;&lsquo;File is read-only&rsquo;&rsquo;) tells you it
is non-writable. <br>
The modifications are shown in bold until they are saved.
The modeline indicates whether you have modified the file or
not. <br>
When editing in hexadecimal, only 0,1,...,9, a,b,...,f,
A,B,...F are legal. Other keys are unbound. The first time
you hit an unbound key, the help pops up. It won&rsquo;t pop
again <br>
unless you call the help directly (with F1). <br>
When editing in ascii, you can find it difficult to enter
characters like / which are bound to a function. The
solution is to use the quoted insert function Ctrl+Q, the
key after <br>
the quoted insert function is not processed by hexedit (like
emacs&rsquo; quoted-insert, or like the &nbsp;character in
C).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Searching <br>
You can search for a string in ASCII or in hexadecimal. You
can switch between the two with Tab. If the string is found,
the cursor is moved to the beginning of the matching <br>
location. If the search failed, a message (&lsquo;&lsquo;not
found&rsquo;&rsquo;) tells you so. You can cancel the search
by pressing a key. <br>
The search in hexadecimal is a bit confusing. You must give
a hexadecimal string with an even number of characters. The
search can then be done byte by byte. If you want to <br>
search a long number (eg: a 32 bit number), you must know
the internal representation of that number (little/big
endian problem) and give it the way it is in memory. For
example, <br>
on an Intel processor (little endian), you must swap every
bytes: 0x12345678 is written 0x78563412 in memory and
that&rsquo;s the string you must give to the search engine.
<br>
Before searching you are asked if you want to save the
changes, if the file is edited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more sophisticated search,
see Volker Schatz&rsquo;s patch at
&lt;http://www.volkerschatz.com/unix/homebrew.html#hexedit&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selecting, copying, pasting,
filling <br>
First, select the part of the buffer you want to copy: start
setting the mark where you want. Then go to the end of the
area you want to copy (you can use the go to function and
<br>
the search functions). Then copy it. You can then paste the
copied area in the current file or in another file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also fill the selected
area with a string or a character: start choosing the block
you want to fill in (set mark then move to the end of the
block), and call the fill <br>
function (F12). hexedit ask you the string you want to fill
the block with. <br>
The code is not tuned for huge filling as it keeps the
modifications in memory until you save them. That&rsquo;s
why hexedit will warn you if you try to fill in a big
block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the mark is set, the
selection is shown in reverse mode. <br>
Be aware that the copied area contains the modifications
done at the time of the copy. But if you undo the
modifications, it does not change the content of the copy
buffer. It <br>
seems obvious but it&rsquo;s worth saying.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scrolling <br>
The scrolling is different whether you are in --sector mode
or not. In normal mode, the scrolling is line by line. In
sector mode, the scrolling is sector by sector. In both <br>
modes, you can force the display to start at a given
position using Esc+L.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNRESTRICTIONS <br>
hexedit is Open Source; anyone may redistribute copies of
hexedit to anyone under the terms stated in the GNU General
Public License.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can find hexedit at <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TODO <br>
Anything you think could be nice...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
There are problems with the curses library given with Redhat
5.0 that make hexedit think the terminal is huge. The result
is that hexedit is not usable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shortcuts work on some
machines, and not on others. That&rsquo;s why there are many
shortcuts for each function. The Ctrl+Arrows and the Alt+.
do not work work as they should most <br>
of the time. On SUNs, you must do Ctrl+V-Ctrl+V instead of
Ctrl+V (!); and the Alt key is the diamond one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While searching, it could be
interesting to know which position the search has reached.
It&rsquo;s always nice to see something moving to help
waiting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hexadecimal search could be
able to search modulo 4 bits instead of 8 bits. Another
feature could be to complete padd odd length hexadecimal
searches with zeros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
I have an example where the display is completly screwed up.
It seems to be a bug in ncurses (or maybe in xterm and
rxvt)?? Don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s me using ncurses
badly or not... It <br>
seems to happen when hexedit leaves only one space at the
end of the lines... If anyone has a (or the) solution,
please tell me!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have any problem with the
program (even a small one), please do report it to me.
Remarks of any kind are also welcome.</p>
