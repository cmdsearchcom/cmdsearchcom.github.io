<p>exult(1) General Commands Manual exult(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
exult_studio - a world editor for Exult</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
exult_studio [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
exult_studio can be used to view graphics and map snippets
of Exult games. Used in conjunction with exult the map can
be changed as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently it is not feasable to
create a game from scratch. You must point exult_studio at
an existing game instead, either via the -d commandline
option (see below), or by <br>
selecting Open static... in the File menu. The latter will
pop up a file requester, where you can choose an appropriate
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once an appropriate directory
has been located, a tree of game files is displayed to the
left of the main window, while the currently selected file
is viewed in detail to the <br>
right. At the moment, the following types of files are
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shape files <br>
Shapes are the basic graphical elements of the game. Each
shape has one or more frames that typically represent
different states or angles of the same thing. E.g. a button
shape <br>
could have frames for pressed, and released; a character
could have frames depicting her sitting, standing up facing
one way, or another, swinging a punch, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a shape file is selected,
the right part of the main window will show frame zero of
the shapes contained therein. Shapes can be selected by
clicking, which will show there <br>
number, number of frames, and name if known. Other frames
can be viewed by changing the frame number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Map files <br>
These files contain so called chunks that serve as templates
in the final map. The chunks of the selected map file are
shown to the right of the main window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d DIRECTORY <br>
specifies DIRECTORY as the game base directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x DIRECTORY <br>
tells exult_studio to look in DIRECTORY for its
user-interface specification. This option is only useful to
developers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/share/exult/exult_studio.glade <br>
Default location of the user-interface specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Editing a copyrighted game may
or may not be allowed. Please exercise caution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Closing the directory selector (via Ok or Cancel) induces a
crash. Double clicking the directory works, just move the
selector out of the way after that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid arguments to commandline
options will not be taken lightly. Avoid that for now.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More bugs? Surely! Please report
them at: <br>

(Be sure to mention information about your operating system,
and which version of exult_studio you are running!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
The Exult Team</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
exult_studio started it&rsquo;s life as a map-browser for
Ultima VII and has evolved from there, thanks to the open
source-model, and contributions of time and code from many
people.</p>
