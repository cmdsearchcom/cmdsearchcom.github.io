<p>RECON(1) LAM TOOLS RECON(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
recon - Check if LAM can be started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
recon [-a] [-b] [-d] [-h] [-v] [-nn] [-np] [-ssi key value]
[bhost]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a Report all host errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Assume local and remote shell
are the same. This means that only one remote shell
invocation is used to each node. If -b is not used, two
remote shell invocations are <br>
used to each node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Turn on debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print the command help
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ssi key value <br>
Send arguments to various SSI modules. See the
&quot;SSI&quot; section, below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Be verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nn Don&rsquo;t add
&quot;-n&quot; to the remote agent command line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-np Do not force the execution
of $HOME/.profile on remote hosts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
In order for LAM to be started on a remote UNIX machine,
several requirements have to be fulfilled:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) The machine must be reachable
via the network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) The user must be able to
remotely execute on the machine with the default remote
shell program that was chosen when LAM was configured. This
is usually rsh(1), but any <br>
remote shell program is acceptable (such as ssh(1), etc.).
Note that remote host permission must be configured such
that the remote shell program will not ask for a pass&acirc;
<br>
word when a command is invoked on remote host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3) The remote user&rsquo;s shell
must have a search path that will locate LAM
executables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4) The remote shell&rsquo;s
startup file must not print anything to standard error when
invoked non-interactively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any of these requirements is
not met for any machine declared in bhost, LAM will not be
able to start. By running recon first, the user will be able
to quickly identify and <br>
correct problems in the setup that would inhibit LAM from
starting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The local machine where recon is
invoked must be one of the machines specified in bhost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bhost file is a LAM boot
schema written in the host file syntax. See bhost(5).
Instead of the command line, a boot schema can be specified
in the LAMBHOST environment vari&acirc; <br>
able. Otherwise a default file, bhost.def, is used. LAM
seaches for bhost first in the local directory and then in
the installation directory under etc/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recon tests each machine defined
in bhost by attempting to execute on it the tkill(1) command
using its &quot;pretend&quot; option (no action is taken).
This test, if successful, indi&acirc; <br>
cates that all the requirements listed above are met, and
thus LAM can be started on the machine. If the attempt is
successful, the next machine is checked. In case the attempt
<br>
fails, a descriptive error message is displayed and recon
stops unless the -a option is used, in which case recon
continues checking the remaining machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If recon takes a long time to
finish successfully, this will be a good indication to the
user that the LAM system to be started has slow
communication links or heavily loaded <br>
machines, and it might be preferable to exclude or replace
some of the machines in the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSI (System Services Interface)
<br>
The -ssi switch allows the passing of parameters to various
SSI modules. LAM&rsquo;s SSI modules are described in detail
in lamssi(7). SSI modules have direct impact on MPI programs
<br>
because they allow tunable parameters to be set at run time
(such as which boot device driver to use, what parameters to
pass to that driver, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -ssi switch takes two
arguments: key and value. The key argument generally
specifies which SSI module will receive the value. For
example, the key &quot;boot&quot; is used to select <br>
which RPI to be used for starting processes on remote nodes.
The value argument is the value that is passed. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recon -ssi boot tm <br>
Tells LAM to use the &quot;tm&quot; boot module for native
launching in PBSPro / OpenPBS environments (the tm boot
module does not require a boot schema).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recon -ssi boot rsh -ssi
rsh_agent &quot;ssh -x&quot; boot_file <br>
Tells LAM to use the &quot;rsh&quot; boot module, and tells
the rsh module to use &quot;ssh -x&quot; as the specific
agent to launch executables on remote nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And so on. LAM&rsquo;s boot SSI
modules are described in lamssi_boot(7). This page should be
consulted for specific actions that are taken by, and how to
tweak the run-time behavior <br>
of each boot module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -ssi switch can be used
multiple times to specify different key and/or value
arguments. If the same key is specified more than once, the
values are concatenated with a comma <br>
(&quot;,&quot;) separating them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the -ssi switch is
simply a shortcut for setting environment variables. The
same effect may be accomplished by setting corresponding
environment variables before run&acirc; <br>
ning lamboot. The form of the environment variables that LAM
sets are: LAM_MPI_SSI_key=value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the -ssi switch
overrides any previously set environment variables. Also
note that unknown key arguments are still set as environment
variable -- they are not checked <br>
(by lamwipe) for correctness. Illegal or incorrect value
arguments may or may not be reported -- it depends on the
specific SSI module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remote Executable Invocation
<br>
All tweakable aspects of launching executables on remote
nodes during recon are discussed in lamssi(7) and
lamssi_boot(7). Topics include (but are not limited to):
discovery of <br>
remote shell, run-time overrides of the agent use to launch
remote executables (e.g., rsh and ssh), etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
laminstalldir/etc/lam-bhost.def default boot schema file,
where &quot;laminstalldir&quot; is the directory where
LAM/MPI was installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
recon -v mynodes <br>
Check if LAM can be started on all the UNIX machines
described in the boot schema mynodes. Report about important
steps as they are done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recon -v -a <br>
Check if LAM can be started on all the UNIX machines
described in the default boot schema. Report about important
steps as they are done. Check all the machines; do not <br>
stop after the first error message.</p>
