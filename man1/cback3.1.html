<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cback3 - Local and remote backups to CD or DVD media or
Amazon S3 storage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cback3 [switches] action(s)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The cback3 script provides the command-line interface for
Cedar Backup 3. Cedar Backup 3 is a software package
designed to manage system backups for a pool of local and
remote <br>
machines. It understands how to back up filesystem data as
well as MySQL and PostgreSQL databases and Subversion
repositories. It can also be easily extended to support
other <br>
kinds of data sources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cedar Backup 3 is focused around
weekly backups to a single CD or DVD disc, with the
expectation that the disc will be changed or overwritten at
the beginning of each week. If <br>
your hardware is new enough, Cedar Backup can write
multisession discs, allowing you to add incremental data to
a disc on a daily basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternately, Cedar Backup 3 can
write your backups to the Amazon S3 cloud rather than
relying on physical media.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BACKUP CONCEPTS <br>
There are two kinds of machines in a Cedar Backup pool. One
machine (the master) has a CD or DVD writer on it and is
where the backup is written to disc. The others (clients)
<br>
collect data to be written to disc by the master.
Collectively, the master and client machines in a pool are
all referred to as peer machines. There are four actions
that take <br>
place as part of the backup process: collect, stage, store
and purge. Both the master and the clients execute the
collect and purge actions, but only the master executes the
<br>
stage and store actions. The configuration file
/etc/cback3.conf controls the actions taken during the
collect, stage, store and purge actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cedar Backup also supports the
concept of managed clients. Managed clients have their
entire backup process managed by the master via a remote
shell. The same actions are run <br>
as part of the backup process, but the master controls when
the actions are executed on the clients rather than the
clients controlling it for themselves. This facility is <br>
intended for use in environments where a scheduler like cron
is not available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIGRATING FROM VERSION 2 TO
VERSION 3 <br>
The main difference between Cedar Backup version 2 and Cedar
Backup version 3 is the targeted Python interpreter. Cedar
Backup version 2 was designed for Python 2, while version
<br>
3 is a conversion of the original code to Python 3. Other
than that, both versions are functionally equivalent. The
configuration format is unchanged, and you can mix-and-match
<br>
masters and clients of different versions in the same backup
pool. Both versions will be fully supported until around the
time of the Python 2 end-of-life in 2020, but you <br>
should plan to migrate sooner than that if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A major design goal for version
3 was to facilitate easy migration testing for users, by
making it possible to install version 3 on the same server
where version 2 was already in <br>
use. A side effect of this design choice is that all of the
executables, configuration files, and logs changed names in
version 3. Where version 2 used cback, version 3 uses <br>
cback3: cback3.conf instead of cback.conf, cback3.log
instead of cback.log, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So, while migrating from version
2 to version 3 is relatively straightforward, you will have
to make some changes manually. You will need to create a new
configuration file (or <br>
soft link to the old one), modify your cron jobs to use the
new executable name, etc. You can migrate one server at a
time in your pool with no ill effects, or even
incremen&acirc; <br>
tally migrate a single server by using version 2 and version
3 on different days of the week or for different parts of
the backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SWITCHES <br>
-h, --help <br>
Display usage/help listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Display version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --verbose <br>
Print verbose output to the screen as well writing to the
logfile. When this option is enabled, most information that
would normally be written to the logfile will also be <br>
written to the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Run quietly (display no output to the screen).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --config <br>
Specify the path to an alternate configuration file. The
default configuration file is /etc/cback3.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --full <br>
Perform a full backup, regardless of configuration. For the
collect action, this means that any existing information
related to incremental backups will be ignored and <br>
rewritten; for the store action, this means that a new disc
will be started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --managed <br>
Include managed clients when executing actions. If the
action being executed is listed as a managed action for a
managed client, execute the action on that client after <br>
executing the action locally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --managed-only <br>
Include only managed clients when executing actions. If the
action being executed is listed as a managed action for a
managed client, execute the action on that client, <br>
but do not execute the action locally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --logfile <br>
Specify the path to an alternate logfile. The default
logfile file is /var/log/cback3.log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --owner <br>
Specify the ownership of the logfile, in the form
user:group. The default ownership is root:adm, to match the
Debian standard for most logfiles. This value will only be
<br>
used when creating a new logfile. If the logfile already
exists when the cback3 script is executed, it will retain
its existing ownership and mode. Only user and group <br>
names may be used, not numeric uid and gid values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mode <br>
Specify the permissions for the logfile, using the numeric
mode as in chmod(1). The default mode is 640 (-rw-r-----).
This value will only be used when creating a new <br>
logfile. If the logfile already exists when the cback3
script is executed, it will retain its existing ownership
and mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --output <br>
Record some sub-command output to the logfile. When this
option is enabled, all output from system commands will be
logged. This might be useful for debugging or just for <br>
reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debug <br>
Write debugging information to the logfile. This option
produces a high volume of output, and would generally only
be needed when debugging a problem. This option implies <br>
the --output option, as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --stack <br>
Dump a Python stack trace instead of swallowing exceptions.
This forces Cedar Backup to dump the entire Python stack
trace associated with an error, rather than just pro&acirc;
<br>
gating last message it received back up to the user
interface. Under some circumstances, this is useful
information to include along with a bug report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --diagnostics <br>
Display runtime diagnostic information and then exit. This
diagnostic information is often useful when filing a bug
report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACTIONS <br>
all Take all normal actions (collect, stage, store, purge),
in that order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">collect <br>
Take the collect action, creating tarfiles for each
directory specified in the collect section of the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stage Take the stage action,
copying tarfiles from each peer in the backup pool to the
daily staging directory, based on the stage section of the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">store Take the store action,
writing the daily staging directory to disc based on the
store section of the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">purge Take the purge action,
removing old and outdated files as specified in the purge
section of the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rebuild <br>
The rebuild action attempts to rebuild &quot;this
week&rsquo;s&quot; disc from any remaining unpurged staging
directories. Typically, it is used to make a copy of a
backup, replace lost <br>
or damaged media, or to switch to new media mid-week for
some other reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">validate <br>
Ensure that configuration is valid, but take no other
action. Validation checks that the configuration file can be
found and can be parsed, and also checks for typical <br>
configuration problems, such as directories that are not
writable or problems with the target SCSI device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
Cedar Backup returns 0 (zero) upon normal completion, and
six other error codes related to particular errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 The Python interpreter version
is &lt; 3.4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Error processing command-line
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Error configuring logging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 Error parsing indicated
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 Backup was interrupted with a
CTRL-C or similar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6 Error executing specified
backup actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The script is designed to run as root, since otherwise
it&rsquo;s difficult to back up system directories or write
the CD or DVD device. However, pains are taken to switch to
a backup <br>
user (specified in configuration) when appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use the script, you must
specify at least one action to take. More than one of the
&quot;collect&quot;, &quot;stage&quot;, &quot;store&quot; or
&quot;purge&quot; actions may be specified, in any arbitrary
order. <br>
The &quot;all&quot;, &quot;rebuild&quot; or
&quot;validate&quot; actions may not be combined with other
actions. If more than one action is specified, then actions
will be taken in a sensible order (gener&acirc; <br>
ally collect, followed by stage, followed by store, followed
by purge).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have configured any Cedar
Backup extensions, then the actions associated with those
extensions may also be specified on the command line. If you
specify any other actions <br>
along with an extended action, the actions will be executed
in a sensible order per configuration. However, the
&quot;all&quot; action never executes extended actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that there is no facility
for restoring backups. It is assumed that the user can deal
with copying tarfiles off disc and using them to restore
missing files as needed. The <br>
user manual provides detailed instructions in Appendix
C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, you should be aware
that backups to CD or DVD can probably be read by any user
which has permissions to mount the CD or DVD drive. If you
intend to leave the backup <br>
disc in the drive at all times, you may want to consider
this when setting up device permissions on your machine. You
might also want to investigate the encrypt extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/cback3.conf - Default configuration file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/log/cback3.log - Default
log file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
There probably are bugs in this code. However, it is in
active use for my own backups, and I fix problems as I
notice them. If you find a bug, please report it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If possible, give me the output
from --diagnostics, all of the error messages that the
script printed into its log, and also any stack-traces
(exceptions) that Python printed. <br>
It would be even better if you could tell me how to
reproduce the problem, for instance by sending me your
configuration file.</p>
