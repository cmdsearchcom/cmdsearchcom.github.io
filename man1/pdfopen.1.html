<p>PDFOPEN(1) PDFOPEN(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pdfopen, pdfclose - open or close a PDF file viewer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pdfopen [ options ] [ --file ] file.pdf <br>
pdfclose [ --file ] file.pdf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h, --help, -? <br>
output help and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version, -V <br>
output the version number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p &lt;n&gt;, --page &lt;n&gt;
<br>
when starting the viewer, display page &lt;n&gt; of the
document (notes: not all viewers support this feature, and
even in those cases this option only has effect when the
doc&acirc; <br>
ument is initially loaded). This option is over-ridden by
-g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g &lt;named destination&gt;,
--goto &lt;named destination&gt; <br>
when starting the viewer, display the page of the document
containing the named destination (notes: not all viewers
support this feature, and even in those cases this <br>
option only has effect when the document is initially
loaded).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --reset_focus <br>
after sending commands to the PDF viewer, attempt to reset
the input focus to the window which had focus before the
commands were sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-viewer, --viewer
&lt;ar9|ar9-tab|ar8|ar7|ar5|xpdf|evince&gt; <br>
use (respectively) Adobe Reader 9 (in a new window), Adobe
Reader 9 (in a new tab of a running AR9, if any), Adobe
Reader 8, Adobe Reader 7, Adobe Reader 5, xpdf or <br>
evince as the PDF viewer program. Adobe Reader 9 (in a new
window) is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
At certain points of TeX document preparation, many people
repeat a &quot;edit-compile-view&quot; cycle. Since PDF
viewers such as Adobe&rsquo;s Acrobat Reader
(&quot;acroread&quot;) do not automatically <br>
refresh the display when the PDF file changes, this cycle
can be more cumbersome than desired. The pdfopen program
provides the ability to automate the reloading of the PDF
doc&acirc; <br>
ument when it is changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: there seems to be little
need for pdfclose under GNU/Linux, since (unlike the
situation for MS windows) acroread does not lock the PDF
file, which would prevent pdftex (or <br>
a DVI to PDF converter) from creating a new version of the
PDF output file. However, pdfclose is provided in case
someone finds it useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pdfopen searches for an instance of the specified (or
default) PDF viewer displaying the specified PDF file. If
there is already an instance of the given viewer displaying
the <br>
given file, the viewer is instructed to reload the file. If
no such instance is found, pdfopen attempts to run the
specified viewer on the specified document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default viewer is
&quot;acroread&quot;, which could start any one of a number
of versions of Acrobat Reader, depending on what is
installed on your system. However, the commands to <br>
reload the current document vary from one version of
acroread to another; consequently, if you are using a
version of acroread other than AR9, you should explicitly
specify the <br>
viewer program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This version of pdfopen accepts
the following viewer options: <br>
ar9, ar9-tab, ar8, ar7, ar5, xpdf, and evince. <br>
The difference between ar9 and ar9-tab is significant when
there is no instance of AR9 already displaying the requested
document. In this situation, while ar9 will request <br>
acroread to create a new instance of acroread (and thus open
a new window) by using the -openInNewInstance argument,
ar9-tab starts acroread without this argument; if there is
<br>
already an instance of acroread running, a new tab will be
opened in an existing window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdfclose searches for one of the
above PDF viewers displaying the given file and instructs
the viewer to &quot;close&quot; the window. In most cases,
the PDF viewer continues to run, pos&acirc; <br>
sibly now displaying just a blank window. (This behaviour
varies somewhat from one PDF viewer to another.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PORTABILITY AND AVAILABILITY
<br>
These programs have been tested on Slackware64 Version 14.1
and a few other versions / distributions of GNU/Linux. The
code is reasonably generic and should work out of the box
<br>
using most recent X11 implementations. (Reports to the
contrary are welcome, particularly if they come with robust
fixes.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These programs are designed for
X11-based systems. If you somehow find compiled versions of
these programs on a system using another window system, they
are very unlikely to be <br>
of any use to you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Source and binaries of the
programs can be downloaded from CTAN://support/xpdfopen/
(e.g., http://mirror.ctan.org/support/xpdfopen).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
If you use ar9-tab to reload the PDF document and the
instance of acroread with the given document is currently
displaying some other document, the command causes your
document <br>
to be displayed, but not reloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdfopen works by looking for a
window with a name (window title) matching that expected for
the given viewer and document. If for some reason your
viewer&rsquo;s window name is not as <br>
expected, pdfopen may not work for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With at least AR9 and some
window managers, using pdfopen to reload the document gives
focus to the acroread window, even though the mouse cursor
is not necessarily in that win&acirc; <br>
dow. This can be annoying. The -reset_focus option can be
used to deal with this problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
This manual page was written by Jim Diamond
&lt;Jim.Diamond@acadiau.ca&gt;. I am the current maintainer
of the X11 versions of pdfopen and pdfclose. Report any bugs
you find to me. <br>
Feature enhancement requests are welcome, coded enhancements
even more so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Past authors: Fabrice Popineau
wrote the MS-windows versions of pdfopen and pdfclose upon
which these programs were originally based. Taco Hoekwater
created the GNU/Linux ver&acirc; <br>
sions, up to Version 0.61 (including some documentation
which inspired parts of this man page). Peter Breitenlohner
has contributed both code and suggestions to versions later
<br>
than 0.61.</p>
