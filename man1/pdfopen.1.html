<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="selflink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
At certain points of TeX document preparation, many people repeat a
  &quot;edit-compile-view&quot; cycle. Since PDF viewers such as Adobe's Acrobat
  Reader (&quot; <b>acroread</b>&quot;) do not automatically refresh the display
  when the PDF file changes, this cycle can be more cumbersome than desired. The
  <b>pdfopen</b> program provides the ability to automate the reloading of the
  PDF document when it is changed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note: there seems to be little need for <b>pdfclose</b> under GNU/Linux, since
  (unlike the situation for MS windows) <b>acroread</b> does not lock the PDF
  file, which would prevent <b>pdftex</b> (or a DVI to PDF converter) from
  creating a new version of the PDF output file. However, <b>pdfclose</b> is
  provided in case someone finds it useful.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>pdfopen</b> searches for an instance of the specified (or default) PDF viewer
  displaying the specified PDF file. If there is already an instance of the
  given viewer displaying the given file, the viewer is instructed to reload the
  file. If no such instance is found, <b>pdfopen</b> attempts to run the
  specified viewer on the specified document.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The default viewer is &quot; <b>acroread</b>&quot;, which could start any one of
  a number of versions of Acrobat Reader, depending on what is installed on your
  system. However, the commands to reload the current document vary from one
  version of <b>acroread</b> to another; consequently, if you are using a
  version of <b>acroread</b> other than AR9, you should explicitly specify the
  viewer program.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This version of <b>pdfopen</b> accepts the following viewer options:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<i>ar9</i>, <i>ar9-tab</i>, <i>ar8</i>, <i>ar7</i>, <i>ar5</i>, <i>xpdf</i>, and
  <i>evince</i>.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The difference between <i>ar9</i> and <i>ar9-tab</i> is significant when there
  is no instance of AR9 already displaying the requested document. In this
  situation, while <i>ar9</i> will request <b>acroread</b> to create a new
  instance of <b>acroread</b> (and thus open a new window) by using the
  <b>-openInNewInstance</b> argument, <i>ar9-tab</i> starts <b>acroread</b>
  without this argument; if there is already an instance of <b>acroread</b>
  running, a new tab will be opened in an existing window.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>pdfclose</b> searches for one of the above PDF viewers displaying the given
  file and instructs the viewer to &quot;close&quot; the window. In most cases,
  the PDF viewer continues to run, possibly now displaying just a blank window.
  (This behaviour varies somewhat from one PDF viewer to another.)

These programs have been tested on Slackware64 Version 14.1 and a few other
  versions / distributions of GNU/Linux. The code is reasonably generic and
  should work out of the box using most recent X11 implementations. (Reports to
  the contrary are welcome, particularly if they come with robust fixes.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
These programs are designed for X11-based systems. If you somehow find compiled
  versions of these programs on a system using another window system, they are
  very unlikely to be of any use to you.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Source and binaries of the programs can be downloaded from
  CTAN://support/xpdfopen/ (e.g., http://mirror.ctan.org/support/xpdfopen).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CAVEATS"><a class="selflink" href="#CAVEATS">CAVEATS</a></h1>
If you use <i>ar9-tab</i> to reload the PDF document and the instance of
  <b>acroread</b> with the given document is currently displaying some other
  document, the command causes your document to be displayed, but not reloaded.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>pdfopen</b> works by looking for a window with a name (window title) matching
  that expected for the given viewer and document. If for some reason your
  viewer's window name is not as expected, <b>pdfopen</b> may not work for you.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
With at least AR9 and some window managers, using <b>pdfopen</b> to reload the
  document gives focus to the <b>acroread</b> window, even though the mouse
  cursor is not necessarily in that window. This can be annoying. The
  <b>-reset_focus</b> option can be used to deal with this problem.

This manual page was written by Jim Diamond &lt;Jim.Diamond@acadiau.ca&gt;. I am
  the current maintainer of the X11 versions of <b>pdfopen</b> and
  <b>pdfclose</b>. Report any bugs you find to me. Feature enhancement requests
  are welcome, coded enhancements even more so.

Past authors: Fabrice Popineau wrote the MS-windows versions of <b>pdfopen</b>
  and <b>pdfclose</b> upon which these programs were originally based. Taco
  Hoekwater created the GNU/Linux versions, up to Version 0.61 (including some
  documentation which inspired parts of this man page). Peter Breitenlohner has
  contributed both code and suggestions to versions later than 0.61.</div>
