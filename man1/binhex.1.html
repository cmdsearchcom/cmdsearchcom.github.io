<p>BINHEX(1) General Commands Manual BINHEX(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
binhex - Hexifies a series of files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
binhex [ - options ] [ files ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
binhex takes the files specified in files and hexifies them
in BinHex 4.0 format on standard output subject to the
options specified. If files also specifies directories they
<br>
are followed recursively, and all files found will be
hexified. If no files parameter is specified, binhex reads a
MacBinary stream from standard input and hexifies the files
<br>
found; folder information is lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
In the absence of any options, binhex takes the specified
files and silently hexifies them to BinHex 4.0 format,
writing the result to standard output. Directories named in
<br>
files are followed recursively, all files found will be
hexified. Files are assumed to be in MacBinary format.
However, if the filename ends with .info the file is assumed
to <br>
be the info fork of a MacIntosh file split amongst more than
one file. In that case the files with .data and .rsrc
extensions are also read (if present). Also, if the info
fork <br>
is mentioned in the parameter list, the names of data and
resource forks can also be mentioned, but those will be
ignored (this is to allow wild-card expansion by the shell.)
<br>
Further, if some form of AppleShare is supported by the
installed program, and if the current directory, or one of
the directories found during recursive processing, is a
direc&acirc; <br>
tory in the format of the supported version of AppleShare,
those files will be handled according to the properties of
AppleShare.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r No intelligent
file-processing is performed; all files named are assumed to
be plain resource files, and are hexified as if they were
MacIntosh resource files with creator <br>
&quot;RSED&quot; and type &quot;RSRC&quot;, unless another
creator and/or type are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d No intelligent
file-processing is performed; all files named are assumed to
be plain data files, and are hexified as if they were
MacIntosh data files with creator &quot;MACA&quot; <br>
and type &quot;TEXT&quot;, unless another creator and/or
type are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u As -d, but the codes for CR
and LF are interchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Is a synonym for -u.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c creator <br>
Defines the creator name to be used if one of the previous
options is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t type <br>
Defines the type name to be used if one of the previous
options is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Do not use run-length
encoding during the conversion. This option may speed up the
encoding a bit, but it is merely a historical artifact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l List every file and directory
processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Do not output files, give
information only (implies -l.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Ask the user for every
file/directory whether it should be visited (implies
-l.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Gives the patchlevel of the
program, and other information. Other options are ignored
and the program quits immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Give short information about
the options. Other options are ignored and the program quits
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
As this is a beta release, there may still be some
problems.</p>
