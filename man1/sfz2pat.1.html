<p>sfz2pat(1) General Commands Manual sfz2pat(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sz2pat - convert sample files into extended GUS patches</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sfz2pat filename.sfz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This documents both the conversion program sfz2pat and the
sfz loader of the gt midi player.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of one or more .wav
files containing samples and various parameters describing
the desired patch structure and how to play the patch are
given in a text file with the <br>
extension .sfz. Run the sfz2pat utility on filename.sfz,
and, if all goes well, the result will be a GUS patch file
named filename.pat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same .sfz file can be loaded
and played directly by gt. Just put the name of the file
into timidity.cfg or a file it sources, as you would the
name of a GUS .pat file. Some <br>
features of sfz patches can only be used when the patch is
loaded directly, because they don&rsquo;t fit into the GUS
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of .sfz files is
described in http://www.rgcaudio.com/sfzformat.htm. See also
http://www.drealm.org.uk/sfz/plj-sfz.html a more lucid, less
authoritative, account <br>
(from PL Jones). An .sfz patch file is a text file
describing a single instrument, as implemented here. (Though
a whole set of drums can be characterized in a single .sfz
file <br>
for RGC Audio&rsquo;s player program, this implementation
requires a separate patch file for each drum.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typically, an instrument will
have a number of different samples, and which sample sounds
when a note on that instrument is played will depend on
various circumstances -- the <br>
pitch of the note, how loud it is, and so on. A sample
thought of in relation to whether it sounds when a note is
played is referred to as a layer in the RGC documentation,
but <br>
I usually call it a sample. Each individual sample (layer)
of an instrument is described in a region of the .sfz patch
file (see the &lt;region&gt; opcode below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only a very tiny, little,
miniscule part of SFZ is currently interpreted. SFZ opcodes
in the .sfz file that are not yet implemented are ignored.
Those that are interpreted may <br>
or may not work exactly as specified in the RGC Audio
documentation (or as described here).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .pat files that are created
are GUS extended patch files, so they can have velocity
layers and can be in stereo. If the source .wav file is in
stereo, the extended GUS patch <br>
derived from it will also be in stereo. In addition to .wav
files, you can also use .aiff and .ogg files for samples.
24-bit .wav files are ok, but for GUS patches, they are <br>
down-converted to 16 bits, so the extra resolution is lost.
When loading patches directly, all 24 bits are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPCODES <br>
Here are the opcodes currently intepreted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;group&gt; <br>
Beginning of global opcodes that apply thoughout following
regions, until the next &lt;group&gt; or end of file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;region&gt; <br>
Beginning of local opcodes that apply only until the next
&lt;region&gt;, or &lt;group&gt; or end of file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sample=filename <br>
Gives path of a file containing sample data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key=k Note to play. k is a
number 0-127 or an IPN note name (letter A-G, optional # or
b, then octave from -1 to 9), and likewise below for all
values referred to as k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hikey=k <br>
Highest key of range. Default is 60.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lokey=k <br>
Lowest key of range. Default is 60.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pitch_keycenter=k <br>
Middle key of range. Default is 60.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hivel=v <br>
Highest velocity of range. v is a number 0-127. Default is
127.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lovel=v <br>
Highest velocity of range. v is a number 0-127. Default is
0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">offset=n <br>
Where patch starts in sample file, in samples from the
beginning of the file. Default is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">end=n Where patch ends in sample
file, in samples. Default is the end of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loop_start=n <br>
Where the loop start point of patch is in sample file, in
samples. Default is the offset of the sample.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loop_end=n <br>
Where the loop end point of patch is in sample file, in
samples. Default is the end of the sample.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loop_mode=loop_sustain <br>
Makes the sample loop while note is held. Default is no
loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">volume=f <br>
How loud to play the sample, in decibels. Default is 0
decibel change to what is found in the sample file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">amp_random=f <br>
The sample is amplified by a randomly selected amount from 0
to f, given in decibels. (This has no effect when creating
.pat files.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ampeg_release=f <br>
Release time for the volume envelope, in seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">group=n <br>
Defines the group the sample belongs to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">off_by=n <br>
The sample will stop playing when a note from group n is
started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trigger=first <br>
The sample will be played only if no other note in the same
group (and on the same channel) is playing. (This has no
effect when creating .pat files.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trigger=legato <br>
The sample will be played only if another note in the same
group (and on the same channel) is playing. (This has no
effect when creating .pat files.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hirand=f <br>
The sample plays only when a randomly selected number
between 0 and 1 is less than f. (This has no effect when
creating .pat files.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lorand=f <br>
The sample plays only when a randomly selected number
between 0 and 1 is greater or equal to f. (This has no
effect when creating .pat files.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sw_hikey=k <br>
Highest key in switch range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sw_lokey=k <br>
Lowest key in switch range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sw_down=k <br>
The sample will play only if note k is playing (on the same
channel), provided it falls within the switch range. (This
has no effect when creating .pat files.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sw_up=k <br>
The sample will not play if note k is playing (on the same
channel), provided it falls within the switch range. (This
has no effect when creating .pat files.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Probably, there are lots of bugs. This is an experiment.</p>
