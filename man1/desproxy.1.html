HTTP proxies are network servers that are used to give HTTP (web) access to
  computers that are not connected to the Internet. This is a typical scenario
  in corporate networks and recently in home networks too. HTTP proxies connect
  to the Internet either directly or via a parent proxy (which in fact connects
  to the Internet directly or via another parent proxy, and so on...)
<div class="Pp"></div>
HTTP clients (web browsers) use HTTP proxies to request web pages; the HTTP
  server just forwards those request to the destination server. All the
  negotiation is done via the HTTP protocol, which is designed just to carry
  HTTP requests and no generic (TCP/IP) traffic. That is why you can't
  (normally) use Internet applications beside your web server if you are behind
  a HTTP proxy.
<div class="Pp"></div>
That is what desproxy is good for. Desproxy is a TCP tunnel, which means
  desproxy can forward TCP/IP traffic via a HTTP proxy. Desproxy uses a HTTP/1.1
  method (CONNECT) to establish TCP/IP connections on demand. CONNECT is used
  for SSL connections when accessing to secure sites, so if you can access sites
  that support SSL (www.hotmail.com for example) you can use desproxy.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Not all IP (Internet) traffic is just TCP/IP. In fact there are two more
  protocols widely used in the Internet not supported by desproxy: UDP and ICMP:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">ICMP is used to manage large IP networks. The only
      application using ICMP you may miss is ping.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">UDP is an unreliable connection-less fast transport
      protocol, mostly used in network games and other applications that need
      low latency network traffic. Notably DNS uses UDP packets for fast
      delivery.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Will_desproxy_work_with_my_HTTP_proxy?"><a class="selflink" href="#Will_desproxy_work_with_my_HTTP_proxy?">Will
  desproxy work with my HTTP proxy?</a></h2>
Short answer: just give it a try
<div class="Pp"></div>
Long answer: desproxy should work with every HTTP proxy, with the following
  exceptions:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">MS Proxies with NTLM authentication. NTLM is a proprietary
      authentication method from Microsoft, not a standard authentication
      method. Maybe in the future desproxy will support NTLM authentication, but
      currently it doesn't.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">HTTP/1.0 Proxies. Desproxy needs the CONNECT method, which
      is only available from HTTP/1.1 protocol version. It's very unlikely your
      proxy doesn't accept HTTP/1.1 requests.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">HTTP/1.1 Proxies without the CONNECT method. Maybe your
      network administrator deactivated CONNECT support in the proxy, or maybe
      CONNECT is restricted to the HTTPS port (443).</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Assumptions"><a class="selflink" href="#Assumptions">Assumptions</a></h2>
Let's assume the following:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">your HTTP proxy host name is &quot;proxy&quot; and its

Imagine you need a network application that uses only one TCP/IP connection with
  just one server. That's the case of IRC in which you connect to an IRC server
  or ssh where you typically connect just to one UNIX computer at a time. That's
  what I called a &quot;static connection&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Of course that's not the case of a web browser or a file sharing program, both
  of them doing several connections at a time to different computers. That's
  what I call &quot;dynamic connections&quot;.

Suppose you want to connect to IRC using irc.undernet.org port 6667 as your IRC
  server. First you have to start a system console (see Assumptions above for
  details) and type
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    desproxy irc.undernet.org 6667 proxy 8080 1080
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
That should start desproxy, giving you the copyright notice along with some
  information. The following is a screen capture from desproxy 0.0.23
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    -----------------------------------
    desproxy                     0.0.23

    This release brought to you patched
    by Rutger Nijlunsig.
    See RutgerWork.txt in documentation
    for details about new features.
    Great work guy!
    -----------------------------------
    TCP port 1080 Binded &amp; Listening
    Press ENTER to Quit
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Desproxy reports it is listening in local port 1080 ready for a connection.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Open your favourite IRC client (install it first ;D) and connect to 127.0.0.1
  port 1080 as your irc server (127.0.0.1 is a virtual IP, always referencing to
  your local machine). Then, your IRC client should connect to desproxy. It
  looks like
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    Connection request from 127.0.0.1, port 1220
    Connecting to http proxy (proxy:8080)
    Bidirectional connection established
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then you should be able to use your IRC client as if you were directly connected
  to irc.undernet.org.

Suppose you have a shell account in a computer that supports secure connections
  via ssh. Let's assume it's called shell.corporate.com. SSH uses port number 22
  by default. So start a new system console and type:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   desproxy shell.corporate.com 22 proxy 8080 1080
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then, tell your ssh client to connect to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 1080 and you
  should get a ssh password prompt!

Let's assume you want to use network application X, which doesn't support HTTP
  proxies but use one TCP/IP connection (like IRC and SSH). To make X work with
  desproxy, you just have to 1) Search for the default port of that application
  2) Search for the default server of that application and 3) Start desproxy,
  passing that info as command line parameters. Format is
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    desproxy remote_host remote_port proxy_host proxy_port local_port
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Just give a local_port of your desire, but always over 1023, cause lower ports
  may need administrator privileges.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="About_HTTP_Authentication"><a class="selflink" href="#About_HTTP_Authentication">About
  HTTP Authentication</a></h2>
Some HTTP proxies need for security reasons a method of checking client's
  identity. That's called HTTP authentication (or HTTP authorization).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Despoxy now supports Basic HTTP authentication. If your proxy needs other kind
  of authentication (either Digest or NTLM) desproxy won't work.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For desproxy to work with a HTTP proxy that needs authentication, you have to
  tell desproxy which username and password to use. Desproxy reads the
  environment variable PROXY_USER to get that info.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Suppose your proxy username is &quot;mayka&quot; and your proxy password is
  &quot;007sgotLTK&quot;. Then, before using any of the desproxy programs you
  should type this in your system console:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    set PROXY_USER=mayka:007sgotLTK
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Beware passwords can include some characters that should be escaped from the
  system console. For example, if your password is &quot;moon!=sun&quot;, and
  you are running Linux, you should type
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    export PROXY_USER=yourusername:moon\!\=sun
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note characters &quot;!&quot; and &quot;=&quot; are escaped using the backslash
  &quot;\&quot;. If you are running MS Windows, as long as I know, you don't
  have to escape any valid password character.
<div class="Pp"></div>

A normal desproxy session looks like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $ desproxy 127.0.0.1 21 127.0.0.1 4480 2222
    -----------------------------------
    desproxy                  &lt;version&gt;
    HTTP/1.1
    (c) Miguelanxo Otero Salgueiro 2001
    -----------------------------------
    Listening on port 2222
    Connection request from 127.0.0.1, port 1227
    Connecting to http proxy (127.0.0.1:4480)
    Bidirectional connection stablished
    (127.0.0.1:21) &lt;-&gt; (localhost)
    End of connection.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here, a connection to local ftp server (127.0.0.1:21) is made by using local
  proxy (127.0.0.1:4480). You can see how, after the connection is accepted,
  desproxy connected to the proxy, interchanged some bytes (a FTP session) and
  terminates the connection.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Desproxy is quite self explanatory about errors. Desproxy-inetd is far more
  obscure, because the way inetd uses it (can't print error messages) to the
  console.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Basically there are two kind of errors:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Errors reported when connecting to the proxy: the http page
      showing the error is displayed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Every other error: a short error message is displayed.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some common HTTP errors (as reported by the proxy)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     * HTTP 400 Bad Request - Some versions of desproxy (0.0.21) cause
       this error (FATAL)
     * HTTP 403 Forbidden - Forbidden to do that (FATAL)
     * HTTP 404 Not Found - Page not found, or resource not found (MINOR)
     * HTTP 405 Method not Allowed - Can't do CONNECT method (FATAL)
     * HTTP 500 Internal Server Error - Maybe you're trying to connect to
       a remote closed port (remote site reported connection refused)
       (MINOR)
     * HTTP 503 Service Unavailable -&gt; The proxy can't reach the site
       (MINOR)
     * HTTP 505 HTTP Version Not Supported - CONNECT method not available
       (FATAL)
     * HTTP 502 Bad Gateway - Stands for &quot;DNS lookup error&quot; (MINOR)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(FATAL) - Forget about using desproxy, you can't surpass the proxy. (TODO) - To
  do, not yet implemented. (MINOR) - Temporary fault or maybe your fault.
