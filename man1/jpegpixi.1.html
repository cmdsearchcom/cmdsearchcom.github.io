<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
jpegpixi - interpolate pixels in JFIF (JPEG) image files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
jpegpixi [OPTION]... SOURCE DEST
[[D:]X,Y[,S]|[,SX,SY]]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Jpegpixi interpolates pixels or pixel blocks in JFIF images
files (commonly referred to as &quot;JPEG images&quot;).
This is useful to correct images from a digital camera with
CCD <br>
defects. Only DCT blocks which contain pixels to be
interpolated are decoded and re-encoded, and the re-encoding
is performed with exactly the same parameters with which the
<br>
image has originally been encoded. Therefore, the image
quality is preserved as much as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOURCE and DEST are the
filenames of the source file and the destination file,
respectively. In both cases, - can be used, which refers to
standard input or standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The destination filename is
followed by any number of pixel or pixel block
specifications. It starts with an optional direction
specifier (D), which can be 2 for 2-dimensional <br>
interpolation (the default), V or v for 1-dimensional
vertical interpolation (e.g. to remove horizontal stripes),
or H or h for 1-dimensional horizontal interpolation. X,Y
are <br>
the coordinates of the pixel or the upper-left corner of the
pixel block. S is the size of the pixel block (1 by
default). Alternatively, separate sizes can be specified for
the <br>
width (SX) and the height (SY).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All numbers (X, Y, S, SX, SY)
can be expressed as absolute coordinates/sizes or
percentages of the image size. If a number is followed by a
percent character (%), it is inter&acirc; <br>
preted as a percentage, otherwise as an absolute number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f FILE, --blocks-file=FILE <br>
Read pixel block specifications from file FILE in addition
to the command line. The file should contain one
specification ([D:]X,Y[,S]|[,SX,SY]) per line. Empty lines
are <br>
ignored. The file may also contain comments, which start
with an octothorpe (#) and extend to the end of the
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m METHOD, --method=METHOD <br>
Use interpolation method METHOD (default: linear). See
section INTERPOLATION METHODS below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Display the coordinates and size of each pixel block that is
interpolated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --info <br>
Display information about the image, such as the size of the
image, the colorspace in which it is encoded, and sampling
rates for the different components.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --strip <br>
Do not copy comment and extra markers from the source to the
destination file. This strips preview images, EXIF data, and
similar information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Display a short help text
and exit immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Display version information and exit immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERPOLATION METHODS <br>
0, av, average <br>
The pixels adjacent to the pixel block are averaged. The
resulting color is assigned to all pixels in the block. For
1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately <br>
for one pixel wide, horizontal or vertical stripes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1, li, linear <br>
The pixels which have a distance of 1 from the pixel block
are used to calculate a bilinear surface (2-dim), or a group
of linear curves (1-dim), which is then used to <br>
assign colors to the pixels in the block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2, qu, quadratic <br>
The pixels which have a distance of 2 or less from the pixel
block are used to calculate a biquadratic surface (2-dim),
or a group of quadratic curves (1-dim), which is <br>
then used to assign colors to the pixels in the block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3, cu, cubic <br>
The pixels which have a distance of 3 or less from the pixel
block are used to calculate a bicubic surface (2-dim), or a
group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used <br>
to assign colors to the pixels in the block.</p>
