<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pammixinterlace - mix adjacent lines to merge interlaced
images</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pammixinterlace</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-filter={linear, fir,
ffmpeg}]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-adaptive]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[infile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pammixinterlace is meant to
operate on an image which is the interlacing of two images,
where raster rows 0, 2, 4, etc. are from one image and rows
1, 3, 5, etc. are from <br>
another. (See below for why you might expect to encounter
such an image).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pammixinterlace makes each row
of the output a mixture of the corresponding row of the
input and its two neighbors. It uses half of the main row
and a quarter each of the two <br>
neighbor rows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be useful if the image
is a video capture from an interlaced video source. In that
case, each row shows the subject 1/60 second before or after
the two rows that sur&acirc; <br>
round it. If the subject is moving, this can detract from
the quality of the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In video data streams, you often
find each frame contains only half the rows of the image --
the odd half or the even half. The displayer of the stream
displays the rows in <br>
their proper positions on a CRT as they come in. When you
display the rows in this order, the CRT has less flicker
because a particular area of the screen gets refreshed twice
<br>
as often. In the process of capturing such a stream,
computers often generate the interlaced image of the type
that pammixinterlace works with. But this interlaced image,
when <br>
displayed on a CRT, does not look the same as if a displayer
were rendering the stream directly on a CRT as it arrived,
because of the timing of when the various pixels get drawn
<br>
and subsequently fade. That&rsquo;s why you need something
like pammixinterlace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may prefer the effect of
simply extracting one of two images. You can do that with
pamdeinterlace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-filter={linear,fir,ffmpeg} <br>
This option chooses between one of the three filtering
mechanisms. linear is a linear-blend formula. fir is a
size-5 FIR low-pass filter, and ffmpeg is a formula pulled
<br>
from the documentation of the program ffmpeg
&acirc;&uml;http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu&acirc;&copy; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is fir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-adaptive <br>
This option turns on &quot;adaptive&quot; filtering mode. In
this mode pammixinterlace modifies only pixels that are
obviously part of a &quot;comb&quot; pattern.</p>
