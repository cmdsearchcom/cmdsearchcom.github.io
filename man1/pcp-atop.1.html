<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The program <b>pcp-atop</b> is an interactive monitor to view various aspects of
  load on a system. It shows the occupation of the most critical hardware
  resources (from a performance point of view) on system level, i.e. cpu,
  memory, disk and network.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
It also shows which processes are responsible for the indicated load with
  respect to cpu and memory load on process level. Disk load is shown per
  process if &quot;storage accounting&quot; is active in the kernel.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Every <i>interval</i> (default: 10 seconds) information is shown about the
  resource occupation on system level (cpu, memory, disks and network layers),
  followed by a list of processes which have been active during the last
  interval (note that all processes that were unchanged during the last interval
  are not shown, unless the key 'a' has been pressed). If the list of active
  processes does not entirely fit on the screen, only the top of the list is
  shown (sorted in order of activity).
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The intervals are repeated till the number of <i>samples</i> (specified as
  command argument) is reached, or till the key 'q' is pressed in interactive
  mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When invoked via the <b>pcp</b>(1) command, the <b>PCPIntro</b>(1) options
  <b>-h</b>/<b>--host</b>, <b>-a</b>/<b>--archive</b>,
  <b>-O</b>/<b>--origin</b>, <b>-s</b>/<b>--samples</b>,
  <b>-t</b>/<b>--interval</b>, <b>-Z</b>/<b>--timezone</b> and several other
  <i>pcp options</i> become indirectly available.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When <b>pcp-atop</b> is started, it checks whether the standard output channel
  is connected to a screen, or to a file/pipe. In the first case it produces
  screen control codes (via the ncurses library) and behaves interactively; in
  the second case it produces flat ASCII-output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In interactive mode, the output of <b>pcp-atop</b> scales dynamically to the
  current dimensions of the screen/window.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
If the window is resized horizontally, columns will be added or removed
  automatically. For this purpose, every column has a particular weight. The
  columns with the highest weights that fit within the current width will be
  shown.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
If the window is resized vertically, lines of the process/thread list will be
  added or removed automatically.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Furthermore in interactive mode the output of <b>pcp-atop</b> can be controlled
  by pressing particular keys. However it is also possible to specify such key
  as <b>flag</b> on the command line. In that case <b>pcp-atop</b> switches to
  the indicated mode on beforehand; this mode can be modified again
  interactively. Specifying such key as flag is especially useful when running
  <b>pcp-atop</b> with output to a pipe or file (non-interactively). These flags
  are the same as the keys that can be pressed in interactive mode (see section
  INTERACTIVE COMMANDS).
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Additional flags are available to support storage of <b>pcp-atop</b> data in PCP
  archive format (see section PCP DATA STORAGE).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COLORS"><a class="selflink" href="#COLORS">COLORS</a></h1>
For the resource consumption on system level, <b>pcp-atop</b> uses colors to
  indicate that a critical occupation percentage has been (almost) reached. A
  critical occupation percentage means that is likely that this load causes a
  noticeable negative performance influence for applications using this
  resource. The critical percentage depends on the type of resource: e.g. the
  performance influence of a disk with a busy percentage of 80% might be more
  noticeable for applications/user than a CPU with a busy percentage of 90%.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Currently <b>pcp-atop</b> uses the following default values to calculate a
  weighted percentage per resource:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>&#x00A0;Processor</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A busy percentage of 90% or higher is considered
      `critical'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>&#x00A0;Disk</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A busy percentage of 70% or higher is considered
      `critical'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>&#x00A0;Network</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A busy percentage of 90% or higher for the load of an
      interface is considered `critical'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>&#x00A0;Memory</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">An occupation percentage of 90% is considered `critical'.
      Notice that this occupation percentage is the accumulated memory
      consumption of the kernel (including slab) and all processes; the memory
      for the page cache (`cache' and `buff' in the MEM-line) and the
      reclaimable part of the slab (`slrec`) is not implied!
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    If the number of pages swapped out (`swout' in the PAG-line) is larger than
      10 per second, the memory resource is considered `critical'. A value of at
      least 1 per second is considered `almost critical'.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    If the committed virtual memory exceeds the limit (`vmcom' and `vmlim' in
      the SWP-line), the SWP-line is colored due to overcommitting the
    system.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>&#x00A0;Swap</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">An occupation percentage of 80% is considered `critical'
      because swap space might be completely exhausted in the near future; it is
      not critical from a performance point-of-view.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
These default values can be modified in the configuration file (see separate
  man-page of pcp-atoprc).
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a resource exceeds its critical occupation percentage, the concerning
  values in the screen line are colored red by default.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
When a resource exceeded (default) 80% of its critical percentage (so it is
  almost critical), the concerning values in the screen line are colored cyan by
  default. This `almost critical percentage' (one value for all resources) can
  be modified in the configuration file (see separate man-page of pcp-atoprc).
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The default colors red and cyan can be modified in the configuration file as
  well (see separate man-page of pcp-atoprc).
<div class="Pp"></div>
With the key 'x' (or flag -x), the use of colors can be suppressed.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INTERACTIVE_COMMANDS"><a class="selflink" href="#INTERACTIVE_COMMANDS">INTERACTIVE
  COMMANDS</a></h1>
When running <b>pcp-atop</b> interactively (no output redirection), keys can be
  pressed to control the output. In general, lower case keys can be used to show
  other information for the active processes and upper case keys can be used to
  influence the sort order of the active process/thread list.

  DATA STORAGE</a></h1>
In order to store system and process level statistics for long-term analysis
  (e.g. to check the system load and the active processes running yesterday
  between 3:00 and 4:00 PM), <b>pcp-atop</b> can store the system and process
  level statistics in the PCP archive format, as an archive folio (see
  <b>mkaf</b>(1)).
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
By default only processes which have been active during the interval are stored
  in the raw file. When the flag <b>-a</b> is specified, all processes will be
  stored.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The interval (default: 10 seconds) and number of samples (default: infinite) can
  be passed as last arguments. Instead of the number of samples, the flag
  <b>-S</b> can be used to indicate that <b>pcp-atop</b> should finish anyhow
  before midnight.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A PCP archive can be read and visualized again with the flag <b>-r .</b> The
  argument is a comma-separated list of names, each of which may be the base
  name of an archive or the name of a directory containing one or more archives.
  If no argument is specified, the file
  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/HOST/YYYYMMDD</b> is opened for input (where
  <i>YYYYMMDD</i> are digits representing the current date, and HOST is the
  hostname of the machine being logged). If a filename is specified in the
  format YYYYMMDD (representing any valid date), the file
  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/HOST/YYYYMMDD</b> is opened. If a filename with the
  symbolic name <b>y</b> is specified, yesterday's daily logfile is opened (this
  can be repeated so 'yyyy' indicates the logfile of four days ago).
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The samples from the file can be viewed interactively by using the key 't' to
  show the next sample, the key 'T' to show the previous sample, the key 'b' to
  branch to a particular time or the key 'r' to rewind to the begin of the file.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
When output is redirected to a file or pipe, <b>pcp-atop</b> prints all samples
  in plain ASCII. The default line length is 80 characters in that case; with
  the flag <b>-L</b> followed by an alternate line length, more (or less)
  columns will be shown.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
With the flag <b>-b</b> (begin time) and/or <b>-e</b> (end time) followed by a
  time argument of the form HH:MM, a certain time period within the raw file can
  be selected.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OUTPUT_DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#OUTPUT_DESCRIPTION">OUTPUT
  DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The first sample shows the system level activity since boot (the elapsed time in
  the header shows the time since boot). Note that particular counters could
  have reached their maximum value (several times) and started by zero again, so
  do not rely on these figures.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For every sample <b>pcp-atop</b> first shows the lines related to system level
  activity. If a particular system resource has not been used during the
  interval, the entire line related to this resource is suppressed. So the
  number of system level lines may vary for each sample.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
After that a list is shown of processes which have been active during the last
  interval. This list is by default sorted on cpu consumption, but this order
  can be changed by the keys which are previously described.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If values have to be shown by <b>pcp-atop</b> which do not fit in the column
  width, another format is used. If e.g. a cpu-consumption of 233216
  milliseconds should be shown in a column width of 4 positions, it is shown as
  `233s' (in seconds). For large memory figures, another unit is chosen if the
  value does not fit (Mb instead of Kb, Gb instead of Mb, Tb instead of Gb,
  ...). For other values, a kind of exponent notation is used (value 123456789
  shown in a column of 5 positions gives 123e6).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OUTPUT_DESCRIPTION_-_SYSTEM_LEVEL"><a class="selflink" href="#OUTPUT_DESCRIPTION_-_SYSTEM_LEVEL">OUTPUT
  DESCRIPTION - SYSTEM LEVEL</a></h1>
The system level information consists of the following output lines:

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>PRC</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Process and thread level totals.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    This line contains the total cpu time consumed in system mode (`sys') and in

      (`#proc'), the total number of threads present at this moment in state
      `running' (`#trun'), `sleeping interruptible' (`#tslpi') and `sleeping

      the number of clone system calls (`clones'), and the number of processes
      that ended during the interval (`#exit') when process accounting is used.
      Instead of `#exit` the last column may indicate that process accounting

    In case of a multi-processor system, an additional line is shown for every
      individual processor (with `cpu' in lower case), sorted on activity.
      Inactive CPUs will not be shown by default. The lines showing the per-cpu
      occupation contain the cpu number in the last field.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Every line contains the percentage of cpu time spent in kernel mode by all
      active processes (`sys'), the percentage of cpu time consumed in user mode
      (`user') for all active processes (including processes running with a nice
      value larger than zero), the percentage of cpu time spent for interrupt
      handling (`irq') including softirq, the percentage of unused cpu time
      while no processes were waiting for disk-I/O (`idle'), and the percentage
      of unused cpu time while at least one process was waiting for disk-I/O
      (`wait').
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    In case of per-cpu occupation, the last column shows the cpu number and the
      wait percentage (`w') for that cpu. The number of lines showing the
      per-cpu occupation can be limited.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For virtual machines the steal-percentage is shown (`steal'), reflecting the
      percentage of cpu time stolen by other virtual machines running on the
      same hardware.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    For physical machines hosting one or more virtual machines, the
      guest-percentage is shown (`guest'), reflecting the percentage of cpu time
      used by the virtual machines. Notice that this percentage overlaps the
      user-percentage.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In case of frequency-scaling, all previously mentioned CPU-percentages are
      relative to the used scaling of the CPU during the interval. If a CPU has
      been active for e.g. 50% in user mode during the interval while the
      frequency-scaling of that CPU was 40%, only 20% of the full capacity of
      the CPU has been used in user mode.

    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    Every process shares resident memory with other processes. E.g. when a
      particular program is started several times, the code pages (text) are
      only loaded once in memory and shared by all incarnations. Also the code
      of shared libraries is shared by all processes using that shared library,
      as well as shared memory and memory-mapped files. For the PSIZE
      calculation of a process, the resident memory of a process that is shared
      with other processes is divided by the number of sharers. This means, that
      every process is accounted for a proportional part of that memory.
      Accumulating the PSIZE values of all processes in the system gives a
      reliable impression of the total resident memory consumed by all
      processes.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    Since gathering of all values that are needed to calculate the PSIZE is a
      relatively time-consuming task, the 'R' key (or '-R' flag) should be

With the flag <b>-P</b> followed by a list of one or more labels
  (comma-separated), parseable output is produced for each sample. The labels
  that can be specified for system-level statistics correspond to the labels
  (first verb of each line) that can be found in the interactive output:
  &quot;CPU&quot;, &quot;cpu&quot; &quot;CPL&quot; &quot;MEM&quot;,
  &quot;SWP&quot;, &quot;PAG&quot;, &quot;LVM&quot;, &quot;MDD&quot;,
  &quot;DSK&quot;, &quot;NFM&quot;, &quot;NFC&quot;, &quot;NFS&quot; and
  &quot;NET&quot;.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
For process-level statistics special labels are introduced: &quot;PRG&quot;
  (general), &quot;PRC&quot; (cpu), &quot;PRM&quot; (memory), &quot;PRD&quot;
  (disk, only if &quot;storage accounting&quot; is active) and &quot;PRN&quot;
  (network, only if the kernel module 'netatop' has been installed).
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
With the label &quot;ALL&quot;, all system and process level statistics are
  shown.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For every interval all requested lines are shown whereafter <b>pcp-atop</b>
  shows a line just containing the label &quot;SEP&quot; as a separator before
  the lines for the next sample are generated.

When a sample contains the values since boot, <b>pcp-atop</b> shows a line just
  containing the label &quot;RESET&quot; before the lines for this sample are
  generated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first part of each output-line consists of the following six fields:
  <b>label</b> (the name of the label), <b>host</b> (the name of this machine),
  <b>epoch</b> (the time of this interval as number of seconds since 1-1-1970),
