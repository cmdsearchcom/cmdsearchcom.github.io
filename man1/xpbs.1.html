<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xpbs - GUI front end to PBS commands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xpbs [-admin]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The xpbs command provides a user-friendly point-and-click
interface to PBS commands. Please see the sections below for
a tour and tutorials. Also, within every dialog box, a Help
<br>
button can be found for assistance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-admin A mode where additional buttons are made available
for terminating PBS servers,
starting/stopping/disabling/enabling queues, and
running/rerunning jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GETTING STARTED <br>
Running xpbs will initialize the X resource database from
various sources in the following order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The RESOURCE_MANAGER property
on the root window (updated via xrdb) with settings usually
defined in the .Xdefaults file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Preference settings defined
by the system administrator in the global xpbsrc file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. User&rsquo;s ~/.xpbsrc file -
this file defines various X resources like fonts, colors,
list of PBS hosts to query, criteria for listing queues and
jobs, and various view <br>
states. See PREFERENCES section below for a list of
resources that can be set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNNING XPBS <br>
To run xpbs as a regular, non-privileged user, type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setenv DISPLAY
&lt;display_host&gt;:0 <br>
xpbs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To run xpbs with the additional
purpose of terminating PBS servers, stopping and starting
queues, or running/rerunning jobs, then run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xpbs -admin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: Be sure to appropriately
set ~/.rhosts file if you&rsquo;re planning to submit jobs
to some remote server, and expecting output files to be
returned to the local host (where xpbs <br>
was run). Usually, adding the PBS hostname running the
server to your .rhosts file locally, and adding the name of
the local machine to the .rhosts file at remote host, should
<br>
be sufficient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, be sure that the PBS
client commands are in the default PATH because xpbs will
call these commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE XPBS DISPLAY <br>
This section describes the main parts of the xpbs display.
The main window is composed of 5 distinct areas (subwindows)
arranged vertically (one on top of another) in the
follow&acirc; <br>
ing order: <br>
1) Menu <br>
2) Hosts <br>
3) Queues <br>
4) Jobs <br>
5) Info</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Menu. The Menu area is composed
of a row of command buttons that signal some action with a
click of the left mouse button. The buttons are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Manual Update to update the
information on hosts, queues, and jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Auto Update same as Manual
Update except updating is done automatically every &lt;some
specified&gt; number of minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Track Job for periodically
checking for returned output files of jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Preferences for setting certain
parameters such as the list of server host(s) to query.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help contains some help
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">About tells of the author and
who to send comments, bugs, suggestions to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Close for exiting xpbs plus
saving the current setup information (if anything had
changed) in the user&rsquo;s $HOME/.xpbsrc file. Information
saved include the <br>
selected host(s), queue(s), job(s), the different jobs
listing criteria, the view states (i.e. minimized/maximized)
of the Hosts, Queues, Jobs, and <br>
INFO regions, and anything in the Preferences section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hosts. The Hosts area is
composed of a leading horizontal HOSTS bar, a listbox, and a
set of command buttons. The HOSTS bar contains a
minimize/maximize button, identified by a <br>
dot or a rectangular image, for displaying or iconizing the
Hosts region. The listbox displays information about
favorite server host(s), and each entry is meant to be
selected <br>
via a single left mouse button click, shift key + mouse
button 1 click for contiguous selection, or cntrl key +
mouse button 1 click for non-contiguous selection. The
command <br>
buttons represent actions on selected host(s), and commonly
found buttons are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">detail for obtaining detailed
information about selected server host(s). This
functionality can also be achieved by double clicking on an
entry in the Hosts listbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Submit for submitting a job to
any of the queues managed by the selected host(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">terminate for terminating PBS
servers on selected host(s). (-admin only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server hosts can be chosen
by specifying in the ~/.xpbsrc file (or .Xdefaults) the
resource:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*serverHosts: hostname1
hostname2 ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another way of specifying the
host is to click on the Preferences button in the Menu
region, and manipulate the server Hosts entry widget from
the preferences dialog box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Queues. The Queues area is
composed of a leading horizontal QUEUES bar, a listbox, and
a set of command buttons. The QUEUES bar lists the hosts
that are consulted when listing <br>
queues; the bar also contains a minimize/maximize button for
displaying or iconizing the Queues region. The listbox
displays information about queues managed by the server <br>
host(s) selected from the Hosts listbox; each listbox entry
is meant to be selected (highlighted) via a single left
mouse button click, shift key + mouse button 1 click for
con&acirc; <br>
tiguous selection, or cntrl key + mouse button 1 click for
non-contiguous selection. The command buttons represent
actions for operating on selected queue(s), and commonly
found <br>
buttons are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">detail for obtaining detailed
information about selected queue(s). This functionality can
also be achieved by double clicking on a Queues listbox
entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop for stopping the selected
queue(s). (-admin only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start for starting the selected
queue(s). (-admin only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disable for disabling the
selected queue(s). (-admin only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable for enabling the selected
queue(s). (-admin only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Jobs. The Jobs area is composed
of a leading horizontal JOBS bar, a listbox, and a set of
command buttons. The JOBS bar lists the queues that are
consulted when listing jobs; the <br>
bar also contains a minimize/maximize button for displaying
or iconizing the Jobs region. The listbox displays
information about jobs that are found in the queue(s)
selected from <br>
the Queues listbox; each listbox entry is meant to be
selected (highlighted) via a single left mouse button click,
shift key + mouse button 1 click for contiguous selection,
or <br>
cntrl key + mouse button 1 click for non-contiguous
selection. The region just above the Jobs listbox shows a
collection of command buttons whose labels describe criteria
used <br>
for filtering the Jobs listbox contents. The list of jobs
can be selected according to the owner of jobs (Owners), job
state (Job_States), name of the job (Job_Name), type of <br>
hold placed on the job (Hold_Types), the account name
associated with the job (Account_Name), checkpoint attribute
(Checkpoint), time the job is eligible for
queueing/execution <br>
(Queue_Time), resources requested by the job (Resources),
priority attached to the job (Priority), and whether or not
the job is rerunnable (Rerunnable). The selection criteria
<br>
can be modified by clicking on any of the appropriate
command buttons to bring up a selection box. The criteria
command buttons are accompanied by a Select Jobs button,
which <br>
when clicked, will update the contents of the Jobs listbox
based on the new selection criteria. Please see qselect(1B)
for more details on how the jobs are filtered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, to the right of the
listbox, the Jobs region is accompanied by the following
command buttons, for operating on selected job(s):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">detail for obtaining detailed
information about selected job(s). This functionality can
also be achieved by double clicking on a Jobs listbox
entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modify for modifying attributes
of the selected job(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete for deleting the selected
job(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hold for placing some type of
hold on selected job(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">release for releasing held
job(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">signal for sending signals to
selected job(s) that are running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msg for writing a message string
into the output streams of the selected job(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">move for moving selected job(s)
into some specified destination queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">order for exchanging order of
two selected jobs in a queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">run for running selected job(s).
(-admin only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rerun for requeueing selected
job(s) that are running. (-admin only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Info. The Info Area shows the
progress of the commands&rsquo; executed by xpbs. Look into
this box for errors. The INFO bar also contains a
minimize/maximize button for displaying or <br>
iconizing the Info region.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WIDGETS USED IN XPBS <br>
Some of the widgets used in xpbs and how they are
manipulated are described in the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. listbox - can be
multi-selectable (a number of entries can be
selected/highlighted using a mouse click) or
single-selectable (one entry can be highlighted at a time).
For a <br>
multi-selectable listbox, the following operations are
allowed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. single click with mouse
button 1 to select/highlight an entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. shift key + mouse button 1 to
contiguously select more than one entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c. cntrl key + mouse button 1 to
non-contiguously select more than one entry. NOTE: For
systems running Tk &lt; 4.0, the newly selected item is
reshuffled to appear next to <br>
already selected items.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d. click the Select All/Deselect
All button to select all entries or deselect all entries at
once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e. double clicking an entry
usually activates some action that uses the selected entry
as a parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. scrollbar - usually appears
either vertically or horizontally and contains 5 distinct
areas that are mouse clicked to achieve different
effects:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">top arrow Causes the view in the
associated widget to shift up by one unit (i.e. the object
appears to move down one unit in its window). If the button
is held down the <br>
action will auto-repeat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">top gap Causes the view in the
associated window to shift up by one less than the number of
units in the window (i.e. the portion of the object that
used to appear at <br>
the very top of the window will now appear at the very
bottom). If the button is held down the action will
auto-repeat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slider Pressing button 1 in this
area has no immediate effect except to cause the slider to
appear sunken rather than raised. However, if the mouse is
moved with <br>
the button down then the slider will be dragged, adjusting
the view as the mouse is moved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bottom gap Causes the view in
the associated window to shift down by one less than the
number of units in the window (i.e. the portion of the
object that used to <br>
appear at the very bottom of the window will now appear at
the very top). If the button is held down the action will
auto-repeat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bottom arrow Causes the view in
the associated window to shift down by one unit (i.e. the
object appears to move up one unit in its window). If the
button is held down the <br>
action will auto-repeat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. entry - brought into focus
with a click of the left mouse button. To manipulate this
widget, simply type in the text value. Use of arrow keys,
mouse selection of text for <br>
deletion or overwrite, copying and pasting with sole use of
mouse buttons are permitted. This widget is usually
accompanied by a scrollbar for horizontally scanning a long
<br>
text entry string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. matrix of entry boxes -
usually shown as several rows of entry widgets where a
number of entries (called fields) can be found per row. The
matrix is accompanied by up/down <br>
arrow buttons for paging through the rows of data, and each
group of fields gets one scrollbar for horizontally scanning
long entry strings. Moving from field to field can be <br>
done using the &lt;Tab&gt;, &lt;Cntrl-f&gt;, or
&lt;Cntrl-b&gt; (move backwards) keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. spinbox - a combination of an
entry widget and a horizontal scrollbar. The entry widget
will only accept values that fall within a defined list of
valid values, and incre&acirc; <br>
menting through the valid values is done by clicking on the
up/down arrows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. button - a rectangular region
appearing either raised or pressed that invokes an action
when clicked with the left mouse button. When the button
appears pressed, then hitting <br>
the &lt;RETURN&gt; key will automatically select the
button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. text - an editor like widget.
This widget is brought into focus with a click of the left
mouse button. To manipulate this widget, simply type in the
text. Use of arrow keys, <br>
backspace/delete key, mouse selection of text for deletion
or overwrite, copying and pasting with sole use of mouse
buttons are permitted. This widget is usually accompanied
<br>
by a scrollbar for vertically scanning a long entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUBMITTING JOBS <br>
Submitting a PBS job requires only to manipulate the widgets
found in the Submit window. The submit dialog box is
composed of 4 distinct regions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) Job Script <br>
2) OPTIONS <br>
3) OTHER OPTIONS <br>
4) Command Buttons</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Job Script file region is at
the upper left, the OPTIONS region containing various
widgets for setting job attributes is scattered all over the
dialog box, the OTHER OPTIONS <br>
is located just below the Job Script file region, and
Command Buttons region is at the bottom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The job script region is
composed of a header box, the text box, FILE entry box, and
a couple of buttons labeled load and save. If you have a
script file containing PBS options <br>
and executable lines, then type the name of the file on the
FILE entry box, and then click on the load button. The
various widgets in the Submit window will get loaded with
val&acirc; <br>
ues found in the script file. The script file text box will
only be loaded with executable lines (non-PBS) found in the
script. The job script header box has a Prefix entry box
<br>
that can be modified to specify the PBS directive to look
for when parsing a script file for PBS options. If you
don&rsquo;t have a script file, you can start typing the
executable <br>
lines of the job in the file text box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To submit a job, perform the
following steps:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Select a host from the HOSTS
listbox in the main xpbs display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Click on the Submit button
located in the Menu bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Specify the script file
containing the job execution lines and job property values,
or simply type in the execution lines in the FILE
textbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Start manipulating the
various widgets in the Submit window. Particularly, pay
close attention to the Destination listbox. This box lists
all the queues found in the <br>
host that you selected. A special entry called
&quot;@host&quot; refers to the default queue at host.
Select appropriately the destination queue of the job. More
options can be <br>
found by clicking the OTHER OPTIONS buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. At the bottom of the Submit
window, click confirm submit. You can also click on
interactive to run the job interactively. Running a job
interactively will open an <br>
xterm window to your display host containing the
session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: The script FILE entry box
is accompanied by a save button that you click to save the
current widget values to the specified file in a form that
can later be read <br>
by xpbs or by the qsub command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODIFYING ATTRIBUTES OF JOBS
<br>
Modifying a PBS job requires only to manipulate the widgets
found in the Modify window. To modify a job or jobs, do the
following steps:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Select one or more jobs from
the JOBS listbox in the main xpbs display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Click on the modify button
located to the right of the listbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The Modify window is
structured similarly to the Submit window. Simply manipulate
the widgets to specify replacement or additional values of
job attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Click on the confirm modify
button located at the bottom of the dialog box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DELETING JOBS <br>
Deleting a PBS job requires only to manipulate the widgets
found in the Delete window. To delete a job or jobs, do the
following steps:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Select one or more jobs from
the JOBS listbox in the main xpbs display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Click on the delete button
located to the right of the listbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Manipulate the spinbox widget
to set the kill delay signal interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Click on the delete button
located at the bottom of the dialog box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRACKING RETURNED OUTPUT FILES
<br>
If you want to be informed of returned output files of
current jobs, and be able to quickly see the contents of
those files, then enable the &quot;track job&quot; feature
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Submit all the jobs that you
want monitored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Click on the Track Job button
located in the Menu bar to bring up the Track Job dialog
box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Specify the list of user
names, whose jobs are to be monitored for returned output
files, in the matrix located at the upper left of the dialog
box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Manipulate the minutes
spinbox, located just below the user names matrix, to
specify the interval value when output files will be
periodically checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Specify the location of job
output files (whether locally or remotely) by clicking on
one of the radio buttons located at the upper right of the
dialog box. <br>
Returned locally means the output files will be returned
back to the host where xpbs was run. If the output files are
returned to some remote host, then xpbs will <br>
execute an <br>
RSH &lt;remote_host&gt; test -f &lt;output_files&gt; <br>
to test the existence of the files. RSH is whatever you set
the remote shell command to in the corresponding entry
box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: Be sure the files are
accessible from the host where xpbs was run (i.e. .rhosts
appropriately set).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Click start/reset tracking
button located at the bottom of the dialog box to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- cancel any previous
tracking</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- build a new list of jobs to be
monitored for returned output files based on currently
queued jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- start periodic tracking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. Click on close window
button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an output file for a job
being monitored is found, then the Track Job button (the one
that originally invoked the Track Job dialog box) will turn
into a different color, and <br>
the Jobs Found Completed listbox, located in the Track Job
dialog box, is then loaded with the corresponding job id(s).
Then double click on a job id to see the contents of the
<br>
output file and the error file. Click stop tracking if you
want to cancel tracking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LEAVING XPBS <br>
Click on the Close button located in the Menu bar to leave
xpbs. If anything had changed, it will bring up a dialog box
asking for a confirmation in regards to saving state <br>
information like the view states (minimize/maximize) of the
HOSTS, QUEUES, JOBS, and INFO subwindows, and various
criteria for listing queues and jobs. The information is
saved <br>
in ~/.xpbsrc file.</p>
