db_dump185 - dump DB 1.85 legacy database files

<b>db_dump185</b> [<b>-p</b>] [<b>-f output</b>] db_file
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <i>db_dump185</i> utility reads the version 1.85 database file
  <i>db_file</i> and writes it to the standard output using a portable flat-text
  format understood by the <i>db_load</i>(1) utility. The argument
  <i>db_file</i> must be a file produced using the version 1.85 <i>DB</i>
  library functions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The options are as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-f</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Write to the specified <i>file</i> instead of to the
      standard output.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-p</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If characters in either the key or data items are printing
      characters (as defined by <i>isprint</i>(3)), use printing characters in
      <i>file</i> to represent them. This option permits users to use standard
      text editors to modify the contents of databases.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Note, different systems may have different notions as to
      what characters are ``printing'', and databases dumped in this manner may
      be less portable to external systems.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Dumping and reloading hash databases that use user-defined hash functions will
  result in new databases that use the default hash function. While using the
  default hash function may not be optimal for the new database, it will
  continue to work correctly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Dumping and reloading btree databases that use user-defined prefix or comparison
  functions will result in new databases that use the default prefix and
  comparison functions. In this case, it is quite likely that the database will
  be damaged beyond repair permitting neither record storage or retrieval.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The only available workaround for either case is to modify the sources for the
  <i>db_load</i>(1) utility to load the database using the correct hash, prefix
  and comparison functions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>db_dump</i> utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OUTPUT_FORMATS"><a class="selflink" href="#OUTPUT_FORMATS">OUTPUT
  FORMATS</a></h1>
There are two output formats used by <i>db_dump</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In both output formats, the first few lines of the output contain header
  information describing the underlying access method, filesystem page size and
  other bookkeeping information. This information is output in ``name=value''
  pairs, where ``name'' may be any of the keywords listed in the
  <i>db_load</i>(1) manual page, and ``value'' will be its value. While this
  header information can be edited before the database is reloaded, there is
  rarely any reason to do so, as all of this information can be overridden by
  command-line arguments to <i>db_load</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Following the header information are the key/data pairs from the database. If
  the database being dumped is of type <b>btree</b> or <b>hash</b>, the output
  will be paired lines of text, where the first line of the pair is the key
  item, and the second line of the pair is its corresponding data item. If the
  database being dumped is of type <b>recno</b>, the output will be lines of
  text, where each line is a new data item for the database.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>-p</b> option was specified, each output line will consist of single
  characters representing any characters from the database that were
  ``printing'', and backslash (``\'') escaped characters for any that were not.
  Backslash characters appearing in the output mean one of two things: if the
  backslash character precedes another backslash character, it means that a
  literal backslash character occurred in the key or data item. If the backslash
  character precedes any other character, the next two characters should be
  interpreted as hexadecimal specification of a single character, e.g., ``\0a''
  is a newline character in the ASCII character set.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>-p</b> option was not specified, each output line will consist of
  paired hexadecimal values, e.g., the line ``726f6f74'' is the string ``root''
  in the ASCII character set.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In both output formats, a single newline character ends both the key and data
  items.

The DB library is a family of groups of functions that provides a modular
  programming interface to transactions and record-oriented file access. The
  library includes support for transactions, locking, logging and file page
  caching, as well as various indexed access methods. Many of the functional
  groups (e.g., the file page caching functions) are useful independent of the
  other DB functions, although some functional groups are explicitly based on
  other functional groups (e.g., transactions and logging).

<i>db_archive</i>(1), <i>db_checkpoint</i>(1), <i>db_deadlock</i>(1),
  <i>db_dump</i>(1), <i>db_load</i>(1), <i>db_recover</i>(1), <i>db_stat</i>(1).
  (Note that on Debian systems, some of these manpages and programs have been
  renamed to things like <b>db4.3_stat</b> to distinguish between the multiple
  DB versions.)</div>
