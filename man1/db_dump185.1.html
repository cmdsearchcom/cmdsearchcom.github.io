<p>DB_DUMP185(1) General Commands Manual DB_DUMP185(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
db_dump185 - dump DB 1.85 legacy database files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
db_dump185 [-p] [-f output] db_file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The db_dump185 utility reads the version 1.85 database file
db_file and writes it to the standard output using a
portable flat-text format understood by the db_load(1)
utility. <br>
The argument db_file must be a file produced using the
version 1.85 DB library functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Write to the specified file
instead of to the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p If characters in either the
key or data items are printing characters (as defined by
isprint(3)), use printing characters in file to represent
them. This option permits <br>
users to use standard text editors to modify the contents of
databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, different systems may have
different notions as to what characters are
&lsquo;&lsquo;printing&rsquo;&rsquo;, and databases dumped
in this manner may be less portable to external systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dumping and reloading hash
databases that use user-defined hash functions will result
in new databases that use the default hash function. While
using the default hash function <br>
may not be optimal for the new database, it will continue to
work correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dumping and reloading btree
databases that use user-defined prefix or comparison
functions will result in new databases that use the default
prefix and comparison functions. In <br>
this case, it is quite likely that the database will be
damaged beyond repair permitting neither record storage or
retrieval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only available workaround
for either case is to modify the sources for the db_load(1)
utility to load the database using the correct hash, prefix
and comparison functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db_dump utility exits 0 on
success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FORMATS <br>
There are two output formats used by db_dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In both output formats, the
first few lines of the output contain header information
describing the underlying access method, filesystem page
size and other bookkeeping informa&acirc; <br>
tion. This information is output in
&lsquo;&lsquo;name=value&rsquo;&rsquo; pairs, where
&lsquo;&lsquo;name&rsquo;&rsquo; may be any of the keywords
listed in the db_load(1) manual page, and
&lsquo;&lsquo;value&rsquo;&rsquo; will be its value. While
<br>
this header information can be edited before the database is
reloaded, there is rarely any reason to do so, as all of
this information can be overridden by command-line arguments
<br>
to db_load.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Following the header information
are the key/data pairs from the database. If the database
being dumped is of type btree or hash, the output will be
paired lines of text, where <br>
the first line of the pair is the key item, and the second
line of the pair is its corresponding data item. If the
database being dumped is of type recno, the output will be
<br>
lines of text, where each line is a new data item for the
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -p option was specified,
each output line will consist of single characters
representing any characters from the database that were
&lsquo;&lsquo;printing&rsquo;&rsquo;, and backslash
(&lsquo;&lsquo;&acute;&rsquo;) <br>
escaped characters for any that were not. Backslash
characters appearing in the output mean one of two things:
if the backslash character precedes another backslash
character, <br>
it means that a literal backslash character occurred in the
key or data item. If the backslash character precedes any
other character, the next two characters should be
inter&acirc; <br>
preted as hexadecimal specification of a single character,
e.g., &lsquo;&lsquo; a&rsquo;&rsquo; is a newline character
in the ASCII character set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -p option was not
specified, each output line will consist of paired
hexadecimal values, e.g., the line
&lsquo;&lsquo;726f6f74&rsquo;&rsquo; is the string
&lsquo;&lsquo;root&rsquo;&rsquo; in the ASCII character
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In both output formats, a single
newline character ends both the key and data items.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
isprint(3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DB library is a family of
groups of functions that provides a modular programming
interface to transactions and record-oriented file access.
The library includes support for <br>
transactions, locking, logging and file page caching, as
well as various indexed access methods. Many of the
functional groups (e.g., the file page caching functions)
are useful <br>
independent of the other DB functions, although some
functional groups are explicitly based on other functional
groups (e.g., transactions and logging).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">db_archive(1), db_checkpoint(1),
db_deadlock(1), db_dump(1), db_load(1), db_recover(1),
db_stat(1). (Note that on Debian systems, some of these
manpages and programs have been <br>
renamed to things like db4.3_stat to distinguish between the
multiple DB versions.)</p>
