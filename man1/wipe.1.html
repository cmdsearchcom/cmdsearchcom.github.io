<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
wipe - securely erase files from magnetic media</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
wipe [options] path1 path2 ... pathn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CURRENT-VERSION <br>
This manual page describes version 0.21 of wipe , released
September 2006.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Recovery of supposedly erased data from magnetic media is
easier than what many people would like to believe. A
technique called Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM) allows any
moder&acirc; <br>
ately funded opponent to recover the last two or three
layers of data written to disk; wipe repeatedly overwrites
special patterns to the files to be destroyed, using the
fsync() <br>
call and/or the O_SYNC bit to force disk access. In normal
mode, 34 patterns are used (of which 8 are random). These
patterns were recommended in an article from Peter Gutmann
<br>
(pgut001@cs.auckland.ac.nz) entitled &quot;Secure Deletion
of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory&quot;. A quick
mode allows you to use only 4 passes with random patterns,
which is <br>
of course much less secure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE ABOUT JOURNALING
FILESYSTEMS AND SOME RECOMMENDATIONS (JUNE 2004) <br>
Journaling filesystems (such as Ext3 or ReiserFS) are now
being used by default by most Linux distributions. No secure
deletion program that does filesystem-level calls can
san&acirc; <br>
itize files on such filesystems, because sensitive data and
metadata can be written to the journal, which cannot be
readily accessed. Per-file secure deletion is better
imple&acirc; <br>
mented in the operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encrypting a whole partition
with cryptoloop, for example, does not help very much
either, since there is a single key for all the
partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Therefore wipe is best used to
sanitize a harddisk before giving it to untrusted parties
(i.e. sending your laptop for repair, or selling your disk).
Wiping size issues have <br>
been hopefully fixed (I apologize for the long delay).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be aware that harddisks are
quite intelligent beasts those days. They transparently
remap defective blocks. This means that the disk can keep an
albeit corrupted (maybe <br>
slightly) but inaccessible and unerasable copy of some of
your data. Modern disks are said to have about 100%
transparent remapping capacity. You can have a look at
recent dis&acirc; <br>
cussions on Slashdot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I hereby speculate that
harddisks can use the spare remapping area to secretly make
copies of your data. Rising totalitarianism makes this
almost a certitude. It is quite <br>
straightforward to implement some simple filtering schemes
that would copy potentially interesting data. Better, a
harddisk can probably detect that a given file is being
wiped, <br>
and silently make a copy of it, while wiping the original as
instructed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recovering such data is probably
easily done with secret IDE/SCSI commands. My guess is that
there are agreements between harddisk manufacturers and
government agencies. Well- <br>
funded mafia hackers should then be able to find those
secret commands too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t trust your harddisk.
Encrypt all your data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course this shifts the trust
to the computing system, the CPU, and so on. I guess there
are also &quot;traps&quot; in the CPU and, in fact, in every
sufficiently advanced mass-marketed <br>
chip. Wealthy nations can find those. Therefore these are
mainly used for criminal investigation and &quot;control of
public dissent&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">People should better think of
their computing devices as facilities lended by the DHS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPORTANT WARNING -- READ
CAREFULLY <br>
The author, the maintainers or the contributors of this
package can NOT be held responsible in any way if wipe
destroys something you didn&rsquo;t want it to destroy.
Let&rsquo;s make this <br>
very clear. I want you to assume that this is a nasty
program that will wipe out parts of your files that you
didn&rsquo;t want it to wipe. So whatever happens after you
launch wipe is <br>
your entire responsiblity. In particular, no one guarantees
that wipe will conform to the specifications given in this
manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, we cannot guarantee
that wipe will actually erase data, or that wiped data is
not recoverable by advanced means. So if nasties get your
secrets because you sold a <br>
wiped harddisk to someone you don&rsquo;t know, well, too
bad for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The best way to sanitize a
storage medium is to subject it to temperatures exceeding
1500K. As a cheap alternative, you might use wipe at your
own risk. Be aware that it is very <br>
difficult to assess whether running wipe on a given file
will actually wipe it -- it depends on an awful lot of
factors, such as : the type of file system the file resides
on (in <br>
particular, whether the file system is a journaling one or
not), the type of storage medium used, and the least
significant bit of the phase of the moon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wiping over NFS or over a
journalling filesystem (ReiserFS etc.) will most probably
not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Therefore I strongly recommend
to call wipe directly on the corresponding block device with
the appropriate options. However THIS IS AN EXTREMELY
DANGEROUS THING TO DO. Be sure <br>
to be sober. Give the right options. In particular :
don&rsquo;t wipe a whole harddisk (eg. wipe -kD /dev/hda is
bad) since this will destroy your master boot record. Bad
idea. Prefer <br>
wiping partitions (eg. wipe -kD /dev/hda2) is good,
provided, of course, that you have backed up all necessary
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS <br>
-f (force; disable confirmation query) <br>
By default wipe will ask for confirmation, indicating the
number of regular and special files and directories
specified on the command line. You must type &quot;yes&quot;
for confir&acirc; <br>
mation, &quot;no&quot; for rejection. You can disable the
confirmation query with the -f (force) option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r (recurse into subdirectories)
<br>
Will allow the removal of the entire directory tree.
Symbolic links are not followed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c (chmod if necessary) <br>
If a file or directory to be wiped has no write permissions
set, will do a chmod to set the permission.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i (informational, verbose mode)
<br>
This enables reporting to stdout. By default all data is
written to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s (silent mode) <br>
All messages, except the confirmation prompt and error
messages, are suppressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q (quick wipe) <br>
If this option is used, wipe will only make (by default) 4
passes on each file, writing random data. See option -Q</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q &lt;number-of-passes&gt; <br>
Sets the number of passes for quick wiping. Default is
4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a (abort on error) <br>
The program will exit with EXIT_FAILURE if a non-fatal error
is encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R (set random device OR random
seed command)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With this option which requires
an argument you can specify an alternate /dev/random device,
or a command who&rsquo;s standard output will be hashed
using MD5-hashed. The distinc&acirc; <br>
tion can be made using the -S option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S (random seed method)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option takes a
single-character argument, which specifies how the random
device/random seed argument is to be used. The default
random device is /dev/random. It can be <br>
set using the -R option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The possible single-character
arguments are: <br>
r If you want the argument to be treated like a regular
file/character device. This will work with /dev/random, and
might also work with FIFOs and the like. <br>
c If you want the argument to be executed as a command. The
output from the command will be hashed using MD5 to provide
the required seed. See the WIPE_SEEDPIPE environment <br>
variable for more info. <br>
p If you want wipe to get its seed by hashing environment
variables, the current date and time, its process id. etc.
(the random device argument will not be used). This is of
<br>
course the least secure setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M (select pseudo-random number
generator algorythm)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During the random passes, wipe
overwrites the target files with a stream of binary data,
created by the following choice of algorythms: <br>
l will use (depending on your system) your libc&rsquo;s
random() or rand() pseudorandom generator. Note that on most
systems, rand() is a linear congruential generator, which is
<br>
awfully weak. The choice is made at compile-time with the
HAVE_RANDOM define (see the Makefile). <br>
a will use the Arcfour stream cipher as a PRNG. Arcfour
happens to be compatible with the well-known RC4 cipher.
This means that under the same key, Arcfour generates
exactly <br>
the same stream as RC4... <br>
r will use the fresh RC6 algorythm as a PRNG; RC6 is keyed
with the 128-bit seed, and then a null block is repeatedly
encrypted to get the pseudo-random stream. I guess this <br>
sould be quite secure. Of course RC6 with 20 rounds is
slower than random(); the compile-time option WEAK_RC6
allows you to use a 4-round version of RC6, which is faster.
In <br>
order to be able to use RC6, wipe must be compiled with
ENABLE_RC6 defined; see the Makefile for warnings about
patent issues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In all cases the PRNG is seeded
with the data gathered from the random device (see -R and -S
options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l &lt;length&gt; <br>
As there can be some problems in determining the actual size
of a block device (as some devices do not even have fixed
sizes, such as floppy disks or tapes), you might need <br>
to specify the size of the device by hand; &lt;length&gt; is
the device capacity expressed as a number of bytes. You can
use K (Kilo) to specify multiplication by 1024, M (Mega)
<br>
to specify multiplication by 1048576, G (Giga) to specify
multiplication by 1073741824 and b (block) to specify
multiplication by 512. Thus</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1024 = 2b = 1K</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">20K33 = 20480+33 = 20513</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">114M32K =
114*1024*1024+32*1024.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o &lt;offset&gt; <br>
This allows you to specify an offset inside the file or
device to be wiped. The syntax of &lt;offset&gt; is the same
as for the -l option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Use exact file size: do not
round up file size to wipe possible remaining junk on the
last block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z Don&rsquo;t try to wipe file
sizes by repeatedly halving the file size. Note that this is
only attempted on regular files so there is no use if you
use wipe for cleaning a block <br>
or special device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Don&rsquo;t try to wipe file
names. Normally, wipe tries to cover file names by renaming
them; this does NOT guarantee that the physical location
holding the old file name gets <br>
overwritten. Furthermore, after renaming a file, the only
way to make sure that the name change is physically carried
out is to call sync (), which flushes out ALL the disk <br>
caches of the system, whereas for ading and writing one can
use the O_SYNC bit to get synchronous I/O for one file. As
sync () is very slow, calling sync () after every <br>
rename () makes filename wiping extremely slow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Keep files: do not unlink the
files after they have been overwritten. Useful if you want
to wipe a device, while keeping the device special file.
This implies -F.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Dereference symlinks: by
default, wipe will never follow symlinks. If you specify -D
however, wipe will consent to, well, wipe the targets of any
symlinks you might happen <br>
to name on the command line. You can&rsquo;t specify both -D
and -r (recursive) options, first because of possible cycles
in the symlink-enhanced directory graph, I&rsquo;d have to
<br>
keep track of visited files to guarantee termination, which,
you&rsquo;ll easily admit, is a pain in C, and, second, for
fear of having a (surprise!!) block device buried
some&acirc; <br>
where unexpected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Show version information and
quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
wipe -rcf /home/berke/plaintext/ <br>
Wipe every file and every directory (option -r) listed under
/home/berke/plaintext/, including
/home/berke/plaintext/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regular files will be wiped with
34 passes and their sizes will then be halved a random
number of times. Special files (character and block devices,
FIFOs...) will not. All <br>
directory entries (files, special files and directories)
will be renamed 10 times and then unlinked. Things with
inappropriate permissions will be chmod()&rsquo;ed (option
-c). <br>
All of this will happen without user confirmation (option
-f).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wipe -kq /dev/hda3 <br>
Assuming /dev/hda3 is the block device corresponding to the
third partition of the master drive on the primary IDE
interface, it will be wiped in quick mode (option -q) i.e.
<br>
with four random passes. The inode won&rsquo;t be renamed or
unlinked (option -k). Before starting, it will ask you to
type &lsquo;&lsquo;yes&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wipe -kqD /dev/floppy <br>
Since wipe never follows symlinks unless explicitly told to
do so, if you want to wipe /dev/floppy which happens to be a
symlink to /dev/fd0u1440 you will have to specify <br>
the -D option. Before starting, it will ask you to type
&lsquo;&lsquo;yes&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wipe -rfi &gt;wipe.log
/var/log/* <br>
Here, wipe will recursively (option -r) destroy everything
under /var/log, excepting /var/log. It will not attempt to
chmod() things. It will however be verbose (option -i). <br>
It won&rsquo;t ask you to type
&lsquo;&lsquo;yes&rsquo;&rsquo; because of the -f
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wipe -Kq -l 1440k /dev/fd0 <br>
Due to various idiosyncracies of the operating system,
it&rsquo;s not always easy to obtain the number of bytes a
given device might contain (in fact, that quantity can be
vari&acirc; <br>
able). This is why you sometimes need to tell wipe the
amount of bytes to destroy. That&rsquo;s what the -l option
is for. Plus, you can use b,K,M and G as multipliers,
respec&acirc; <br>
tively for 2^9 (512), 2^10 (1024 or a Kilo), 2^20 (a Mega)
and 2^30 (a Giga) bytes. You can even combine more than one
multiplier !! So that 1M416K = 1474560 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS/LIMITATIONS <br>
Wipe should work on harddisks and floppy disks; however the
internal cache of some harddisks might prevent the necessary
writes to be done to the magnetic surface. It would be <br>
funny to use it over NFS. Under CFS (Cryptographic File
System) the fsync() call has no effect; wipe has not much
use under it anyway - use wipe directly on the corresponding
<br>
encrypted files. Also, under Linux, when using a device
mounted thru a loopback device, synchronous I/O does not get
propagated cleanly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For wiping floppy disks, at
least under Linux, there is no way, besides obscure
floppy-driver specific ioctl&rsquo;s to determine the block
size of the disk. In particular, the BLKGET&acirc; <br>
SIZE ioctl is not implemented in the floppy driver. So, for
wiping floppies, you must specify the size of the floppy
disk using the -l option, as in the last example. This
option <br>
is normally not needed for other fixed block devices, like
IDE and SCSI devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File name wiping is implemented
since version 0.12. I don&rsquo;t know how efficient it is.
It first changes the name of the file to a random- generated
name of same length, calls sync <br>
(), then changes the name to a random-generated name of
maximal length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File size wiping is implemented
by repeatedly truncating the file to half of its size, until
it becomes empty; sync () is called between such
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that it is still not
possible to file creation date and permission bits portably.
A wipe utility working at the block device level could be
written using the ext2fs library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR AND LICENCE <br>
Wipe was written by Berke Durak (to find my email address,
just type echo berke1ouvaton2org|tr 12 @. in a shell).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wipe is released under the
conditions of the GNU General Public License.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/dev/random is used by default to seed the pseudo-random
number generators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
WIPE_SEEDPIPE If set, wipe will execute the command
specified in it (using popen()), and will hash the
command&rsquo;s output with the MD5 message-digest algorythm
to get a 128-bit <br>
seed for its PRNG. For example, on systems lacking a
/dev/random device, this variable might be set in
/etc/profile to a shell script which contains various
commands such as ls, <br>
ps, who, last, etc. and which are run asynchronously in
order to get an output as less predictable as possible.</p>
