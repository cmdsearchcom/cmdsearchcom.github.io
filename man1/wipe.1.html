This manual page describes version <b>0.21</b> of <b>wipe</b> , released
  September 2006.

Recovery of supposedly erased data from magnetic media is easier than what many
  people would like to believe. A technique called Magnetic Force Microscopy
  (MFM) allows any moderately funded opponent to recover the last two or three
  layers of data written to disk; <b>wipe</b> repeatedly overwrites special
  patterns to the files to be destroyed, using the fsync() call and/or the
  O_SYNC bit to force disk access. In normal mode, 34 patterns are used (of
  which 8 are random). These patterns were recommended in an article from Peter
  Gutmann (pgut001@cs.auckland.ac.nz) entitled &quot;Secure Deletion of Data
  from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory&quot;. A quick mode allows you to use
  only 4 passes with random patterns, which is of course much less secure.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTE_ABOUT_JOURNALING_FILESYSTEMS_AND_SOME_RECOMMENDATIONS_(JUNE_2004)"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTE_ABOUT_JOURNALING_FILESYSTEMS_AND_SOME_RECOMMENDATIONS_(JUNE_2004)">NOTE
  ABOUT JOURNALING FILESYSTEMS AND SOME RECOMMENDATIONS (JUNE 2004)</a></h1>
Journaling filesystems (such as Ext3 or ReiserFS) are now being used by default
  by most Linux distributions. No secure deletion program that does
  filesystem-level calls can sanitize files on such filesystems, because
  sensitive data and metadata can be written to the journal, which cannot be
  readily accessed. Per-file secure deletion is better implemented in the
  operating system.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Encrypting a whole partition with cryptoloop, for example, does not help very
  much either, since there is a single key for all the partition.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Therefore <b>wipe</b> is best used to sanitize a harddisk before giving it to
  untrusted parties (i.e. sending your laptop for repair, or selling your disk).
  Wiping size issues have been hopefully fixed (I apologize for the long delay).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Be aware that harddisks are quite intelligent beasts those days. They
  transparently remap defective blocks. This means that the disk can keep an
  albeit corrupted (maybe slightly) but inaccessible and unerasable copy of some
  of your data. Modern disks are said to have about 100% transparent remapping
  capacity. You can have a look at recent discussions on Slashdot.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
I hereby speculate that harddisks can use the spare remapping area to secretly
  make copies of your data. Rising totalitarianism makes this almost a
  certitude. It is quite straightforward to implement some simple filtering
  schemes that would copy potentially interesting data. Better, a harddisk can
  probably detect that a given file is being wiped, and silently make a copy of
  it, while wiping the original as instructed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Recovering such data is probably easily done with secret IDE/SCSI commands. My
  guess is that there are agreements between harddisk manufacturers and
  government agencies. Well-funded mafia hackers should then be able to find
  those secret commands too.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Don't trust your harddisk. Encrypt all your data.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Of course this shifts the trust to the computing system, the CPU, and so on. I
  guess there are also &quot;traps&quot; in the CPU and, in fact, in every
  sufficiently advanced mass-marketed chip. Wealthy nations can find those.
  Therefore these are mainly used for criminal investigation and &quot;control
  of public dissent&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
People should better think of their computing devices as facilities lended by
  the DHS.

  WARNING -- READ CAREFULLY</a></h1>
The author, the maintainers or the contributors of this package can NOT be held
  responsible in any way if <b>wipe</b> destroys something you didn't want it to
  destroy. Let's make this very clear. I want you to assume that this is a nasty
  program that will wipe out parts of your files that you didn't want it to
  wipe. So whatever happens after you launch <b>wipe</b> is your entire
  responsiblity. In particular, no one guarantees that <b>wipe</b> will conform
  to the specifications given in this manual page.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Similarly, we cannot guarantee that <b>wipe</b> will actually erase data, or
  that wiped data is not recoverable by advanced means. So if nasties get your
  secrets because you sold a wiped harddisk to someone you don't know, well, too
  bad for you.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The best way to sanitize a storage medium is to subject it to temperatures
  exceeding 1500K. As a cheap alternative, you might use <b>wipe</b> at your own
  risk. Be aware that it is very difficult to assess whether running <b>wipe</b>
  on a given file will actually wipe it -- it depends on an awful lot of
  factors, such as : the type of file system the file resides on (in particular,
  whether the file system is a journaling one or not), the type of storage
  medium used, and the least significant bit of the phase of the moon.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Wiping over NFS or over a journalling filesystem (ReiserFS etc.) will most
  probably not work.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Therefore I strongly recommend to call <b>wipe</b> directly on the corresponding
  block device with the appropriate options. However <i>THIS IS AN EXTREMELY
  DANGEROUS THING TO DO.</i> Be sure to be sober. Give the right options. In
  particular : don't wipe a whole harddisk (eg. wipe -kD /dev/hda is bad) since
  this will destroy your master boot record. Bad idea. Prefer wiping partitions
  (eg. wipe -kD /dev/hda2) is good, provided, of course, that you have backed up
  all necessary data.

<b>Wipe</b> should work on harddisks and floppy disks; however the internal
  cache of some harddisks might prevent the necessary writes to be done to the
  magnetic surface. It would be funny to use it over NFS. Under CFS
  (Cryptographic File System) the fsync() call has no effect; wipe has not much
  use under it anyway - use wipe directly on the corresponding encrypted files.
  Also, under Linux, when using a device mounted thru a loopback device,
  synchronous I/O does not get propagated cleanly.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For wiping floppy disks, at least under Linux, there is no way, besides obscure
  floppy-driver specific ioctl's to determine the block size of the disk. In
  particular, the BLKGETSIZE ioctl is not implemented in the floppy driver. So,
  for wiping floppies, you must specify the size of the floppy disk using the -l
  option, as in the last example. This option is normally not needed for other
  fixed block devices, like IDE and SCSI devices.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
File name wiping is implemented since version 0.12. I don't know how efficient
  it is. It first changes the name of the file to a random- generated name of
  same length, calls sync (), then changes the name to a random-generated name
  of maximal length.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
File size wiping is implemented by repeatedly truncating the file to half of its
  size, until it becomes empty; sync () is called between such operations.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that it is still not possible to file creation date and permission bits
  portably. A wipe utility working at the block device level could be written
  using the ext2fs library.

<b>WIPE_SEEDPIPE</b> If set, <b>wipe</b> will execute the command specified in
  it (using popen()), and will hash the command's output with the MD5
  message-digest algorythm to get a 128-bit seed for its PRNG. For example, on
  systems lacking a /dev/random device, this variable might be set in
  /etc/profile to a shell script which contains various commands such as ls, ps,
  who, last, etc. and which are run asynchronously in order to get an output as
  less predictable as possible.
