<p>MAKEPP_EXTENDING(1) Makepp MAKEPP_EXTENDING(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
makepp_extending -- How to extend makepp using Perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Makepp internally is flexible enough so that by writing a
little bit of Perl code, you can add functions or do a
number of other operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General notes on writing Perl
code to work with makepp <br>
Each makefile lives in its own package. Thus definitions in
one makefile do not affect definitions in another makefile.
A common set of functions including all the standard <br>
textual manipulation functions is imported into the package
when it is created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makefile variables are stored as
Perl scalars in that package. (There are exceptions to this:
automatic variables and the default value of variables like
CC are actually <br>
implemented as functions with no arguments. Target specific
vars, command line vars and environment vars are not seen
this way.) Thus any Perl code you write has access to all
<br>
makefile variables. Global variables are stored in the
&quot;Mpp::global&quot; package. See Makefile variables for
the details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each of the statements (ifperl /
ifmakeperl, perl / makeperl, sub / makesub), the functions
(perl / makeperl, map / makemap) and the rule action (perl /
makeperl) for writing <br>
Perl code directly in the makefile come in two flavours. The
first is absolutely normal Perl, meaning you have to use the
&quot;f_&quot; prefix as explained in the next section, if
you <br>
want to call makepp functions. The second variant first
passes the statement through Make-style variable expansion,
meaning you have to double the &quot;$&quot;s you want Perl
to see.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">End handling is special because
makepp&rsquo;s huge (depending on your build system) data
structures would take several seconds to garbage collect
with a normal exit. So we do a brute <br>
force exit. In the main process you can still have
&quot;END&quot; blocks but if you have any global file
handles they may not get flushed. But you should be using
the modern lexical <br>
filehandles, which get closed properly when going out of
scope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Perl code run directly as a
rule action or via a command you define, it is the opposite.
&quot;END&quot; blocks will not be run, but global
filehandles get flushed for you. The <br>
&quot;DESTROY&quot; of global objects will never be run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adding new textual functions
<br>
You can add a new function to makepp&rsquo;s repertoire by
simply defining a Perl subroutine of the same name but with
a prefix of &quot;f_&quot;. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub f_myfunc { <br>
my $argument = &amp;arg; # Name the argument. <br>
my( undef, $mkfile, $mkfile_line ) = @_; # Name the
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">... do something here</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">return $return_value; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XYZ := $(myfunc my func
arguments)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your function takes no
arguments, there is nothing to do. If your function takes
one argument, as in the example above, use the simple
accessor &amp;arg to obtain it. If you <br>
expect more arguments, you need the more complex accessor
&quot;args&quot; described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These accessors processes the
same three parameters that should be passed to any
&quot;f_&quot; function, namely the function arguments, the
makefile object and a line descriptor for <br>
messages. Therefore you can use the efficient &amp;arg form
in the first case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &amp;arg accessor takes care
of the following for you: If the arguments were already
expanded (e.g. to find the name of the function in
&quot;$(my$(function) arg)&quot; the arg is passed <br>
as a string and just returned. If the argument still needs
expansion, this is the usual case, it is instead a reference
to a string. The &amp;arg accessor expands it for you, for
<br>
which it needs the makefile object as its 2nd parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you expect more arguments,
possibly in variable number, the job is performed by
&quot;args&quot;. This accessor takes the same 3 parameters
as arg, plus additional parameters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max: number of args (default 2):
give ~0 (maxint) for endless <br>
min: number of args (default 0 if max is ~0, else same as
max) <br>
only_comma: don&rsquo;t eat space around commas, usual for
non-filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At most max, but at least min
commas present before expansion are used to split the
arguments. Some examples from makepp&rsquo;s builtin
functions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my( $prefix, $text ) = args
$_[0], $_[1], $_[2], 2, 2, 1; # addprefix <br>
for my $cond ( args $_[0], undef, $_[2], ~0 ) ... # and, or
<br>
my @args= args $_[0], $_[1], $_[2], ~0, 1, 1; # call <br>
my( $filters, $words ) = args $_[0], $_[1], $_[2]; #
filter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The function should return a
scalar string (not an array) which is then inserted into the
text at that point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your function encounters an
error, it should die using the usual Perl die statement.
This will be trapped by makepp and an error message
displaying the file name and the line <br>
number of the expression causing the error will be printed
out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are essentially no limits
on what the function can do; you can access the file, run
shell commands, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At present, expressions
appearing in dependencies and in the rule actions are
expanded once while expressions appearing in targets are
expanded twice, so be careful if your <br>
function has side effects and is present in an expression
for a target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the environment (in
particular, the cwd) in which the function evaluates will
not necessarily match the environment in which the rules
from the Makefile in which the <br>
function was evaluated are executed. If this is a problem
for you, then your function probably ought to look something
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub f_foo { <br>
... <br>
chdir $makefile-&gt;{CWD};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">... etc. <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Putting functions into a Perl
module <br>
If you put functions into an include file, you will have one
copy per Makeppfile which uses it. To avoid that, you can
write them as a normal Perl module with an
&quot;Exporter&quot; <br>
interface, and use that. This will load faster and save
memory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl { use mymodule } <br>
perl { <br>
use my::module; # put : on a new line so this is not parsed
as a rule <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need any of the functions
normally available in a Makefile (like the &quot;f_&quot;
functions, &quot;arg&quot; or &quot;args&quot;), you must
put this line into your module:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Mpp::Subs;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The drawback is that the module
would be in a different package than a function directly
appearing in a makefile. So you need to pass in everything
as parameters, or construct <br>
names with Perl&rsquo;s &quot;caller&quot; function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Calling external Perl scripts
<br>
If you call an external Perl script via &quot;system&quot;,
or as a rule action, makepp will fork a new process (unless
it&rsquo;s the last rule action) and fire off a brand new
perl <br>
interpreter. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that, except
that there&rsquo;s a more efficient way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;command arguments... <br>
This can be a rule action. It will call a function command
with a &quot;c_&quot; prefix, and pass it the remaining
(optionally quoted makepp style -- not exactly the same as
Shell) <br>
arguments. If such a function cannot be found, this passes
all strings to &quot;run&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub c_mycmd { my @args = @_; ...
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(phony callcmd): <br>
&amp;mycmd &rsquo;arg with space&rsquo; arg2
&quot;arg3&quot; # calls c_mycmd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.out: %.in <br>
&amp;myscript -o $(output) $(input) # calls external
myscript</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can write your commands
within the framework of the builtins, allowing you to use
the same standard options as they have, and the I/O handling
they give.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The block operator
&quot;Mpp::Cmds::frame&quot; is followed by a single letter
option list of the builtins (maximally &quot;qw(f i I o O r
s)&quot;). Even if you specify your own option <br>
overriding one of these, you still give the single letter of
the standard option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each own option is specified as
&quot;[qw(n name), ef, arg, sub]&quot;. The first two
elements are short and long name, followed by the variable
reference and optionally by a <br>
boolean for whether to take an argument. Without an arg, the
variable is incremented each time the option is given, else
the option value is stored in it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub c_my_ocmd { # Typical output
case <br>
local @ARGV = @_; <br>
Mpp::Cmds::frame {</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">... print something here with
@ARGV, with options already automatically removed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">} &rsquo;f&rsquo;, qw(o O); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub c_my_icmd { # Typical input
case with 2 options <br>
local @ARGV = @_; <br>
my( $short, $long ); <br>
Mpp::Cmds::frame {</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">... do something here with
&lt;&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">} qw(i I r s), # s specifies
only --separator, not -s <br>
[qw(s short), hort], # No option arg -&gt; $short == 1 <br>
[qw(l long), ong, 1, sub { warn &quot;got arg $long&quot;}];
<br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here comes a simple command
which upcases only the first character of each input record
(equivalent to &quot;&amp;sed &rsquo;$$_ =
&quot;_&quot;&rsquo;&quot;):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub c_uc { <br>
local @ARGV = @_; <br>
Mpp::Cmds::frame { <br>
print &quot;&quot; while &lt;&gt;; <br>
} &rsquo;f&rsquo;, qw(i I o O r s); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Within the block handled by
frame, you can have nested blocks for performing critical
operations, like opening other files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mpp::Cmds::perform { ... }
&rsquo;message&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will output message with
&quot;--verbose&quot; (which every command accepts) iff the
command is successfully run. But if the block evaluates as
false, it dies with negated <br>
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">run script arguments... <br>
This is a normal Perl function you can use in any Perl
context within your makefile. It is similar to the
multi-argument form of system, but it runs the Perl script
within <br>
the current process. For makepp statements, the perl
function or your own functions that is the process running
makepp. But for a rule that is the subprocess performing it.
<br>
The script gets parsed as many times as it gets called, but
you can put the real work into a lib, as pod2html does. This
lib can then get used in the top level, so that it&rsquo;s
<br>
already present:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl { use mylib } # gets forked
to all rules which needn&rsquo;t reparse it</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.out: %.in <br>
makeperl { run qw&rsquo;myscript -o $(output)
$(input)&rsquo; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the script calls
&quot;exit&quot;, closes standard file descriptors or relies
on the system to clean up after it (open files, memory...),
this can be a problem with &quot;run&quot;. If you <br>
call &quot;run&quot; within statements or the perl function,
makepp can get disturbed or the cleanup only happens at the
end of makepp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have one the
aforementioned problems, run the script externally, i.e. as
from the command line instead. Within a rule cleanup is less
of a problem, especially not as <br>
the last action of a rule, since the rule subprocess will
exit afterwards anyway, except on Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Writing your own signature
methods <br>
Sometimes you want makepp to compute a signature method
using a different technique. For example, suppose you have a
binary that depends on a shared library. Ordinarily, if you
<br>
change the shared library, you don&rsquo;t have to relink
executables that depend on it because the linking is done at
run time. (However, it is possible that relinking the
executable <br>
might be necessary, which is why I did not make this the
default.) What you want makepp to do is to have the same
signature for the shared library even if it changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be accomplished in
several ways. The easiest way is to create your own new
signature method (let&rsquo;s call it
&quot;shared_object&quot;). You would use this signature
method only <br>
on rules that link binaries, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">myprogram : *.o lib1/lib1.so
lib2/lib2.so <br>
: signature shared_object <br>
$(CC) $(inputs) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now we have to create the
signature method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All signature methods must be
their own class, and the class must contain a few special
items (see Mpp/Signature.pm in the distribution for
details). The class&rsquo;s name must be <br>
prefixed with &quot;Mpp::Signature::&quot;, so in this case
our class should be called
&quot;Mpp::Signature::shared_object&quot;. We have to create
a file called shared_object.pm and put it into a <br>
Mpp::Signature directory somewhere in the Perl include path;
the easiest place might be in the Mpp/Signature directory in
the makepp installation (e.g., <br>
/usr/local/share/makepp/Mpp/Signature or wherever you
installed it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For precise details about what
has to go in this class, you should look carefully through
the file Mpp/Signature.pm and probably also
Mpp/Signature/exact_match.pm in the makepp <br>
distribution. But in our case, all we want to do is to make
a very small change to an existing signature mechanism; if
the file is a shared library, we want to have a constant
<br>
signature, whereas if the file is anything else, we want to
rely on makepp&rsquo;s normal signature mechanism. The best
way to do this is to inherit from <br>
&quot;Mpp::Signature::c_compilation_md5&quot;, which is the
signature method that is usually chosen when makepp
recognizes a link command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So the file
Mpp/Signature/shared_object.pm might contain the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use strict; <br>
package Mpp::Signature::shared_object; <br>
use Mpp::Signature::c_compilation_md5; <br>
our @ISA = qw(Mpp::Signature::c_compilation_md5); # Indicate
inheritance. <br>
our $shared_object = bless @ISA; # A piece of magic that
helps makepp find <br>
# the subroutines for this method. All <br>
# signature methods must have one of these. <br>
# The value is not used, just any object. <br>
# Now here&rsquo;s the method that gets called when we need
the signature of <br>
# any target or dependency for which this signature method
is active: <br>
sub signature { <br>
my ($self, # This will be the same as $shared_object. <br>
$finfo) = @_; # A special structure that contains everything
<br>
# makepp knows about this file. See <br>
# Mpp/File.pm for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ($finfo-&gt;{NAME} =~
/.s[oa]$/) { # Does the file name end in .so or .sa? <br>
return $finfo-&gt;file_exists ? &rsquo;exists&rsquo; :
&rsquo;&rsquo;; <br>
# Always return the same signature if the file <br>
# exists. In this case, the signature is the <br>
# string &quot;exists&quot;. <br>
}</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mpp::Signature::c_compilation_md5::signature;
<br>
# If the file didn&rsquo;t end in .so or .sa, <br>
# delegate to makepp&rsquo;s usual signature method. <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This file is provided as an
example in the makepp distribution, with some additional
comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incidentally, why don&rsquo;t we
make this the default? Well, there are times when changing a
shared library will require a relinking of your program. If
you ever change either the <br>
symbols that a shared library defines, or the symbols that
it depends on other libraries for, a relink may sometimes be
necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppose, for example, that the
shared library invokes some subroutines that your program
provides. E.g., suppose you change the shared library so it
now calls an external <br>
subroutine &quot;xyz()&quot;. Unless you use the
&quot;-E&quot; or &quot;--export-dynamic&quot; option to the
linker (for GNU binutils; other linkers have different
option names), the symbol &quot;xyz()&quot; may not <br>
be accessible to the run-time linker even if it exists in
your program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even worse, suppose you defined
&quot;xyz()&quot; in another library (call it libxyz), like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my_program: main.o lib1/lib1.so
xyz/libxyz.a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since &quot;libxyz&quot; is a .a
file and not a .so file, then &quot;xyz()&quot; may not be
pulled in correctly from libxyz.a unless you relink your
binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mpp::Signature methods also
control not only the string that is used to determine if a
file has changed, but the algorithm that is used to compare
the strings. For example, the <br>
signature method &quot;target_newer&quot; in the makepp
distribution merely requires that the targets be newer than
the dependencies, whereas the signature method
&quot;exact_match&quot; (and <br>
everything that depends on it, such as &quot;md5&quot; and
&quot;c_compilation_md5&quot;) requires that the file have
the same signature as on the last build.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are some other kinds of
signature methods that might be useful, to help you realize
the possibilities. If general purpose enough, some of these
may eventually be <br>
incorporated into makepp:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A signature
method for shared libraries that returns a checksum of all
the exported symbols, and also all the symbols that it needs
from other libraries. This solves the <br>
problem with the example above, and guarantees a correct
link under all circumstances. An experimental attempt has
been made to do this in the makepp distribution (see <br>
Mpp/Signature/shared_object.pm), but it will only work with
GNU binutils and ELF libraries at the moment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A signature
method that ignores a date stamp written into a file. E.g.,
if you generate a .c file automatically using some program
that insists on putting a string in like <br>
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">static char * date_stamp =
&quot;Generated automatically on 01 Apr 2004 by
nobody&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">you could write a signature
method that specifically ignores changes in date stamps.
Thus if the date stamp is the only thing that has changed,
makepp will not rebuild.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A signature
method that computes the signatures the normal way, but
ignores the architecture dependence when deciding whether to
rebuild. This could be useful for truly <br>
architecture-independent files; currently if you build on
one architecture, makepp will insist on rebuilding even
architecture-independent files when you switch to a <br>
different architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A signature
method that knows how to ignore comments in latex files, as
the &quot;c_compilation_md5&quot; method knows how to ignore
comments in C files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A signature
method for automatic documentation extraction that checksums
only to the comments that a documentation extractor needs
and ignores other changes to the source <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unfinished <br>
This document is not finished yet. It should cover how to
write your own scanners for include files and things like
that.</p>
