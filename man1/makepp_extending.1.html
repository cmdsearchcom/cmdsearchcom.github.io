<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Makepp internally is flexible enough so that by writing a little bit of Perl
  code, you can add functions or do a number of other operations.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="General_notes_on_writing_Perl_code_to_work_with_makepp"><a class="selflink" href="#General_notes_on_writing_Perl_code_to_work_with_makepp">General
  notes on writing Perl code to work with makepp</a></h2>
Each makefile lives in its own package. Thus definitions in one makefile do not
  affect definitions in another makefile. A common set of functions including
  all the standard textual manipulation functions is imported into the package
  when it is created.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Makefile variables are stored as Perl scalars in that package. (There are
  exceptions to this: automatic variables and the default value of variables
  like CC are actually implemented as functions with no arguments. Target
  specific vars, command line vars and environment vars are not seen this way.)
  Thus any Perl code you write has access to all makefile variables. Global
  variables are stored in the &quot;Mpp::global&quot; package. See Makefile
  variables for the details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each of the statements (ifperl / ifmakeperl, perl / makeperl, sub / makesub),
  the functions (perl / makeperl, map / makemap) and the rule action (perl /
  makeperl) for writing Perl code directly in the makefile come in two flavours.
  The first is absolutely normal Perl, meaning you have to use the
  &quot;f_&quot; prefix as explained in the next section, if you want to call
  makepp functions. The second variant first passes the statement through
  Make-style variable expansion, meaning you have to double the &quot;$&quot;s
  you want Perl to see.
<div class="Pp"></div>
End handling is special because makepp's huge (depending on your build system)
  data structures would take several seconds to garbage collect with a normal
  exit. So we do a brute force exit. In the main process you can still have
  &quot;END&quot; blocks but if you have any global file handles they may not
  get flushed. But you should be using the modern lexical filehandles, which get
  closed properly when going out of scope.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In Perl code run directly as a rule action or via a command you define, it is
  the opposite. &quot;END&quot; blocks will not be run, but global filehandles
  get flushed for you. The &quot;DESTROY&quot; of global objects will never be
  run.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Adding_new_textual_functions"><a class="selflink" href="#Adding_new_textual_functions">Adding
  new textual functions</a></h2>
You can add a new function to makepp's repertoire by simply defining a Perl
  subroutine of the same name but with a prefix of &quot;f_&quot;. For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    sub f_myfunc {
      my $argument = &amp;arg;      # Name the argument.
      my( undef, $mkfile, $mkfile_line ) = @_; # Name the arguments.
 
      ... do something here
 
      return $return_value;
    }
 
    XYZ := $(myfunc my func arguments)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If your function takes no arguments, there is nothing to do. If your function
  takes one argument, as in the example above, use the simple accessor &amp;arg
  to obtain it. If you expect more arguments, you need the more complex accessor
  &quot;args&quot; described below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
These accessors processes the same three parameters that should be passed to any
  &quot;f_&quot; function, namely the function arguments, the makefile object
  and a line descriptor for messages. Therefore you can use the efficient
  &amp;arg form in the first case.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &amp;arg accessor takes care of the following for you: If the arguments were
  already expanded (e.g. to find the name of the function in
  &quot;$(my$(function) arg)&quot; the arg is passed as a string and just
  returned. If the argument still needs expansion, this is the usual case, it is
  instead a reference to a string. The &amp;arg accessor expands it for you, for
  which it needs the makefile object as its 2nd parameter.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you expect more arguments, possibly in variable number, the job is performed
  by &quot;args&quot;. This accessor takes the same 3 parameters as arg, plus
  additional parameters:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">max: number of args (default 2): give ~0 (maxint) for
    endless</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">min: number of args (default 0 if max is ~0, else same as
    max)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">only_comma: don't eat space around commas, usual for
    non-filename</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
At most max, but at least min commas present before expansion are used to split
  the arguments. Some examples from makepp's builtin functions:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    my( $prefix, $text ) = args $_[0], $_[1], $_[2], 2, 2, 1; # addprefix
    for my $cond ( args $_[0], undef, $_[2], ~0 ) ... # and, or
    my @args= args $_[0], $_[1], $_[2], ~0, 1, 1; # call
    my( $filters, $words ) = args $_[0], $_[1], $_[2]; # filter
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The function should return a scalar string (not an array) which is then inserted
  into the text at that point.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If your function encounters an error, it should die using the usual Perl die
  statement. This will be trapped by makepp and an error message displaying the
  file name and the line number of the expression causing the error will be
  printed out.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are essentially no limits on what the function can do; you can access the
  file, run shell commands, etc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At present, expressions appearing in dependencies and in the rule actions are
  expanded once while expressions appearing in targets are expanded twice, so be
  careful if your function has side effects and is present in an expression for
  a target.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the environment (in particular, the cwd) in which the function
  evaluates will not necessarily match the environment in which the rules from
  the Makefile in which the function was evaluated are executed. If this is a
  problem for you, then your function probably ought to look something like
  this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    sub f_foo {
      ...
      chdir $makefile-&gt;{CWD};
 
      ... etc.
    }
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Putting_functions_into_a_Perl_module"><a class="selflink" href="#Putting_functions_into_a_Perl_module">Putting
  functions into a Perl module</a></h2>
If you put functions into an include file, you will have one copy per Makeppfile
  which uses it. To avoid that, you can write them as a normal Perl module with
  an &quot;Exporter&quot; interface, and use that. This will load faster and
  save memory:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    perl { use mymodule }
    perl {
        use my::module;         # put : on a new line so this is not parsed as a rule
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you need any of the functions normally available in a Makefile (like the
  &quot;f_&quot; functions, &quot;arg&quot; or &quot;args&quot;), you must put
  this line into your module:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use Mpp::Subs;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The drawback is that the module would be in a different package than a function
  directly appearing in a makefile. So you need to pass in everything as
  parameters, or construct names with Perl's &quot;caller&quot; function.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Calling_external_Perl_scripts"><a class="selflink" href="#Calling_external_Perl_scripts">Calling
  external Perl scripts</a></h2>
If you call an external Perl script via &quot;system&quot;, or as a rule action,
  makepp will fork a new process (unless it's the last rule action) and fire off
  a brand new perl interpreter. There's nothing wrong with that, except that
  there's a more efficient way:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&amp;<i>command arguments...</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This can be a rule action. It will call a function
      <i>command</i> with a &quot;c_&quot; prefix, and pass it the remaining
      (optionally quoted makepp style -- not exactly the same as Shell)
      arguments. If such a function cannot be found, this passes all strings to
      &quot;run&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    sub c_mycmd { my @args = @_; ... }
 
    $(phony callcmd):
        &amp;mycmd 'arg with space' arg2 &quot;arg3&quot; # calls c_mycmd
 
    %.out: %.in
        &amp;myscript -o $(output) $(input) # calls external myscript
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You can write your commands within the framework of the builtins, allowing
      you to use the same standard options as they have, and the I/O handling
      they give.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The block operator &quot;Mpp::Cmds::frame&quot; is followed by a single
      letter option list of the builtins (maximally &quot;qw(f i I o O r
      s)&quot;). Even if you specify your own option overriding one of these,
      you still give the single letter of the standard option.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Each own option is specified as &quot;[qw(n name), <i>\$ref</i>, <i>arg</i>,
      <i>sub</i>]&quot;. The first two elements are short and long name,
      followed by the variable reference and optionally by a boolean for whether
      to take an argument. Without an arg, the variable is incremented each time
      the option is given, else the option value is stored in it.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    sub c_my_ocmd {             # Typical output case
      local @ARGV = @_;
      Mpp::Cmds::frame {
 
        ... print something here with @ARGV, with options already automatically removed
 
      } 'f', qw(o O);
    }
 
    sub c_my_icmd {             # Typical input case with 2 options
      local @ARGV = @_;
      my( $short, $long );
      Mpp::Cmds::frame {
 
        ... do something here with &lt;&gt;
 
      } qw(i I r s),            # s specifies only --separator, not -s
        [qw(s short), \$short], # No option arg -&gt; $short == 1
        [qw(l long), \$long, 1, sub { warn &quot;got arg $long&quot;}];
    }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Here comes a simple command which upcases only the first character of each
      input record (equivalent to &quot;&amp;sed '$$_ =
      &quot;\u\L$$_&quot;'&quot;):
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    sub c_uc {
      local @ARGV = @_;
      Mpp::Cmds::frame {
        print &quot;\u\L$_&quot; while &lt;&gt;;
      } 'f', qw(i I o O r s);
    }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Within the block handled by frame, you can have nested blocks for performing
      critical operations, like opening other files.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    Mpp::Cmds::perform { ... } 'message';
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This will output message with &quot;--verbose&quot; (which every command
      accepts) iff the command is successfully run. But if the block evaluates
      as false, it dies with negated message.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">run <i>script arguments...</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is a normal Perl function you can use in any Perl
      context within your makefile. It is similar to the multi-argument form of
      system, but it runs the Perl script within the current process. For makepp
      statements, the perl function or your own functions that is the process
      running makepp. But for a rule that is the subprocess performing it. The
      script gets parsed as many times as it gets called, but you can put the
      real work into a lib, as pod2html does. This lib can then get used in the
      top level, so that it's already present:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    perl { use mylib }          # gets forked to all rules which needn't reparse it
 
    %.out: %.in
        makeperl { run qw'myscript -o $(output) $(input)' }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the script calls &quot;exit&quot;, closes standard file descriptors or
      relies on the system to clean up after it (open files, memory...), this
      can be a problem with &quot;run&quot;. If you call &quot;run&quot; within
      statements or the perl function, makepp can get disturbed or the cleanup
      only happens at the end of makepp.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you have one the aforementioned problems, run the script externally, i.e.
      as from the command line instead. Within a rule cleanup is less of a
      problem, especially not as the last action of a rule, since the rule
      subprocess will exit afterwards anyway, except on Windows.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Writing_your_own_signature_methods"><a class="selflink" href="#Writing_your_own_signature_methods">Writing
  your own signature methods</a></h2>
Sometimes you want makepp to compute a signature method using a different
  technique. For example, suppose you have a binary that depends on a shared
  library. Ordinarily, if you change the shared library, you don't have to
  relink executables that depend on it because the linking is done at run time.
  (However, it is possible that relinking the executable might be necessary,
  which is why I did not make this the default.) What you want makepp to do is
  to have the same signature for the shared library even if it changes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This can be accomplished in several ways. The easiest way is to create your own
  new signature method (let's call it &quot;shared_object&quot;). You would use
  this signature method only on rules that link binaries, like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    myprogram : *.o lib1/lib1.so lib2/lib2.so
        : signature shared_object
        $(CC) $(inputs) -o $(output)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now we have to create the signature method.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All signature methods must be their own class, and the class must contain a few
  special items (see Mpp/Signature.pm in the distribution for details). The
  class's name must be prefixed with &quot;Mpp::Signature::&quot;, so in this
  case our class should be called &quot;Mpp::Signature::shared_object&quot;. We
  have to create a file called <i>shared_object.pm</i> and put it into a
  <i>Mpp::Signature</i> directory somewhere in the Perl include path; the
  easiest place might be in the <i>Mpp/Signature</i> directory in the makepp
  installation (e.g., <i>/usr/local/share/makepp/Mpp/Signature</i> or wherever
  you installed it).
<div class="Pp"></div>
For precise details about what has to go in this class, you should look
  carefully through the file <i>Mpp/Signature.pm</i> and probably also
  <i>Mpp/Signature/exact_match.pm</i> in the makepp distribution. But in our
  case, all we want to do is to make a very small change to an existing
  signature mechanism; if the file is a shared library, we want to have a
  constant signature, whereas if the file is anything else, we want to rely on
  makepp's normal signature mechanism. The best way to do this is to inherit
  from &quot;Mpp::Signature::c_compilation_md5&quot;, which is the signature
  method that is usually chosen when makepp recognizes a link command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
So the file <i>Mpp/Signature/shared_object.pm</i> might contain the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use strict;
    package Mpp::Signature::shared_object;
    use Mpp::Signature::c_compilation_md5;
    our @ISA = qw(Mpp::Signature::c_compilation_md5); # Indicate inheritance.
    our $shared_object = bless \@ISA; # A piece of magic that helps makepp find
                                # the subroutines for this method.  All
                                # signature methods must have one of these.
                                # The value is not used, just any object.
    # Now here's the method that gets called when we need the signature of
    # any target or dependency for which this signature method is active:
    sub signature {
      my ($self,                 # This will be the same as $shared_object.
          $finfo) = @_;          # A special structure that contains everything
                                 # makepp knows about this file.  See
                                 # Mpp/File.pm for details.
 
      if ($finfo-&gt;{NAME} =~ /\.s[oa]$/) { # Does the file name end in .so or .sa?
        return $finfo-&gt;file_exists ? 'exists' : '';
                                 # Always return the same signature if the file
                                 # exists.  In this case, the signature is the
                                 # string &quot;exists&quot;.
      }
 
      Mpp::Signature::c_compilation_md5::signature;
                                 # If the file didn't end in .so or .sa,
                                 # delegate to makepp's usual signature method.
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This file is provided as an example in the makepp distribution, with some
  additional comments.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Incidentally, why don't we make this the default? Well, there are times when
  changing a shared library will require a relinking of your program. If you
  ever change either the symbols that a shared library defines, or the symbols
  that it depends on other libraries for, a relink may sometimes be necessary.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Suppose, for example, that the shared library invokes some subroutines that your
  program provides. E.g., suppose you change the shared library so it now calls
  an external subroutine &quot;xyz()&quot;. Unless you use the &quot;-E&quot; or
  &quot;--export-dynamic&quot; option to the linker (for GNU binutils; other
  linkers have different option names), the symbol &quot;xyz()&quot; may not be
  accessible to the run-time linker even if it exists in your program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Even worse, suppose you defined &quot;xyz()&quot; in another library (call it
  <i>libxyz</i>), like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    my_program: main.o lib1/lib1.so xyz/libxyz.a
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since &quot;libxyz&quot; is a <i>.a</i> file and not a <i>.so</i> file, then
  &quot;xyz()&quot; may not be pulled in correctly from <i>libxyz.a</i> unless
  you relink your binary.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mpp::Signature methods also control not only the string that is used to
  determine if a file has changed, but the algorithm that is used to compare the
  strings. For example, the signature method &quot;target_newer&quot; in the
  makepp distribution merely requires that the targets be newer than the
  dependencies, whereas the signature method &quot;exact_match&quot; (and
  everything that depends on it, such as &quot;md5&quot; and
  &quot;c_compilation_md5&quot;) requires that the file have the same signature
  as on the last build.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here are some other kinds of signature methods that might be useful, to help you
  realize the possibilities. If general purpose enough, some of these may
  eventually be incorporated into makepp:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A signature method for shared libraries that returns a
      checksum of all the exported symbols, and also all the symbols that it
      needs from other libraries. This solves the problem with the example
      above, and guarantees a correct link under all circumstances. An
      experimental attempt has been made to do this in the makepp distribution
      (see <i>Mpp/Signature/shared_object.pm</i>), but it will only work with
      GNU binutils and ELF libraries at the moment.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A signature method that ignores a date stamp written into a
      file. E.g., if you generate a <i>.c</i> file automatically using some
      program that insists on putting a string in like this:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    static char * date_stamp = &quot;Generated automatically on 01 Apr 2004 by nobody&quot;;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    you could write a signature method that specifically ignores changes in date
      stamps. Thus if the date stamp is the only thing that has changed, makepp
      will not rebuild.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A signature method that computes the signatures the normal
      way, but ignores the architecture dependence when deciding whether to
      rebuild. This could be useful for truly architecture-independent files;
      currently if you build on one architecture, makepp will insist on
      rebuilding even architecture-independent files when you switch to a
      different architecture.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A signature method that knows how to ignore comments in
      latex files, as the &quot;c_compilation_md5&quot; method knows how to
      ignore comments in C files.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
