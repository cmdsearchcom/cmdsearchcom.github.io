<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pnmmercator - transform a worldmap from rectangular
projection to Mercator projection and vice-versa</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pnmmercator [-inverse] [-nomix] [-[v]verbose] [filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimum unique abbreviation of
option is acceptable. You may use double hyphens instead of
single hyphen to denote options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pnmmercator utility,
converts a rectangular projection worldmap to a Mercator
projection format, as used for maps.google.com and many
other online maps. The map used as <br>
input for pnmmercator must have rows for -90 to 90 degrees
latitude and columns for -180 to +180 degrees longitude. The
file will typically be twice as wide as high, but this is
<br>
not a requirement. The output file will be using the
Mercator projection
&acirc;&uml;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection&acirc;&copy;
and will get double the height of the input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Maps using the Mercator
projection are stretched more the closer a row is to the
North or South Pole. The last few degrees (&gt; 85 or &lt;
-85 degrees) are not part of a Mercator map <br>
at all because they would be stretched too much and the rows
close to the edge will show banding, because they originate
from the same row in the original map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To overcome this, the program
will by default do interpolation of pixel colors, which will
eliminate the banding effect, but will cause some blurring
of the output. With the <br>
-nomix option, this interpolation of colors isn&rsquo;t
applied. You can obtain the highest quality output by
starting with an input map of high resolution, so that you
can follow the <br>
pnmmercator transformation with a pamscale reduction in
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program can also convert a
Mercator projection map back to a rectangular projection
based. As said, the Mercator map doesn&rsquo;t have
information about the latitudes close to <br>
the poles. Therefore the top rows in the output image will
be identical and copied from the row corresponding with
latitude of 85 degrees. The same at the bottom of the
map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pnmmercator doesn&rsquo;t have
any provision for scaling the image. You can scale by piping
the output of the program through Netpbm programs such as
pamscale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can find maps to be used as
input at flatplanet.sourceforge.net(1)</p>

.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The point of a Mercator
projection map is that compass directions work on it. If you
draw a straight line northeast from some point on the
Mercator map, the line traces the <br>
course you would sail if you sailed a compass bearing of
northeast from that spot. Naturally, primitive navigators
appreciated that. The biggest drawback of Mercator is that
<br>
areas to the north and south appear much larger than they
are in real life. For example, Greenland appears to be
larger than South America even though it only a ninth as
large. <br>
Note that areas away from the equator are stretched
north-south as well as east-west.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A rectangular projection is one
where vertical distance is proportional to angular latitude
distance of the represented area and horizontal distance is
proportional to angular <br>
longitude.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS <br>
filename is the name of the input file. If you don&rsquo;t
specify this, pnmmercator reads the image from standard
Input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
&lt;dl compact=&quot;compact&quot;&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-inverse</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With this option a conversion
from Mercator to degrees is applied.The output image will
have half the height of the input map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nomix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default behaviour is that color
blending is applied in between two adjacent rows. If you
specify the -nomix parameter there is no blending. The
consequence is a banding at <br>
the top and bottom of the map. With this option, the output
map will also consist of exactly the same colors as the
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose and -vverbose</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This parameter outputs some
additional information. If you double the &rsquo;v&rsquo;,
it will output debug data about the lat/long degree and
Mercator conversions.</p>

pnmmercator was new in Netpbm 10.49 (December 2009).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
Willem van Schaik (of pnmtopng/pngtopnm fame) wrote this
program in October 2009 and suggested it for inclusion in
Netpbm.</p>
