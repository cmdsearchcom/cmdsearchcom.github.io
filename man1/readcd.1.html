<p>READOM(1) Schily&Acirc;&acute;s USER COMMANDS
READOM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
readom - read or write data Compact Discs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
readom dev=device [ options ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Readom is used to read or write Compact Discs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The device refers to a device
location similar to the one used in the wodim command. Refer
to its manpage for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also note that this version of
readom uses a modified libusal library which has a different
behaviour compared to the one distributed by its original
author.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
If no options except the dev= option have been specified,
readom goes into interactive mode. Select a primary function
and then follow the instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Print version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dev=target <br>
Sets the SCSI target for the drive, see notes above. A
typical device specification is dev=6,0 . If a filename must
be provided together with the numerical target speci&acirc;
<br>
fication, the filename is implementation specific. The
correct filename in this case can be found in the system
specific manuals of the target operating system. On a <br>
FreeBSD system without CAM support, you need to use the
control device (e.g. /dev/rcd0.ctl). A correct device
specification in this case may be dev=/dev/rcd0.ctl:@ .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Linux, drives connected to a
parallel port adapter are mapped to a virtual SCSI bus.
Different adapters are mapped to different targets on this
virtual SCSI bus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no dev option is present,
readom will try to get the device from the CDR_DEVICE
environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the argument to the dev=
option does not contain the characters &rsquo;,&rsquo;,
&rsquo;/&rsquo;, &rsquo;@&rsquo; or &rsquo;:&rsquo;, it is
interpreted as an label name that may be found in the file
/etc/wodim.conf <br>
(see FILES section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeout=# <br>
Set the default SCSI command timeout value to # seconds. The
default SCSI command timeout is the minimum timeout used for
sending SCSI commands. If a SCSI command fails <br>
due to a timeout, you may try to raise the default SCSI
command timeout above the timeout value of the failed
command. If the command runs correctly with a raised command
<br>
timeout, please report the better timeout value and the
corresponding command to the author of the program. If no
timeout option is present, a default timeout of 40
sec&acirc; <br>
onds is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug=#, -d <br>
Set the misc debug value to # (with debug=#) or increment
the misc debug level by one (with -d). If you specify -dd,
this equals to debug=2. This may help to find prob&acirc;
<br>
lems while opening a driver for libusal. as well as with
sector sizes and sector types. Using -debug slows down the
process and may be the reason for a buffer underrun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kdebug=#, kd=# <br>
Tell the usal-driver to modify the kernel debug value while
SCSI commands are running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-silent, -s <br>
Do not print out a status report for failed SCSI
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Increment the level of
general verbosity by one. This is used e.g. to display the
progress of the process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Increment the verbose level
with respect of SCSI command transport by one. This helps to
debug problems during the process, that occur in the
CD-Recorder. If you get <br>
incomprehensible error messages you should use this flag to
get more detailed output. -VV will show data buffer content
in addition. Using -V or -VV slows down the <br>
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f=file Specify the filename
where the output should be written or the input should be
taken from. Using &rsquo;-&rsquo; as filename will cause
readom to use stdout resp. stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Switch to write mode. If this
option is not present, readom reads from the specified
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c2scan <br>
Scans the whole CD or the range specified by the
sectors=range for C2 errors. C2 errors are errors that are
uncorrectable after the second stage of the 24/28 + 28/32
Reed <br>
Solomon correction system at audio level (2352 bytes sector
size). If an audio CD has C2 errors, interpolation is needed
to hide the errors. If a data CD has C2 errors, <br>
these errors are in most cases corrected by the ECC/EDC code
that makes 2352 bytes out of 2048 data bytes. The ECC/EDC
code should be able to correct about 100 C2 error <br>
bytes per sector.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you find C2 errors you may
want to reduce the speed using the speed= option as C2
errors may be a result of dynamic unbalance on the
medium.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-scanbus <br>
Scan all SCSI devices on all SCSI busses and print the
inquiry strings. This option may be used to find SCSI
address of the devices on a system. The numbers printed out
<br>
as labels are computed by: bus * 100 + target</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sectors=range <br>
Specify a sector range that should be read. The range is
specified by the starting sector number, a minus sign and
the ending sector number. The end sector is not <br>
included in the list, so sectors=0-0 will not read anything
and may be used to check for a CD in the drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">speed=# <br>
Set the speed factor of the read or write process to #. # is
an integer, representing a multiple of the audio speed. This
is about 150 KB/s for CD-ROM and about 172 KB/s <br>
for CD-Audio. If no speed option is present, readom will use
maximum speed. Only MMC compliant drives will benefit from
this option. The speed of non MMC drives is not <br>
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using a lower speed may increase
the readability of a CD or DVD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ts=# Set the maximum transfer
size for a single SCSI command to #. The syntax for the ts=
option is the same as for wodim fs=# or sdd bs=#.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no ts= option has been
specified, readom defaults to a transfer size of 256 kB. If
libusal gets lower values from the operating system, the
value is reduced to the max&acirc; <br>
imum value that is possible with the current operating
system. Sometimes, it may help to further reduce the
transfer size or to enhance it, but note that it may take a
<br>
long time to find a better value by experimenting with the
ts= option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-notrunc <br>
Do not truncate the output file when opening it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fulltoc <br>
Retrieve a full TOC from the current disk and print it in
hex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-clone Do a clone read. Read the
CD with all sub-channel data and a full TOC. The full TOC
data will be put into a file with similar name as with the
f= option but the suffix <br>
.toc added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noerror <br>
Do not abort if the high level error checking in readom
found an uncorrectable error in the data stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nocorr <br>
Switch the drive into a mode where it ignores read errors in
data sectors that are a result of uncorrectable ECC/EDC
errors before reading. If readom completes, the error <br>
recovery mode of the drive is switched back to the
remembered old mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">retries=# <br>
Set the retry count for high level retries in readom to #.
The default is to do 128 retries which may be too much if
you like to read a CD with many unreadable sectors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-overhead <br>
Meter the SCSI command overhead time. This is done by
executing several commands 1000 times and printing the total
time used. If you divide the displayed times by 1000, <br>
you get the average overhead time for a single command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">meshpoints=# <br>
Print read-speed at # locations. The purpose of this option
is to create a list of read speed values suitable for e.g.
gnuplot. The speed values are calculated assuming <br>
that 1000 bytes are one kilobyte as documented in the SCSI
standard. The output data created for this purpose is
written to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-factor <br>
Output the speed values for meshpoints=# as factor based on
single speed of the current medium. This only works if
readom is able to determine the current medium type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
For all examples below, it will be assumed that the drive is
connected to the primary SCSI bus of the machine. The SCSI
target id is set to 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To read the complete media from
a CD-ROM writing the data to the file cdimage.raw:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readom dev=2,0 f=cdimage.raw</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To read sectors from range 150
... 10000 from a CD-ROM writing the data to the file
cdimage.raw:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readom dev=2,0 sectors=150-10000
f=cdimage.raw</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To write the data from the file
cdimage.raw (e.g. a filesystem image from genisoimage) to a
DVD-RAM, call:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readom dev=2,0 -w
f=cdimage.raw</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
RSH If the RSH environment is present, the remote connection
will not be created via rcmd(3) but by calling the program
pointed to by RSH. Use e.g. RSH=/usr/bin/ssh to cre&acirc;
<br>
ate a secure shell connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this forces wodim to
create a pipe to the rsh(1) program and disallows wodim to
directly access the network socket to the remote server.
This makes it impossi&acirc; <br>
ble to set up performance parameters and slows down the
connection compared to a root initiated rcmd(3)
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RSCSI If the RSCSI environment
is present, the remote SCSI server will not be the program
/opt/schily/sbin/rscsi but the program pointed to by RSCSI.
Note that the remote SCSI <br>
server program name will be ignored if you log in using an
account that has been created with a remote SCSI server
program as login shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
wodim(1), genisoimage(1), rcmd(3), ssh(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Unless you want to risk getting problems, readom should be
run as root. If you don&rsquo;t want to allow users to
become root on your system, readom may safely be installed
suid root. <br>
For more information see the additional notes of your
system/program distribution or README.suidroot which is part
of the Cdrkit source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documentation of the wodim
program contains more technical details which could also
apply to readom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
A typical error message for a SCSI command looks like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readom: I/O error. test unit
ready: scsi sendcmd: no error <br>
CDB: 00 20 00 00 00 00 <br>
status: 0x2 (CHECK CONDITION) <br>
Sense Bytes: 70 00 05 00 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00 00 25 00 00 00
00 00 <br>
Sense Key: 0x5 Illegal Request, Segment 0 <br>
Sense Code: 0x25 Qual 0x00 (logical unit not supported) Fru
0x0 <br>
Sense flags: Blk 0 (not valid) <br>
cmd finished after 0.002s timeout 40s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first line gives information
about the transport of the command. The text after the first
colon gives the error text for the system call from the view
of the kernel. It usu&acirc; <br>
ally is: I/O error unless other problems happen. The next
words contain a short description for the SCSI command that
fails. The rest of the line tells you if there were any <br>
problems for the transport of the command over the SCSI bus.
fatal error means that it was not possible to transport the
command (i.e. no device present at the requested SCSI <br>
address).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second line prints the SCSI
command descriptor block for the failed command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third line gives information
on the SCSI status code returned by the command, if the
transport of the command succeeds. This is error information
from the SCSI device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fourth line is a hex dump of
the auto request sense information for the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fifth line is the error text
for the sense key if available, followed by the segment
number that is only valid if the command was a copy command.
If the error message is not <br>
directly related to the current command, the text deferred
error is appended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sixth line is the error text
for the sense code and the sense qualifier if available. If
the type of the device is known, the sense data is decoded
from tables in scsierrs.c <br>
. The text is followed by the error value for a field
replaceable unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The seventh line prints the
block number that is related to the failed command and text
for several error flags. The block number may not be
valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The eight line reports the
timeout set up for this command and the time that the
command really needed to complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The readom program described here is the Cdrkit spinoff from
the original readcd application (see AUTHOR section for
details). It may contain bugs not present in the original
<br>
implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is definitely less portable
than the original implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For platform specific bugs, see
the corresponding README.platform file in the Cdrkit
documentation (eg. README.linux).</p>
