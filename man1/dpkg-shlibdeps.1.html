<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dpkg-shlibdeps - generate shared library substvar
dependencies</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dpkg-shlibdeps [option...] [-e]executable [option...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dpkg-shlibdeps calculates shared library dependencies for
executables named in its arguments. The dependencies are
added to the substitution variables file debian/substvars as
<br>
variable names shlibs:dependency-field where
dependency-field is a dependency field name. Any other
variables starting with shlibs: are removed from the
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpkg-shlibdeps has two possible
sources of information to generate dependency information.
Either symbols files or shlibs files. For each binary that
dpkg-shlibdeps analyzes, it <br>
finds out the list of libraries that it&rsquo;s linked with.
Then, for each library, it looks up either the symbols file,
or the shlibs file (if the former doesn&rsquo;t exist or if
<br>
debian/shlibs.local contains the relevant dependency). Both
files are supposed to be provided by the library package and
should thus be available as /var/lib/dpkg/info/pack&acirc;
<br>
age.symbols or /var/lib/dpkg/info/package.shlibs. The
package name is identified in two steps: find the library
file on the system (looking in the same directories that
ld.so <br>
would use), then use dpkg -S library-file to lookup the
package providing the library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Symbols files <br>
Symbols files contain finer-grained dependency information
by providing the minimum dependency for each symbol that the
library exports. The script tries to find a symbols file
<br>
associated to a library package in the following places
(first match is used):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debian/*/DEBIAN/symbols <br>
Shared library information generated by the current build
process that also invoked dpkg-shlibdeps. They are generated
by dpkg-gensymbols(1). They are only used if the <br>
library is found in a package&rsquo;s build tree. The
symbols file in that build tree takes precedence over
symbols files from other binary packages.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/dpkg/symbols/package.symbols.arch</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/dpkg/symbols/package.symbols
<br>
Per-system overriding shared library dependency information.
arch is the architecture of the current system (obtained by
dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_ARCH).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output from &acirc;dpkg-query
--control-path package symbols&acirc; <br>
Package-provided shared library dependency information.
Unless overridden by --admindir, those files are located in
/var/lib/dpkg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While scanning the symbols used
by all binaries, dpkg-shlibdeps remembers the (biggest)
minimal version needed for each library. At the end of the
process, it is able to write <br>
out the minimal dependency for every library used (provided
that the information of the symbols files are accurate).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a safe-guard measure, a
symbols file can provide a Build-Depends-Package
meta-information field and dpkg-shlibdeps will extract the
minimal version required by the correspond&acirc; <br>
ing package in the Build-Depends field and use this version
if it&rsquo;s higher than the minimal version computed by
scanning symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shlibs files <br>
Shlibs files associate directly a library to a dependency
(without looking at the symbols). It&rsquo;s thus often
stronger than really needed but very safe and easy to
handle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dependencies for a library
are looked up in several places. The first file providing
information for the library of interest is used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debian/shlibs.local <br>
Package-local overriding shared library dependency
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/dpkg/shlibs.override <br>
Per-system overriding shared library dependency
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debian/*/DEBIAN/shlibs <br>
Shared library information generated by the current build
process that also invoked dpkg-shlibdeps. They are only used
if the library is found in a package&rsquo;s build tree.
<br>
The shlibs file in that build tree takes precedence over
shlibs files from other binary packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output from &acirc;dpkg-query
--control-path package shlibs&acirc; <br>
Package-provided shared library dependency information.
Unless overridden by --admindir, those files are located in
/var/lib/dpkg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/dpkg/shlibs.default <br>
Per-system default shared library dependency
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The extracted dependencies are
then directly used (except if they are filtered out because
they have been identified as duplicate, or as weaker than
another dependency).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
dpkg-shlibdeps interprets non-option arguments as executable
names, just as if they&rsquo;d been supplied as
-eexecutable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-eexecutable <br>
Include dependencies appropriate for the shared libraries
required by executable. This option can be used multiple
times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ldirectory <br>
Prepend directory to the list of directories to search for
private shared libraries (since dpkg 1.17.0). This option
can be used multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Use this option instead of
setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH, as that environment variable is
used to control the run-time linker and abusing it to set
the shared library <br>
paths at build-time can be problematic when cross-compiling
for example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ddependency-field <br>
Add dependencies to be added to the control file dependency
field dependency-field. (The dependencies for this field are
placed in the variable shlibs:dependency-field.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -ddependency-field option
takes effect for all executables after the option, until the
next -ddependency-field. The default dependency-field is
Depends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the same dependency entry (or
set of alternatives) appears in more than one of the
recognized dependency field names Pre-Depends, Depends,
Recommends, Enhances or Sug&acirc; <br>
gests then dpkg-shlibdeps will automatically remove the
dependency from all fields except the one representing the
most important dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pvarname-prefix <br>
Start substitution variables with varname-prefix: instead of
shlibs:. Likewise, any existing substitution variables
starting with varname-prefix: (rather than shlibs:) <br>
are removed from the substitution variables file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O[filename] <br>
Print substitution variable settings to standard output (or
filename if specified, since dpkg 1.17.2), rather than being
added to the substitution variables file <br>
(debian/substvars by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ttype Prefer shared library
dependency information tagged for the given package type. If
no tagged information is available, falls back to untagged
information. The default <br>
package type is deb. Shared library dependency information
is tagged for a given type by prefixing it with the name of
the type, a colon, and whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Llocal-shlibs-file <br>
Read overriding shared library dependency information from
local-shlibs-file instead of debian/shlibs.local.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Tsubstvars-file <br>
Write substitution variables in substvars-file; the default
is debian/substvars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Enable verbose mode (since
dpkg 1.14.8). Numerous messages are displayed to explain
what dpkg-shlibdeps does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xpackage <br>
Exclude the package from the generated dependencies (since
dpkg 1.14.8). This is useful to avoid self-dependencies for
packages which provide ELF binaries (executables or <br>
library plugins) using a library contained in the same
package. This option can be used multiple times to exclude
several packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Spackage-build-dir <br>
Look into package-build-dir first when trying to find a
library (since dpkg 1.14.15). This is useful when the source
package builds multiple flavors of the same library <br>
and you want to ensure that you get the dependency from a
given binary package. You can use this option multiple
times: directories will be tried in the same order before
<br>
directories of other binary packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ipackage-build-dir <br>
Ignore package-build-dir when looking for shlibs, symbols,
and shared library files (since dpkg 1.18.5). You can use
this option multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-missing-info <br>
Do not fail if dependency information can&rsquo;t be found
for a shared library (since dpkg 1.14.8). Usage of this
option is discouraged, all libraries should provide
depen&acirc; <br>
dency information (either with shlibs files, or with symbols
files) even if they are not yet used by other packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--warnings=value <br>
value is a bit field defining the set of warnings that can
be emitted by dpkg-shlibdeps (since dpkg 1.14.17). Bit 0
(value=1) enables the warning &acirc;symbol sym used by <br>
binary found in none of the libraries&acirc;, bit 1
(value=2) enables the warning &acirc;package could avoid a
useless dependency&acirc; and bit 2 (value=4) enables the
warning &acirc;binary <br>
should not be linked against library&acirc;. The default
value is 3: the first two warnings are active by default,
the last one is not. Set value to 7 if you want all warnings
<br>
to be active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--admindir=dir <br>
Change the location of the dpkg database (since dpkg
1.14.0). The default location is /var/lib/dpkg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Show the usage message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Show the version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Warnings <br>
Since dpkg-shlibdeps analyzes the set of symbols used by
each binary of the generated package, it is able to emit
warnings in several cases. They inform you of things that
can be <br>
improved in the package. In most cases, those improvements
concern the upstream sources directly. By order of
decreasing importance, here are the various warnings that
you can <br>
encounter:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">symbol sym used by binary found
in none of the libraries. <br>
The indicated symbol has not been found in the libraries
linked with the binary. The binary is most likely a library
and it needs to be linked with an additional library <br>
during the build process (option -llibrary of the
linker).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">binary contains an unresolvable
reference to symbol sym: it&rsquo;s probably a plugin <br>
The indicated symbol has not been found in the libraries
linked with the binary. The binary is most likely a plugin
and the symbol is probably provided by the program that <br>
loads this plugin. In theory a plugin doesn&rsquo;t have any
SONAME but this binary does have one and as such it could
not be clearly identified as such. However the fact that
<br>
the binary is stored in a non-public directory is a strong
indication that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not a normal shared
library. If the binary is really a plugin, then disregard
this warn&acirc; <br>
ing. But there&rsquo;s always the possibility that
it&rsquo;s a real library and that programs linking to it
are using an RPATH so that the dynamic loader finds it. In
that case, the <br>
library is broken and needs to be fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package could avoid a useless
dependency if binary was not linked against library (it uses
none of the library&rsquo;s symbols) <br>
None of the binaries that are linked with library use any of
the symbols provided by the library. By fixing all the
binaries, you would avoid the dependency associated to <br>
this library (unless the same dependency is also generated
by another library that is really used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package could avoid a useless
dependency if binaries were not linked against library (they
use none of the library&rsquo;s symbols) <br>
Exactly the same as the above warning, but for multiple
binaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">binary should not be linked
against library (it uses none of the library&rsquo;s
symbols) <br>
The binary is linked to a library that it doesn&rsquo;t
need. It&rsquo;s not a problem but some small performance
improvements in binary load time can be obtained by not
linking this <br>
library to this binary. This warning checks the same
information as the previous one but does it for each binary
instead of doing the check globally on all binaries
ana&acirc; <br>
lyzed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Errors <br>
dpkg-shlibdeps will fail if it can&rsquo;t find a public
library used by a binary or if this library has no
associated dependency information (either shlibs file or
symbols file). A <br>
public library has a SONAME and is versioned
(libsomething.so.X). A private library (like a plugin)
should not have a SONAME and doesn&rsquo;t need to be
versioned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">couldn&rsquo;t find library
library-soname needed by binary (its RPATH is
&rsquo;rpath&rsquo;) <br>
The binary uses a library called library-soname but
dpkg-shlibdeps has been unable to find the library.
dpkg-shlibdeps creates a list of directories to check as
follow&acirc; <br>
ing: directories listed in the RPATH of the binary,
directories added by the -l option, directories listed in
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, cross multiarch
<br>
directories (ex. /lib/arm64-linux-gnu,
/usr/lib/arm64-linux-gnu), standard public directories
(/lib, /usr/lib), directories listed in /etc/ld.so.conf, and
obsolete multi&acirc; <br>
lib directories (/lib32, /usr/lib32, /lib64, /usr/lib64).
Then it checks those directories in the package&rsquo;s
build tree of the binary being analyzed, in the
packages&rsquo; <br>
build trees indicated with the -S command-line option, in
other packages&rsquo; build trees that contains a
DEBIAN/shlibs or DEBIAN/symbols file and finally in the root
direc&acirc; <br>
tory. If the library is not found in any of those
directories, then you get this error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the library not found is in a
private directory of the same package, then you want to add
the directory with -l. If it&rsquo;s in another binary
package being built, you want <br>
to make sure that the shlibs/symbols file of this package is
already created and that -l contains the appropriate
directory if it also is in a private directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no dependency information found
for library-file (used by binary). <br>
The library needed by binary has been found by
dpkg-shlibdeps in library-file but dpkg-shlibdeps has been
unable to find any dependency information for that library.
To <br>
find out the dependency, it has tried to map the library to
a Debian package with the help of dpkg -S library-file. Then
it checked the corresponding shlibs and symbols <br>
files in /var/lib/dpkg/info/, and in the various
package&rsquo;s build trees (debian/*/DEBIAN/).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This failure can be caused by a
bad or missing shlibs or symbols file in the package of the
library. It might also happen if the library is built within
the same source <br>
package and if the shlibs files has not yet been created (in
which case you must fix debian/rules to create the shlibs
before calling dpkg-shlibdeps). Bad RPATH can also <br>
lead to the library being found under a non-canonical name
(example: /usr/lib/openoffice.org/../lib/libssl.so.0.9.8
instead of /usr/lib/libssl.so.0.9.8) that&rsquo;s not
associ&acirc; <br>
ated to any package, dpkg-shlibdeps tries to work around
this by trying to fallback on a canonical name (using
realpath(3)) but it might not always work. It&rsquo;s always
best <br>
to clean up the RPATH of the binary to avoid problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Calling dpkg-shlibdeps in
verbose mode (-v) will provide much more information about
where it tried to find the dependency information. This
might be useful if you don&rsquo;t <br>
understand why it&rsquo;s giving you this error.</p>
