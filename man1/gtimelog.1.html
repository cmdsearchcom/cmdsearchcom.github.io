<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gtimelog - minimal time logging application</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSYS <br>
gtimelog [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gtimelog provides a time tracking application to allow the
user to track what they work on during the day and how long
they spend doing it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s how it works: every
day, when you arrive to work, start up gtimelog and type
&quot;arrived&quot;. Then start doing some activity (e.g.
reading mail, or working on a task). When&acirc; <br>
ever you stop doing an activity (either when you have
finished it, or when you switch to working on something
else), type the name of the activity into the gtimelog
prompt. Try <br>
to use the same text if you make several entries for an
activity (history helps here &acirc; just use the up and
down arrow keys). The key principle is to name the activity
after <br>
you&rsquo;ve stopped working on it, and not when
you&rsquo;ve started. Of course you can type the activity
name upfront, and just delay pressing the Enter key until
you&rsquo;re done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two broad categories
of activities: ones that count as work (coding, planning,
writing proposals or reports, answering work-related email),
and ones that don&rsquo;t (brows&acirc; <br>
ing the web for fun, reading personal email, chatting with a
friend on the phone for two hours, going out for a lunch
break). To indicate which activities are not work related
<br>
add two asterisks to the activity name:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lunch ** <br>
browsing slashdot ** <br>
napping on the couch **</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want some activity (or
non-activity) to be completely omitted from the reports, use
three asterisks:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">break ***</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gtimelog displays all the things
you&rsquo;ve done today, calculates the total time you spent
working, and the total time you spent &quot;slacking&quot;.
It also advises you how much time you <br>
still have to work today to get 8 hours of work done. There
are two basic views: one shows all the activities in
chronological order, with starting and ending times, while
<br>
another groups all entries with the same into one activity
and just shows the total duration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the end of the day you can
send off a daily report by choosing Report -&gt; Daily
Report. A mail program (Mutt in a terminal, unless you have
changed it in ~/.gtimelog/gtimelo&acirc; <br>
grc or ~/.config/gtimelog/gtimelogrc) will be started with
all the activities listed in it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you make a mistake and type
in the wrong activity name, or just forget to enter an
activity, don&rsquo;t worry. gtimelog stores the time log in
a simple plain text file <br>
~/.gtimelog/timelog.txt (or
~/.local/share/gtimelog/timelog.txt). Every line contains a
timestamp and the name of the activity that was finished at
the time. All other lines <br>
are ignored, so you can add comments if you want to &acirc;
just make sure no comment begins with a timestamp. You do
not have to worry about gtimelog overwriting your changes
&acirc; <br>
gtimelog always appends entries at the end of the file, and
does not keep the log file open all the time. You do have to
worry about overwriting changes made by gtimelog with <br>
your editor &acirc; make sure you do not enter any
activities in gtimelog while you have timelog.txt open in a
text editor.</p>
