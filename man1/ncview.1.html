<p>NCVIEW(1) General Commands Manual NCVIEW(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ncview - graphically display netCDF files under X
windows</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ncview [-beep] [-copying] [-frames] [-warranty] [-private]
[-ncolors XX] [-extrainfo] [-mtitle &quot;title&quot;]
[-minmax fast | med | slow | all] datafiles ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ncview displays 2-D slices of a netCDF data file, using the
X Window System graphical user interface (Release 4 or
higher). You can examine different floating point variables
in <br>
the file, and animate the floating point data along the
&lsquo;&lsquo;record dimension&rsquo;&rsquo; (usually time)
to see how it evolves. You can also display 1-D (line plot)
views of the data simply <br>
by clicking the mouse on the point of interest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you first invoke ncview, a
command panel comes up which has a number of buttons for
manipulating the current view into the data file, and
presenting various information <br>
about the current view. From the top, going down, the
information fields are: the &rsquo;title&rsquo; of the data
file; the &rsquo;long_name&rsquo; of the currently selected
variable; the frame number <br>
(i.e., place along the scan axis) currently displayed; the
minimum and maximum values of the variable; and the value of
the data point under the cursor (only active when the <br>
pointer is over the color contour image).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next comes a row of buttons
similar to a tape recorder, used for changing the view into
the netCDF file along the scan dimension. In Version 1.XX of
ncview, the scan dimension <br>
is constrained to be the &lsquo;&lsquo;record
dimension&rsquo;&rsquo; (in netCDF parlance). From the left,
the buttons are: the quit button; a button to take you
directly to the first frame, marked <br>
&quot;-&gt;1&quot;; rewind, which loops the images going
backwards; step backwards; pause; step forwards; and fast
forward, which loops the images going forwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Below this is the row of option
buttons, which from the left are: the colormap button,
labeled with the name of the current colormap (see below);
&quot;Inv P&quot;, which inverts the phys&acirc; <br>
ical representation of the data (flips it upside-down);
&quot;Inv C&quot;, which inverts the colors currently being
used so that the colors indicating minimum and maximum are
switched; the <br>
magnification button, which sets how much image expansion
the image undergoes; and the transformation button, which
determines what preprocessing the data undergoes before
dis&acirc; <br>
play. For this button, &quot;Linear&quot; means no
preprocessing, &quot;Low&quot; means that the data is raised
to the fourth power before conversion to a pixel, so that
low values are emphasized; <br>
and &quot;Hi&quot; means that the fourth root of the data is
taken before conversion, so that large values are
emphasized. Next comes &quot;Set Dim&quot;; pressing this
pops up a window which <br>
allows you to determine which variables are shown on the X
and Y axes. Note that Version 1.XX of ncview will not
transpose your data! This means that, for example, you
cannot <br>
simultaneously display the X dimension along the Y axis
while displaying the Y dimension along the X axis---that
would be an attempt to transpose the data. You can display
the X <br>
dimension along the Y axis if some other variable which
varies less rapidly in your particular data file (for
example, depth) is on the X axis. Such a configuration is
possible <br>
because it involves no transposition of data. In general you
don&rsquo;t have to worry about this issue much, because if
you attempt to pick axes which would be transposing the
data, <br>
ncview switches them (and tells you that it&rsquo;s doing
so!) so you can get the axes you want. Note that there is
never any ambiguity about which dimensions are being
displayed on <br>
what axes; that information is always shown in the main
panel. Next is &quot;range&quot;, which pops up dialog boxes
to set the data min and maxes which will be contoured.
Pressing with <br>
the RIGHTMOST mouse button on the &quot;range&quot; button
resets the ranges to match the currently displayed slice;
this is a VERY useful option, so remember it and make use of
it fre&acirc; <br>
quently! The last button shows the method currently employed
for expanding the data onto the screen; the default,
&quot;bi-lin&quot;, performes a bi-linear interpolation.
Also available <br>
is &quot;repl&quot;, which simply replicates the pixels and
is somewhat faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next row of buttons shows
what variables can be displayed from the input files. Note
that when ncview first comes up, if there is more than one
variable in the file, you <br>
must select a variable to display before you will see
anything. If there is only one variable in the file, the
selection defaults to that one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Below the variable selection
buttons are the dimension information fields. All the
dimensions for the displayed variable which can take on more
than one value are shown here, <br>
one variable to a line. In each line, there are 6 fields of
information; from left to right, they are: &quot;Dim&quot;,
the Dimension identifier, which is &lsquo;Scan&rsquo; if the
dimension is cur&acirc; <br>
rently the scanned dimension (i.e., the dimension accessed
via the tape-recorder style buttons), &lsquo;X&rsquo; if the
dimension appears in the color contour display along the x
axis, or <br>
&lsquo;Y&rsquo; if it appears in the color display along the
y axis. This field will be blank if it isn&rsquo;t Scan, X,
or Y. Next come &quot;Name&quot;, the dimension&rsquo;s
short name; &quot;Min&quot;, the minimum <br>
value of the dimension; &quot;Current&quot;, the current
value of the dimension as displayed in the color contour
panel; &quot;Max&quot;, the maximum value of the dimension;
and &quot;Units&quot;, the dimen&acirc; <br>
sion&rsquo;s units. Clicking on the &quot;Current&quot;
field of a dimension allows you to change the current value
of that dimension. Clicking with the left mouse button
increases the current <br>
value of that dimension; clicking with the right button
decreases it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POPUP X-Y GRAPH <br>
You can get a popup X-Y (line) graph of data at a point
simply by clicking on the point of interest. You have
several options at this point; with the bottons at the
bottom of <br>
the window you can change the axis along which the data is
graphed (if there are other axes available), use log scaling
for the X and/or Y axis, and set the data range. You can
<br>
also dump out the data from the X-Y plot into an text file,
for easy importation into other programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Up to five line plots can be on
one graph. The panel on which the next line plot will appear
is called the &quot;locked&quot; panel. If you don&rsquo;t
want the next line plot to appear on the <br>
locked panel, then unlock it by pressing the
&quot;Locked&quot; button. At the moment, panels are
automatically unlocked when you choose a new variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UDUNITS SUPPORT <br>
ncview supports time axes that use the conventions in the
udunits package. Typical units names in this scheme would be
&quot;days since 1990-01-01&quot;. If ncview encounters a
time <br>
dimension that it understands in this way, then it displays
the calendar date (as calculated by the udunits package, not
ncview) rathar than the actual axis value. For instance,
<br>
it might display &quot;3_Jun_1995&quot; rather than
&quot;Day 2390&quot;. To have this functionality, the
udunits package must be able to find the
&quot;udunits.dat&quot; file. You must set the
environmen&acirc; <br>
tal variable UDUNITS_PATH to the location of this file for
ncview to be able to find it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODIFIERS <br>
Clicking on a button with the left mouse button invokes the
standard action described above; clicking with the right
mouse button on the colormap select, transformation,
magnifi&acirc; <br>
cation, or dimension &quot;Current&quot; buttons DECREASES
the selection instead of increasing it (i.e., cycles in the
reverse direction). Holding down the control key
&quot;accelerates&quot; <br>
actions; while clicking with the left mouse button will
increase the rate at which the rewind, step backwards, step
forwards, and fast forward keys will step through the data.
<br>
When holding down the control key while clicking on the
magnification button, the magnification DOUBLES or HALVES
instead of incrementing or decrementing by one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ncview attempts to save the
displayed images in main memory, with each frame being saved
as it is calculated for the first time. This speeds up
looping replays of the same data. <br>
If there is not enough memory to store all the required
frames at the selected magnification, ncview will inform you
and automatically stop trying to do so. Changing the
magni&acirc; <br>
fication will again force ncview to try and allocate a image
buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the scaled, interpolated
pixel maps are stored, the following operations will flush
the image buffer and require recalculating the images if
they are performed: inverting <br>
the data; inverting the color map; changing the
magnification; changing the data transformation (linear, lo,
or hi); changing the dimension; changing the range; changing
the <br>
pixel replication scheme. Changing colormaps does not
require refilling the image buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can invoke ncview with
multiple netCDF filenames on the command line, and it will
try to present the data in a logical way; i.e., if there are
identically named variables in <br>
the data files, it will try to treat them as if they were
all in one giant data file. If there are different variables
in different files, it will let you choose to display any
<br>
of the available variables. This is generally a Good Thing,
but if you have identically named variables in different
files with different attributes, ncview will not know which
<br>
attribute you want to use and most likely will crash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETTING THE DATA RANGE <br>
It is important to set the data range correctly; otherwise,
the color contour might come out all red, or all blue, or
otherwise not very interesting. There are a number of ways
<br>
to set or manipulate the range: 1) Click with the left mouse
button on the &quot;range&quot; button. This pops up a
dialog window letting you specify the minimum and maximum
values <br>
directly. 2) Click with the right mouse button on the
&quot;range&quot; button. This scales the displayed data to
the currently shown frame. 3) Click with the left mouse
button on a <br>
data point in the color-contour window; this will set the
minimum scaling to the value of the data which you clicked
on. 4) Click with the right mouse button on a data point in
<br>
the color-contour window; this will set the maximum scaling
to the value of the data which you clicked on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-beep: rings the terminal&rsquo;s bell when stepping forward
through frames in movie mode and the loop is restarted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-extrainfo: Puts up extra
information in the color-contour window. This is useful for
photographing the computer screen to make slides or pictures
of the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-frames: This will make ncview
dump out the frames it displays in a series of PPM-format
files. You can then make them into an mpeg movie if you so
desire (using tools other <br>
than ncview).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtitle: Puts the following
argument (enclosed in quotes) up as the title of the
color-contour window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ncolors: Sets the number of
colors which will be displayed. Defaults to 200. Must
currently be less than 256.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-private: Forces use of a
private colormap. This will cut down on the number of
colormap entries used, but will turn the rest of the screen
annoying colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-minmax: determines how the
calculation of minimum and maximum values is done. If fast,
then only the first, middle, and last time entries of each
variable are examined. If <br>
med, then every fifth time entry is scanned for extrema. If
slow, then every tenth entry is used. If all, then every
time entry is examined for extrema. Default is
&quot;fast&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-copying: prints out the terms
under which ncview may be copied, distributed, and modified.
Ncview is covered under the provisions of the Gnu General
Public Liicense Version 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-warranty: Ncview comes with no
warranty; this option prints out a fuller statement to this
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Ncview looks in directory /usr/share/ncview for system-wide
colormap (.ncmap) files. It also examines the user&rsquo;s
environmental variable NCVIEWBASE for the name of a
directory <br>
which contains additional colormap files. If that is not
defined, then colormaps are sought in the user&rsquo;s home
directory, and in the directory which was run from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Colormap files have 256 lines,
each consisting of one r g b triplet, where r, g, and b are
integers in the range of 0 to 255. There should be only
whitespace separating the r, <br>
g, and b values on each line. Colormap files end with the
extension &quot;.ncmap&quot;. If Ncview does not find any
colormaps, it will complain, and supply a simple default
map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is necessary to install the
applications default file, &quot;Ncview&quot;, in your
$XAPPLRESDIR directory for the program to function properly.
If the screen appears out of alignment, <br>
make sure that this installation has been performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The application resources file
recognizes the following resources, in addition to the
standard ones:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">labelWidth <br>
The width, in pixels, of the information labels at the top
of the main window. If you generally use long titles and
variable longnames, you might want to increase this. <br>
Default = 400.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">buttonWidth <br>
The width, in pixels, of the &quot;variable&quot; and
&quot;dimension&quot; buttons. If you use long names for
these, you might want to increase this value. Default =
50.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nVarsPerRow <br>
The number of variable buttons in a row before a new one is
started. Set to be aesthetically pleasing to you. Default =
5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deltaStep <br>
The amount to step forward and backwards by when the control
key is held down while pushing the button. If this value is
less than 0, in indicates an absolute number of <br>
steps to take; if this value is greater than zero, it
indicates the percent (in integer form, from 1 to 100) of
the total file size to step. Default = 10 (ten percent).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Occasional bugs surface, especially when mixing variables in
different files.</p>
