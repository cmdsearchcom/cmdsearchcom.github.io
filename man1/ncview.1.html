<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<i>Ncview</i> displays 2-D slices of a netCDF data file, using the X Window
  System graphical user interface (Release 4 or higher). You can examine
  different floating point variables in the file, and animate the floating point
  data along the ``record dimension'' (usually time) to see how it evolves. You
  can also display 1-D (line plot) views of the data simply by clicking the
  mouse on the point of interest.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you first invoke <i>ncview,</i> a command panel comes up which has a number
  of buttons for manipulating the current view into the data file, and
  presenting various information about the current view. From the top, going
  down, the information fields are: the 'title' of the data file; the
  'long_name' of the currently selected variable; the frame number (i.e., place
  along the scan axis) currently displayed; the minimum and maximum values of
  the variable; and the value of the data point under the cursor (only active
  when the pointer is over the color contour image).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Next comes a row of buttons similar to a tape recorder, used for changing the
  view into the netCDF file along the scan dimension. In Version 1.XX of
  <i>ncview,</i> the scan dimension is constrained to be the ``record
  dimension'' (in netCDF parlance). From the left, the buttons are: the quit
  button; a button to take you directly to the first frame, marked
  &quot;-&gt;1&quot;; rewind, which loops the images going backwards; step
  backwards; pause; step forwards; and fast forward, which loops the images
  going forwards.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Below this is the row of option buttons, which from the left are: the colormap
  button, labeled with the name of the current colormap (see below); &quot;Inv
  P&quot;, which inverts the physical representation of the data (flips it
  upside-down); &quot;Inv C&quot;, which inverts the colors currently being used
  so that the colors indicating minimum and maximum are switched; the
  magnification button, which sets how much image expansion the image undergoes;
  and the transformation button, which determines what preprocessing the data
  undergoes before display. For this button, &quot;Linear&quot; means no
  preprocessing, &quot;Low&quot; means that the data is raised to the fourth
  power before conversion to a pixel, so that low values are emphasized; and
  &quot;Hi&quot; means that the fourth root of the data is taken before
  conversion, so that large values are emphasized. Next comes &quot;Set
  Dim&quot;; pressing this pops up a window which allows you to determine which
  variables are shown on the X and Y axes. Note that Version 1.XX of
  <i>ncview</i> will <i>not</i> transpose your data! This means that, for
  example, you cannot simultaneously display the X dimension along the Y axis
  while displaying the Y dimension along the X axis---that would be an attempt
  to transpose the data. You can display the X dimension along the Y axis if
  some other variable which varies less rapidly in your particular data file
  (for example, depth) is on the X axis. Such a configuration is possible
  because it involves no transposition of data. In general you don't have to
  worry about this issue much, because if you attempt to pick axes which would
  be transposing the data, <i>ncview</i> switches them (and tells you that it's
  doing so!) so you can get the axes you want. Note that there is never any
  ambiguity about which dimensions are being displayed on what axes; that
  information is always shown in the main panel. Next is &quot;range&quot;,
  which pops up dialog boxes to set the data min and maxes which will be
  contoured. Pressing with the RIGHTMOST mouse button on the &quot;range&quot;
  button resets the ranges to match the currently displayed slice; this is a
  VERY useful option, so remember it and make use of it frequently! The last
  button shows the method currently employed for expanding the data onto the
  screen; the default, &quot;bi-lin&quot;, performes a bi-linear interpolation.
  Also available is &quot;repl&quot;, which simply replicates the pixels and is
  somewhat faster.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The next row of buttons shows what variables can be displayed from the input
  files. Note that when <i>ncview</i> first comes up, if there is more than one
  variable in the file, you must select a variable to display before you will
  see anything. If there is only one variable in the file, the selection
  defaults to that one.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Below the variable selection buttons are the dimension information fields. All
  the dimensions for the displayed variable which can take on more than one
  value are shown here, one variable to a line. In each line, there are 6 fields
  of information; from left to right, they are: &quot;Dim&quot;, the Dimension
  identifier, which is `Scan' if the dimension is currently the scanned
  dimension (i.e., the dimension accessed via the tape-recorder style buttons),
  `X' if the dimension appears in the color contour display along the x axis, or
  `Y' if it appears in the color display along the y axis. This field will be
  blank if it isn't Scan, X, or Y. Next come &quot;Name&quot;, the dimension's
  short name; &quot;Min&quot;, the minimum value of the dimension;
  &quot;Current&quot;, the current value of the dimension as displayed in the
  color contour panel; &quot;Max&quot;, the maximum value of the dimension; and
  &quot;Units&quot;, the dimension's units. Clicking on the &quot;Current&quot;
  field of a dimension allows you to change the current value of that dimension.
  Clicking with the left mouse button increases the current value of that
  dimension; clicking with the right button decreases it.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="POPUP_X-Y_GRAPH"><a class="selflink" href="#POPUP_X-Y_GRAPH">POPUP
  X-Y GRAPH</a></h1>
You can get a popup X-Y (line) graph of data at a point simply by clicking on
  the point of interest. You have several options at this point; with the
  bottons at the bottom of the window you can change the axis along which the
  data is graphed (if there are other axes available), use log scaling for the X
  and/or Y axis, and set the data range. You can also dump out the data from the
  X-Y plot into an text file, for easy importation into other programs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Up to five line plots can be on one graph. The panel on which the next line plot
  will appear is called the &quot;locked&quot; panel. If you don't want the next
  line plot to appear on the locked panel, then unlock it by pressing the
  &quot;Locked&quot; button. At the moment, panels are automatically unlocked
  when you choose a new variable.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="UDUNITS_SUPPORT"><a class="selflink" href="#UDUNITS_SUPPORT">UDUNITS
  SUPPORT</a></h1>
<i>ncview</i> supports time axes that use the conventions in the udunits
  package. Typical units names in this scheme would be &quot;days since
  1990-01-01&quot;. If <i>ncview</i> encounters a time dimension that it
  understands in this way, then it displays the calendar date (as calculated by
  the udunits package, not ncview) rathar than the actual axis value. For
  instance, it might display &quot;3_Jun_1995&quot; rather than &quot;Day
  2390&quot;. To have this functionality, the udunits package must be able to
  find the &quot;udunits.dat&quot; file. You must set the environmental variable
  UDUNITS_PATH to the location of this file for ncview to be able to find it.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MODIFIERS"><a class="selflink" href="#MODIFIERS">MODIFIERS</a></h1>
Clicking on a button with the left mouse button invokes the standard action
  described above; clicking with the right mouse button on the colormap select,
  transformation, magnification, or dimension &quot;Current&quot; buttons
  DECREASES the selection instead of increasing it (i.e., cycles in the reverse
  direction). Holding down the control key &quot;accelerates&quot; actions;
  while clicking with the left mouse button will increase the rate at which the
  rewind, step backwards, step forwards, and fast forward keys will step through
  the data. When holding down the control key while clicking on the
  magnification button, the magnification DOUBLES or HALVES instead of
  incrementing or decrementing by one.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Ncview</i> attempts to save the displayed images in main memory, with each
  frame being saved as it is calculated for the first time. This speeds up
  looping replays of the same data. If there is not enough memory to store all
  the required frames at the selected magnification, <i>ncview</i> will inform
  you and automatically stop trying to do so. Changing the magnification will
  again force <i>ncview</i> to try and allocate a image buffer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since the scaled, interpolated pixel maps are stored, the following operations
  will flush the image buffer and require recalculating the images if they are
  performed: inverting the data; inverting the color map; changing the
  magnification; changing the data transformation (linear, lo, or hi); changing
  the dimension; changing the range; changing the pixel replication scheme.
  Changing colormaps does not require refilling the image buffer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can invoke <i>ncview</i> with multiple netCDF filenames on the command line,
  and it will try to present the data in a logical way; i.e., if there are
  identically named variables in the data files, it will try to treat them as if
  they were all in one giant data file. If there are different variables in
  different files, it will let you choose to display any of the available
  variables. This is generally a Good Thing, but if you have identically named
  variables in different files with different attributes, <i>ncview</i> will not
  know which attribute you want to use and most likely will crash.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SETTING_THE_DATA_RANGE"><a class="selflink" href="#SETTING_THE_DATA_RANGE">SETTING
  THE DATA RANGE</a></h1>
It is important to set the data range correctly; otherwise, the color contour
  might come out all red, or all blue, or otherwise not very interesting. There
  are a number of ways to set or manipulate the range: 1) Click with the left
  mouse button on the &quot;range&quot; button. This pops up a dialog window
  letting you specify the minimum and maximum values directly. 2) Click with the
  right mouse button on the &quot;range&quot; button. This scales the displayed
  data to the currently shown frame. 3) Click with the left mouse button on a
  data point in the color-contour window; this will set the minimum scaling to
  the value of the data which you clicked on. 4) Click with the right mouse
  button on a data point in the color-contour window; this will set the maximum
  scaling to the value of the data which you clicked on.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<i>-beep:</i> rings the terminal's bell when stepping forward through frames in
  movie mode and the loop is restarted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>-extrainfo:</i> Puts up extra information in the color-contour window. This
  is useful for photographing the computer screen to make slides or pictures of
  the data.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>-frames:</i> This will make ncview dump out the frames it displays in a
  series of PPM-format files. You can then make them into an mpeg movie if you
  so desire (using tools other than ncview).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>-mtitle:</i> Puts the following argument (enclosed in quotes) up as the title
  of the color-contour window.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>-ncolors:</i> Sets the number of colors which will be displayed. Defaults to
  200. Must currently be less than 256.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>-private:</i> Forces use of a private colormap. This will cut down on the
  number of colormap entries used, but will turn the rest of the screen annoying
  colors.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>-minmax:</i> determines how the calculation of minimum and maximum values is
  done. If <i>fast,</i> then only the first, middle, and last time entries of
  each variable are examined. If <i>med,</i> then every fifth time entry is
  scanned for extrema. If <i>slow,</i> then every tenth entry is used. If
  <i>all,</i> then every time entry is examined for extrema. Default is
  &quot;fast&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>-copying:</i> prints out the terms under which <i>ncview</i> may be copied,
  distributed, and modified. <i>Ncview</i> is covered under the provisions of
  the Gnu General Public Liicense Version 1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>-warranty:</i> <i>Ncview</i> comes with no warranty; this option prints out a
  fuller statement to this effect.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
<i>Ncview</i> looks in directory /usr/share/ncview for system-wide colormap
  (.ncmap) files. It also examines the user's environmental variable NCVIEWBASE
  for the name of a directory which contains additional colormap files. If that
  is not defined, then colormaps are sought in the user's home directory, and in
  the directory which was run from.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Colormap files have 256 lines, each consisting of one r g b triplet, where r, g,
  and b are integers in the range of 0 to 255. There should be only whitespace
  separating the r, g, and b values on each line. Colormap files end with the
  extension &quot;.ncmap&quot;. If <i>Ncview</i> does not find any colormaps, it
  will complain, and supply a simple default map.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is necessary to install the applications default file, &quot;Ncview&quot;, in
  your $XAPPLRESDIR directory for the program to function properly. If the
  screen appears out of alignment, make sure that this installation has been
  performed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The application resources file recognizes the following resources, in addition
  to the standard ones:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>labelWidth</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The width, in pixels, of the information labels at the top
      of the main window. If you generally use long titles and variable
      longnames, you might want to increase this. Default = 400.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>buttonWidth</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The width, in pixels, of the &quot;variable&quot; and
      &quot;dimension&quot; buttons. If you use long names for these, you might
      want to increase this value. Default = 50.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>nVarsPerRow</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The number of variable buttons in a row before a new one is
      started. Set to be aesthetically pleasing to you. Default = 5.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>deltaStep</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The amount to step forward and backwards by when the
      control key is held down while pushing the button. If this value is less
      than 0, in indicates an absolute number of steps to take; if this value is
      greater than zero, it indicates the percent (in integer form, from 1 to
      100) of the total file size to step. Default = 10 (ten percent).
