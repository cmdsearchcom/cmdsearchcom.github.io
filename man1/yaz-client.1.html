<p>YAZ-CLIENT(1) Commands YAZ-CLIENT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
yaz-client - Z39.50/SRU client for implementors</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
yaz-client [-a apdulog] [-b berdump] [-c cclfile] [-d dump]
[-f cmdfile] [-k size] [-m marclog] [-p proxy-addr] [-q
cqlfile] [-t dispcharset] [-u auth] [-v loglevel] [-V] [-x]
<br>
[server-addr]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
yaz-client is a Z39.50[1]/SRU[2] client (origin) with a
simple command line interface that allows you to test
behavior and performance of Z39.50 targets and SRU
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From YAZ version 4.1.0
yaz-client may also operate as a Solr[3] Web Service
client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the server-addr is specified,
the client creates a connection to the Z39.50/SRU target at
the address given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When yaz-client is started it
tries to read commands from one of the following files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Command file if
it is given by option -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; .yazclientrc in
current working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; .yazclientrc in
the user&rsquo;s home directory. The value of the HOME is
used to determine the home directory. Normally, HOME is only
set on POSIX systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, <br>
Solaris.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a filename <br>
If specified, logging of protocol packages will be appended
to the file given. If filename is specified as -, the output
is written to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b filename <br>
If specified, YAZ will dump BER data in readable notation to
the file specified. If filename is specified as - the output
is written to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c filename <br>
If specified, CCL configuration will be read from the file
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d dump <br>
If specified, YAZ will dump BER data for all PDUs sent and
received to individual files, named dump.DDD.raw, where DDD
is 001, 002, 003, ..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f cmdfile <br>
Reads commands from cmdfile. When this option is used, YAZ
client does not read .yazclientrc from current directory or
home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k size <br>
Sets preferred messages and maximum record size for
Initialize Request in kilobytes. Default value is 65536 (64
MB).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m filename <br>
If specified, retrieved records will be appended to the file
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p proxy-addr <br>
If specified, the client will use the proxy at the address
given. YAZ client will connect to a proxy on the address and
port given. The actual target will be specified as <br>
part of the InitRequest to inform the proxy about the actual
target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q filename <br>
If specified, CQL configuration will be read from the file
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t displaycharset <br>
If displaycharset is given, it specifies name of the
character set of the output (on the terminal on which YAZ
client is running).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u auth <br>
If specified, the auth string will be used for
authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v level <br>
Sets the LOG level to level. Level is a sequence of tokens
separated by comma. Each token is a integer or a named LOG
item - one of fatal, debug, warn, log, malloc, all, <br>
none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
Prints YAZ version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x <br>
Makes the YAZ client print hex dumps of packages sent and
received on standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
The YAZ client accepts the following commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open zurl <br>
Opens a connection to a server. The syntax for zurl is the
same as described above for connecting from the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Syntax:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">[(tcp|ssl|unix|http)&rsquo;:&rsquo;]host
[:port][/base]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit <br>
Quits YAZ client</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find query <br>
Sends a Search Request using the query given. By default the
query is assumed to be PQF. See command querytype for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete setname <br>
Deletes result set with name setname on the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">base base1 base2 ... <br>
Sets the name(s) of the database(s) to search. One or more
databases may be specified, separated by blanks. This
command overrides the database given in zurl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show [start[+number]] <br>
Fetches records by sending a Present Request from the start
position given by start and a number of records given by
number. If start is not given, then the client will fetch
<br>
from the position of the last retrieved record plus 1. If
number is not given, then one record will be fetched at a
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scan term <br>
Scans database index for a term. The syntax resembles the
syntax for find. If you want to scan for the word water you
could write</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scan water</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but if you want to scan only in,
say the title field, you would write</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scan @attr 1=4 water</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setscan set term <br>
Scans database index for a term within a result set. This is
similar to the scan command but has a result set as its
first argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scanpos pos <br>
Sets preferred position for scan. This value is used in the
next scan. By default, position is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scansize size <br>
Sets number of entries to be returned by scan. Default
number of entries is 20.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scanstep step <br>
Set step-size for scan. This value is used in the next scan
sent to the target. By default step-size is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort sortspecs <br>
Sorts a result set. The sort command takes a sequence of
space-separated sort specifications, with each sort
specification consisting of two space-separated words (so
that <br>
the whole specification list is made up of an even number of
words). The first word of each specification holds a field
(sort criterion) and the second holds flags. If the <br>
sort criterion includes = it is assumed that the SortKey is
of type sortAttributes using Bib-1: in this case the integer
before = is the attribute type and the integer <br>
following = is the attribute value. If no = character is in
the criterion, it is treated as a sortfield of type
InternationalString. The flags word of each sort
specification <br>
must consist of s for case sensitive or i for case
insensitive, and &lt; for ascending order or &gt; for
descending order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort+ <br>
Same as sort but stores the sorted result set in a new
result set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">authentication openauth <br>
Sets up an authentication string if a server requires
authentication (v2 OpenStyle). The authentication string is
first sent to the server when the open command is issued and
<br>
the Z39.50 Initialize Request is sent, so this command must
be used before open in order to be effective. A common
convention for the authopen string is that the username -
<br>
and password is separated by a slash, e.g.
myusername/mysecret.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sru method version <br>
Selects Web Service method and version. Must be one of post,
get, soap (default) or solr. Version should be either 1.1,
1.2 or 2.0 for SRU. Other versions are allowed - for <br>
testing purposes (version negotiation with SRU server). The
version is currently not used for Solr Web Services</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list_all <br>
This command displays status and values for many
settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lslb n <br>
Sets the limit for when no records should be returned
together with the search result. See the Z39.50 standard on
set bounds[4] for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssub n <br>
Sets the limit for when all records should be returned with
the search result. See the Z39.50 standard on set bounds[4]
for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mspn n <br>
Sets the number of records that should be returned if the
number of records in the result set is between the values of
lslb and ssub. See the Z39.50 standard on set bounds[4] <br>
for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status <br>
Displays the values of lslb, ssub and mspn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setname <br>
Switches named result sets on and off. Default is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cancel <br>
Sends a Trigger Resource Control Request to the target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format oid <br>
Sets the preferred transfer syntax for retrieved records.
yaz-client supports all the record syntaxes that currently
are registered. See Z39.50 Record Syntax Identifiers[5] <br>
for more details. Commonly used records syntaxes include
usmarc, sutrs and xml.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">elements e <br>
Sets the element set name for the records. Many targets
support element sets B (for brief) and F (for full).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close <br>
Sends a Z39.50 Close APDU and closes connection with the
peer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">querytype type <br>
Sets the query type as used by command find. The following
is supported: prefix for Prefix Query Notation (Type-1
Query); ccl for CCL search (Type-2 Query), cql for CQL <br>
(Type-104 search with CQL OID), ccl2rpn for CCL to RPN
conversion (Type-1 Query), cql2rpn for CQL to RPN conversion
(Type-1 Query).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attributeset set <br>
Sets attribute set OID for prefix queries (RPN, Type-1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">refid id <br>
Sets reference ID for Z39.50 Request(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">itemorder type no <br>
Sends an Item Order Request using the ILL External. type is
either 1 or 2 which corresponds to ILL-Profile 1 and 2
respectively. The no is the Result Set position of the <br>
record to be ordered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update action recid doc <br>
Sends Item Update Request. The action argument must be the
action type: one of insert, replace, delete and update. The
second argument, recid, is the record identifier (any <br>
string). Third argument which is optional is the record
document for the request. If doc is preceded with
&quot;&lt;&quot;, then the following characters are treated
as a filename with <br>
the records to be updated. Otherwise doc is treated as a
document itself. The doc may also be quoted in double
quotes. If doc is omitted, the last received record (as part
of <br>
present response or piggybacked search response) is used for
the update.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source filename <br>
Executes list of commands from file filename, just like
&rsquo;source&rsquo; on most UNIX shells. A single dot (.)
can be used as an alternative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! args <br>
Executes command args in subshell using the system call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">push_command command <br>
The push_command takes another command as its argument. That
command is then added to the history information (so you can
retrieve it later). The command itself is not <br>
executed. This command only works if you have GNU
readline/history enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set_apdufile filename <br>
Sets that APDU should be logged to file filename. Another
way to achieve APDU log is by using command-line option
-a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set_auto_reconnect flag <br>
Specifies whether YAZ client automatically reconnects if the
target closes connection (Z39.50 only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flag must be either on or
off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set_auto_wait flag <br>
Specifies whether YAZ client should wait for response
protocol packages after a request. By default YAZ client
waits (on) for response packages immediately after a command
<br>
(find, show) has been issued. If off is used, YAZ client
does not attempt to receive packages automatically. These
will have to be manually received when command <br>
wait_response is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flag must be either on or
off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set_marcdump filename <br>
Specifies that all retrieved records should be appended to
file filename. This command does the thing as option -m.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">schema schemaid <br>
Specifies schema for retrieval. Schema may be specified as
an OID for Z39.50. For SRU, schema is a simple string
URI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">charset negotiationcharset
[displaycharset] [[marccharset]] <br>
Specifies character set (encoding) for Z39.50 negotiation /
SRU encoding and/or character set for output (terminal).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">negotiationcharset is the name
of the character set to be negotiated by the server. The
special name - for negotiationcharset specifies no character
set to be negotiated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If displaycharset is given, it
specifies name of the character set of the output (on the
terminal on which YAZ client is running). To disable
conversion of characters to the <br>
output encoding, the special name - (dash) can be used. If
the special name auto is given, YAZ client will convert
strings to the encoding of the terminal as returned by <br>
nl_langinfo call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If marccharset is given, it
specifies name of the character set of retrieved MARC
records from server. See also marccharset command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
Since character set negotiation takes effect in the Z39.50
Initialize Request you should issue this command before
command open is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
MARC records are not covered by Z39.50 character set
negotiation, so that&rsquo;s why there is a separate
character that must be known in order to do meaningful
conversion(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">negcharset charset <br>
Specifies character set for negotiation (Z39.50). The
argument is the same as second argument for command
charset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">displaycharset charset <br>
Specifies character set for output (display). The argument
is the same as second argument for command charset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">marccharset charset <br>
Specifies character set for retrieved MARC records so that
YAZ client can display them in a character suitable for your
display. See charset command. If auto is given, YAZ <br>
will assume that MARC21/USMARC is using MARC8/UTF8 and
ISO-8859-1 for all other MARC variants. The charset argument
is the same as third argument for command charset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">querycharset charset <br>
Specifies character set for query terms for Z39.50 RPN
queries and Z39.50 Scan Requests (termListAndStartPoint).
This is a pure client-side conversion which converts from
<br>
displayCharset to queryCharset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set_cclfile filename <br>
Specifies that CCL fields should be read from file file
filename. This command does the thing as option -c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set_cqlfile filename <br>
Specifies that CQL fields should be read from file file
filename. This command does the thing as option -q.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">register_oid name class OID <br>
This command allows you to register your own object
identifier - so that instead of entering a long dot-notation
you can use a short name instead. The name is your name for
<br>
the OID, class is the class, and OID is the raw OID in dot
notation. Class is one of: appctx, absyn, attet, transyn,
diagset, recsyn, resform, accform, extserv, userinfo, <br>
elemspec, varset, schema, tagset, general. If you&rsquo;re
in doubt use the general class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">register_tab command string <br>
This command registers a TAB completion string for the
command given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sleep seconds <br>
This command makes YAZ client sleep (be idle) for the number
of seconds given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wait_response [ number] <br>
This command makes YAZ client wait for a number of response
packages from target. If number is omitted, 1 is
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is rarely used and
is only useful if command set_auto_wait is set to off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xmles OID doc <br>
Sends XML Extended Services request using the OID and doc
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zversion ver <br>
This command sets Z39.50 version for negotiation. Should be
used before open. By default 3 (version 3) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">options op1 op2.. <br>
This command sets Z39.50 options for negotiation. Should be
used before open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
supported: search, present, delSet, resourceReport,
triggerResourceCtrl, resourceCtrl, accessCtrl, scan, sort,
extendedServices, <br>
level_1Segmentation, level_2Segmentation,
concurrentOperations, namedResultSets, encapsulation,
resultCount, negotiationModel, duplicationDetection,
queryType104, <br>
pQESCorrection, stringSchema.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
The simplest example of a Prefix Query would be something
like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f knuth</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f &quot;donald knuth&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In those queries, no attributes
were specified. This leaves it up to the server what fields
to search but most servers will search in all fields. Some
servers do not support this <br>
feature though, and require that some attributes are
defined. To add one attribute you could do:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f @attr 1=4 computer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where we search in the title
field, since the use(1) is title(4). If we want to search in
the author field and in the title field, and in the title
field using right truncation <br>
it could look something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f @and @attr 1=1003 knuth @attr
1=4 @attr 5=1 computer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally using a mix of Bib-1 and
GILS attributes could look something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f @attrset Bib-1 @and @attr GILS
1=2008 Washington @attr 1=21 weather</p>
