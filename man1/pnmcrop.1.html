<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pnmcrop - crop a PNM image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pnmcrop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-white|-black|-sides]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-left]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-right]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-top]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-bottom]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-margin=pixels]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-borderfile=filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[pnmfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimum unique abbreviation of
option is acceptable. You may use double hyphens instead of
single hyphen to denote options. You may use white space in
place of the equals sign <br>
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmcrop reads a PBM, PGM, or PPM
image as input, removes borders that are the background
color, and produces the same type of image as output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t specify
otherwise, pnmcrop assumes the background color is whatever
color the top left and right corners of the image are and if
they are different colors, something <br>
midway between them. You can specify that the background is
white or black with the -white and -black options or make
pnmcrop base its guess on all four corners instead of just
<br>
two with -sides.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, pnmcrop chops off
any stripe of background color it finds, on all four sides.
You can tell pnmcrop to remove only specific borders with
the -left, -right, -top, and <br>
-bottom options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to leave some
border, use the -margin option. It will not only spare some
of the border from cropping, but will fill in (with what
pnmcrop considers the background <br>
color) if necessary to get up to that size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the input is a multi-image
stream, pnmcrop processes each one independently and
produces a multi-image stream as output. It chooses where to
crop independently for each <br>
image. So if you start with a stream of images of the same
dimensions, you may end up with images of differing
dimensions. Before Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006), pnmcrop
ignored <br>
all input images but the first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to chop a specific
amount off the side of an image, use pamcut.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to add different
borders after removing the existing ones, use pnmcat or
pamcomp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-white Take white to be the background color. pnmcrop
removes borders which are white.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-black Take black to be the
background color. pnmcrop removes borders which are
black.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sides Determine the background
color from the colors of the four corners of the input
image. pnmcrop removes borders which are of the background
color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If at least three of the four
corners are the same color, pnmcrop takes that as the
background color. If not, pnmcrop looks for two corners of
the same color in the fol&acirc; <br>
lowing order, taking the first found as the background
color: top, left, right, bottom. If all four corners are
different colors, pnmcrop assumes an average of the four
<br>
colors as the background color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -sides option slows pnmcrop
down, as it reads the entire image to determine the
background color in addition to the up to three times that
it would read it without <br>
-sides.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-left Remove any left
border.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-right Remove any right
border.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-top Remove any top border.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bottom <br>
Remove any bottom border.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-margin=pixels <br>
Leave pixels pixels of border. Expand the border to this
size if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.29 (August 2005).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-borderfile=filename <br>
Use the image in the file named filename instead of the
input image to determine where the borders of the input
image are and the background color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without this option, pnmcrop
examines the input image and figures out what part of the
image is border and what part is foreground (not border), as
well as the background <br>
color. With this option, pnmcrop finds the borders in one
image, then uses the those four border sizes (left, right,
top, bottom) in cropping a different image. Further&acirc;
<br>
more, if you use -margin to add borders, the color of those
borders is the background color pnmcrop detects in the
border file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The point of this is that you
may want to help pnmcrop to come to a different conclusion
as to where the borders are and what the background color is
by preprocessing the <br>
input image. For example, consider an image that has
speckles of noise in its borders. pnmcrop isn&rsquo;t smart
enough to recognize these as noise; it sees them as
foreground <br>
image. So pnmcrop considers most of your borders to be
foreground and does not crop them off as you want. To fix
this, run the image through a despeckler such as pbm&acirc;
<br>
clean and tell pnmcrop to use the despeckled version of the
image as the -borderfile image, but the original speckled
version as the input image. That way, you crop the <br>
borders, but retain the true foreground image, speckles and
all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.29 (August 2005).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 10.46 (March
2009), the original image and not the border file determines
the background color. pnmcrop fails if there is no apparent
background color in <br>
the original image (i.e. the corners of the image
don&rsquo;t have a common color).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Print on Standard Error information about the processing,
including exactly how much is being cropped off of which
sides.</p>
