<p>DB5.3_CHECKPOINT(1) General Commands Manual
DB5.3_CHECKPOINT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
db5.3_checkpoint - Periodically checkpoint transactions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
db5.3_checkpoint [-1Vv] [-h home] [-k kbytes] [-L file] [-P
password] [-p min]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The db5.3_checkpoint utility is a daemon process that
monitors the database log, and periodically calls
DB_ENV-&gt;txn_checkpoint to checkpoint it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-1 Checkpoint the log once, regardless of whether or not
there has been activity since the last checkpoint and then
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Specify a home directory for
the database environment; by default, the current working
directory is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Checkpoint the database at
least as often as every kbytes of log file are written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Log the execution of the
db5.3_checkpoint utility to the specified file in the
following format, where ### is the process ID, and the date
is the time the utility was <br>
started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">db_checkpoint: ### Wed Jun 15
01:23:45 EDT 1995</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This file will be removed if the
db5.3_checkpoint utility exits gracefully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Specify an environment
password. Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite password
strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a window
of vulnerability on sys&acirc; <br>
tems where unprivileged users can see command-line arguments
or where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
containing the command-line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Checkpoint the database at
least every min minutes if there has been any activity since
the last checkpoint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Write the library version
number to the standard output, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Write the time of each
checkpoint attempt to the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At least one of the -1, -k, and
-p options must be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_checkpoint utility
uses a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the -h
option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the
utility was run in a directory con&acirc; <br>
taining a Berkeley DB environment). In order to avoid
environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment,
db5.3_checkpoint should always be given the chance to detach
<br>
from the environment and exit gracefully. To cause
db5.3_checkpoint to release all environment resources and
exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_checkpoint utility
does not attempt to create the Berkeley DB shared memory
regions if they do not already exist. The application that
creates the region should be <br>
started first, and once the region is created, the
db5.3_checkpoint utility should be started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DB_ENV-&gt;txn_checkpoint
method is the underlying method used by the db5.3_checkpoint
utility. See the db_checkpoint utility source code for an
example of using <br>
DB_ENV-&gt;txn_checkpoint in a IEEE/ANSI Std 1003.1 (POSIX)
environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_checkpoint utility
exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DB_HOME <br>
If the -h option is not specified and the environment
variable DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the
database home, as described in DB_ENV-&gt;open.</p>
