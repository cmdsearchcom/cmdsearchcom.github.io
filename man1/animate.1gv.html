Animate is an interactive animation tool specifically designed to be used with
  Geomview. It provides several simple animation controls such as looping,
  bouncing, and single frame stepping, as well as adjustable speed playing. The
  program works by telling geomview to read in a sequence of geomview files and
  then telling geomview to display each frame of the sequence in order.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are two methods that Animate provides for specifying which frames one
  wants to have in the sequence being viewed. The first method is to enter the
  name of every frame into the text input box and press return or click on load.
  The name of each frame must correspond with the name of a geomview file
  existing in the file system.

EXAMPLES
<div class="Pp"></div>
	  pict1 pict2 pict3 pict4
	  pict*
	  pic??
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second method of loading frames is to first create an animation script file
  outside of animate and then load the script in by typing its name in the input
  box and clicking on the script button. The advantage of this method is that
  you can more easily specify the exact order in which you want the frames to be
  shown. The format of the script file is a list of frame names each followed by
  a newline. Comments prepended by a # sign are allowed.
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
EXAMPLE SCRIPT FILE
<div class="Pp"></div>
	  # list of frames for
	  # my rotating cube movie
	  cube.02
	  cube.04
	  cube.03 # get rid of this frame later
	  cube.01
	    .
	    .
	    .
	  cube.90

Loading frames into memory may take a little time, especially if each frame is a
  particularly large file. Be sure the machine you're using has sufficient
  memory to load all the frames you desire. Once all frames have been loaded, an
  'animate' object will appear in the geomview object browser. It is now
  possible to begin animating.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Scrolling through frames can be accomplished in several different ways. The
  first, and most obvious way is by 'playing' the frames. Clicking on the
  <b>Play</b> button causes animate to begin playing through the frames in
  order, starting with the first frame or whichever frame has been selected. The
  corresponding name of each frame being shown is shown in the pink text-entry
  box. Click on <b>Stop</b> to cease playing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Animation speed depends on the size and complexity of the object in each frame.
  Thus different sequences can have considerably different top playing speeds.
  Use the <b>Speed</b> slider to set an upper limit to the animation rate. You
  can also play slowly through the frames can also by clicking repeatedly on
  either step button.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Press the <b>Bounce</b> button to enter bounce mode. While in bounce mode,
  direction of play reverses whenever the first or last frame is reached.
  Clicking on either <b>Step</b> button determines the playing direction.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Clicking on <b>Once</b> puts animate in 'once' mode. While in this mode, upon
  reaching the first or last frame (depending on which direction you are going)
  of a specified sequence, animate will stop playing. Normal playing can be
  resumed by clicking on <b>Once</b> again to exit this mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>Info</b> button will bring up a short menu containing helpful hints for
  program usage. Clicking on the exit button will cause the program to exit.

When loading sequences one after another, geomview will often not load a
  sequence on the first try. This can often be remedied by telling animate to
  load the sequence yet again.
