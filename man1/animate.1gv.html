<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
animate - animate a sequence of geomview files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
animate [-p] [-b] [-s speed] [-o] [-S script] [-hide] [-f
file1 file2 ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Animate is an interactive animation tool specifically
designed to be used with Geomview. It provides several
simple animation controls such as looping, bouncing, and
single frame <br>
stepping, as well as adjustable speed playing. The program
works by telling geomview to read in a sequence of geomview
files and then telling geomview to display each frame of
<br>
the sequence in order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two methods that
Animate provides for specifying which frames one wants to
have in the sequence being viewed. The first method is to
enter the name of every frame into <br>
the text input box and press return or click on load. The
name of each frame must correspond with the name of a
geomview file existing in the file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pict1 pict2 pict3 pict4 <br>
pict* <br>
pic??</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second method of loading
frames is to first create an animation script file outside
of animate and then load the script in by typing its name in
the input box and clicking on <br>
the script button. The advantage of this method is that you
can more easily specify the exact order in which you want
the frames to be shown. The format of the script file is a
<br>
list of frame names each followed by a newline. Comments
prepended by a # sign are allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE SCRIPT FILE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># list of frames for <br>
# my rotating cube movie <br>
cube.02 <br>
cube.04 <br>
cube.03 # get rid of this frame later <br>
cube.01 <br>
. <br>
. <br>
. <br>
cube.90</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Loading frames into memory may
take a little time, especially if each frame is a
particularly large file. Be sure the machine you&rsquo;re
using has sufficient memory to load all the <br>
frames you desire. Once all frames have been loaded, an
&rsquo;animate&rsquo; object will appear in the geomview
object browser. It is now possible to begin animating.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scrolling through frames can be
accomplished in several different ways. The first, and most
obvious way is by &rsquo;playing&rsquo; the frames. Clicking
on the Play button causes animate to <br>
begin playing through the frames in order, starting with the
first frame or whichever frame has been selected. The
corresponding name of each frame being shown is shown in the
<br>
pink text-entry box. Click on Stop to cease playing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Animation speed depends on the
size and complexity of the object in each frame. Thus
different sequences can have considerably different top
playing speeds. Use the Speed slider <br>
to set an upper limit to the animation rate. You can also
play slowly through the frames can also by clicking
repeatedly on either step button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Press the Bounce button to enter
bounce mode. While in bounce mode, direction of play
reverses whenever the first or last frame is reached.
Clicking on either Step button <br>
determines the playing direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clicking on Once puts animate in
&rsquo;once&rsquo; mode. While in this mode, upon reaching
the first or last frame (depending on which direction you
are going) of a specified sequence, <br>
animate will stop playing. Normal playing can be resumed by
clicking on Once again to exit this mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Info button will bring up a
short menu containing helpful hints for program usage.
Clicking on the exit button will cause the program to
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-p Start playing through the frames right away upon
startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Go into bounce mode upon
startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s speed <br>
Set the speed of play upon startup. The value of speed may
be an integer between 0 and 100 which roughly signifies the
percentage of top playing speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Set animation to play through
only once upon startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S script <br>
Specify name of script containing filenames for objects to
be read in upon startup. Takes precedence over -f option if
present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hide Makes animate invisible
upon startup. *Warning* all animate commands must be
specified on the command line when this option is used since
there is no way to access the <br>
main window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f file1 file2 ... <br>
Specify names of files containing objects to be read in upon
startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
When loading sequences one after another, geomview will
often not load a sequence on the first try. This can often
be remedied by telling animate to load the sequence yet
again.</p>
