<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
qacct - report and account for Grid Engine usage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
qacct [-ar [ar_id]] [-A Account] [-b BeginTime] [-d Days]
[-e EndTime] [-g [GroupId|GroupName]] [-h [HostName]]
[-help] [-j [job_id|job_name|pattern]] [-l attr=val,...]
[-m] [-o <br>
[Owner]] [-u [Owner]] [-pe [PEname]] [-q [wc_queue]] [-slots
[SlotNumber]] [-t task_id_range_list] [-P [Project]] [-D
[Department]] [-f AcctFileName] [-E]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The qacct utility scans the accounting data file (see
accounting(5)) and produces a summary of information for
wall-clock time, CPU time, and system time for the
categories of <br>
host name, queue name, group name, owner name, job name, job
ID, and for the queues meeting the resource requirements as
specified with the -l switch. Combinations of each
cate&acirc; <br>
gory are permitted. Alternatively, all or specific jobs can
be listed with the -j switch. For example the search
criteria could include summarizing for a queue and an owner,
but <br>
not for two queues in the same request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that results including
parallel jobs depend on the value of accounting_summary in
the parallel environment definition (see sge_pe(5)). If it
is false, there is an account&acirc; <br>
ing record for slave tasks as well as master tasks so that,
for example, there is a contribution to CPU time from each
task. Note that the slot count reported for each task is
<br>
the total for the job, not that allocated to the slave.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-ar [ar_id] <br>
The ID of the advance reservation for which usage is
summarized. If ar_id is not given, accounting data are
listed for each advance reservation separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Account <br>
The account for jobs to be summarized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b BeginTime <br>
The earliest start time for jobs to be summarized, in the
format [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]. See also the -d option. If CC
is not specified, a YY of &lt;70 means 20YY. If the -E <br>
option is specified, this specifies the earliest job end
time instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Days <br>
The number of days for which to summarize and print
accounting information. If used together with the -b
BeginTime option (see above), jobs started (or, with the -E
<br>
option, finished) within BeginTime to BeginTime+Days are
counted. If used together with -e EndTime (see below)
option, selection is from EndTime-Days. With neither,
con&acirc; <br>
sider the last Days.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e EndTime <br>
The latest start time for jobs to be summarized, in the
format [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]. See also the -d option. If CC
is not specified, a YY of &lt;70 means 20YY. If the -E <br>
option is specified, this specifies the latest job end time
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-f AcctFileName] <br>
The accounting file to be used. &quot;-&quot; means use
standard input. If omitted, the system default accounting
file is processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g [GroupId|GroupName] <br>
The numeric system group id or the group alphanumeric name
of the job owners to be included in the accounting. If
GroupId/GroupName is omitted, all groups are accounted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h [HostName] <br>
The case-insensitive name of the host upon which accounting
information is requested. If the name is omitted, totals for
each host are listed separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help Display help information
for the qacct command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j [job_id|job_name|pattern]
<br>
The name, an expression for matching names, or ID of the job
during execution for which accounting information is
printed. If neither a name nor an ID is given, all jobs <br>
are listed. <br>
This option changes the output format of qacct. If
activated, CPU times are no longer accumulated but
&quot;raw&quot; per-job accounting information is printed in
a formatted form <br>
instead. CPU time (seconds), integrated memory usage (GB
seconds), total i/o (bytes), i/o wait time (seconds), and
maximum virtual memory (bytes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l attr=val,... <br>
A resource requirement specification which must be met by
the queues in which the jobs being accounted were executing.
The resource request is very similar to the one <br>
described in qsub(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Ignore slave tasks of
parallel jobs. Only relevant when when accounting_summary is
false, and probably only useful with -j to prune the
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o [Owner] | -u [Owner] <br>
The name of the owner of the jobs for which accounting
statistics are assembled. If the optional Owner argument is
omitted, a listing of the accounting statistics of all <br>
job owners present in the accounting file is produced. -u
and -o are synonyms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pe [PEname] <br>
The name of the parallel environment for which usage is
summarized. If PEname is not given, accounting data are
listed for each parallel environment separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q [wc_queue_name] <br>
An expression for queues for which usage is summarized. All
queue instances matching the expression will be listed. If
no expression is specified, a cluster queue summary <br>
will be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-slots [SlotNumber] <br>
The number of queue slots for which usage is summarized. If
SlotNumber is not given, accounting data are listed for each
number of queue slots separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t task_id_range_list <br>
Only available together with the -j option described
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -t switch specifies the
array job task range, for which accounting information
should be printed. Syntax and semantics of
task_id_range_list are identical to that one <br>
described under the -t option to qsub(1). Please see there
also for further information on array jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P [Project] <br>
The name of the project for which usage is summarized. If
Project is not given, accounting data are listed for each
relevant project separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D [Department] <br>
The name of the department for which usage is summarized. If
Department is not given, accounting data are listed for each
relevant department separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E When selecting times with -b,
-e, -d, use the job end time rather than the start time to
select. This may be useful because the accounting record is
written at the job <br>
end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
SGE_ROOT Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard
configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_CELL If set, specifies the
default Grid Engine cell. To address a Grid Engine cell
qacct uses (in the order of precedence):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the cell specified
in the environment variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the default cell,
i.e. default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL <br>
If set, specifies that debug information should be written
to stderr. In addition the level of detail in which debug
information is generated is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_QMASTER_PORT <br>
If set, specifies the tcp port on which sge_qmaster(8) is
expected to listen for communication requests. Most
installations will use a services map entry for the <br>
service &quot;sge_qmaster&quot; instead to define that
port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGE_EXECD_PORT If set, specifies
the tcp port on which sge_execd(8) is expected to listen for
communication requests. Most installations will use a
services map entry for the <br>
service &quot;sge_execd&quot; instead to define that
port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
&lt;sge_root&gt;/&lt;cell&gt;/common/accounting <br>
Grid Engine default accounting file <br>
&lt;xxqs_nam_sexx_root&gt;/&lt;cell&gt;/common/act_qmaster
<br>
Grid Engine master host file</p>
