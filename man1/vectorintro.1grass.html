<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vector data processing in GRASS
GIS <br>
Vector maps in general <br>
A &quot;vector map&quot; is a data layer consisting of a
number of sparse features in geographic space. These might
be data points (drill sites), lines (roads), polygons (park
boundary), <br>
volumes (3D CAD structure), or some combination of all
these. Typically each feature in the map will be tied to a
set of attribute layers stored in a database (road names,
site <br>
ID, geologic type, etc.). As a general rule these can exist
in 2D or 3D space and are independent of the GIS&acirc;s
computation region.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vector data import and export
<br>
The v.in.ogr module offers a common interface for many
different vector formats. Additionally, it offers options
such as on-the-fly creation of new locations or extension of
the <br>
default region to match the extent of the imported vector
map. For special cases, other import modules are available,
e.g. v.in.ascii for input from a text file containing <br>
coordinate and attribute data, and v.in.db for input from a
database containing coordinate and attribute data. With
v.external external maps can be virtually linked into a <br>
mapset, only pseudo-topology is generated but the vector
geometry is not imported. The v.out.* set of commands
exports to various formats. To import and export only
attribute <br>
tables, use db.in.ogr and db.out.ogr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRASS GIS vector map exchange
between different locations (same projection) can be done in
a lossless way using the v.pack and v.unpack modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The naming convention for vector
maps requires that map names start with a character, not a
number (map name scheme: [A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Metadata <br>
The v.info display general information such as metadata and
attribute columns about a vector map including the history
how it was generated. Each map generating command stores
<br>
the command history into the metadata (query with v.info -h
mapname). Metadata such as map title, scale, organization
etc. can be updated with v.support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vector map operations <br>
GRASS vector map processing is always performed on the full
map. If this is not desired, the input map has to be clipped
to the current region beforehand (v.in.region, v.over&acirc;
<br>
lay,v.select).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vector model and topology <br>
GRASS is a topological GIS. This means that adjacent
geographic components in a single vector map are related.
For example in a non-topological GIS if two areas shared a
common <br>
border that border would be digitized two times and also
stored in duplicate. In a topological GIS this border exists
once and is shared between two areas. Topological
represen&acirc; <br>
tation of vector data helps to produce and maintain vector
maps with clean geometry as well as enables certain analyses
that can not be conducted with non-topological or <br>
spaghetti data. In GRASS, topological data are referred to
as level 2 data and spaghetti data is referred to as level
1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes topology is not
necessary and the additional memory and space requirements
are burdensome to a particular task. Therefore two modules
allow for working level 1 <br>
(non-topological) data within GRASS. The v.in.ascii module
allows users to input points without building topology. This
is very useful for large files where memory restrictions
<br>
may cause difficulties. The other module which works with
level 1 data is v.surf.rst which enables spatial
approximation and topographic analysis from a point or
isoline file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In GRASS, the following vector
object types are defined:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; point: a
point;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; line: a directed
sequence of connected vertices with two endpoints called
nodes;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; boundary: the
border line to describe an area;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; centroid: a
point within a closed ring of boundaries;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; area: the
topological composition of a closed ring of boundaries and a
centroid;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; face: a 3D
area;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; kernel: a 3D
centroid in a volume (not yet implemented);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; volume: a 3D
corpus, the topological composition of faces and kernel (not
yet implemented).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lines and boundaries can be
composed of multiple vertices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Area topology also holds
information about isles. These isles are located within that
area, not touching the boundaries of the outer area. Isles
are holes inside the area, and <br>
can consist of one or more areas. They are used internally
to maintain correct topology for areas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The v.type module can be used to
convert between vector types if possible. The v.build module
is used to generate topology. It optionally allows the user
to extract erroneous <br>
vector objects into a separate map. Topological errors can
be corrected either manually within wxGUI vector digitizer
or, to some extent, automatically in v.clean. A dedicated
<br>
vector editing module is v.edit which supports global and
local editing operations. Adjacent polygons can be found by
v.to.db (see &acirc;sides&acirc; option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many operations including
extraction, queries, overlay, and export will only act on
features which have been assigned a category number.
Typically a centroid will hold the <br>
attribute data for the area with which the centroid is
associated. Boundaries are not typically given a category ID
as it would be ambiguous as to which area either side of it
<br>
the attribute data would belong to. An exception might be
when the boundary between two crop-fields is the center-line
of a road, and the category information is an index to the
<br>
road name. For everyday use boundaries and centroids can be
treated as internal data types and the user can work
directly and more simply with the &quot;area&quot; type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vector object categories and
attribute management <br>
GRASS vectors can be linked to one or many database
management systems (DBMS). The db.* set of commands provides
basic SQL support for attribute management, while the v.db.*
set <br>
of commands operates on a table linked to a vector map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Categories <br>
Categories are used to categorize vector objects and link
attribute(s) to each category. Each vector object can have
zero, one or several categories. Category numbers do <br>
not have to be unique for each vector object, several vector
objects can share the same category. <br>
Category numbers are stored both within the geometry file
for each vector object and within the (optional) attribute
table(s) (usually the &quot;cat&quot; column). It is not
<br>
required that attribute table(s) hold an entry for each
category, and attribute table(s) can hold information about
categories not present in the vector geometry file. <br>
This means that e.g. an attribute table can be populated
first and then vector objects can be added to the geometry
file with category numbers. Using v.category, cate&acirc;
<br>
gory numbers can be printed or maintained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Layers <br>
Layers are a characteristic of the vector feature
(geometries) file. As mentioned above, categories allow the
user to give either a unique id to each feature or to group
<br>
similar features by giving them all the same id. Layers
allow several parallel, but different groupings of features
in a same map. The practical benefit of this system is <br>
that it allows placement of thematically distinct but
topologically related objects into a single map, or for
linking time series attribute data to a series of locations
<br>
that did not change over time. <br>
For example, one can have roads with one layer containing
the unique id of each road and another layer with ids for
specific routes that one might take, combining several <br>
roads by assigning the same id. While this example can also
be dealt with in an attribute table, another example of the
use of layers that shows their specific advantage <br>
is the possibility to identify the same geometrical features
as representing different thematic objects. For example, in
a map with a series of polygons representing <br>
fields in which at the same time the boundaries of these
fields have a meaning as linear features, e.g. as paths, one
can give a unique id to each field as area in layer <br>
1, and a unique id in layer 2 to those boundary lines that
are paths. If the paths will always depend on the field
boundaries (and might change if these boundaries <br>
change) then keeping them in the same map can be helpful.
Trying to reproduce the same functionality through
attributes is much more complicated. <br>
If a vector object has zero categories in a layer, then it
does not appear in that layer. In this fashion some vector
objects may appear in some layers but not in others. <br>
Taking the example of the fields and paths, only some
boundaries, but not all, might have a category value in
layer 2. With option=report, v.category lists available
cat&acirc; <br>
egories in each layer. <br>
Optionally, each layer can (but does not have to) be linked
to an attribute table. The link is made by the category
values of the features in that layer which have to <br>
have corresponding entries in the specified key column of
the table. Using v.db.connect connections between layers and
attribute tables can be listed or maintained. <br>
In most modules, the first layer (layer=1) is active by
default. Using layer=-1 one can access all layers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; SQL support <br>
The DBF driver provides only very limited SQL support (as
DBF is not an SQL DB) while the other DBMS backends (such as
SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL etc) provide full SQL <br>
support since the SQL commands are sent directly to the
DBMI. SQL commands can be directly executed with db.execute,
db.select and the other db.* modules. <br>
When creating vector maps from scratch, in general an
attribute table must be created and the table must be
populated with one row per category (using v.to.db).
However, this <br>
can be performed in a single step using v.db.addtable along
with the definition of table column types. Column adding and
dropping can be done with v.db.addcolumn and
v.db.drop&acirc; <br>
column. A table column can be renamed with
v.db.renamecolumn. To drop a table from a map, use
v.db.droptable. Values in a table can be updated with
v.db.update. Tables can be <br>
joined with with v.db.join.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Editing vector attributes <br>
To manually edit attributes of a table, the map has to be
queried in &acirc;edit mode&acirc; using d.what.vect. To
bulk process attributes, it is recommended to use SQL
(db.execute).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Geometry operations <br>
The module v.in.region saves the current region extents as a
vector area. Split vector lines can be converted to
polylines by v.build.polylines. Long lines can be split by
<br>
v.split and v.segment. Buffer and circles can be generated
with v.buffer and v.parallel. v.generalize is module for
generalization of GRASS vector maps. 2D vector maps can be
<br>
changed to 3D using v.drape or v.extrude. If needed, the
spatial position of vector points can be perturbed by
v.perturb. The v.type command changes between vector types
(see <br>
list above). Projected vector maps can be reprojected with
v.proj. Unprojected maps can be geocoded with v.transform.
Based on the control points, v.rectify rectifies a vector
<br>
map by computing a coordinate transformation for each vector
object. Triangulation and point-to-polygon conversions can
be done with v.delaunay, v.hull, and v.voronoi. The <br>
v.random command generated random points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vector overlays and selections
<br>
Geometric overlay of vector maps is done with v.patch,
v.overlay and v.select, depending on the combination of
vector types. Vectors can be extracted with v.extract and
reclas&acirc; <br>
sified with v.reclass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vector statistics <br>
Statistics can be generated by v.qcount, v.sample, v.normal,
v.univar, and v.vect.stats. Distances between vector objects
are calculated with v.distance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vector-Raster-DB conversion <br>
The v.to.db transfers vector information into database
tables. With v.to.points, v.to.rast and v.to.rast3
conversions are performed. Note that a raster mask
(&quot;MASK&quot;) will not be <br>
respected since it is only applied when reading an existing
GRASS raster map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vector queries <br>
Vector maps can be queried with v.what and v.what.vect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vector-Raster queries <br>
Raster values can be transferred to vector maps with
v.what.rast and v.rast.stats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vector network analysis <br>
GRASS provides support for vector network analysis. The
following algorithms are implemented:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Network
preparation and maintenance: v.net</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Shortest path:
d.path and v.net.path</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Shortest path
between all pairs of nodes v.net.allpairs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Allocation of
sources (create subnetworks, e.g. police station zones):
v.net.alloc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Iso-distances
(from centers): v.net.iso</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Computes bridges
and articulation points: v.net.bridge</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Computes degree,
centrality, betweeness, closeness and eigenvector centrality
measures: v.net.centrality</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Computes
strongly and weakly connected components:
v.net.components</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Computes vertex
connectivity between two sets of nodes:
v.net.connectivity</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Computes
shortest distance via the network between the given sets of
features: v.net.distance</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Computes the
maximum flow between two sets of nodes: v.net.flow</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Computes minimum
spanning tree:v.net.spanningtree</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Minimum Steiner
trees (star-like connections, e.g. broadband cable
connections): v.net.steiner</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Finds shortest
path using timetables: v.net.timetable</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Traveling
salesman (round trip): v.net.salesman <br>
Vector directions are defined by the digitizing direction
(a--&gt;--b). Both directions are supported, most network
modules provide parameters to assign attribute columns to
the <br>
forward and backward direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vector networks: Linear
referencing system (LRS) <br>
LRS uses linear features and distance measured along those
features to positionate objects. There are the commands
v.lrs.create to create a linear reference system,
v.lrs.label <br>
to create stationing on the LRS, v.lrs.segment to create
points/segments on LRS, and v.lrs.where to find line id and
real km+offset for given points in vector map using linear
<br>
reference system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The LRS tutorial explains
further details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interpolation and approximation
<br>
Some of the vector modules deal with spatial or volumetric
approximation (also called interpolation): v.kernel,
v.surf.idw, v.surf.rst, and v.vol.rst.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lidar data processing <br>
Lidar point clouds (first and last return) are imported from
text files with v.in.ascii or from LAS files with
v.in.lidar. Both modules recognize the -b flag to not build
topol&acirc; <br>
ogy. Outlier detection is done with v.outlier on both first
and last return data. Then, with v.lidar.edgedetection,
edges are detected from last return data. The building are
<br>
generated by v.lidar.growing from detected edges. The
resulting data are post-processed with v.lidar.correction.
Finally, the DTM and DSM are generated with v.surf.bspline
(DTM: <br>
uses the &acirc;v.lidar.correction&acirc; output; DSM: uses
last return output from outlier detection).</p>
