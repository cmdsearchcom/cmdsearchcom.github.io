<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlfork - Perl&rsquo;s fork() emulation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
NOTE: As of the 5.8.0 release, fork() emulation has
considerably <br>
matured. However, there are still a few known bugs and
differences <br>
from real fork() that might affect you. See the
&quot;BUGS&quot; and <br>
&quot;CAVEATS AND LIMITATIONS&quot; sections below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl provides a fork() keyword
that corresponds to the Unix system call of the same name.
On most Unix-like platforms where the fork() system call is
available, Perl&rsquo;s fork() <br>
simply calls it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some platforms such as
Windows where the fork() system call is not available, Perl
can be built to emulate fork() at the interpreter level.
While the emulation is designed to <br>
be as compatible as possible with the real fork() at the
level of the Perl program, there are certain important
differences that stem from the fact that all the pseudo
child <br>
&quot;processes&quot; created this way live in the same real
process as far as the operating system is concerned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This document provides a general
overview of the capabilities and limitations of the fork()
emulation. Note that the issues discussed here are not
applicable to platforms where <br>
a real fork() is available and Perl has been configured to
use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The fork() emulation is implemented at the level of the Perl
interpreter. What this means in general is that running
fork() will actually clone the running interpreter and all
<br>
its state, and run the cloned interpreter in a separate
thread, beginning execution in the new thread just after the
point where the fork() was called in the parent. We will
<br>
refer to the thread that implements this child
&quot;process&quot; as the pseudo-process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To the Perl program that called
fork(), all this is designed to be transparent. The parent
returns from the fork() with a pseudo-process ID that can be
subsequently used in any <br>
process-manipulation functions; the child returns from the
fork() with a value of 0 to signify that it is the child
pseudo-process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Behavior of other Perl features
in forked pseudo-processes <br>
Most Perl features behave in a natural way within
pseudo-processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$$ or $PROCESS_ID <br>
This special variable is correctly set to the pseudo-process
ID. It can be used to identify pseudo-processes within a
particular session. Note that this value is <br>
subject to recycling if any pseudo-processes are launched
after others have been wait()-ed on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%ENV Each pseudo-process
maintains its own virtual environment. Modifications to %ENV
affect the virtual environment, and are only visible within
that pseudo-process, and in <br>
any processes (or pseudo-processes) launched from it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chdir() and all other builtins
that accept filenames <br>
Each pseudo-process maintains its own virtual idea of the
current directory. Modifications to the current directory
using chdir() are only visible within that pseudo- <br>
process, and in any processes (or pseudo-processes) launched
from it. All file and directory accesses from the
pseudo-process will correctly map the virtual working <br>
directory to the real working directory appropriately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wait() and waitpid() <br>
wait() and waitpid() can be passed a pseudo-process ID
returned by fork(). These calls will properly wait for the
termination of the pseudo-process and return its <br>
status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill()
&quot;kill(&rsquo;KILL&rsquo;, ...)&quot; can be used to
terminate a pseudo-process by passing it the ID returned by
fork(). The outcome of kill on a pseudo-process is
unpredictable and it <br>
should not be used except under dire circumstances, because
the operating system may not guarantee integrity of the
process resources when a running thread is terminated. <br>
The process which implements the pseudo-processes can be
blocked and the Perl interpreter hangs. Note that using
&quot;kill(&rsquo;KILL&rsquo;, ...)&quot; on a
pseudo-process() may typically <br>
cause memory leaks, because the thread that implements the
pseudo-process does not get a chance to clean up its
resources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;kill(&rsquo;TERM&rsquo;,
...)&quot; can also be used on pseudo-processes, but the
signal will not be delivered while the pseudo-process is
blocked by a system call, e.g. waiting for a <br>
socket to connect, or trying to read from a socket with no
data available. Starting in Perl 5.14 the parent process
will not wait for children to exit once they have <br>
been signalled with &quot;kill(&rsquo;TERM&rsquo;,
...)&quot; to avoid deadlock during process exit. You will
have to explicitly call waitpid() to make sure the child has
time to clean-up <br>
itself, but you are then also responsible that the child is
not blocking on I/O either.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec() Calling exec() within a
pseudo-process actually spawns the requested executable in a
separate process and waits for it to complete before exiting
with the same exit <br>
status as that process. This means that the process ID
reported within the running executable will be different
from what the earlier Perl fork() might have returned. <br>
Similarly, any process manipulation functions applied to the
ID returned by fork() will affect the waiting pseudo-process
that called exec(), not the real process it is <br>
waiting for after the exec().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When exec() is called inside a
pseudo-process then DESTROY methods and END blocks will
still be called after the external process returns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exit() exit() always exits just
the executing pseudo-process, after automatically wait()-ing
for any outstanding child pseudo-processes. Note that this
means that the process <br>
as a whole will not exit unless all running pseudo-processes
have exited. See below for some limitations with open
filehandles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Open handles to files,
directories and network sockets <br>
All open handles are dup()-ed in pseudo-processes, so that
closing any handles in one process does not affect the
others. See below for some limitations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resource limits <br>
In the eyes of the operating system, pseudo-processes
created via the fork() emulation are simply threads in the
same process. This means that any process-level limits
imposed <br>
by the operating system apply to all pseudo-processes taken
together. This includes any limits imposed by the operating
system on the number of open file, directory and socket <br>
handles, limits on disk space usage, limits on memory size,
limits on CPU utilization etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Killing the parent process <br>
If the parent process is killed (either using Perl&rsquo;s
kill() builtin, or using some external means) all the
pseudo-processes are killed as well, and the whole process
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lifetime of the parent process
and pseudo-processes <br>
During the normal course of events, the parent process and
every pseudo-process started by it will wait for their
respective pseudo-children to complete before they exit.
This <br>
means that the parent and every pseudo-child created by it
that is also a pseudo-parent will only exit after their
pseudo-children have exited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting with Perl 5.14 a parent
will not wait() automatically for any child that has been
signalled with &quot;sig(&rsquo;TERM&rsquo;, ...)&quot; to
avoid a deadlock in case the child is blocking on <br>
I/O and never receives the signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS AND LIMITATIONS <br>
BEGIN blocks <br>
The fork() emulation will not work entirely correctly when
called from within a BEGIN block. The forked copy will run
the contents of the BEGIN block, but will not <br>
continue parsing the source stream after the BEGIN block.
For example, consider the following code:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEGIN { <br>
fork and exit; # fork child and exit the parent <br>
print &quot;inner0; <br>
} <br>
print &quot;outer0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will print:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inner</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rather than the expected:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inner <br>
outer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This limitation arises from
fundamental technical difficulties in cloning and restarting
the stacks used by the Perl parser in the middle of a
parse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Open filehandles <br>
Any filehandles open at the time of the fork() will be
dup()-ed. Thus, the files can be closed independently in the
parent and child, but beware that the dup()-ed <br>
handles will still share the same seek pointer. Changing the
seek position in the parent will change it in the child and
vice-versa. One can avoid this by opening files <br>
that need distinct seek pointers separately in the
child.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some operating systems,
notably Solaris and Unixware, calling &quot;exit()&quot;
from a child process will flush and close open filehandles
in the parent, thereby corrupting the <br>
filehandles. On these systems, calling &quot;_exit()&quot;
is suggested instead. &quot;_exit()&quot; is available in
Perl through the &quot;POSIX&quot; module. Please consult
your system&rsquo;s manpages <br>
for more information on this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Open directory handles <br>
Perl will completely read from all open directory handles
until they reach the end of the stream. It will then
seekdir() back to the original location and all future <br>
readdir() requests will be fulfilled from the cache buffer.
That means that neither the directory handle held by the
parent process nor the one held by the child process <br>
will see any changes made to the directory after the fork()
call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that rewinddir() has a
similar limitation on Windows and will not force readdir()
to read the directory again either. Only a newly opened
directory handle will <br>
reflect changes to the directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forking pipe open() not yet
implemented <br>
The &quot;open(FOO, &quot;|-&quot;)&quot; and
&quot;open(BAR, &quot;-|&quot;)&quot; constructs are not yet
implemented. This limitation can be easily worked around in
new code by creating a pipe explicitly. <br>
The following example shows how to write to a forked
child:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># simulate open(FOO,
&quot;|-&quot;) <br>
sub pipe_to_fork ($) { <br>
my $parent = shift; <br>
pipe my $child, $parent or die; <br>
my $pid = fork(); <br>
die &quot;fork() failed: $!&quot; unless defined $pid; <br>
if ($pid) { <br>
close $child; <br>
} <br>
else { <br>
close $parent; <br>
open(STDIN, &quot;&lt;&amp;=&quot; . fileno($child)) or die;
<br>
} <br>
$pid; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if
(pipe_to_fork(&rsquo;FOO&rsquo;)) { <br>
# parent <br>
print FOO &quot;pipe_to_fork0; <br>
close FOO; <br>
} <br>
else { <br>
# child <br>
while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) { print; } <br>
exit(0); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And this one reads from the
child:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># simulate open(FOO,
&quot;-|&quot;) <br>
sub pipe_from_fork ($) { <br>
my $parent = shift; <br>
pipe $parent, my $child or die; <br>
my $pid = fork(); <br>
die &quot;fork() failed: $!&quot; unless defined $pid; <br>
if ($pid) { <br>
close $child; <br>
} <br>
else { <br>
close $parent; <br>
open(STDOUT, &quot;&gt;&amp;=&quot; . fileno($child)) or
die; <br>
} <br>
$pid; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if
(pipe_from_fork(&rsquo;BAR&rsquo;)) { <br>
# parent <br>
while (&lt;BAR&gt;) { print; } <br>
close BAR; <br>
} <br>
else { <br>
# child <br>
print &quot;pipe_from_fork0; <br>
exit(0); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forking pipe open() constructs
will be supported in future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Global state maintained by XSUBs
<br>
External subroutines (XSUBs) that maintain their own global
state may not work correctly. Such XSUBs will either need to
maintain locks to protect simultaneous access to <br>
global data from different pseudo-processes, or maintain all
their state on the Perl symbol table, which is copied
naturally when fork() is called. A callback mechanism <br>
that provides extensions an opportunity to clone their state
will be provided in the near future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interpreter embedded in larger
application <br>
The fork() emulation may not behave as expected when it is
executed in an application which embeds a Perl interpreter
and calls Perl APIs that can evaluate bits of Perl <br>
code. This stems from the fact that the emulation only has
knowledge about the Perl interpreter&rsquo;s own data
structures and knows nothing about the containing <br>
application&rsquo;s state. For example, any state carried on
the application&rsquo;s own call stack is out of reach.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thread-safety of extensions <br>
Since the fork() emulation runs code in multiple threads,
extensions calling into non-thread-safe libraries may not
work reliably when calling fork(). As Perl&rsquo;s <br>
threading support gradually becomes more widely adopted even
on platforms with a native fork(), such extensions are
expected to be fixed for thread-safety.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PORTABILITY CAVEATS <br>
In portable Perl code, &quot;kill(9, $child)&quot; must not
be used on forked processes. Killing a forked process is
unsafe and has unpredictable results. See
&quot;kill()&quot;, above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Having pseudo-process IDs be negative
integers breaks down for the integer &quot;-1&quot; because
the wait() and waitpid() functions treat this number as
being special. The tacit <br>
assumption in the current implementation is that the system
never allocates a thread ID of 1 for user threads. A better
representation for pseudo-process IDs will be <br>
implemented in future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In certain
cases, the OS-level handles created by the pipe(), socket(),
and accept() operators are apparently not duplicated
accurately in pseudo-processes. This only <br>
happens in some situations, but where it does happen, it may
result in deadlocks between the read and write ends of pipe
handles, or inability to send or receive data <br>
across socket handles.</p>
