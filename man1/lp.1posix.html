<p>LP(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
LP(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lp &acirc; send files to a printer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lp [&acirc;c] [&acirc;d dest] [&acirc;n copies] [&acirc;msw]
[&acirc;o option]... [&acirc;t title] [file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The lp utility shall copy the input files to an output
destination in an unspecified manner. The default output
destination should be to a hardcopy device, such as a
printer or <br>
microfilm recorder, that produces non-volatile,
human-readable documents. If such a device is not available
to the application, or if the system provides no such
device, the lp <br>
utility shall exit with a non-zero exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actual writing to the output
device may occur some time after the lp utility successfully
exits. During the portion of the writing that corresponds to
each input file, the <br>
implementation shall guarantee exclusive access to the
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The lp utility shall associate a
unique request ID with each request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, a banner page is
produced to separate and identify each print job. This page
may be suppressed by implementation-defined conditions, such
as an operator command or one <br>
of the &acirc;o option values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The lp utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;c Exit only after further
access to any of the input files is no longer required. The
application can then safely delete or modify the files
without affecting the output <br>
operation. Normally, files are not copied, but are linked
whenever possible. If the &acirc;c option is not given, then
the user should be careful not to remove any of the <br>
files before the request has been printed in its entirety.
It should also be noted that in the absence of the &acirc;c
option, any changes made to the named files after the <br>
request is made but before it is printed may be reflected in
the printed output. On some implementations, &acirc;c may be
on by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;d dest Specify a string
that names the destination (dest). If dest is a printer, the
request shall be printed only on that specific printer. If
dest is a class of printers, <br>
the request shall be printed on the first available printer
that is a member of the class. Under certain conditions
(printer unavailability, file space limitation, and <br>
so on), requests for specific destinations need not be
accepted. Destination names vary between systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &acirc;d is not specified,
and neither the LPDEST nor PRINTER environment variable is
set, an unspecified destination is used. The &acirc;d dest
option shall take precedence <br>
over LPDEST, which in turn shall take precedence over
PRINTER. Results are undefined when dest contains a value
that is not a valid destination name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;m Send mail (see mailx)
after the files have been printed. By default, no mail is
sent upon normal completion of the print request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;n copies Write copies
number of copies of the files, where copies is a positive
decimal integer. The methods for producing multiple copies
and for arranging the multiple copies <br>
when multiple file operands are used are unspecified, except
that each file shall be output as an integral whole, not
interleaved with portions of other files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;o option Specify
printer-dependent or class-dependent options. Several such
options may be collected by specifying the &acirc;o option
more than once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;s Suppress messages from
lp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;t title Write title on
the banner page of the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;w Write a message on the
user&rsquo;s terminal after the files have been printed. If
the user is not logged in, then mail shall be sent
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of a file to be
output. If no file operands are specified, or if a file
operand is &rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;, the standard input shall
be used. If a file operand is used, but the <br>
&acirc;c option is not specified, the process performing the
writing to the output device may have user and group
permissions that differ from that of the process invoking
<br>
lp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be used only if no file operands
are specified, or if a file operand is
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;. See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The input files shall be text files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of lp:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments <br>
and input files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error and informative messages written to standard
<br>
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_TIME Determine the format and
contents of date and time strings displayed in the lp banner
page, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LPDEST Determine the
destination. If the LPDEST environment variable is not set,
the PRINTER environment variable shall be used. The &acirc;d
dest option takes precedence over <br>
LPDEST. Results are undefined when &acirc;d is not specified
and LPDEST contains a value that is not a valid destination
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRINTER Determine the output
device or destination. If the LPDEST and PRINTER environment
variables are not set, an unspecified output device is used.
The &acirc;d dest option and <br>
the LPDEST environment variable shall take precedence over
PRINTER. Results are undefined when &acirc;d is not
specified, LPDEST is unset, and PRINTER contains a value
that <br>
is not a valid device or destination name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TZ Determine the timezone used
to calculate date and time strings displayed in the lp
banner page, if any. If TZ is unset or null, an unspecified
default timezone shall be <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The lp utility shall write a request ID to the standard
output, unless &acirc;s is specified. The format of the
message is unspecified. The request ID can be used on
systems supporting <br>
the historical cancel and lpstat utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 All input files were processed
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 No output device was
available, or an error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The pr and fold utilities can be used to achieve reasonable
formatting for the implementation&rsquo;s default page
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A conforming application can use
one of the file operands only with the &acirc;c option or if
the file is publicly readable and guaranteed to be available
at the time of printing. This <br>
is because POSIX.1&acirc;2008 gives the implementation the
freedom to queue up the request for printing at some later
time by a different process that might not be able to access
the <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. To print file file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lp &acirc;c file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. To print multiple files with
headers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pr file1 file2 | lp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The lp utility was designed to be a basic version of a
utility that is already available in many historical
implementations. The standard developers considered that it
should be <br>
implementable simply as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat &quot;$@&quot; &gt;
/dev/lp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">after appropriate processing of
options, if that is how the implementation chose to do it
and if exclusive access could be granted (so that two users
did not write to the device <br>
simultaneously). Although in the future the standard
developers may add other options to this utility, it should
always be able to execute with no options or operands and
send <br>
the standard input to an unspecified output device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 makes no representations concerning the
format of the printed output, except that it must be
&lsquo;&lsquo;human-readable&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;non-volatile&rsquo;&rsquo;. Thus, writing <br>
by default to a disk or tape drive or a display terminal
would not qualify. (Such destinations are not prohibited
when &acirc;d dest, LPDEST, or PRINTER are used,
however.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 is worded such that a &lsquo;&lsquo;print
job&rsquo;&rsquo; consisting of multiple input files,
possibly in multiple copies, is guaranteed to print so that
any one file is <br>
not intermixed with another, but there is no statement that
all the files or copies have to print out together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;c option may imply a
spooling operation, but this is not required. The utility
can be implemented to wait until the printer is ready and
then wait until it is finished. <br>
Because of that, there is no attempt to define a queuing
mechanism (priorities, classes of output, and so on).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some historical systems, the
request ID reported on the STDOUT can be used to later
cancel or find the status of a request using utilities not
defined in this volume of <br>
POSIX.1&acirc;2008.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although the historical System V
lp and BSD lpr utilities have provided similar
functionality, they used different names for the environment
variable specifying the destination <br>
printer. Since the name of the utility here is lp, LPDEST
(used by the System V lp utility) was given precedence over
PRINTER (used by the BSD lpr utility). Since environments
<br>
of users frequently contain one or the other environment
variable, the lp utility is required to recognize both. If
this was not done, many applications would send output to
<br>
unexpected output devices when users moved from system to
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some have commented that lp has
far too little functionality to make it worthwhile. Requests
have proposed additional options or operands or both that
added functionality. The <br>
requests included:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Wording requiring the output
to be &lsquo;&lsquo;hardcopy&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A requirement for multiple
printers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Options for supporting various
page-description languages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Given that a compliant system is
not required to even have a printer, placing further
restrictions upon the behavior of the printer is not useful.
Since hardcopy format is so <br>
application-dependent, it is difficult, if not impossible,
to select a reasonable subset of functionality that should
be required on all compliant systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The term unspecified is used in
this section in lieu of implementation-defined as most known
implementations would not be able to make definitive
statements in their conformance <br>
documents; the existence and usage of printers is very
dependent on how the system administrator configures each
individual system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the default destination,
device type, queuing mechanisms, and acceptable forms of
input are all unspecified, usage guidelines for what a
conforming application can do are <br>
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Use the command in a pipeline,
or with &acirc;c, so that there are no permission problems
and the files can be safely deleted or modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Limit output to text files of
reasonable line lengths and printable characters and include
no device-specific formatting information, such as a page
description language. The <br>
meaning of &lsquo;&lsquo;reasonable&rsquo;&rsquo; in this
context can only be answered as a quality-of-implementation
issue, but it should be apparent from historical usage
patterns in the industry <br>
and the locale. The pr and fold utilities can be used to
achieve reasonable formatting for the default page size of
the implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, the application
can arrange its installation in such a way that it requires
the system administrator or operator to provide the
appropriate information on lp <br>
options and environment variable values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At a minimum, having this
utility in this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 tells the
industry that conforming applications require a means to
print output and provides at least a command <br>
name and LPDEST routing mechanism that can be used for
discussions between vendors, application developers, and
users. The use of &lsquo;&lsquo;should&rsquo;&rsquo; in the
DESCRIPTION of lp clearly <br>
shows the intent of the standard developers, even if they
cannot mandate that all systems (such as laptops) have
printers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 does not specify what the ownership of
the process performing the writing to the output device may
be. If &acirc;c is not used, it is unspecified whether <br>
the process performing the writing to the output device has
permission to read file if there are any restrictions in
place on who may read file until after it is printed. Also,
<br>
if &acirc;c is not used, the results of deleting file before
it is printed are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
