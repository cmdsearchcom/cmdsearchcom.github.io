<p>dpkg-buildflags(1) dpkg suite dpkg-buildflags(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dpkg-buildflags - returns build flags to use during package
build</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dpkg-buildflags [option...] [command]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dpkg-buildflags is a tool to retrieve compilation flags to
use during build of Debian packages. The default flags are
defined by the vendor but they can be extended/overriden in
<br>
several ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. system-wide with
/etc/dpkg/buildflags.conf;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. for the current user with
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dpkg/buildflags.conf where $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
defaults to $HOME/.config;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. temporarily by the user with
environment variables (see section ENVIRONMENT);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. dynamically by the package
maintainer with environment variables set via debian/rules
(see section ENVIRONMENT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration files can
contain two types of directives:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SET flag value <br>
Override the flag named flag to have the value value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STRIP flag value <br>
Strip from the flag named flag all the build flags listed in
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPEND flag value <br>
Extend the flag named flag by appending the options given in
value. A space is prepended to the appended value if the
flag&rsquo;s current value is non-empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREPEND flag value <br>
Extend the flag named flag by prepending the options given
in value. A space is appended to the prepended value if the
flag&rsquo;s current value is non-empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration files can
contain comments on lines starting with a hash (#). Empty
lines are also ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
--dump Print to standard output all compilation flags and
their values. It prints one flag per line separated from its
value by an equal sign (&acirc;flag=value&acirc;). This is
the default <br>
action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list Print the list of flags
supported by the current vendor (one per line). See the
SUPPORTED FLAGS section for more information about them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--status <br>
Display any information that can be useful to explain the
behaviour of dpkg-buildflags (since dpkg 1.16.5): relevant
environment variables, current vendor, state of all <br>
feature flags. Also print the resulting compiler flags with
their origin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is intended to be run from
debian/rules, so that the build log keeps a clear trace of
the build flags used. This can be useful to diagnose
problems related to them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--export=format <br>
Print to standard output commands that can be used to export
all the compilation flags for some particular tool. If the
format value is not given, sh is assumed. Only com&acirc;
<br>
pilation flags starting with an upper case character are
included, others are assumed to not be suitable for the
environment. Supported formats:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh Shell commands to set and
export all the compilation flags in the environment. The
flag values are quoted so the output is ready for evaluation
by a shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cmdline <br>
Arguments to pass to a build program&rsquo;s command line to
use all the compilation flags (since dpkg 1.17.0). The flag
values are quoted in shell syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">configure <br>
This is a legacy alias for cmdline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">make Make directives to set and
export all the compilation flags in the environment. Output
can be written to a makefile fragment and evaluated using an
include direc&acirc; <br>
tive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--get flag <br>
Print the value of the flag on standard output. Exits with 0
if the flag is known otherwise exits with 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--origin flag <br>
Print the origin of the value that is returned by --get.
Exits with 0 if the flag is known otherwise exits with 1.
The origin can be one of the following values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vendor the original flag set by
the vendor is returned;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">system the flag is set/modified
by a system-wide configuration;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user the flag is set/modified by
a user-specific configuration;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">env the flag is set/modified by
an environment-specific configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--query-features area <br>
Print the features enabled for a given area (since dpkg
1.16.2). The only currently recognized areas on Debian and
derivatives are qa, reproducible, sanitize and harden&acirc;
<br>
ing, see the FEATURE AREAS section for more details. Exits
with 0 if the area is known otherwise exits with 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output is in RFC822 format,
with one section per feature. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Feature: pie <br>
Enabled: no</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Feature: stackprotector <br>
Enabled: yes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Show the usage message
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Show the version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED FLAGS <br>
CFLAGS Options for the C compiler. The default value set by
the vendor includes -g and the default optimization level
(-O2 usually, or -O0 if the DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS environment
<br>
variable defines noopt).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPPFLAGS <br>
Options for the C preprocessor. Default value: empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CXXFLAGS <br>
Options for the C++ compiler. Same as CFLAGS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OBJCFLAGS <br>
Options for the Objective C compiler. Same as CFLAGS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OBJCXXFLAGS <br>
Options for the Objective C++ compiler. Same as
CXXFLAGS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCJFLAGS <br>
Options for the GNU Java compiler (gcj). A subset of
CFLAGS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FFLAGS Options for the Fortran
77 compiler. A subset of CFLAGS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FCFLAGS <br>
Options for the Fortran 9x compiler. Same as FFLAGS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LDFLAGS <br>
Options passed to the compiler when linking executables or
shared objects (if the linker is called directly, then -Wl
and , have to be stripped from these options). <br>
Default value: empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New flags might be added in the
future if the need arises (for example to support other
languages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FEATURE AREAS <br>
Each area feature can be enabled and disabled in the
DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS and DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS environment
variable&rsquo;s area value with the &acirc;+&acirc; and
&acirc;-&acirc; modifier. For example, <br>
to enable the hardening &acirc;pie&acirc; feature and
disable the &acirc;fortify&acirc; feature you can do this in
debian/rules:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export
DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS=hardening=+pie,-fortify</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special feature all (valid
in any area) can be used to enable or disable all area
features at the same time. Thus disabling everything in the
hardening area and enabling <br>
only &acirc;format&acirc; and &acirc;fortify&acirc; can be
achieved with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export
DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS=hardening=-all,+format,+fortify</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qa <br>
Several compile-time options (detailed below) can be used to
help detect problems in the source code or build system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bug This setting (disabled by
default) adds any warning option that reliably detects
problematic source code. The warnings are fatal. The only
currently supported flags are <br>
CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS with flags set to -Werror=array-bounds,
-Werror=clobbered, -Werror=implicit-function-declaration and
-Werror=volatile-register-var.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">canary This setting (disabled by
default) adds dummy canary options to the build flags, so
that the build logs can be checked for how the build flags
propagate and to allow find&acirc; <br>
ing any omission of normal build flag settings. The only
currently supported flags are CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, OBJCFLAGS,
CXXFLAGS and OBJCXXFLAGS with flags set to <br>
-D__DEB_CANARY_flag_random-id__, and LDFLAGS set to
-Wl,-z,deb-canary-random-id.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sanitize <br>
Several compile-time options (detailed below) can be used to
help sanitize a resulting binary against memory corruptions,
memory leaks, use after free, threading data races and <br>
undefined behavior bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">address <br>
This setting (disabled by default) adds -fsanitize=address
to LDFLAGS and -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer to
CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">thread This setting (disabled by
default) adds -fsanitize=thread to CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and
LDFLAGS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">leak This setting (disabled by
default) adds -fsanitize=leak to LDFLAGS. It gets
automatically disabled if either the address or the thread
features are enabled, as they imply <br>
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">undefined <br>
This setting (disabled by default) adds -fsanitize=undefined
to CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hardening <br>
Several compile-time options (detailed below) can be used to
help harden a resulting binary against memory corruption
attacks, or provide additional warning messages during
com&acirc; <br>
pilation. Except as noted below, these are enabled by
default for architectures that support them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format This setting (enabled by
default) adds -Wformat -Werror=format-security to CFLAGS,
CXXFLAGS, OBJCFLAGS and OBJCXXFLAGS. This will warn about
improper format string uses, <br>
and will fail when format functions are used in a way that
represent possible security problems. At present, this warns
about calls to printf and scanf functions where the <br>
format string is not a string literal and there are no
format arguments, as in printf(foo); instead of
printf(&quot;%s&quot;, foo); This may be a security hole if
the format string <br>
came from untrusted input and contains &acirc;%n&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fortify <br>
This setting (enabled by default) adds -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2
to CPPFLAGS. During code generation the compiler knows a
great deal of information about buffer sizes (where <br>
possible), and attempts to replace insecure unlimited length
buffer function calls with length-limited ones. This is
especially useful for old, crufty code. Additionally, <br>
format strings in writable memory that contain
&acirc;%n&acirc; are blocked. If an application depends on
such a format string, it will need to be worked around.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that for this option to
have any effect, the source must also be compiled with -O1
or higher. If the environment variable DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS
contains noopt, then for&acirc; <br>
tify support will be disabled, due to new warnings being
issued by glibc 2.16 and later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stackprotector <br>
This setting (enabled by default if stackprotectorstrong is
not in use) adds -fstack-protector --param=ssp-buffer-size=4
to CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, OBJCFLAGS, OBJCXXFLAGS, <br>
GCJFLAGS, FFLAGS and FCFLAGS. This adds safety checks
against stack overwrites. This renders many potential code
injection attacks into aborting situations. In the best <br>
case this turns code injection vulnerabilities into denial
of service or into non-issues (depending on the
application).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature requires linking
against glibc (or another provider of __stack_chk_fail), so
needs to be disabled when building with -nostdlib or
-ffreestanding or similar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stackprotectorstrong <br>
This setting (enabled by default) adds
-fstack-protector-strong to CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, OBJCFLAGS,
OBJCXXFLAGS, GCJFLAGS, FFLAGS and FCFLAGS. This is a
stronger variant of <br>
stackprotector, but without significant performance
penalties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disabling stackprotector will
also disable this setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature has the same
requirements as stackprotector, and in addition also
requires gcc 4.9 and later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">relro This setting (enabled by
default) adds -Wl,-z,relro to LDFLAGS. During program load,
several ELF memory sections need to be written to by the
linker. This flags the <br>
loader to turn these sections read-only before turning over
control to the program. Most notably this prevents GOT
overwrite attacks. If this option is disabled, bindnow <br>
will become disabled as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bindnow <br>
This setting (disabled by default) adds -Wl,-z,now to
LDFLAGS. During program load, all dynamic symbols are
resolved, allowing for the entire PLT to be marked read-only
<br>
(due to relro above). The option cannot become enabled if
relro is not enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pie This setting (disabled by
default) adds -fPIE to CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, OBJCFLAGS,
OBJCXXFLAGS, GCJFLAGS, FFLAGS and FCFLAGS, and -fPIE -pie to
LDFLAGS. Position Independent <br>
Executable are needed to take advantage of Address Space
Layout Randomization, supported by some kernel versions.
While ASLR can already be enforced for data areas in the
<br>
stack and heap (brk and mmap), the code areas must be
compiled as position-independent. Shared libraries already
do this (-fPIC), so they gain ASLR automatically, but <br>
binary .text regions need to be build PIE to gain ASLR. When
this happens, ROP (Return Oriented Programming) attacks are
much harder since there are no static locations to <br>
bounce off of during a memory corruption attack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is not compatible with
-fPIC so care must be taken when building shared
objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Static libraries can be used by
programs or other shared libraries. Depending on the flags
used to compile all the objects within a static library,
these libraries will <br>
be usable by different sets of objects:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none Cannot be linked into a PIE
program, nor a shared library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fPIE Can be linked into any
program, but not a shared library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fPIC Can be linked into any
program and shared library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unconditionally passing -fPIE,
-fpie or -pie to a build-system using libtool is safe as
these flags will get stripped when building shared
libraries. Otherwise on <br>
projects that build both programs and shared libraries you
might need to make sure that when building the shared
libraries -fPIC is always passed last (so that it
over&acirc; <br>
rides any previous -PIE) to compilation flags such as
CFLAGS, and -shared is passed last (so that it overrides any
previous -pie) to linking flags such as LDFLAGS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, since PIE is
implemented via a general register, some register starved
architectures (but not including i386 anymore since
optimizations implemented in gcc <br>
&gt;= 5) can see performance losses of up to 15% in very
text-segment-heavy application workloads; most workloads see
less than 1%. Architectures with more general registers <br>
(e.g. amd64) do not see as high a worst-case penalty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reproducible <br>
The compile-time options detailed below can be used to help
improve build reproducibility or provide additional warning
messages during compilation. Except as noted below, these
<br>
are enabled by default for architectures that support
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeless <br>
This setting (enabled by default) adds -Wdate-time to
CPPFLAGS. This will cause warnings when the __TIME__,
__DATE__ and __TIMESTAMP__ macros are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fixdebugpath <br>
This setting (enabled by default) adds
-fdebug-prefix-map=BUILDPATH=. to CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS,
OBJCFLAGS, OBJCXXFLAGS, GCJFLAGS, FFLAGS and FCFLAGS where
BUILDPATH is set to <br>
the top-level directory of the package being built. This has
the effect of removing the build path from any generated
debug symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
There are 2 sets of environment variables doing the same
operations, the first one (DEB_flag_op) should never be used
within debian/rules. It&rsquo;s meant for any user that
wants to <br>
rebuild the source package with different build flags. The
second set (DEB_flag_MAINT_op) should only be used in
debian/rules by package maintainers to change the resulting
build <br>
flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEB_flag_SET <br>
DEB_flag_MAINT_SET <br>
This variable can be used to force the value returned for
the given flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEB_flag_STRIP <br>
DEB_flag_MAINT_STRIP <br>
This variable can be used to provide a space separated list
of options that will be stripped from the set of flags
returned for the given flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEB_flag_APPEND <br>
DEB_flag_MAINT_APPEND <br>
This variable can be used to append supplementary options to
the value returned for the given flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEB_flag_PREPEND <br>
DEB_flag_MAINT_PREPEND <br>
This variable can be used to prepend supplementary options
to the value returned for the given flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS <br>
DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS <br>
These variables can be used by a user or maintainer to
disable/enable various area features that affect build
flags. The DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS variable overrides any
<br>
setting in the DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS feature areas. See the
FEATURE AREAS section for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEB_VENDOR <br>
This setting defines the current vendor. If not set, it will
discover the current vendor by reading
/etc/dpkg/origins/default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEB_BUILD_PATH <br>
This variable sets the build path (since dpkg 1.18.8) to use
in features such as fixdebugpath so that they can be
controlled by the caller. This variable is currently <br>
Debian and derivatives-specific.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Configuration files <br>
/etc/dpkg/buildflags.conf <br>
System wide configuration file.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dpkg/buildflags.conf
or <br>
$HOME/.config/dpkg/buildflags.conf <br>
User configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Packaging support <br>
/usr/share/dpkg/buildflags.mk <br>
Makefile snippet that will load (and optionally export) all
flags supported by dpkg-buildflags into variables (since
dpkg 1.16.1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To pass build flags to a build command in a makefile:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(MAKE) $(shell dpkg-buildflags
--export=cmdline)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./configure $(shell
dpkg-buildflags --export=cmdline)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To set build flags in a shell
script or shell fragment, eval can be used to interpret the
output and to export the flags in the environment:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval &quot;$(dpkg-buildflags
--export=sh)&quot; &amp;&amp; make</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or to set the positional
parameters to pass to a command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval &quot;set --
$(dpkg-buildflags --export=cmdline)&quot; <br>
for dir in a b c; do (cd $dir &amp;&amp; ./configure
&quot;$@&quot; &amp;&amp; make); done</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usage in debian/rules <br>
You should call dpkg-buildflags or include buildflags.mk
from the debian/rules file to obtain the needed build flags
to pass to the build system. Note that older versions of
<br>
dpkg-buildpackage (before dpkg 1.16.1) exported these flags
automatically. However, you should not rely on this, since
this breaks manual invocation of debian/rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For packages with autoconf-like
build systems, you can pass the relevant options to
configure or make(1) directly, as shown above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For other build systems, or when
you need more fine-grained control about which flags are
passed where, you can use --get. Or you can include
buildflags.mk instead, which takes <br>
care of calling dpkg-buildflags and storing the build flags
in make variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to export all
buildflags into the environment (where they can be picked up
by your build system):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DPKG_EXPORT_BUILDFLAGS = 1 <br>
include /usr/share/dpkg/buildflags.mk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For some extra control over what
is exported, you can manually export the variables (as none
are exported by default):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include
/usr/share/dpkg/buildflags.mk <br>
export CPPFLAGS CFLAGS LDFLAGS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And you can of course pass the
flags to commands manually:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include
/usr/share/dpkg/buildflags.mk <br>
build-arch: <br>
$(CC) -o hello hello.c $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)</p>
