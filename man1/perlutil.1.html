<p>PERLUTIL(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLUTIL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlutil - utilities packaged with the Perl distribution</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Along with the Perl interpreter itself, the Perl
distribution installs a range of utilities on your system.
There are also several utilities which are used by the Perl
<br>
distribution itself as part of the install process. This
document exists to list all of these utilities, explain what
they are for and provide pointers to each module&rsquo;s
<br>
documentation, if appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIST OF UTILITIES <br>
Documentation <br>
perldoc <br>
The main interface to Perl&rsquo;s documentation is
&quot;perldoc&quot;, although if you&rsquo;re reading this,
it&rsquo;s more than likely that you&rsquo;ve already found
it. perldoc will extract and format <br>
the documentation from any file in the current directory,
any Perl module installed on the system, or any of the
standard documentation pages, such as this one. Use
&quot;perldoc <br>
&lt;name&gt;&quot; to get information on any of the
utilities described in this document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pod2man and pod2text <br>
If it&rsquo;s run from a terminal, perldoc will usually call
pod2man to translate POD (Plain Old Documentation - see
perlpod for an explanation) into a manpage, and then run man
to <br>
display it; if man isn&rsquo;t available, pod2text will be
used instead and the output piped through your favourite
pager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pod2html and pod2latex <br>
As well as these two, there are two other converters:
pod2html will produce HTML pages from POD, and pod2latex,
which produces LaTeX files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pod2usage <br>
If you just want to know how to use the utilities described
here, pod2usage will just extract the &quot;USAGE&quot;
section; some of the utilities will automatically call
pod2usage on <br>
themselves when you call them with &quot;-help&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">podselect <br>
pod2usage is a special case of podselect, a utility to
extract named sections from documents written in POD. For
instance, while utilities have &quot;USAGE&quot; sections,
Perl modules <br>
usually have &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot; sections: &quot;podselect
-s &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot; ...&quot; will extract this section
for a given file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">podchecker <br>
If you&rsquo;re writing your own documentation in POD, the
podchecker utility will look for errors in your markup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splain <br>
splain is an interface to perldiag - paste in your error
message to it, and it&rsquo;ll explain it for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;roffitall&quot; <br>
The &quot;roffitall&quot; utility is not installed on your
system but lives in the pod/ directory of your Perl source
kit; it converts all the documentation from the distribution
to <br>
*roff format, and produces a typeset PostScript or text file
of the whole lot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Converters <br>
To help you convert legacy programs to Perl, we&rsquo;ve
included three conversion filters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a2p <br>
a2p converts awk scripts to Perl programs; for example,
&quot;a2p -F:&quot; on the simple awk script &quot;{print
$2}&quot; will produce a Perl program based around this
code:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while (&lt;&gt;) { <br>
($Fld1,$Fld2) = split(/[:0/, $_, -1); <br>
print $Fld2; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s2p and psed <br>
Similarly, s2p converts sed scripts to Perl programs. s2p
run on &quot;s/foo/bar&quot; will produce a Perl program
based around this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while (&lt;&gt;) { <br>
chomp; <br>
s/foo/bar/g; <br>
print if $printit; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When invoked as psed, it behaves
as a sed implementation, written in Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find2perl <br>
Finally, find2perl translates &quot;find&quot; commands to
Perl equivalents which use the File::Find module. As an
example, &quot;find2perl . -user root -perm 4000
-print&quot; produces the <br>
following callback subroutine for
&quot;File::Find&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub wanted { <br>
my ($dev,$ino,$mode,$nlink,$uid,$gid); <br>
(($dev,$ino,$mode,$nlink,$uid,$gid) = lstat($_)) &amp;&amp;
<br>
$uid == $uid{&rsquo;root&rsquo;}) &amp;&amp; <br>
(($mode &amp; 0777) == 04000); <br>
print(&quot;$name0); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As well as these filters for
converting other languages, the pl2pm utility will help you
convert old-style Perl 4 libraries to new-style Perl5
modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Administration <br>
config_data <br>
Query or change configuration of Perl modules that use
Module::Build-based configuration files for features and
config data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">libnetcfg <br>
To display and change the libnet configuration run the
libnetcfg command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlivp <br>
The perlivp program is set up at Perl source code build time
to test the Perl version it was built under. It can be used
after running &quot;make install&quot; (or your
platform&rsquo;s <br>
equivalent procedure) to verify that perl and its libraries
have been installed correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Development <br>
There are a set of utilities which help you in developing
Perl programs, and in particular, extending Perl with C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlbug <br>
perlbug is the recommended way to report bugs in the perl
interpreter itself or any of the standard library modules
back to the developers; please read through the <br>
documentation for perlbug thoroughly before using it to
submit a bug report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlthanks <br>
This program provides an easy way to send a thank-you
message back to the authors and maintainers of perl.
It&rsquo;s just perlbug installed under another name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h2ph <br>
Back before Perl had the XS system for connecting with C
libraries, programmers used to get library constants by
reading through the C header files. You may still see
&quot;require <br>
&rsquo;syscall.ph&rsquo;&quot; or similar around - the .ph
file should be created by running h2ph on the corresponding
.h file. See the h2ph documentation for more on how to
convert a whole <br>
bunch of header files at once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c2ph and pstruct <br>
c2ph and pstruct, which are actually the same program but
behave differently depending on how they are called, provide
another way of getting at C with Perl - they&rsquo;ll
convert <br>
C structures and union declarations to Perl code. This is
deprecated in favour of h2xs these days.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h2xs <br>
h2xs converts C header files into XS modules, and will try
and write as much glue between C libraries and Perl modules
as it can. It&rsquo;s also very useful for creating
skeletons <br>
of pure Perl modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enc2xs <br>
enc2xs builds a Perl extension for use by Encode from either
Unicode Character Mapping files (.ucm) or Tcl Encoding Files
(.enc). Besides being used internally during the <br>
build process of the Encode module, you can use enc2xs to
add your own encoding to perl. No knowledge of XS is
necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xsubpp <br>
xsubpp is a compiler to convert Perl XS code into C code. It
is typically run by the makefiles created by
ExtUtils::MakeMaker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xsubpp will compile XS code into
C code by embedding the constructs necessary to let C
functions manipulate Perl values and creates the glue
necessary to let Perl access those <br>
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prove <br>
prove is a command-line interface to the test-running
functionality of Test::Harness. It&rsquo;s an alternative to
&quot;make test&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">corelist <br>
A command-line front-end to &quot;Module::CoreList&quot;, to
query what modules were shipped with given versions of
perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General tools <br>
A few general-purpose tools are shipped with perl, mostly
because they came along modules included in the perl
distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">piconv <br>
piconv is a Perl version of iconv, a character encoding
converter widely available for various Unixen today. This
script was primarily a technology demonstrator for Perl <br>
5.8.0, but you can use piconv in the place of iconv for
virtually any case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ptar <br>
ptar is a tar-like program, written in pure Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ptardiff <br>
ptardiff is a small utility that produces a diff between an
extracted archive and an unextracted one. (Note that this
utility requires the &quot;Text::Diff&quot; module to
function <br>
properly; this module isn&rsquo;t distributed with perl, but
is available from the CPAN.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ptargrep <br>
ptargrep is a utility to apply pattern matching to the
contents of files in a tar archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shasum <br>
This utility, that comes with the &quot;Digest::SHA&quot;
module, is used to print or verify SHA checksums.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zipdetails <br>
zipdetails displays information about the internal record
structure of the zip file. It is not concerned with
displaying any details of the compressed data stored in the
zip <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Installation <br>
These utilities help manage extra Perl modules that
don&rsquo;t come with the perl distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpan <br>
cpan is a command-line interface to CPAN.pm. It allows you
to install modules or distributions from CPAN, or just get
information about them, and a lot more. It is similar <br>
to the command line mode of the CPAN module,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -MCPAN -e shell</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpanp <br>
cpanp is, like cpan, a command-line interface to the CPAN,
using the &quot;CPANPLUS&quot; module as a back-end. It can
be used interactively or imperatively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpan2dist <br>
cpan2dist is a tool to create distributions (or packages)
from CPAN modules, then suitable for your package manager of
choice. Support for specific formats are available from <br>
CPAN as &quot;CPANPLUS::Dist::*&quot; modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">instmodsh <br>
A little interface to ExtUtils::Installed to examine
installed modules, validate your packlists and even create a
tarball from an installed module.</p>
