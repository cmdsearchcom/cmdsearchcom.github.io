<p>splitshp(1) General Commands Manual splitshp(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
splitshp - Split Shape into frames or combine frames into
Shapes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
splitshp SHAPE FRAME...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splitshp SHAPE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Shape files are used for storage of all visible elements
(from UI buttons to terrain features) of the games Exult
supports. Shapes contain one or more frames. splitshp can be
<br>
used to combine frames into one file, or split a Shape file
into its component frames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mode of operation is
determined by looking at the number of commandline
arguments. Exactly one argument means splitting, more than
one argument signals a combining operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Combining <br>
Each FRAME names a Shape file typically consisting of only
one frame (i.e. subsequent frames are ignored). All these
frames are concatenated and written to the Shape file
SHAPE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Splitting <br>
SHAPE will be read and split into its component frames. Each
of those will be written to its own Shape file. The names of
these files are determined by splitting the name of <br>
SHAPE before the last dot &acirc; anything before this dot
is the STEM, anything else (including the dot) is the
PREFIX, which may be empty in case there is no dot in the
name. The <br>
output files are then named STEM_nnSUFFIX with nn replaced
by the frame number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
splitshp button.shp button-up.shp button-down.shp <br>
Packs the (first) two frames from button-up.shp and
button-down.shp into the Shape file button.shp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splitshp grizzly <br>
Unpacks the frames contained in the Shape file grizzly into
the (single-frame) Shape files grizzly_00, grizzly_01,
grizzly_02, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splitshp boar.new.shp <br>
Unpacks the frames contained in the Shape file boar.new.shp
into the (single-frame) Shape files boar.new_00.shp,
boar.new_01.shp, boar.new_02.shp, etc.</p>
