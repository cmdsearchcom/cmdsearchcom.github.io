<p>PMDASAMPLE(1) General Commands Manual PMDASAMPLE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmdasample - sample performance metrics domain agent
(PMDA)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pmdasample [-d domain] [-i port] [-l logfile]
[-p] [-u socket] [-U username]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmdasample is a sample Performance Metrics Domain Agent
(PMDA) which exports a variety of synthetic performance
metrics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This PMDA was developed as part
of the quality assurance testing for the PCP product, but
has other uses, most notably in the development of new PCP
clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The metrics exported by the
sample PMDA cover the full range of data types, data
semantics, value cardinality, instance domain stability and
error conditions found in real PMDAs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A brief description of the
pmdasample command line options follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d It is absolutely crucial that
the performance metrics domain number specified here is
unique and consistent. That is, domain should be different
for every PMDA on the one <br>
host, and the same domain number should be used for the same
PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Expect PMCD to connect to
pmdasample on the specified TCP/IP port. port may be a port
number or port name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Location of the log file. By
default, a log file named sample.log is written in the
current directory of pmcd(1) when pmdasample is started,
i.e. $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. If <br>
the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
written to the standard error instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Expect PMCD to create a pipe
and the connection to pmdasample is via standard input and
standard output. This is the default connection mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Expect PMCD to connect to
pmdasample on the Unix domain socket named socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U User account under which to
run the agent. The default is the unprivileged
&quot;pcp&quot; account in current versions of PCP, but in
older versions the superuser account (&quot;root&quot;) <br>
was used by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At most one of the options -i,
-p and -u may be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
If you want access to the names, help text and values for
the sample performance metrics, do the following as
root:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sample <br>
# ./Install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the installation
script also installs the DSO version of the sample PMDA, so
there are in fact two PMDAs installed, and two sets of
performance metrics, namely sample.* <br>
and sampledso.*.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to undo the
installation (and remove both PMDAs), do the following as
root:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sample <br>
# ./Remove</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmdasample is launched by
pmcd(1) and should never be executed directly. The Install
and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the agent is
installed or removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH <br>
command line options used to launch pmdasample <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sample/help <br>
default help text file for the sample metrics <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sample/Install <br>
installation script for the pmdasample agent <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sample/Remove <br>
undo installation script for the pmdasample agent <br>
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/sample.log <br>
default log file for error messages and other information
from pmdasample</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
