<p>WINE(1) Windows On Unix WINE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
wine - run Windows programs on Unix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
wine program [arguments] <br>
wine --help <br>
wine --version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instructions on passing
arguments to Windows programs, please see the
PROGRAM/ARGUMENTS section of the man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
wine loads and runs the given program, which can be a DOS,
Windows 3.x, Win32 or Win64 executable (on 64-bit
systems).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For debugging wine, use winedbg
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For running CUI executables
(Windows console programs), use wineconsole instead of wine.
This will display the output in a separate window. Not using
wineconsole for CUI pro&acirc; <br>
grams will only provide very limited console support, and
your program might not function properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When invoked with --help or
--version as the only argument, wine will simply print a
small help message or its version respectively and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROGRAM/ARGUMENTS <br>
The program name may be specified in DOS format
(C:\WINDOWS\SOL.EXE) or in Unix format
(/msdos/windows/sol.exe). You may pass arguments to the
program being executed by adding <br>
them to the end of the command line invoking wine (such as:
wine notepad C:\TEMP\README.TXT). Note that you need to
&rsquo;&acute; escape special characters (and spaces) when
invoking <br>
Wine via a shell, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wine
C:\Program&nbsp;Files\MyPrg\test.exe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It can also be one of the
Windows executables shipped with Wine, in which case
specifying the full path is not mandatory, e.g. wine
explorer or wine notepad.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
wine makes the environment variables of the shell from which
it is started accessible to the Windows/DOS processes
started. So use the appropriate syntax for your shell to
enter <br>
environment variables you need.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINEPREFIX <br>
If set, the contents of this variable is taken as the name
of the directory where Wine stores its data (the default is
$HOME/.wine). This directory is also used to iden&acirc;
<br>
tify the socket which is used to communicate with the
wineserver. All wine processes using the same wineserver
(i.e.: same user) share certain things like registry, <br>
shared memory, and config file. By setting WINEPREFIX to
different values for different wine processes, it is
possible to run a number of truly independent wine
pro&acirc; <br>
cesses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINESERVER <br>
Specifies the path and name of the wineserver binary. If not
set, Wine will try to load /usr/lib/wine/wineserver, and if
this doesn&rsquo;t exist it will then look for a file <br>
named &quot;wineserver&quot; in the path and in a few other
likely locations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINELOADER <br>
Specifies the path and name of the wine binary to use to
launch new Windows processes. If not set, Wine will try to
load /usr/lib/wine/wine, and if this doesn&rsquo;t exist it
<br>
will then look for a file named &quot;wine&quot; in the path
and in a few other likely locations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINEDEBUG <br>
Turns debugging messages on or off. The syntax of the
variable is of the form
[class][+|-]channel[,[class2][+|-]channel2]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">class is optional and can be one
of the following: err, warn, fixme, or trace. If class is
not specified, all debugging messages for the specified
channel are turned on. <br>
Each channel will print messages about a particular
component of Wine. The following character can be either +
or - to switch the specified channel on or off respec&acirc;
<br>
tively. If there is no class part before it, a leading + can
be omitted. Note that spaces are not allowed anywhere in the
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINEDEBUG=warn+all <br>
will turn on all warning messages (recommended for
debugging).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINEDEBUG=warn+dll,+heap <br>
will turn on DLL warning messages and all heap messages.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINEDEBUG=fixme-all,warn+cursor,+relay
<br>
will turn off all FIXME messages, turn on cursor warning
messages, and turn on all relay messages (API calls).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINEDEBUG=relay <br>
will turn on all relay messages. For more control on
including or excluding functions and dlls from the relay
trace, look into the HKEY_CURRENT_USERt&acirc; <br>
wareWinegistry key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information on
debugging messages, see the Running Wine chapter of the Wine
User Guide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINEDLLPATH <br>
Specifies the path(s) in which to search for builtin dlls
and Winelib applications. This is a list of directories
separated by &quot;:&quot;. In addition to any directory
specified <br>
in WINEDLLPATH, Wine will also look in
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/wine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINEDLLOVERRIDES <br>
Defines the override type and load order of dlls used in the
loading process for any dll. There are currently two types
of libraries that can be loaded into a process <br>
address space: native windows dlls (native) and Wine
internal dlls (builtin). The type may be abbreviated with
the first letter of the type (n or b). The library may <br>
also be disabled (&rsquo;&rsquo;). Each sequence of orders
must be separated by commas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each dll may have its own
specific load order. The load order determines which version
of the dll is attempted to be loaded into the address space.
If the first fails, <br>
then the next is tried and so on. Multiple libraries with
the same load order can be separated with commas. It is also
possible to use specify different loadorders for <br>
different libraries by separating the entries by
&quot;;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The load order for a 16-bit dll
is always defined by the load order of the 32-bit dll that
contains it (which can be identified by looking at the
symbolic link of the <br>
16-bit .dll.so file). For instance if ole32.dll is
configured as builtin, storage.dll will be loaded as builtin
too, since the 32-bit ole32.dll contains the 16-bit
stor&acirc; <br>
age.dll.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINEDLLOVERRIDES=&quot;comdlg32,shell32=n,b&quot;
<br>
Try to load comdlg32 and shell32 as native windows dll first
and try the builtin version if the native load fails.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINEDLLOVERRIDES=&quot;comdlg32,shell32=n;c:\foo\bar\baz=b&quot;
<br>
Try to load the libraries comdlg32 and shell32 as native
windows dlls. Furthermore, if an application r d t h e b u i
request to load c:olry t i n l i b r <br>
baz.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINEDLLOVERRIDES=&quot;comdlg32=b,n;shell32=b;comctl32=n;oleaut32=&quot;
<br>
Try to load comdlg32 as builtin first and try the native
version if the builtin load fails; load shell32 always as
builtin and comctl32 always as native; oleaut32 <br>
will be disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINEARCH <br>
Specifies the Windows architecture to support. It can be set
either to win32 (support only 32-bit applications), or to
win64 (support both 64-bit applications and 32-bit <br>
ones in WoW64 mode). <br>
The architecture supported by a given Wine prefix is set at
prefix creation time and cannot be changed afterwards. When
running with an existing prefix, Wine will refuse <br>
to start if WINEARCH doesn&rsquo;t match the prefix
architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAY <br>
Specifies the X11 display to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OSS sound driver configuration
variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUDIODEV <br>
Set the device for audio input / output. Default
/dev/dsp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIXERDEV <br>
Set the device for mixer controls. Default /dev/mixer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIDIDEV <br>
Set the MIDI (sequencer) device. Default /dev/sequencer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/lib/wine/wine <br>
The Wine program loader.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/lib/wine/wineconsole <br>
The Wine program loader for CUI (console) applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/lib/wine/wineserver <br>
The Wine server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/lib/wine/winedbg <br>
The Wine debugger</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/wine
<br>
Directory containing Wine shared libraries</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$WINEPREFIX/dosdevices <br>
Directory containing the DOS device mappings. Each file in
that directory is a symlink to the Unix device file
implementing a given device. For instance, if COM1 is mapped
<br>
to /dev/ttyS0 you&rsquo;d have a symlink of the form
$WINEPREFIX/dosdevices/com1 -&gt; /dev/ttyS0. <br>
DOS drives are also specified with symlinks; for instance if
drive D: corresponds to the CDROM mounted at /mnt/cdrom,
you&rsquo;d have a symlink $WINEPREFIX/dosdevices/d: -&gt;
<br>
/mnt/cdrom. The Unix device corresponding to a DOS drive can
be specified the same way, except with &rsquo;::&rsquo;
instead of &rsquo;:&rsquo;. So for the previous example, if
the CDROM device <br>
is mounted from /dev/hdc, the corresponding symlink would be
$WINEPREFIX/dosdevices/d:: -&gt; /dev/hdc.</p>
