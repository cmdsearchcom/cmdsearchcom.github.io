<p style="margin-top: 1em">Raster data processing in GRASS
GIS <br>
Raster maps in general <br>
A &quot;raster map&quot; is a data layer consisting of a
gridded array of cells. It has a certain number of rows and
columns, with a data point (or null value indicator) in each
cell. <br>
These may exist as a 2D grid or as a 3D cube made up of many
smaller cubes, i.e. a stack of 2D grids.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The geographic boundaries of the
raster map are described by the north, south, east, and west
fields. These values describe the lines which bound the map
at its edges. These <br>
lines do NOT pass through the center of the grid cells at
the edge of the map, but along the edge of the map itself.
i.e. the geographic extent of the map is described by the
<br>
outer bounds of all cells within the map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a general rule in GRASS
GIS:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Raster output maps have their
bounds and resolution equal to those of the current
computational region.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Raster input maps are
automatically cropped/padded and rescaled (using
nearest-neighbour resampling) to match the current
region.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Raster input maps are
automatically masked if a raster map named MASK exists. The
MASK is only applied when reading maps from the disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a few exceptions to
this: r.in.* programs read the data cell-for-cell, with no
resampling. When reading non-georeferenced data, the
imported map will usually have its <br>
lower-left corner at (0,0) in the location&acirc;s
coordinate system; the user needs to use r.region to
&quot;place&quot; the imported map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some programs which need to
perform specific types of resampling (e.g. r.resamp.rst)
read the input maps at their original resolution then do the
resampling themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r.proj has to deal with two
regions (source and destination) simultaneously; both will
have an impact upon the final result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Raster import and export <br>
The module r.in.gdal offers a common interface for many
different raster formats. Additionally, it also offers
options such as on-the-fly location creation or extension of
the <br>
default region to match the extent of the imported raster
map. For special cases, other import modules are available.
The full map is always imported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For importing scanned maps, the
user will need to create a x,y-location, scan the map in the
desired resolution and save it into an appropriate raster
format (e.g. tiff, jpeg, <br>
png, pbm) and then use r.in.gdal to import it. Based on
reference points the scanned map can be recified to obtain
geocoded data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Raster maps are exported with
r.out.gdal into common formats. Also r.out.bin, r.out.vtk,
r.out.ascii and other export modules are available. They
export the data according to the <br>
current region settings. If those differ from the original
map, the map is resampled on the fly (nearest neighbor
algorithm). In other words, the output will have as many
rows <br>
and columns as the current region. To export maps with
various grid spacings (e.g, 500x500 or 200x500), you can
just change the region resolution with g.region and then
export <br>
the map. The resampling is done with nearest neighbor
algorithm in this case. If you want some other form of
resampling, first change the region, then explicitly
resample the map <br>
with e.g. r.resamp.interp or r.resamp.stats, then export the
resampled map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRASS GIS raster map exchange
between different locations (same projection) can be done in
a lossless way using the r.pack and r.unpack modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Metadata <br>
The r.info module displays general information about a map
such as region extent, data range, data type, creation
history, and other metadata. Metadata such as map title,
units, <br>
vertical datum etc. can be updated with r.support.
Timestamps are managed with r.timestamp. Region extent and
resolution are mangaged with r.region.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Raster map operations <br>
Resampling methods and interpolation methods <br>
GRASS raster map processing is always performed in the
current region settings (see g.region), i.e. the current
region extent and current raster resolution is used. If the
reso&acirc; <br>
lution differs from that of the input raster map(s),
on-the-fly resampling is performed (nearest neighbor
resampling). If this is not desired, the input map(s)
has/have to be <br>
resampled beforehand with one of the dedicated modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The built-in nearest-neighbour
resampling of raster data calculates the centre of each
region cell, and takes the value of the raster cell in which
that point falls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the point falls exactly upon
a grid line, the exact result will be determined by the
direction of any rounding error. One consequence of this is
that downsampling by a factor <br>
which is an even integer will always sample exactly on the
boundary between cells, meaning that the result is
ill-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following modules are
available for reinterpolation of &quot;filled&quot; raster
maps (continuous data) to a different resolution:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; r.resample uses
the built-in resampling, so it should produce identical
results as the on-the-fly resampling done via the raster
import modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; r.resamp.interp
Resampling with nearest neighbor, bilinear, and bicubic
method: method=nearest uses the same algorithm as
r.resample, but not the same code, so it may not <br>
produce identical results in cases which are decided by the
rounding of floating-point numbers. <br>
For r.resamp.interp method=bilinear and method=bicubic, the
raster values are treated as samples at each raster
cell&acirc;s centre, defining a piecewise-continuous
surface. <br>
The resulting raster values are obtained by sampling the
surface at each region cell&acirc;s centre. As the algorithm
only interpolates, and doesn&acirc;t extrapolate, a margin
of <br>
0.5 (for bilinear) or 1.5 (for bicubic) cells is lost from
the extent of the original raster. Any samples taken within
this margin will be null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; r.resamp.rst
Regularized Spline with Tension (RST) interpolation 2D:
Behaves similarly, i.e. it computes a surface assuming that
the values are samples at each raster <br>
cell&acirc;s centre, and samples the surface at each region
cell&acirc;s centre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; r.resamp.bspline
Bicubic or bilinear spline interpolation with Tykhonov
regularization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; For
r.resamp.stats without -w, the value of each region cell is
the chosen aggregate of the values from all of the raster
cells whose centres fall within the bounds of <br>
the region cell. <br>
With -w, the samples are weighted according to the
proportion of the raster cell which falls within the bounds
of the region cell, so the result is normally unaffected by
<br>
rounding error (a minuscule difference in the position of
the boundary results in the addition or subtraction of a
sample weighted by a minuscule factor; also, The min <br>
and max aggregates can&acirc;t use weights, so -w has no
effect for those).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; r.fillnulls for
Regularized Spline with Tension (RST) interpolation 2D for
hole filling (e.g., SRTM DEM)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, there are modules
available for reinterpolation of &quot;sparse&quot;
(scattered points or lines) maps:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Inverse distance
weighted average (IDW) interpolation (r.surf.idw)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Interpolating
from contour lines (r.contour)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Various vector
modules for interpolation <br>
For Lidar and similar data, r.in.lidar and r.in.xyz support
loading and binning of ungridded x,y,z ASCII data into a new
raster map. The user may choose from a variety of sta&acirc;
<br>
tistical methods in creating the new raster map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, for interpolation of
scattered data, use the v.surf.* set of modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Raster MASKs <br>
If a raster map named &quot;MASK&quot; exists, most GRASS
raster modules will operate only on data falling inside the
masked area, and treat any data falling outside of the mask
as if its <br>
value were NULL. The mask is only applied when reading an
existing GRASS raster map, for example when used in a module
as an input map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mask is read as an integer
map. If MASK is actually a floating-point map, the values
will be converted to integers using the map&acirc;s
quantisation rules (this defaults to <br>
round-to-nearest, but can be changed with r.quant).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(see r.mask)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Raster map statistics <br>
A couple of commands are available to calculate local
statistics (r.neighbors), and global statistics
(r.statistics, r.surf.area). Profiles and transects can be
generated <br>
(d.profile, r.profile, r.transect) as well as histograms
(d.histogram) and polar diagrams (d.polar). Univariate
statistics (r.univar) and reports are also available <br>
(r.report,r.stats, r.volume).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Raster map algebra and
aggregation <br>
The r.mapcalc command provides raster map algebra methods.
The r.resamp.stats command resamples raster map layers using
various aggregation methods, the r.statistics command <br>
aggregates one map based on a second map. r.resamp.interp
resamples raster map layers using interpolation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regression analysis <br>
Both linear (r.regression.line) and multiple regression
(r.regression.multi) are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hydrologic modeling toolbox <br>
Watershed modeling related modules are r.basins.fill,
r.water.outlet, r.watershed, and r.terraflow. Water flow
related modules are r.carve, r.drain, r.fill.dir,
r.fillnulls, <br>
r.flow, and r.topidx. Flooding can be simulated with r.lake.
Hydrologic simulation model are available as r.sim.sediment,
r.sim.water, and r.topmodel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Raster format <br>
In GRASS GIS, raster data can be stored as 2D or 3D
grids.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2D raster maps <br>
2D rasters support three data types (for technical details,
please refer to the Wiki article GRASS raster
semantics):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 32bit signed
integer (CELL),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; single-precision
floating-point (FCELL), and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; double-precision
floating-point (DCELL). <br>
In most GRASS GIS resources, 2D raster maps are usually
called &quot;raster&quot; maps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3D raster maps <br>
The 3D raster map type is usually called &quot;3D
raster&quot; but other names like &quot;RASTER3D&quot;,
&quot;voxel&quot;, &quot;volume&quot;, &quot;GRID3D&quot; or
&quot;3d cell&quot; are yet common. 3D rasters support only
single- <br>
and double-precision floating-point. 3D raster&acirc;s
single-precision data type is most often called
&quot;float&quot;, and the double-precision one
&quot;double&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No-data management and data
portability <br>
GRASS GIS distinguishes NULL and zero. When working with
NULL data, it is important to know that operations on NULL
cells lead to NULL cells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GRASS GIS raster format is
architecture independent and portable between 32bit and
64bit machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Raster compression <br>
All GRASS GIS raster map types are by default ZLIB
compressed, i.e. using ZLIB&acirc;s deflate algorithm.
Through the environment variable GRASS_COMPRESSOR the
compression method can <br>
be set to RLE, ZLIB, LZ4, or BZIP2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Integer (CELL type) raster maps
can be compressed with RLE if the environment variable
GRASS_INT_ZLIB exists and is set to value 0. However, this
is not recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Floating point (FCELL, DCELL)
raster maps never use RLE compression; they are either
compressed with ZLIB, LZ4, BZIP2 or are uncompressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RLE <br>
DEPRECATED Run-Length Encoding, poor compression ratio but
fast. It is kept for backwards compatibility to read raster
maps created with GRASS 6. It is only used for raster <br>
maps of type CELL. FCELL and DCELL maps are never and have
never been compressed with RLE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZLIB <br>
ZLIB&acirc;s deflate is the default compression method for
all raster maps. GRASS GIS 7 uses by default 1 as ZLIB
compression level which is the best compromise between speed
and <br>
compression ratio, also when compared to other available
compression methods. Valid levels are in the range [1, 9]
and can be set with the environment variable <br>
GRASS_ZLIB_LEVEL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LZ4 <br>
LZ4 is a very fast compression method, about as fast as no
compression. Decompression is also very fast. The
compression ratio is generally higher than for RLE but worse
than <br>
for ZLIB. LZ4 is recommended if disk space is not a limiting
factor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BZIP2 <br>
BZIP2 can provide compression ratios much higher than the
other methods, but only for large raster maps (&gt; 10000
columns). For large raster maps, disk space consumption can
<br>
be reduced by 30 - 50% when using BZIP2 instead of
ZLIB&acirc;s deflate. BZIP2 is the slowest compression and
decompression method. However, if reading from / writing to
a storage <br>
device is the limiting factor, BZIP2 compression can speed
up raster map processing. Be aware that for smaller raster
maps, BZIP2 compression ratio can be worse than other <br>
compression methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the internal cellhd file, the
value for &quot;compressed&quot; is 1 for RLE, 2 for ZLIB, 3
for LZ4, and 4 for BZIP2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Obviously, decompression is
controlled by the raster map&acirc;s compression, not the
environment variable.</p>
