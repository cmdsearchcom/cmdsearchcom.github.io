  maps in general</a></h2>
A &quot;raster map&quot; is a data layer consisting of a gridded array of cells.
  It has a certain number of rows and columns, with a data point (or null value
  indicator) in each cell. These may exist as a 2D grid or as a 3D cube made up
  of many smaller cubes, i.e. a stack of 2D grids.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The geographic boundaries of the raster map are described by the north, south,
  east, and west fields. These values describe the lines which bound the map at
  its edges. These lines do NOT pass through the center of the grid cells at the
  edge of the map, but along the edge of the map itself. i.e. the geographic
  extent of the map is described by the outer bounds of all cells within the
  map.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a general rule in GRASS GIS:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>1</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Raster output maps have their bounds and resolution equal
      to those of the current computational region.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>2</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Raster input maps are automatically cropped/padded and
      rescaled (using nearest-neighbour resampling) to match the current
    region.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>3</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Raster input maps are automatically masked if a raster map
      named MASK exists. The MASK is only applied when <i>reading</i> maps from
      the disk.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are a few exceptions to this: r.in.* programs read the data cell-for-cell,
  with no resampling. When reading non-georeferenced data, the imported map will
  usually have its lower-left corner at (0,0) in the location&#x2019;s
  coordinate system; the user needs to use r.region to &quot;place&quot; the
  imported map.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some programs which need to perform specific types of resampling (e.g.
  r.resamp.rst) read the input maps at their original resolution then do the
  resampling themselves.
<div class="Pp"></div>
r.proj has to deal with two regions (source and destination) simultaneously;
  both will have an impact upon the final result.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Raster_import_and_export"><a class="selflink" href="#Raster_import_and_export">Raster
  import and export</a></h2>
The module r.in.gdal offers a common interface for many different raster
  formats. Additionally, it also offers options such as on-the-fly location
  creation or extension of the default region to match the extent of the
  imported raster map. For special cases, other import modules are available.
  The full map is always imported.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For importing scanned maps, the user will need to create a x,y-location, scan
  the map in the desired resolution and save it into an appropriate raster
  format (e.g. tiff, jpeg, png, pbm) and then use r.in.gdal to import it. Based
  on reference points the scanned map can be recified to obtain geocoded data.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Raster maps are exported with r.out.gdal into common formats. Also r.out.bin,
  r.out.vtk, r.out.ascii and other export modules are available. They export the
  data according to the current region settings. If those differ from the
  original map, the map is resampled on the fly (nearest neighbor algorithm). In
  other words, the output will have as many rows and columns as the current
  region. To export maps with various grid spacings (e.g, 500x500 or 200x500),
  you can just change the region resolution with g.region and then export the
  map. The resampling is done with nearest neighbor algorithm in this case. If
  you want some other form of resampling, first change the region, then
  explicitly resample the map with e.g. r.resamp.interp or r.resamp.stats, then
  export the resampled map.
<div class="Pp"></div>
GRASS GIS raster map exchange between different locations (same projection) can
  be done in a lossless way using the r.pack and r.unpack modules.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Metadata"><a class="selflink" href="#Metadata">Metadata</a></h2>
The r.info module displays general information about a map such as region
  extent, data range, data type, creation history, and other metadata. Metadata
  such as map title, units, vertical datum etc. can be updated with r.support.
  Timestamps are managed with r.timestamp. Region extent and resolution are
  mangaged with r.region.

GRASS raster map processing is always performed in the current region settings
  (see g.region), i.e. the current region extent and current raster resolution
  is used. If the resolution differs from that of the input raster map(s),
  on-the-fly resampling is performed (nearest neighbor resampling). If this is
  not desired, the input map(s) has/have to be resampled beforehand with one of
  the dedicated modules.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The built-in nearest-neighbour resampling of raster data calculates the centre
  of each region cell, and takes the value of the raster cell in which that
  point falls.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the point falls exactly upon a grid line, the exact result will be determined
  by the direction of any rounding error. One consequence of this is that
  downsampling by a factor which is an even integer will always sample exactly
  on the boundary between cells, meaning that the result is ill-defined.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following modules are available for reinterpolation of &quot;filled&quot;
  raster maps (continuous data) to a different resolution:
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">r.resample uses the built-in resampling, so it should
      produce identical results as the on-the-fly resampling done via the raster
      import modules.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">r.resamp.interp Resampling with nearest neighbor, bilinear,
      and bicubic method: <b>method=nearest</b> uses the same algorithm as
      r.resample, but not the same code, so it may not produce identical results
      in cases which are decided by the rounding of floating-point numbers.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    For r.resamp.interp <b>method=bilinear</b> and <b>method=bicubic</b>, the
      raster values are treated as samples at each raster cell&#x2019;s centre,
      defining a piecewise-continuous surface. The resulting raster values are
      obtained by sampling the surface at each region cell&#x2019;s centre. As
      the algorithm only interpolates, and doesn&#x2019;t extrapolate, a margin
      of 0.5 (for bilinear) or 1.5 (for bicubic) cells is lost from the extent
      of the original raster. Any samples taken within this margin will be
    null.</dd>

      the position of the boundary results in the addition or subtraction of a
      sample weighted by a minuscule factor; also, The min and max aggregates

Furthermore, there are modules available for reinterpolation of
  &quot;sparse&quot; (scattered points or lines) maps:

</dl>
</div>
For Lidar and similar data, r.in.lidar and r.in.xyz support loading and binning
  of ungridded x,y,z ASCII data into a new raster map. The user may choose from
  a variety of statistical methods in creating the new raster map.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Otherwise, for interpolation of scattered data, use the <i>v.surf.*</i> set of
  modules.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Raster_MASKs"><a class="selflink" href="#Raster_MASKs">Raster
  MASKs</a></h2>
If a raster map named &quot;MASK&quot; exists, most GRASS raster modules will
  operate only on data falling inside the masked area, and treat any data
  falling outside of the mask as if its value were NULL. The mask is only
  applied when <i>reading</i> an existing GRASS raster map, for example when
  used in a module as an input map.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The mask is read as an integer map. If MASK is actually a floating-point map,
  the values will be converted to integers using the map&#x2019;s quantisation
  rules (this defaults to round-to-nearest, but can be changed with r.quant).
<div class="Pp"></div>
(see r.mask)
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Raster_map_statistics"><a class="selflink" href="#Raster_map_statistics">Raster
  map statistics</a></h2>
A couple of commands are available to calculate local statistics (r.neighbors),
  and global statistics (r.statistics, r.surf.area). Profiles and transects can
  be generated (d.profile, r.profile, r.transect) as well as histograms
  (d.histogram) and polar diagrams (d.polar). Univariate statistics (r.univar)
  and reports are also available (r.report,r.stats, r.volume).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Raster_map_algebra_and_aggregation"><a class="selflink" href="#Raster_map_algebra_and_aggregation">Raster
  map algebra and aggregation</a></h2>
The r.mapcalc command provides raster map algebra methods. The r.resamp.stats
  command resamples raster map layers using various aggregation methods, the
  r.statistics command aggregates one map based on a second map. r.resamp.interp
  resamples raster map layers using interpolation.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Regression_analysis"><a class="selflink" href="#Regression_analysis">Regression

Both linear (r.regression.line) and multiple regression (r.regression.multi) are
  supported.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Hydrologic_modeling_toolbox"><a class="selflink" href="#Hydrologic_modeling_toolbox">Hydrologic

Watershed modeling related modules are r.basins.fill, r.water.outlet,
  r.watershed, and r.terraflow. Water flow related modules are r.carve, r.drain,
  r.fill.dir, r.fillnulls, r.flow, and r.topidx. Flooding can be simulated with
  r.lake. Hydrologic simulation model are available as r.sim.sediment,
  r.sim.water, and r.topmodel.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="2D_raster_maps"><a class="selflink" href="#2D_raster_maps">2D

2D rasters support three data types (for technical details, please refer to the
  Wiki article GRASS raster semantics):
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">

</div>
In most GRASS GIS resources, 2D raster maps are usually called
  &quot;raster&quot; maps.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="3D_raster_maps"><a class="selflink" href="#3D_raster_maps">3D
  raster maps</a></h2>
The 3D raster map type is usually called &quot;3D raster&quot; but other names
  like &quot;RASTER3D&quot;, &quot;voxel&quot;, &quot;volume&quot;,
  &quot;GRID3D&quot; or &quot;3d cell&quot; are yet common. 3D rasters support
  only single- and double-precision floating-point. 3D raster&#x2019;s
  single-precision data type is most often called &quot;float&quot;, and the
  double-precision one &quot;double&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="No-data_management_and_data_portability"><a class="selflink" href="#No-data_management_and_data_portability">No-data

GRASS GIS distinguishes NULL and zero. When working with NULL data, it is
  important to know that operations on NULL cells lead to NULL cells.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The GRASS GIS raster format is architecture independent and portable between
  32bit and 64bit machines.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Raster_compression"><a class="selflink" href="#Raster_compression">Raster
  compression</a></h2>
All GRASS GIS raster map types are by default ZLIB compressed, i.e. using
  ZLIB&#x2019;s deflate algorithm. Through the environment variable
  GRASS_COMPRESSOR the compression method can be set to RLE, ZLIB, LZ4, or
  BZIP2.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Integer (CELL type) raster maps can be compressed with RLE if the environment
  variable GRASS_INT_ZLIB exists and is set to value 0. However, this is not
  recommended.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Floating point (FCELL, DCELL) raster maps never use RLE compression; they are
  either compressed with ZLIB, LZ4, BZIP2 or are uncompressed.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">RLE</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>DEPRECATED</b> Run-Length Encoding, poor compression ratio but fast. It
      is kept for backwards compatibility to read raster maps created with GRASS
      6. It is only used for raster maps of type CELL. FCELL and DCELL maps are
      never and have never been compressed with RLE.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">ZLIB</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    ZLIB&#x2019;s deflate is the default compression method for all raster maps.
      GRASS GIS 7 uses by default 1 as ZLIB compression level which is the best
      compromise between speed and compression ratio, also when compared to
      other available compression methods. Valid levels are in the range [1, 9]
      and can be set with the environment variable GRASS_ZLIB_LEVEL.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">LZ4</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    LZ4 is a very fast compression method, about as fast as no compression.
      Decompression is also very fast. The compression ratio is generally higher
      than for RLE but worse than for ZLIB. LZ4 is recommended if disk space is
      not a limiting factor.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">BZIP2</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    BZIP2 can provide compression ratios much higher than the other methods, but
      only for large raster maps (&gt; 10000 columns). For large raster maps,
      disk space consumption can be reduced by 30 - 50% when using BZIP2 instead
      of ZLIB&#x2019;s deflate. BZIP2 is the slowest compression and
      decompression method. However, if reading from / writing to a storage
      device is the limiting factor, BZIP2 compression can speed up raster map
      processing. Be aware that for smaller raster maps, BZIP2 compression ratio
      can be worse than other compression methods.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the internal cellhd file, the value for &quot;compressed&quot; is 1 for RLE,
  2 for ZLIB, 3 for LZ4, and 4 for BZIP2.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Obviously, decompression is controlled by the raster map&#x2019;s compression,
  not the environment variable.
