<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-update-index - Register file contents in the working
tree to the index</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git update-index <br>
[--add] [--remove | --force-remove] [--replace] <br>
[--refresh] [-q] [--unmerged] [--ignore-missing] <br>
[(--cacheinfo &lt;mode&gt; &lt;object&gt; &lt;file&gt;)...]
<br>
[--chmod=(+|-)x] <br>
[--[no-]assume-unchanged] <br>
[--[no-]skip-worktree] <br>
[--ignore-submodules] <br>
[--really-refresh] [--unresolve] [--again | -g] <br>
[--info-only] [--index-info] <br>
[-z] [--stdin] [--index-version &lt;n&gt;] <br>
[--verbose] <br>
[--] [&lt;file&gt;...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Modifies the index or directory cache. Each file mentioned
is updated into the index and any unmerged or needs updating
state is cleared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also git-add(1) for a more
user-friendly way to do some of the most common operations
on the index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The way git update-index handles
files it is told about can be modified using the various
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--add <br>
If a specified file isn&acirc;t in the index already then
it&acirc;s added. Default behaviour is to ignore new
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remove <br>
If a specified file is in the index but is missing then
it&acirc;s removed. Default behavior is to ignore removed
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--refresh <br>
Looks at the current index and checks to see if merges or
updates are needed by checking stat() information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q <br>
Quiet. If --refresh finds that the index needs an update,
the default behavior is to error out. This option makes git
update-index continue anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-submodules <br>
Do not try to update submodules. This option is only
respected when passed before --refresh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unmerged <br>
If --refresh finds unmerged changes in the index, the
default behavior is to error out. This option makes git
update-index continue anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-missing <br>
Ignores missing files during a --refresh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cacheinfo &lt;mode&gt;
&lt;object&gt; &lt;path&gt; <br>
Directly insert the specified info into the index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--index-info <br>
Read index information from stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--chmod=(+|-)x <br>
Set the execute permissions on the updated files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no-]assume-unchanged <br>
When these flags are specified, the object names recorded
for the paths are not updated. Instead, these options set
and unset the &quot;assume unchanged&quot; bit for the
paths. When <br>
the &quot;assume unchanged&quot; bit is on, Git stops
checking the working tree files for possible modifications,
so you need to manually unset the bit to tell Git when you
change the <br>
working tree file. This is sometimes helpful when working
with a big project on a filesystem that has very slow
lstat(2) system call (e.g. cifs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be also used as
a coarse file-level mechanism to ignore uncommitted changes
in tracked files (akin to what .gitignore does for untracked
files). Git will fail <br>
(gracefully) in case it needs to modify this file in the
index e.g. when merging in a commit; thus, in case the
assumed-untracked file is changed upstream, you will need to
<br>
handle the situation manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--really-refresh <br>
Like --refresh, but checks stat information unconditionally,
without regard to the &quot;assume unchanged&quot;
setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no-]skip-worktree <br>
When one of these flags is specified, the object name
recorded for the paths are not updated. Instead, these
options set and unset the &quot;skip-worktree&quot; bit for
the paths. See <br>
section &quot;Skip-worktree bit&quot; below for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --again <br>
Runs git update-index itself on the paths whose index
entries are different from those from the HEAD commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unresolve <br>
Restores the unmerged or needs updating state of a file
during a merge if it was cleared by accident.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--info-only <br>
Do not create objects in the object database for all
&lt;file&gt; arguments that follow this flag; just insert
their object IDs into the index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force-remove <br>
Remove the file from the index even when the working
directory still has such a file. (Implies --remove.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--replace <br>
By default, when a file path exists in the index, git
update-index refuses an attempt to add path/file. Similarly
if a file path/file exists, a file path cannot be added.
<br>
With --replace flag, existing entries that conflict with the
entry being added are automatically removed with warning
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stdin <br>
Instead of taking list of paths from the command line, read
list of paths from the standard input. Paths are separated
by LF (i.e. one path per line) by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose <br>
Report what is being added and removed from index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--index-version &lt;n&gt; <br>
Write the resulting index out in the named on-disk format
version. Supported versions are 2, 3 and 4. The current
default version is 2 or 3, depending on whether extra <br>
features are used, such as git add -N.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 4 performs a simple
pathname compression that reduces index size by 30%-50% on
large repositories, which results in faster load time.
Version 4 is relatively young <br>
(first released in in 1.8.0 in October 2012). Other Git
implementations such as JGit and libgit2 may not support it
yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z <br>
Only meaningful with --stdin or --index-info; paths are
separated with NUL character instead of LF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- <br>
Do not interpret any more arguments as options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;file&gt; <br>
Files to act on. Note that files beginning with . are
discarded. This includes ./file and dir/./file. If you
don&acirc;t want this, then use cleaner names. The same
applies to <br>
directories ending / and paths with //</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING --REFRESH <br>
--refresh does not calculate a new sha1 file or bring the
index up-to-date for mode/content changes. But what it does
do is to &quot;re-match&quot; the stat information of a file
with the <br>
index, so that you can refresh the index for a file that
hasn&acirc;t been changed but where the stat entry is out of
date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, you&acirc;d want to
do this after doing a git read-tree, to link up the stat
index details with the proper files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING --CACHEINFO OR --INFO-ONLY
<br>
--cacheinfo is used to register a file that is not in the
current working directory. This is useful for
minimum-checkout merging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To pretend you have a file with
mode and sha1 at path, say:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git update-index --cacheinfo
mode sha1 path</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--info-only is used to register
files without placing them in the object database. This is
useful for status-only repositories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both --cacheinfo and --info-only
behave similarly: the index is updated but the object
database isn&acirc;t. --cacheinfo is useful when the object
is in the database but the file isn&acirc;t <br>
available locally. --info-only is useful when the file is
available, but you do not wish to update the object
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING --INDEX-INFO <br>
--index-info is a more powerful mechanism that lets you feed
multiple entry definitions from the standard input, and
designed specifically for scripts. It can take inputs of
<br>
three formats:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. mode SP sha1 TAB path</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first format is what
&quot;git-apply --index-info&quot; reports, and used to
reconstruct a partial tree that is used for phony merge base
tree when falling back on 3-way merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. mode SP type SP sha1 TAB
path</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second format is to stuff
git ls-tree output into the index file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. mode SP sha1 SP stage TAB
path</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This format is to put higher
order stages into the index file and matches git ls-files
--stage output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To place a higher stage entry to
the index, the path should first be removed by feeding a
mode=0 entry for the path, and then feeding necessary input
lines in the third format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, starting with this
index:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git ls-files -s <br>
100644 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 0 frotz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">you can feed the following input
to --index-info:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git update-index --index-info
<br>
0 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 frotz <br>
100644 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 1 frotz <br>
100755 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 2 frotz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first line of the input
feeds 0 as the mode to remove the path; the SHA-1 does not
matter as long as it is well formatted. Then the second and
third line feeds stage 1 and <br>
stage 2 entries for that path. After the above, we would end
up with this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git ls-files -s <br>
100644 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 1 frotz <br>
100755 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 2 frotz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING &acirc;ASSUME
UNCHANGED&acirc; BIT <br>
Many operations in Git depend on your filesystem to have an
efficient lstat(2) implementation, so that st_mtime
information for working tree files can be cheaply checked to
see <br>
if the file contents have changed from the version recorded
in the index file. Unfortunately, some filesystems have
inefficient lstat(2). If your filesystem is one of them, you
<br>
can set &quot;assume unchanged&quot; bit to paths you have
not changed to cause Git not to do this check. Note that
setting this bit on a path does not mean Git will check the
contents of <br>
the file to see if it has changed &acirc; it makes Git to
omit any checking and assume it has not changed. When you
make changes to working tree files, you have to explicitly
tell Git <br>
about it by dropping &quot;assume unchanged&quot; bit,
either before or after you modify them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to set &quot;assume
unchanged&quot; bit, use --assume-unchanged option. To
unset, use --no-assume-unchanged. To see which files have
the &quot;assume unchanged&quot; bit set, use git <br>
ls-files -v (see git-ls-files(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command looks at
core.ignorestat configuration variable. When this is true,
paths updated with git update-index paths... and paths
updated with other Git commands that update <br>
both index and working tree (e.g. git apply --index, git
checkout-index -u, and git read-tree -u) are automatically
marked as &quot;assume unchanged&quot;. Note that
&quot;assume unchanged&quot; bit <br>
is not set if git update-index --refresh finds the working
tree file matches the index (use git update-index
--really-refresh if you want to mark them as &quot;assume
unchanged&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To update and refresh only the files already checked
out:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout-index -n -f -a
&amp;&amp; git update-index --ignore-missing --refresh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On an inefficient filesystem
with core.ignorestat set</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git update-index
--really-refresh (1) <br>
$ git update-index --no-assume-unchanged foo.c (2) <br>
$ git diff --name-only (3) <br>
$ edit foo.c <br>
$ git diff --name-only (4) <br>
M foo.c <br>
$ git update-index foo.c (5) <br>
$ git diff --name-only (6) <br>
$ edit foo.c <br>
$ git diff --name-only (7) <br>
$ git update-index --no-assume-unchanged foo.c (8) <br>
$ git diff --name-only (9) <br>
M foo.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. forces lstat(2) to set
&quot;assume unchanged&quot; bits for paths that match
index. <br>
2. mark the path to be edited. <br>
3. this does lstat(2) and finds index matches the path. <br>
4. this does lstat(2) and finds index does not match the
path. <br>
5. registering the new version to index sets &quot;assume
unchanged&quot; bit. <br>
6. and it is assumed unchanged. <br>
7. even after you edit it. <br>
8. you can tell about the change after the fact. <br>
9. now it checks with lstat(2) and finds it has been
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SKIP-WORKTREE BIT <br>
Skip-worktree bit can be defined in one (long) sentence:
When reading an entry, if it is marked as skip-worktree,
then Git pretends its working directory version is up to
date <br>
and read the index version instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To elaborate,
&quot;reading&quot; means checking for file existence,
reading file attributes or file content. The working
directory version may be present or absent. If present, its
<br>
content may match against the index version or not. Writing
is not affected by this bit, content safety is still first
priority. Note that Git can update working directory file,
<br>
that is marked skip-worktree, if it is safe to do so (i.e.
working directory version matches index version)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although this bit looks similar
to assume-unchanged bit, its goal is different from
assume-unchanged bit&acirc;s. Skip-worktree also takes
precedence over assume-unchanged bit when <br>
both are set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
The command honors core.filemode configuration variable. If
your repository is on a filesystem whose executable bits are
unreliable, this should be set to false (see git- <br>
config(1)). This causes the command to ignore differences in
file modes recorded in the index and the file mode on the
filesystem if they differ only on executable bit. On such
<br>
an unfortunate filesystem, you may need to use git
update-index --chmod=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quite similarly, if
core.symlinks configuration variable is set to false (see
git-config(1)), symbolic links are checked out as plain
files, and this command does not modify a <br>
recorded file mode from symbolic link to regular file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command looks at
core.ignorestat configuration variable. See Using
&quot;assume unchanged&quot; bit section above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command also looks at
core.trustctime configuration variable. It can be useful
when the inode change time is regularly modified by
something outside Git (file system crawlers <br>
and backup systems use ctime for marking files processed)
(see git-config(1)).</p>
