<p>POSTER(1) General Commands Manual POSTER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
poster - Scale and tile a postscript image to print on
multiple pages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
poster &lt;options&gt; infile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Poster can be used to create a large poster by building it
from multiple pages and/or printing it on large media. It
expects as input a generic (encapsulated) postscript file,
<br>
normally printing on a single page. The output is again a
postscript file, maybe containing multiple pages together
building the poster. The output pages bear cutmarks and have
<br>
slightly overlapping images for easier assembling. The input
picture will be scaled to obtain the desired size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program uses a brute-force
method: it copies the entire input file for each output
page, hence the output file can be very large. Since the
program does not really bother <br>
about the input file contents, it clearly works for both
black-and-white and color postscript.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To control its operation, you
need to specify either the size of the desired poster or a
scale factor for the image:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Given the poster size, it
calculates the required number of sheets to print on, and
from that a scale factor to fill these sheets optimally with
the input image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Given a scale factor, it
derives the required number of pages from the input image
size, and positions the scaled image centered on this
area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Its input file should best be a
real &lsquo;Encapsulated Postscript&rsquo; file (often
denoted with the extension .eps or .epsf). Such files can be
generated from about all current drawing <br>
applications, and text processors like Word, Interleaf and
Framemaker. <br>
However poster tries to behave properly also on more
relaxed, general postscript files containing a single page
definition. Proper operation is obtained for instance on
pages <br>
generated by (La)TeX and (g)troff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The media to print on can be
selected independently from the input image size and/or the
poster size. Poster will determine by itself whether it is
beneficial to rotate the out&acirc; <br>
put image on the media.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To preview the output results of
poster and/or to (re-)print individual output pages, you
should use a postscript previewer like ghostview(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v Be verbose. Tell about scaling, rotation and number of
pages. <br>
Default is silent operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Ask manual media feed on the
plotting/printing device, instead of using its standard
paper tray. <br>
Default is adhering to the device settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i &lt;box&gt; <br>
Specify the size of the input image. <br>
Default is reading the image size from the
&lsquo;%%BoundingBox&rsquo; specification in the input file
header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m &lt;box&gt; <br>
Specify the desired media size to print on. See below for
&lt;box&gt;. <br>
The default is set at compile time, being A4 in the standard
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p &lt;box&gt; <br>
Specify the poster size. See below for &lt;box&gt;. Since
poster will autonomously choose for rotation, always specify
a &lsquo;portrait&rsquo; poster size (i.e. higher then
wide). <br>
If you give neither the -s nor the -p option, the default
poster size is identical to the media size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s &lt;number&gt; <br>
Specify a linear scaling factor to produce the poster.
Together with the input image size and optional margins,
this induces an output poster size. So don&rsquo;t specify
both -s <br>
and -p. <br>
Default is deriving the scale factor to fit a given poster
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c &lt;box&gt; or -c
&lt;number&gt;% <br>
Specify the cut margin. This is the distance between the
cutmarks and the paper edge. If the output is really tiled
on multiple sheets, the cut marks indicate where to cut the
<br>
paper for assembly. This margin must be big enough to cover
the non-printable margin which almost all printers have. For
&lt;box&gt; see below. <br>
Default is 5%. Only when you specify identical poster and
media sizes, the default cut margin becomes 0, effectively
removing the cutmarks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w &lt;box&gt; or -w
&lt;number&gt;% <br>
Specify a white margin around the output image. <br>
In the &lsquo;ideal&rsquo; situation (when an input
&lsquo;eps&rsquo; file specifies an exact BoundingBox in its
header), the output image will be scaled exactly to the
edges of the resulting poster <br>
(minus cut margin). If you desire a certain margin to remain
around the picture after poster assembly, you can specify
this with &lsquo;-w&rsquo;. <br>
(This option is actually redundant, since you can obtain the
same result using -s or -i. However some might find this
more convenient.) <br>
Default is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C &lt;number&gt; <br>
Select the clipping facilities you want to see on the page
margin. <br>
Clipping facilities are the cut marks, consisting of cut
mark line, cut mark arrow head and the grid labels. <br>
The following bits in the argument represent one of the
clipping facilities: <br>
bit 1 (value = 1): cutmark lines <br>
bit 2 (value = 2): cutmark arrow heads <br>
bit 3 (value = 4): grid label <br>
Default is printing all clipping facilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O &lt;number&gt; <br>
Specify how many Postscript dots the content of the output
pages shall overlap. <br>
Overlapping content makes it easier to glue together pages
seamlessly, but it consumes printing space. <br>
Default is 6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P &lt;pagespec&gt; <br>
Specify which pages of the poster to print. It consists of a
comma-separated list of single pages or page ranges (using
the dash). The order in which page number appears <br>
determines the final page order in the result PostScript
file. Page numbering starts at 1, from left to right and
bottom-up. <br>
Examples: 1-2 or 1,3-4,7</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o &lt;outputfile&gt; <br>
Specify the name of the file to write the output into. <br>
(Only added for those poor people who cannot specify output
redirection from their command line due to a silly OS.) <br>
Default is writing to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;box&gt; mentioned above
is a specification of horizontal and vertical size. Only in
combination with the &lsquo;-i&rsquo; option, the program
also understands the offset specification in <br>
the &lt;box&gt;. <br>
In general: <br>
&lt;box&gt; =
[&lt;multiplier&gt;][&lt;offset&gt;]&lt;unit&gt; <br>
with multipier and offset being specified optionally. <br>
&lt;multiplier&gt; = &lt;number&gt;x&lt;number&gt; <br>
&lt;offset&gt; = +&lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt; <br>
&lt;unit&gt; = &lt;medianame&gt; or &lt;distancename&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many international media names
are recognised by the program, in upper and lower case, and
can be shortened to their first few characters, as long as
unique. For instance &lsquo;A0&rsquo;, <br>
&lsquo;Let&rsquo;. <br>
Distance names are like &lsquo;cm&rsquo;, &lsquo;i&rsquo;,
&lsquo;ft&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following command prints an A4 input file on 8 A3 pages,
forming an A0 poster: <br>
poster -v -iA4 -mA3 -pA0 infile &gt; outfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next command prints an eps
input image on a poster of 3x3 Letter pages: <br>
poster -v -mLet -p3x3Let image.eps &gt; outfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next command enlarges an eps
input image to print on a large-media A0 capable device,
maintaining 2 inch margins: <br>
poster -v -mA0 -w2x2i image.eps &gt; outfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enlarge a postscript image
exactly 4 times, print on the default A4 media, and let
poster determine the number of pages required: <br>
poster -v -s4 image.eps &gt; outfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scale a postscript image to a
poster of about 1 square meter, printing on
&lsquo;Legal&rsquo; media, maintaining a 10% of
&lsquo;Legal&rsquo; size as white margin around the poster.
Print cutmark lines <br>
and grid labels, but don&rsquo;t print cut mark arrow heads.
<br>
poster -v -mLegal -p1x1m -w10% -C5 infile.ps &gt;
outfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROBLEMS &amp; QUESTIONS <br>
I get a blurry image and/or interference patterns <br>
If your input file contains -or consists of- pixel images
(as opposed to just vector data which is essentially
resolution independent), you might have this problem. Such
pixel <br>
images are normally made to fit well to standard 300 (or
600) dpi devices. Scaling such a picture with an uncarefully
chosen factor, can easily lead to hazy edges and
interfer&acirc; <br>
ence patterns on the output. The solution is to provide
poster with an exact scaling factor (with the -s option),
chosen as an integer. If integer scaling is unpractical for
<br>
your purpose, choose a fractional number made from a small
integer denominator (2, 3, 4).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can I select only a small part
of a given input picture? <br>
Yes, for this purpose you can define both the size (width
and height) and offset (from left and bottom) of a window on
the input image. Specify these numbers as argument to a <br>
&lsquo;-i&rsquo; command line option. <br>
One way to obtain such numbers is previewing the original
image with ghostview, and observing the coordinate numbers
which it continually displays. These numbers are in
post&acirc; <br>
script units (points), named by poster as just
&lsquo;p&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Poster doesn&rsquo;t seem to
work properly, output pages are empty <br>
The major cause for poster not to work correctly, is giving
it postscript files which don&rsquo;t conform to proper
&rsquo;eps&rsquo; behaviour. Try whether your application
(or printer driver) <br>
cannot generate real &rsquo;encapsulated
postscript&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If I ask for a 50x50cm poster,
it always generates something bigger <br>
Yes, probably. When specifying a desired output size with
the &lsquo;-p&rsquo; option, poster first determines an
array of sheets to cover such an area. Then it determines a
scale factor <br>
for the picture to fill these sheets upto their edge. As
result your requested size is used as rough guess only. If
you want an exact output size, specify the scaling factor
<br>
yourself with the &lsquo;-s&rsquo; option (and omit the
&lsquo;-p&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I want to keep the white space
around the poster as in my original <br>
Poster will as default use the input image bounding box, and
scale/translate that to the edges of your poster. If the
program which generated your input file specifies an exact
<br>
and tight %%BoundingBox, you will indeed loose your white
margin. To keep the original margin, specify a
&lsquo;-i&rsquo; option with as argument the papersize on
which the original docu&acirc; <br>
ment was formatted (such as &lsquo;-iA4&rsquo;).
Alternatively specify a smaller scale factor (with -s) or an
explicit new margin (with -w).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSTER ASSEMBLY <br>
Our preferred method for the assembly of a poster from
multiple sheets is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Arrange the sheets in the
proper order on a large table or on the floor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Remove from all sheets, except
from those in the leftmost column or bottom row, their left
and bottom cutmargin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- In left-to-right and
bottom-to-top order, glue the right (and top) cutmargin and
stick the right (and upper) neighbouring page on top of
that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Turn the glued-together poster
face bottom, and put adhesive tape on the sheet edges (on
the backside of the poster) for more strength.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Remove the remaining cutmargin
around the poster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVICE SETTINGS <br>
For postscript level-2 capable printers/plotters, which is
about all modern postscript devices today, poster will send
device settings in its output file. This consists of a <br>
&lsquo;setpagedevice&rsquo; call, setting:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the media size. <br>
This is required for all printers I know to get correct
behaviour on different media/picture sizes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- duplexing off. <br>
Some printers will otherwise perform double-side printing by
default. Clearly that is not what you want to print a
poster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- manual media feed. <br>
This is given only when poster was executed with the
&lsquo;-f&rsquo; command line option. This is a convenient
feature if you want to print your job on different media
than normally <br>
installed in the paper tray, and you are submitting your job
through a multi-user networking and spooling
environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These settings cause proper
device behaviour, without the need to manually interact with
the printer settings, and has been here locally tested to
work on devices like the <br>
HP300XL and HP650C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The settings thus passed in the
postscript file, will affect the device for this job
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DSC CONFORMANCE <br>
Poster will generate its own DSC header and other DSC lines
in the output file, according the &lsquo;Document
Structuring Conventions - version 3.0&rsquo;, as written
down in the &lsquo;Postscript <br>
Language Reference Manual, 2nd ed.&rsquo; from Adobe Systems
Inc, Addison Wesley Publ comp., 1990.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It will copy any
&lsquo;%%Document...&rsquo; line from the input file DSC
header to its own header output. This is used here in
particular for required nonresident fonts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However the copy(s) of the input
file included in the output, are stripped from all lines
starting with a &lsquo;%&rsquo;, since they tend to disturb
our &lsquo;ghostview&rsquo; previewer and take use&acirc;
<br>
less space anyhow.</p>
