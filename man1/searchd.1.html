<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
searchd [--config CONFIGFILE] [--cpustats] [--iostats]
[--index INDEX] [--port PORT]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">searchd --status [--config

<p style="margin-top: 1em">searchd --stop [--config
CONFIGFILE] [--pidfile PIDFILE]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Sphinx is a collection of programs that aim to provide high
quality fulltext search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Searchd is the second of the two
principle tools as part of Sphinx. searchd is the part of
the system which actually handles searches; it functions as
a server and is <br>
responsible for receiving queries, processing them and
returning a dataset back to the different APIs for client
applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike indexer, searchd is not
designed to be run either from a regular script or
command-line calling, but instead either as a daemon to be
called from init.d (on Unix/Linux <br>
type systems) or to be called as a service (on Windows-type
systems). so not all of the command line options will always
apply, and so will be build-dependent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax,
with long options starting with two dashes
(&lsquo;-&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options available to searchd
on all builds are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--configCONFIGFILE, -cCONFIGFILE
<br>
Tell searchd to use the given file as its configuration,
just as with indexer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--console <br>
Force searchd into console mode; typically it will be
running as a conventional server application, and will aim
to dump information into the log files (as specified in <br>
sphinx.conf). Sometimes though, when debugging issues in the
configuration or the daemon itself, or trying to diagnose
hard-to-track-down problems, it may be easier to force <br>
it to dump information directly to the console/command line
from which it is being called. Running in console mode also
means that the process will not be forked (so searches <br>
are done in sequence) and logs will not be written to. (It
should be noted that console mode is not the intended method
for running searchd.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can invoke it as such:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ searchd --config
/home/myuser/sphinx.conf --console</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cpustats <br>
Used to provide actual CPU time report (in addition to wall
time) in both query log file (for every given query) and
status report (aggregated). It depends on clock_gettime()
<br>
system call and might therefore be unavailable on certain
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You might start searchd
thus:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ searchd --config
/home/myuser/sphinx.conf --cpustats</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help, -h, --?, -? <br>
List all of the parameters that can be called in your
particular build of searchd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--index INDEX, -i INDEX <br>
Serve only the specified index. Like --port, this is usually
for debugging purposes; more long-term changes would
generally be applied to the configuration file itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usage example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ searchd --index myindex</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--iostats <br>
Used in conjuction with the logging options (the query_log
will need to have been activated in sphinx.conf) to provide
more detailed information on a per-query basis as to <br>
the input/output operations carried out in the course of
that query, with a slight performance hit and of course
bigger logs. Further details are available under the query
<br>
log format section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You might start searchd
thus:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ searchd --config
/home/myuser/sphinx.conf --iostats</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--listen, -l ( address
&quot;:&quot; port | port | path ) [ &quot;:&quot; protocol
] <br>
Works as --port, but allow you to specify not only the port,
but full path, as IP address and port, or Unix-domain socket
path, that searchd will listen on. Otherwords, you <br>
can specify either an IP address (or hostname) and port
number, or just a port number, or Unix socket path. If you
specify port number but not the address, searchd will <br>
listen on all network interfaces. Unix path is identified by
a leading slash. As the last param you can also specify a
protocol handler (listener) to be used for connections <br>
on this socket. Supported protocol values are
&rsquo;sphinx&rsquo; (Sphinx 0.9.x API protocol) and
&rsquo;mysql41&rsquo; (MySQL protocol used since 4.1 upto at
least 5.1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--logdebug, --logdebugv,
--logdebugvv <br>
Enable additional debug output in the daemon log. Should
only be needed rarely, to assist with debugging issues that
could not be easily reproduced on request. --logdebug <br>
causes daemon to fire general debug messages. --logdebugv
and --logdebugvv points to &rsquo;verbose&rsquo; and
&rsquo;very verbose&rsquo; debug info. The last could really
flood your logfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nodetach <br>
Do not &rsquo;daemonize&rsquo;, or, do not detach into
background. Apart debug purposes, this switch is useful when
you manage sphinx with upstart init daemon. In this case
actual <br>
&rsquo;daemonizing&rsquo; will be done by upstart itself,
and also all tasks like starting, stopping, reloading the
config and respawning on crash will be done by the system,
not the <br>
sphinx.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pidfile PIDFILE <br>
Explicitly state a PID file, where the process information
is stored regarding searchd, used for inter-process
communications (for example, indexer will need to know the
PID <br>
to contact searchd for rotating indexes). Normally, searchd
would use a PID if running in regular mode (i.e. not with
--console), but it is possible that you will be running <br>
it in console mode whilst the index is being updated and
rotated, for which a PID file will be needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ searchd --config
/home/myuser/sphinx.conf --pidfile
/home/myuser/sphinx.pid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--replay-flags OPTIONS <br>
Specify a list of extra binary log replay options. The
supported options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
accept-desc-timestamp, ignore descending transaction
timestamps and replay such transactions anyway (the default
behavior is to exit with an error).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ searchd
--replay-flags=accept-desc-timestamp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--port PORT, -p PORT <br>
Specify the port that searchd should listen on, usually for
debugging purposes. This will usually default to 9312, but
sometimes you need to run it on a different port. <br>
Specifying it on the command line will override anything
specified in the configuration file. The valid range is 0 to
65535, but ports numbered 1024 and below usually require
<br>
a privileged account in order to run. Look also the --listen
option, it will give you more possibilities to tune
here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example of usage:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ searchd --port 9313</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--safetrace <br>
Forces searchd to only use system backtrace() call in crash
reports. In certain (rare) scenarios, this might be a
&quot;safer&quot; way to get that report. This is a
debugging option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--status <br>
Query running searchd instance status, using the connection
details from the (optionally) provided configuration file.
It will try to connect to the running instance using <br>
the first configured UNIX socket or TCP port. On success, it
will query for a number of status and performance counter
values and print them. You can use Status() API call to <br>
access the very same counters from your application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ searchd --status <br>
$ searchd --config /home/myuser/sphinx.conf --status</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stop <br>
Asynchronously stop searchd, using the details of the PID
file as specified in the sphinx.conf file, so you may also
need to confirm to searchd which configuration file to <br>
use with the --config option. NB, calling --stop will also
make sure any changes applied to the indexes with
UpdateAttributes() will be applied to the index files
themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ searchd --config
/home/myuser/sphinx.conf --stop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stopwait <br>
Synchronously stop searchd. --stop essentially tells the
running instance to exit (by sending it a SIGTERM) and then
immediately returns. --stopwait will also attempt to <br>
wait until the running searchd instance actually finishes
the shutdown (eg. saves all the pending attribute changes)
and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ searchd --config
/home/myuser/sphinx.conf --stopwait</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possible exit codes are as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 0 on
success;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 1 if connection
to running searchd daemon failed;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 2 if daemon
reported an error during shutdown;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 3 if daemon
crashed during shutdown</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--strip-path <br>
Strip the path names from all the file names referenced from
the index (stopwords, wordforms, exceptions, etc). This is
useful for picking up indexes built on another machine <br>
with possibly different path layouts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
Last but not least, as every other daemon, searchd supports
a number of signals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGTERM <br>
Initiates a clean shutdown. New queries will not be handled;
but queries that are already started will not be forcibly
interrupted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP <br>
Initiates index rotation. Depending on the value of
seamless_rotate setting, new queries might be shortly
stalled; clients will receive temporary errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 <br>
Forces reopen of searchd log and query log files, letting
you implement log file rotation.</p>
