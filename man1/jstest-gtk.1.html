<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
jstest-gtk - joystick testing and configuration tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
jstest-gtk [options]... [device] files...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
jstest-gtk is a simple joystick tester based on Gtk+. It
provides a list of attached joysticks, a way to display
which buttons and axis are pressed, a way to remap axis and
but&acirc; <br>
tons and a way to calibrate your joystick.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even when your joystick is
working mostly fine, you might want to give it a try, as the
calibration lets you get rid of overlarge default deadzones
that many joysticks use and <br>
then is a noticeable problem in some games.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
jstest-gtk is mainly a graphical interface to check that
your joysticks and pads work properly. You can find precise
information on each axis, you can optionally recalibrate it
<br>
and also change the mapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you run the program without
parameters, you will get a window showing all the joystick
devices in your system (there can be more than one). When
you double click on one of <br>
them, you will get a newer window with detailed information
about its axis and buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two buttons in the
detailed window called &quot;Mapping&quot; adn
&quot;Calibration&quot;, that allows you to reconfigurate
the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you run the program with a
device as an argument (for example /dev/input/js0), you will
get the detailed window for that device directly, without
getting the whole list of <br>
joysticks in the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Calibration of the axis consists
in a simple window in which you set the values that go
directly into the operative system configuration, without
doing any changes on them. <br>
They&rsquo;re divided in range and dead zone (or center). In
both of them you have to set a minimum and a maximum. You
also have a checkbox for inverting the axis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Values are changed and applied
in the same instant that you modify them, there&rsquo;s no
need for clicking anywhere or doing anything else for
applying the changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
These program follows the usual GNU command line syntax,
with long options starting with two dashes
(&lsquo;-&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
