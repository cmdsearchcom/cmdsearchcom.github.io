makepp_speedup -- How to make makepp faster
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
So you think makepp is slow? It has gotten noticeably faster, but granted, it's
  still slow, especially if you come from GNU make. This is because it
  conscientiously checks all those things where gmake gives you a headache,
  ignoring lots of dependencies (the &quot;I think I need to gmake clean to get
  rid of a mysterious bug&quot; syndrome). If you suspect some Perl code you
  added to your makefiles might be at fault, take a look at perl_performance.
<div class="Pp"></div>
But there are a few things you can do to squeeze out more speed. Some of the
  things are labeled unsafe, in the sence that you're asking makepp not to check
  or do certain things, which you think are not needed. If these things would
  have been necessary, the build may not be correct. Luckily this problem will
  be temporary, however. It will get corrected as soon as you let makepp do all
  checks.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can combine several of these tips to increase the time gain even more.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Safe_Methods"><a class="selflink" href="#Safe_Methods">Safe
  Methods</a></h2>
<i>Use makeppreplay</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The stand-alone utility makeppreplay, mppr repeats things that makepp has
  already done, without any overhead.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Use a Faster Perl</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Within version 5.8, all are roughly the same, only 5.8.7 is a bit faster. Tuning
  your Perl can also help, like not compiling it for 64 bits, which makepp
  doesn't need. For example ActiveState's build
  (&lt;http://www.activestate.com/activeperl&gt;) of 5.8.7 for Linux is faster
  than the Perl 5.8.7 that comes with SuSE Linux 10.0.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Include as Little as Possible</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each additional file you include is doubly penalizing. On the one hand, the
  compiler must look for and at all those files. You don't notice this so much,
  because it's just a little extra per compiler call. On the other hand makepp
  must look too, to find dependencies and figure out whether they incur a
  rebuild. Then it can seem to stall, while it is digesting a lot of
  dependencies at once.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An absolutely deadly variant is the project master include file, which in turn
  conveniently includes anything you might need. The result is that any header
  file change leads to a full build. Even without a change, makepp must think
  about all those headers again, for every source you compile. Just a tiny
  effort, since this is cached, but thousands of files can make this staggering.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It may be cumbersome to figure out the minimal set of includes, and to cleanup
  those no longer needed, but it really pays off. If anybody knows a tool that
  can identify which files get included unnecessarily, I'd be glad to mention it
  here!
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Build as Little as You Need</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have a default target which makes several programs, then makepp will have
  to check all their dependencies, right down to the smallest header file. But
  maybe you want to test your change with only one of those programs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then you would call makepp with an explicit target. The less modules or headers
  all those programs have in common, the greater the benefit of not letting
  makepp check them all.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Say your top level Makeppfile has this rule:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $(phony all): proggie1 proggie2 $(only_phony_targets */**/all)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then you would call things like
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $ makepp proggie2
    $ makepp proggie1 dir/subdir/proggie27
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Use preferred makefile names</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Makepp looks for makefiles (unless you specify them explicitly on the command
  line or with &quot;load-makefile&quot;) in the order <i>RootMakeppfile</i>,
  <i>RootMakeppfile.mk</i>, <i>Makeppfile</i> and <i>Makeppfile.mk</i>, followed
  by the classical makefile names. (The <i>.mk</i> variants are for purely
  suffix-based systems.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
So, if you use <i>RootMakeppfile</i> at the root of your build tree, and
  <i>Makeppfile</i> everywhere else, the files will be found slightly faster.
  Makepp will also have a slightly smaller memory consumption (caching the fact
  that the other names don't exist), which also means speed through less memory
  management.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Likewise if you have a statement
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    include standard
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
there will first be an attempt to find <i>standard.makepp</i>, so you might as
  well use that name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Have as few rules as you need</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Makepp keeps track not only of existent files, but also of any it learns to
  create. (That's why it offers reliable wildcards like <i>*.o</i>.) The price
  for this power is a lot of management. So, if you tell it how to create a
  <i>.o</i> from a <i>.c</i>, that's fine, because it will happen for most if
  not all candidates.
<div class="Pp"></div>
But if you tell it how to link any suffixless executable from a like named
  <i>.o</i>, that's expensive, because it will probably only happen for a small
  part of them (those that contain a main function), but the basis will get laid
  for all. You have to weigh the comfort of a linker pattern rule, against the
  efficiency of individual linker rules.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you don't use any of them, you should also turn off the builtin rules with:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    makepp_no_builtin = 1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you do use them, but, for the reasons explained above, not the builtin linker
  rules, you should turn those off with:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    makepp_no_builtin_linker = 1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Put makepp extensions into a module</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Makepp offers very convenient possibilities of being extended through Perl. But
  if you write some functions, commands or statements in a file and include that
  from dozens of makefiles, you will get dozens of copies of them all in memory.
  And they will be read dozens of times by the makepp parser, which is a bit
  slower than Perl's.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In this situation it is better to put your own functions into a module.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Use Repositories and/or a Build Cache</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have several developers working on the same machine or if you change to
  and fro between sets of build options, this is for you. Repositories allow you
  to offer a central reference where you only need to build what is locally
  different. A build cache simply collects all produced files, and reuses them
  as appropriate, with less planning needed. The latter page also describes the
  differences.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Use Sandboxes</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If your build is so big that makepp is having a hard time digesting all the
  information and if you can find a way of splitting it up into smaller
  independent parts, sandboxes might give you better parallelism than the
  &quot;--jobs&quot; option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Don't log what you do</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Makepp's logging feature is very powerful for tracking down bugs in the build
  system, or for analyzing your dependencies. Whenever you don't do these
  things, you can save quite a bit of formatting and I/O with &quot;--no-log
  --no-scan-log&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Almost_Safe_Methods"><a class="selflink" href="#Almost_Safe_Methods">Almost
  Safe Methods</a></h2>
<i>Get a Headstart</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The option &quot;--loop&quot; (or &quot;--stop-before-building&quot; or
  &quot;--stop-after-loading&quot; or &quot;--stop&quot;) allows makepp to start
  its work while you are still editing. It will repeatedly suspend itself when
  it gets to the point analyzing the dependencies. You decide when you're ready
  to let it go on. On our huge project this saves half a minute, and that's only
  when we have a CPU to ourselves.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This method has two potential drawbacks:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Makeppfiles have been read by the time makepp stops. If you
      edit a Makeppfile or something from which it would have to be rebuilt,
      after starting makepp, this will go unnoticed till the next time. But this
      should rarely be necessary, since makepp greatly reduces the need for
      Makeppfile changes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If a target depends on a wildcard, and that would match
      more than when the Makeppfile was read, makepp will not notice:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    proggie: *.o
        $(LD) $(inputs) -o $(output)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you add another source file, or a file from which makepp knows how to
      generate a source, then &quot;*.o&quot; should match the object that
      produces. But, if this file was added after starting makepp, it will not,
      because the wildcard was expanded too early.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In both of these cases you should kill the prestarted makepp and start it anew.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Gulliver's Travels</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The option &quot;--gullible&quot; tells makepp to believe that a rule changes
  what it says it will, neither less nor more. Not performing these checks can
  save a few percent of makepp's CPU time. And the Disk I/O savings is
  especially welcome on network file systems. If you do nightly full builds in
  an empty directory with the &quot;--repository&quot; option, but without the
  &quot;--gullible&quot; option, you can be fairly sure that your rule set is
  consistent. Then this option shouldn't hurt in your daytime work.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Potentially_Unsafe_Methods"><a class="selflink" href="#Potentially_Unsafe_Methods">Potentially
  Unsafe Methods</a></h2>
These methods are unsafe if you give makepp the wrong hints. But everything will
  again be fine, however, as soon as you let makepp do all the checks, by not
  passing it any limiting options. For this reason I suggest using these hints
  to get quick intermediate builds, and use lunchtime and nights to let makepp
  do its job thoroughly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Build as Little as Needed</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is the same tip of using explicit targets discussed under &quot;Build as
  Little as You Need&quot; above. But it becomes more dangerous, if you do it
  because you are sure that your change will not affect any of the other
  programs. Then they will not be built, even though it might have been
  necessary.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Know Where Not to Build</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The option &quot;--dont-build&quot; is very powerful for speeding makepp up a
  lot. If you know one or more directories, which you are sure are unaffected by
  any change you made since the last time, you can issue
  &quot;--dont-build&quot; options for them. This can save makepp a lot of
  dependency analysis. But it will not build anything in those directories, even
  if it should have.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Know Where to Build</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is the same as &quot;Know where not to build&quot;, but instead of an
  exclusion list, you supply an inclusion list. The trick is that a
  &quot;--do-build&quot; option, with a &quot;--dont-build=/&quot; option or
  under a &quot;RootMakeppfile(.mk)&quot; directory without a
  &quot;--dont-build&quot; option on a higher level directory means: build
  nothing except what I tell you to. This is what users of traditional makes are
  looking for when they want to build just one directory:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $ makepp --do-build=dir/subdir
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or, if you don't have a &quot;RootMakeppfile(.mk)&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $ makepp --dont-build=/ --do-build=dir/subdir
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The difference is that any default target in the top level Makeppfile, i.e. link
  commands are also executed this way. If you don't want that, you must give an
  explicit target, which is automatically also marked for
  &quot;--do-build&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $ makepp --do-build=dir1/subdir dir2/proggie
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Know What to Build</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
An extreme variant is asking makepp not to build anything but what you tell it
  to. This is not so dangerous if you changed <b>no include files</b>, only
  modules, and you know which programs they go into.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Say you have only changed &quot;src/a.cpp&quot; and &quot;src/b.cpp&quot; and
  these are linked directly into one program. Dot is the current directory
  including all subdirectories.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $ makepp --dont-build=. src/a.o src/b.o proggie1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Or equivalently, because a &quot;--do-build&quot; option, without a
  &quot;--dont-build&quot; option on a higher level directory implies
  &quot;--dont-build&quot; for the root of the build tree:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $ makepp --do-build=src/a.o src/b.o proggie1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can do something like the following in your Shell's $ENV file or .profile to
  save typing (csh users replace '=' with ' '):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    alias mppb='makepp --do-build'
    alias mppsb='makepp --stop --do-build'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then the last example becomes:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $ mppb src/a.o src/b.o proggie1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Build on a RAM disk</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Modern computers, especially servers, typically have a high mean time between
  failure. If this is the case for you, and you have lots of RAM to spare, you
  can save the time you wait for I/O. You should edit on a real disk, or
  replicate your edits there quickly. But the build results are reproducible, so
  they can reside in RAM. If you don't want to risk rebuilding, you can always
  replicate to disk after each build or at night. You should not do this during
  the build, as you might catch partially written files, just as if the machine
  had crashed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have a system and/or storage unit with good caching and RAID, the gain
  might not be so big.
