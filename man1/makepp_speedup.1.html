<p>MAKEPP_SPEEDUP(1) Makepp MAKEPP_SPEEDUP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
makepp_speedup -- How to make makepp faster</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
So you think makepp is slow? It has gotten noticeably
faster, but granted, it&rsquo;s still slow, especially if
you come from GNU make. This is because it conscientiously
checks all <br>
those things where gmake gives you a headache, ignoring lots
of dependencies (the &quot;I think I need to gmake clean to
get rid of a mysterious bug&quot; syndrome). If you suspect
some <br>
Perl code you added to your makefiles might be at fault,
take a look at perl_performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But there are a few things you
can do to squeeze out more speed. Some of the things are
labeled unsafe, in the sence that you&rsquo;re asking makepp
not to check or do certain things, <br>
which you think are not needed. If these things would have
been necessary, the build may not be correct. Luckily this
problem will be temporary, however. It will get corrected
<br>
as soon as you let makepp do all checks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can combine several of these
tips to increase the time gain even more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Safe Methods <br>
Use makeppreplay</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The stand-alone utility
makeppreplay, mppr repeats things that makepp has already
done, without any overhead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use a Faster Perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Within version 5.8, all are
roughly the same, only 5.8.7 is a bit faster. Tuning your
Perl can also help, like not compiling it for 64 bits, which
makepp doesn&rsquo;t need. For <br>
example ActiveState&rsquo;s build
(&lt;http://www.activestate.com/activeperl&gt;) of 5.8.7 for
Linux is faster than the Perl 5.8.7 that comes with SuSE
Linux 10.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Include as Little as
Possible</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each additional file you include
is doubly penalizing. On the one hand, the compiler must
look for and at all those files. You don&rsquo;t notice this
so much, because it&rsquo;s just a <br>
little extra per compiler call. On the other hand makepp
must look too, to find dependencies and figure out whether
they incur a rebuild. Then it can seem to stall, while it is
<br>
digesting a lot of dependencies at once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An absolutely deadly variant is
the project master include file, which in turn conveniently
includes anything you might need. The result is that any
header file change leads to <br>
a full build. Even without a change, makepp must think about
all those headers again, for every source you compile. Just
a tiny effort, since this is cached, but thousands of <br>
files can make this staggering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It may be cumbersome to figure
out the minimal set of includes, and to cleanup those no
longer needed, but it really pays off. If anybody knows a
tool that can identify which <br>
files get included unnecessarily, I&rsquo;d be glad to
mention it here!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Build as Little as You Need</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have a default target
which makes several programs, then makepp will have to check
all their dependencies, right down to the smallest header
file. But maybe you want to <br>
test your change with only one of those programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then you would call makepp with
an explicit target. The less modules or headers all those
programs have in common, the greater the benefit of not
letting makepp check them all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Say your top level Makeppfile
has this rule:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(phony all): proggie1 proggie2
$(only_phony_targets */**/all)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then you would call things
like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ makepp proggie2 <br>
$ makepp proggie1 dir/subdir/proggie27</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use preferred makefile names</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makepp looks for makefiles
(unless you specify them explicitly on the command line or
with &quot;load-makefile&quot;) in the order RootMakeppfile,
RootMakeppfile.mk, Makeppfile and <br>
Makeppfile.mk, followed by the classical makefile names.
(The .mk variants are for purely suffix-based systems.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So, if you use RootMakeppfile at
the root of your build tree, and Makeppfile everywhere else,
the files will be found slightly faster. Makepp will also
have a slightly smaller <br>
memory consumption (caching the fact that the other names
don&rsquo;t exist), which also means speed through less
memory management.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Likewise if you have a
statement</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include standard</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">there will first be an attempt
to find standard.makepp, so you might as well use that
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Have as few rules as you
need</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makepp keeps track not only of
existent files, but also of any it learns to create.
(That&rsquo;s why it offers reliable wildcards like *.o.)
The price for this power is a lot of <br>
management. So, if you tell it how to create a .o from a .c,
that&rsquo;s fine, because it will happen for most if not
all candidates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But if you tell it how to link
any suffixless executable from a like named .o, that&rsquo;s
expensive, because it will probably only happen for a small
part of them (those that contain <br>
a main function), but the basis will get laid for all. You
have to weigh the comfort of a linker pattern rule, against
the efficiency of individual linker rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t use any of
them, you should also turn off the builtin rules with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makepp_no_builtin = 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do use them, but, for the
reasons explained above, not the builtin linker rules, you
should turn those off with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makepp_no_builtin_linker = 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Put makepp extensions into a
module</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makepp offers very convenient
possibilities of being extended through Perl. But if you
write some functions, commands or statements in a file and
include that from dozens of <br>
makefiles, you will get dozens of copies of them all in
memory. And they will be read dozens of times by the makepp
parser, which is a bit slower than Perl&rsquo;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this situation it is better
to put your own functions into a module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use Repositories and/or a Build
Cache</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have several developers
working on the same machine or if you change to and fro
between sets of build options, this is for you. Repositories
allow you to offer a central <br>
reference where you only need to build what is locally
different. A build cache simply collects all produced files,
and reuses them as appropriate, with less planning needed.
<br>
The latter page also describes the differences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use Sandboxes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your build is so big that
makepp is having a hard time digesting all the information
and if you can find a way of splitting it up into smaller
independent parts, sandboxes <br>
might give you better parallelism than the
&quot;--jobs&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t log what you do</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makepp&rsquo;s logging feature
is very powerful for tracking down bugs in the build system,
or for analyzing your dependencies. Whenever you don&rsquo;t
do these things, you can save quite <br>
a bit of formatting and I/O with &quot;--no-log
--no-scan-log&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Almost Safe Methods <br>
Get a Headstart</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option &quot;--loop&quot;
(or &quot;--stop-before-building&quot; or
&quot;--stop-after-loading&quot; or &quot;--stop&quot;)
allows makepp to start its work while you are still editing.
It will repeatedly suspend <br>
itself when it gets to the point analyzing the dependencies.
You decide when you&rsquo;re ready to let it go on. On our
huge project this saves half a minute, and that&rsquo;s only
when we <br>
have a CPU to ourselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This method has two potential
drawbacks:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Makeppfiles have
been read by the time makepp stops. If you edit a Makeppfile
or something from which it would have to be rebuilt, after
starting makepp, this will go <br>
unnoticed till the next time. But this should rarely be
necessary, since makepp greatly reduces the need for
Makeppfile changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If a target
depends on a wildcard, and that would match more than when
the Makeppfile was read, makepp will not notice:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">proggie: *.o <br>
$(LD) $(inputs) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you add another source file,
or a file from which makepp knows how to generate a source,
then &quot;*.o&quot; should match the object that produces.
But, if this file was added <br>
after starting makepp, it will not, because the wildcard was
expanded too early.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In both of these cases you
should kill the prestarted makepp and start it anew.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option
&quot;--gullible&quot; tells makepp to believe that a rule
changes what it says it will, neither less nor more. Not
performing these checks can save a few percent of
makepp&rsquo;s <br>
CPU time. And the Disk I/O savings is especially welcome on
network file systems. If you do nightly full builds in an
empty directory with the &quot;--repository&quot; option,
but <br>
without the &quot;--gullible&quot; option, you can be fairly
sure that your rule set is consistent. Then this option
shouldn&rsquo;t hurt in your daytime work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Potentially Unsafe Methods <br>
These methods are unsafe if you give makepp the wrong hints.
But everything will again be fine, however, as soon as you
let makepp do all the checks, by not passing it any <br>
limiting options. For this reason I suggest using these
hints to get quick intermediate builds, and use lunchtime
and nights to let makepp do its job thoroughly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Build as Little as Needed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the same tip of using
explicit targets discussed under &quot;Build as Little as
You Need&quot; above. But it becomes more dangerous, if you
do it because you are sure that your <br>
change will not affect any of the other programs. Then they
will not be built, even though it might have been
necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Know Where Not to Build</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option
&quot;--dont-build&quot; is very powerful for speeding
makepp up a lot. If you know one or more directories, which
you are sure are unaffected by any change you made since the
<br>
last time, you can issue &quot;--dont-build&quot; options
for them. This can save makepp a lot of dependency analysis.
But it will not build anything in those directories, even if
it <br>
should have.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Know Where to Build</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the same as &quot;Know
where not to build&quot;, but instead of an exclusion list,
you supply an inclusion list. The trick is that a
&quot;--do-build&quot; option, with a
&quot;--dont-build=/&quot; <br>
option or under a &quot;RootMakeppfile(.mk)&quot; directory
without a &quot;--dont-build&quot; option on a higher level
directory means: build nothing except what I tell you to.
This is what users <br>
of traditional makes are looking for when they want to build
just one directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ makepp
--do-build=dir/subdir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or, if you don&rsquo;t have a
&quot;RootMakeppfile(.mk)&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ makepp --dont-build=/
--do-build=dir/subdir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The difference is that any
default target in the top level Makeppfile, i.e. link
commands are also executed this way. If you don&rsquo;t want
that, you must give an explicit target, <br>
which is automatically also marked for
&quot;--do-build&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ makepp --do-build=dir1/subdir
dir2/proggie</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Know What to Build</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An extreme variant is asking
makepp not to build anything but what you tell it to. This
is not so dangerous if you changed no include files, only
modules, and you know which <br>
programs they go into.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Say you have only changed
&quot;src/a.cpp&quot; and &quot;src/b.cpp&quot; and these
are linked directly into one program. Dot is the current
directory including all subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ makepp --dont-build=. src/a.o
src/b.o proggie1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or equivalently, because a
&quot;--do-build&quot; option, without a
&quot;--dont-build&quot; option on a higher level directory
implies &quot;--dont-build&quot; for the root of the build
tree:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ makepp --do-build=src/a.o
src/b.o proggie1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can do something like the
following in your Shell&rsquo;s $ENV file or .profile to
save typing (csh users replace &rsquo;=&rsquo; with &rsquo;
&rsquo;):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias mppb=&rsquo;makepp
--do-build&rsquo; <br>
alias mppsb=&rsquo;makepp --stop --do-build&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then the last example
becomes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ mppb src/a.o src/b.o
proggie1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Build on a RAM disk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modern computers, especially
servers, typically have a high mean time between failure. If
this is the case for you, and you have lots of RAM to spare,
you can save the time you <br>
wait for I/O. You should edit on a real disk, or replicate
your edits there quickly. But the build results are
reproducible, so they can reside in RAM. If you don&rsquo;t
want to <br>
risk rebuilding, you can always replicate to disk after each
build or at night. You should not do this during the build,
as you might catch partially written files, just as if <br>
the machine had crashed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have a system and/or
storage unit with good caching and RAID, the gain might not
be so big.</p>
