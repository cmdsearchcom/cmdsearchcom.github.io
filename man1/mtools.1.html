mtools - utilities to access DOS disks in Unix.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Introduction"><a class="selflink" href="#Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
Mtools is a collection of tools to allow Unix systems to manipulate MS-DOS
  files: read, write, and move around files on an MS-DOS file system (typically
  a floppy disk). Where reasonable, each program attempts to emulate the MS-DOS
  equivalent command. However, unnecessary restrictions and oddities of DOS are
  not emulated. For instance, it is possible to move subdirectories from one
  subdirectory to another.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mtools is sufficient to give access to MS-DOS file systems. For instance,
  commands such as mdir a: work on the a: floppy without any preliminary
  mounting or initialization (assuming the default `/etc/mtools.conf' works on
  your machine). With mtools, one can change floppies too without unmounting and
  mounting.

There is an mtools mailing list at mtools @ tux.org . Please send all bug
  reports to this list. You may subscribe to the list by sending a message with
  'subscribe mtools @ tux.org' in its body to majordomo @ tux.org . (N.B. Please
  remove the spaces around the &quot;@&quot; both times. I left them there in
  order to fool spambots.) Announcements of new mtools versions will also be
  sent to the list, in addition to the Linux announce newsgroups. The mailing
  list is archived at http://lists.gnu.org/pipermail/info-mtools/

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Options_and_filenames"><a class="selflink" href="#Options_and_filenames">Options&#x00A0;and&#x00A0;filenames</a></h2>
MS-DOS filenames are composed of a drive letter followed by a colon, a
  subdirectory, and a filename. Only the filename part is mandatory, the drive
  letter and the subdirectory are optional. Filenames without a drive letter
  refer to Unix files. Subdirectory names can use either the '/' or '\'
  separator. The use of the '\' separator or wildcards requires the names to be
  enclosed in quotes to protect them from the shell. However, wildcards in Unix
  filenames should not be enclosed in quotes, because here we <b>want</b> the
  shell to expand them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The regular expression &quot;pattern matching&quot; routines follow the
  Unix-style rules. For example, `*' matches all MS-DOS files in lieu of `*.*'.
  The archive, hidden, read-only and system attribute bits are ignored during
  pattern matching.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All options use the - (minus) as their first character, not / as you'd expect in
  MS-DOS.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most mtools commands allow multiple filename parameters, which doesn't follow
  MS-DOS conventions, but which is more user-friendly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most mtools commands allow options that instruct them how to handle file name
  clashes. See section name clashes, for more details on these. All commands
  accept the -V flags which prints the version, and most accept the -v flag,
  which switches on verbose mode. In verbose mode, these commands print out the
  name of the MS-DOS files upon which they act, unless stated otherwise. See
  section Commands, for a description of the options which are specific to each
  command.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Drive_letters"><a class="selflink" href="#Drive_letters">Drive&#x00A0;letters</a></h2>
The meaning of the drive letters depends on the target architectures. However,
  on most target architectures, drive A is the first floppy drive, drive B is
  the second floppy drive (if available), drive J is a Jaz drive (if available),
  and drive Z is a Zip drive (if available). On those systems where the device
  name is derived from the SCSI id, the Jaz drive is assumed to be at SCSI
  target 4, and the Zip at SCSI target 5 (factory default settings). On Linux,
  both drives are assumed to be the second drive on the SCSI bus (/dev/sdb). The
  default settings can be changes using a configuration file (see section
  Configuration).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The drive letter : (colon) has a special meaning. It is used to access image
  files which are directly specified on the command line using the -i options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
<br/>
 mcopy -i my-image-file.bin ::file1 ::file2 .
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This copies file1 and file2 from the image file (my-image-file.bin) to the /tmp
  directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also supply an offset within the image file by including @@
  <i>offset</i> into the file name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
<br/>
 mcopy -i my-image-file.bin@@1M ::file1 ::file2 .
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This looks for the image at the offset of 1M in the file, rather than at its
  beginning.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Current_working_directory"><a class="selflink" href="#Current_working_directory">Current&#x00A0;working&#x00A0;directory</a></h2>
The mcd command (`mcd') is used to establish the device and the current working
  directory (relative to the MS-DOS file system), otherwise the default is
  assumed to be A:/. However, unlike MS-DOS, there is only one working directory
  for all drives, and not one per drive.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="VFAT-style_long_file_names"><a class="selflink" href="#VFAT-style_long_file_names">VFAT-style&#x00A0;long&#x00A0;file&#x00A0;names</a></h2>
This version of mtools supports VFAT style long filenames. If a Unix filename is
  too long to fit in a short DOS name, it is stored as a VFAT long name, and a
  companion short name is generated. This short name is what you see when you
  examine the disk with a pre-7.0 version of DOS.
<br/>
 The following table shows some examples of short names:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
<br/>
Long name       MS-DOS name     Reason for the change
---------       ----------      ---------------------
thisisatest     THISIS~1        filename too long
alain.knaff     ALAIN~1.KNA     extension too long
prn.txt         PRN~1.TXT       PRN is a device name
.abc            ABC~1           null filename
hot+cold        HOT_CO~1        illegal character
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 As you see, the following transformations happen to derive a short name:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">* &#x00A0;&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Illegal characters are replaced by underscores. The illegal
      characters are ;+=[]',\&quot;*\\&lt;&gt;/?:|.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">* &#x00A0;&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Extra dots, which cannot be interpreted as a main
      name/extension separator are removed</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">* &#x00A0;&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A ~<i>n</i> number is generated,</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">* &#x00A0;&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The name is shortened so as to fit in the 8+3
    limitation</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 The initial Unix-style file name (whether long or short) is also called the
  <i>primary</i> name, and the derived short name is also called the
  <i>secondary</i> name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 Example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
<br/>
 mcopy /etc/motd a:Reallylongname
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
 Mtools creates a VFAT entry for Reallylongname, and uses REALLYLO as a short
  name. Reallylongname is the primary name, and REALLYLO is the secondary name.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
<br/>
 mcopy /etc/motd a:motd
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
 Motd fits into the DOS filename limits. Mtools doesn't need to derivate another
  name. Motd is the primary name, and there is no secondary name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 In a nutshell: The primary name is the long name, if one exists, or the short
  name if there is no long name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 Although VFAT is much more flexible than FAT, there are still names that are
  not acceptable, even in VFAT. There are still some illegal characters left
  (\&quot;*\\&lt;&gt;/?:|), and device names are still reserved.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
<br/>
Unix name       Long name       Reason for the change
---------       ----------      ---------------------
prn             prn-1           PRN is a device name
ab:c            ab_c-1          illegal character
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 As you see, the following transformations happen if a long name is illegal:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">* &#x00A0;&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Illegal characters are replaces by underscores,</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">* &#x00A0;&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A -<i>n</i> number is generated,</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Name_clashes"><a class="selflink" href="#Name_clashes">Name&#x00A0;clashes</a></h2>
When writing a file to disk, its long name or short name may collide with an
  already existing file or directory. This may happen for all commands which
  create new directory entries, such as mcopy, mmd, mren, mmove. When a name
  clash happens, mtools asks you what it should do. It offers several choices:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">overwrite&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Overwrites the existing file. It is not possible to
      overwrite a directory with a file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">rename&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Renames the newly created file. Mtools prompts for the new
      filename</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">autorename&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Renames the newly created file. Mtools chooses a name by
      itself, without prompting</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">skip&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Gives up on this file, and moves on to the next (if
    any)</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To chose one of these actions, type its first letter at the prompt. If you use a
  lower case letter, the action only applies for this file only, if you use an
  upper case letter, the action applies to all files, and you won't be prompted
  again.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may also chose actions (for all files) on the command line, when invoking
  mtools:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-D&#x00A0;o&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Overwrites primary names by default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-D&#x00A0;O&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Overwrites secondary names by default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-D&#x00A0;r&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Renames primary name by default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-D&#x00A0;R&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Renames secondary name by default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-D&#x00A0;a&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Autorenames primary name by default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-D&#x00A0;A&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Autorenames secondary name by default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-D&#x00A0;s&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Skip primary name by default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-D&#x00A0;S&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Skip secondary name by default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-D&#x00A0;m&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Ask user what to do with primary name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-D&#x00A0;M&#x00A0;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Ask user what to do with secondary name.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that for command line switches lower/upper differentiates between
  primary/secondary name whereas for interactive choices, lower/upper
  differentiates between just-this-time/always.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The primary name is the name as displayed in Windows 95 or Windows NT: i.e. the
  long name if it exists, and the short name otherwise. The secondary name is
  the &quot;hidden&quot; name, i.e. the short name if a long name exists.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, the user is prompted if the primary name clashes, and the secondary
  name is autorenamed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a name clash occurs in a Unix directory, mtools only asks whether to
  overwrite the file, or to skip it.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Case_sensitivity_of_the_VFAT_file_system"><a class="selflink" href="#Case_sensitivity_of_the_VFAT_file_system">Case&#x00A0;sensitivity&#x00A0;of&#x00A0;the&#x00A0;VFAT&#x00A0;file&#x00A0;system</a></h2>
The VFAT file system is able to remember the case of the filenames. However,
  filenames which differ only in case are not allowed to coexist in the same
  directory. For example if you store a file called LongFileName on a VFAT file
  system, mdir shows this file as LongFileName, and not as Longfilename.
  However, if you then try to add LongFilename to the same directory, it is
  refused, because case is ignored for clash checks.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The VFAT file system allows to store the case of a filename in the attribute
  byte, if all letters of the filename are the same case, and if all letters of
  the extension are the same case too. Mtools uses this information when
  displaying the files, and also to generate the Unix filename when mcopying to
  a Unix directory. This may have unexpected results when applied to files
  written using an pre-7.0 version of DOS: Indeed, the old style filenames map
  to all upper case. This is different from the behavior of the old version of
  mtools which used to generate lower case Unix filenames.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="high_capacity_formats"><a class="selflink" href="#high_capacity_formats">high&#x00A0;capacity&#x00A0;formats</a></h2>
Mtools supports a number of formats which allow to store more data on disk as
  usual. Due to different operating system abilities, these formats are not
  supported on all operating systems. Mtools recognizes these formats
  transparently where supported.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to format these disks, you need to use an operating system specific
  tool. For Linux, suitable floppy tools can be found in the fdutils package at
  the following locations~:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
<br/>
ftp://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/fdutils/.
ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/disk-management/fdutils-*
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
See the manual pages included in that package for further detail: Use
  superformat to format all formats except XDF, and use xdfcopy to format XDF.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="More_sectors"><a class="selflink" href="#More_sectors">&#x00A0;&#x00A0;More&#x00A0;sectors</a></h2>
The oldest method of fitting more data on a disk is to use more sectors and more
  cylinders. Although the standard format uses 80 cylinders and 18 sectors (on a
  3 1/2 high density disk), it is possible to use up to 83 cylinders (on most
  drives) and up to 21 sectors. This method allows to store up to 1743K on a 3
  1/2 HD disk. However, 21 sector disks are twice as slow as the standard 18
  sector disks because the sectors are packed so close together that we need to
  interleave them. This problem doesn't exist for 20 sector formats.
<div class="Pp"></div>
These formats are supported by numerous DOS shareware utilities such as fdformat
  and vgacopy. In his infinite hubris, Bill Gate$ believed that he invented
  this, and called it `DMF disks', or `Windows formatted disks'. But in reality,
  it has already existed years before! Mtools supports these formats on Linux,
  on SunOS and on the DELL Unix PC.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Bigger_sectors"><a class="selflink" href="#Bigger_sectors">&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Bigger&#x00A0;sectors</a></h2>
By using bigger sectors it is possible to go beyond the capacity which can be
  obtained by the standard 512-byte sectors. This is because of the sector
  header. The sector header has the same size, regardless of how many data bytes
  are in the sector. Thus, we save some space by using <i>fewer</i>, but bigger
  sectors. For example, 1 sector of 4K only takes up header space once, whereas
  8 sectors of 512 bytes have also 8 headers, for the same amount of useful
  data.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This method allows to store up to 1992K on a 3 1/2 HD disk.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mtools supports these formats only on Linux.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="2m"><a class="selflink" href="#2m">&#x00A0;&#x00A0;2m</a></h2>
The 2m format was originally invented by Ciriaco Garcia de Celis. It also uses
  bigger sectors than usual in order to fit more data on the disk. However, it
  uses the standard format (18 sectors of 512 bytes each) on the first cylinder,
  in order to make these disks easier to handle by DOS. Indeed this method
  allows to have a standard sized boot sector, which contains a description of
  how the rest of the disk should be read.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, the drawback of this is that the first cylinder can hold less data than
  the others. Unfortunately, DOS can only handle disks where each track contains
  the same amount of data. Thus 2m hides the fact that the first track contains
  less data by using a <i>shadow</i> <i>FAT</i>. (Usually, DOS stores the FAT in
  two identical copies, for additional safety. XDF stores only one copy, but
  tells DOS that it stores two. Thus the space that would be taken up by the
  second FAT copy is saved.) This also means that you should <b>never use a 2m
  disk</b> <b>to store anything else than a DOS file system</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mtools supports these formats only on Linux.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="XDF"><a class="selflink" href="#XDF">&#x00A0;&#x00A0;XDF</a></h2>
XDF is a high capacity format used by OS/2. It can hold 1840 K per disk. That's
  lower than the best 2m formats, but its main advantage is that it is fast: 600
  milliseconds per track. That's faster than the 21 sector format, and almost as
  fast as the standard 18 sector format. In order to access these disks, make
  sure mtools has been compiled with XDF support, and set the use_xdf variable
  for the drive in the configuration file. See section Compiling mtools, and
  `miscellaneous variables', for details on how to do this. Fast XDF access is
  only available for Linux kernels which are more recent than 1.1.34.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mtools supports this format only on Linux.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Caution / Attention distributors</b>: If mtools is compiled on a Linux kernel
  more recent than 1.3.34, it won't run on an older kernel. However, if it has
  been compiled on an older kernel, it still runs on a newer kernel, except that
  XDF access is slower. It is recommended that distribution authors only include
  mtools binaries compiled on kernels older than 1.3.34 until 2.0 comes out.
  When 2.0 will be out, mtools binaries compiled on newer kernels may (and
  should) be distributed. Mtools binaries compiled on kernels older than 1.3.34
  won't run on any 2.1 kernel or later.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Exit_codes"><a class="selflink" href="#Exit_codes">Exit&#x00A0;codes</a></h2>
All the Mtools commands return 0 on success, 1 on utter failure, or 2 on partial
  failure. All the Mtools commands perform a few sanity checks before going
  ahead, to make sure that the disk is indeed an MS-DOS disk (as opposed to, say
  an ext2 or MINIX disk). These checks may reject partially corrupted disks,
  which might otherwise still be readable. To avoid these checks, set the
  MTOOLS_SKIP_CHECK environmental variable or the corresponding configuration
  file variable (see section global variables)
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Bugs"><a class="selflink" href="#Bugs">Bugs</a></h2>
An unfortunate side effect of not guessing the proper device (when multiple disk
  capacities are supported) is an occasional error message from the device
  driver. These can be safely ignored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The fat checking code chokes on 1.72 Mb disks mformatted with pre-2.0.7 mtools.
  Set the environmental variable MTOOLS_FAT_COMPATIBILITY (or the corresponding
  configuration file variable, `global variables') to bypass the fat checking.
