<p>mtools(1) General Commands Manual mtools(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name <br>
mtools - utilities to access DOS disks in Unix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Introduction <br>
Mtools is a collection of tools to allow Unix systems to
manipulate MS-DOS files: read, write, and move around files
on an MS-DOS file system (typically a floppy disk). Where
<br>
reasonable, each program attempts to emulate the MS-DOS
equivalent command. However, unnecessary restrictions and
oddities of DOS are not emulated. For instance, it is
possible <br>
to move subdirectories from one subdirectory to another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mtools is sufficient to give
access to MS-DOS file systems. For instance, commands such
as mdir a: work on the a: floppy without any preliminary
mounting or initialization <br>
(assuming the default &lsquo;/etc/mtools.conf&rsquo; works
on your machine). With mtools, one can change floppies too
without unmounting and mounting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where to get mtools <br>
Mtools can be found at the following places (and their
mirrors):</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mtools/mtools-4.0.18.tar.gz
<br>
http://mtools.linux.lu/mtools-4.0.18.tar.gz <br>
ftp://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/mtools/mtools-4.0.18.tar.gz <br>

ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/disk-management/mtools-4.0.18.tar.gz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before reporting a bug, make
sure that it has not yet been fixed in the Alpha patches
which can be found at:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mtools/
<br>
http://mtools.linux.lu/ <br>
ftp://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/mtools</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These patches are named
mtools-version-ddmm.taz, where version stands for the base
version, dd for the day and mm for the month. Due to a lack
of space, I usually leave only the <br>
most recent patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is an mtools mailing list
at mtools @ tux.org . Please send all bug reports to this
list. You may subscribe to the list by sending a message
with &rsquo;subscribe mtools @ <br>
tux.org&rsquo; in its body to majordomo @ tux.org . (N.B.
Please remove the spaces around the &quot;@&quot; both
times. I left them there in order to fool spambots.)
Announcements of new mtools <br>
versions will also be sent to the list, in addition to the
Linux announce newsgroups. The mailing list is archived at
http://lists.gnu.org/pipermail/info-mtools/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Common features of all mtools
commands <br>
Options and filenames <br>
MS-DOS filenames are composed of a drive letter followed by
a colon, a subdirectory, and a filename. Only the filename
part is mandatory, the drive letter and the subdirectory
<br>
are optional. Filenames without a drive letter refer to Unix
files. Subdirectory names can use either the &rsquo;/&rsquo;
or &rsquo;&acute; separator. The use of the &rsquo;&acute;
separator or wildcards <br>
requires the names to be enclosed in quotes to protect them
from the shell. However, wildcards in Unix filenames should
not be enclosed in quotes, because here we want the shell
<br>
to expand them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The regular expression
&quot;pattern matching&quot; routines follow the Unix-style
rules. For example, &lsquo;*&rsquo; matches all MS-DOS files
in lieu of &lsquo;*.*&rsquo;. The archive, hidden, read-only
and <br>
system attribute bits are ignored during pattern
matching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options use the - (minus) as
their first character, not / as you&rsquo;d expect in
MS-DOS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most mtools commands allow
multiple filename parameters, which doesn&rsquo;t follow
MS-DOS conventions, but which is more user-friendly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most mtools commands allow
options that instruct them how to handle file name clashes.
See section name clashes, for more details on these. All
commands accept the -V flags which <br>
prints the version, and most accept the -v flag, which
switches on verbose mode. In verbose mode, these commands
print out the name of the MS-DOS files upon which they act,
<br>
unless stated otherwise. See section Commands, for a
description of the options which are specific to each
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Drive letters <br>
The meaning of the drive letters depends on the target
architectures. However, on most target architectures, drive
A is the first floppy drive, drive B is the second floppy
<br>
drive (if available), drive J is a Jaz drive (if available),
and drive Z is a Zip drive (if available). On those systems
where the device name is derived from the SCSI id, the <br>
Jaz drive is assumed to be at SCSI target 4, and the Zip at
SCSI target 5 (factory default settings). On Linux, both
drives are assumed to be the second drive on the SCSI bus
<br>
(/dev/sdb). The default settings can be changes using a
configuration file (see section Configuration).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The drive letter : (colon) has a
special meaning. It is used to access image files which are
directly specified on the command line using the -i
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mcopy -i my-image-file.bin
::file1 ::file2 .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This copies file1 and file2 from
the image file (my-image-file.bin) to the /tmp
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also supply an offset
within the image file by including @@offset into the file
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mcopy -i my-image-file.bin@@1M
::file1 ::file2 .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This looks for the image at the
offset of 1M in the file, rather than at its beginning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Current working directory <br>
The mcd command (&lsquo;mcd&rsquo;) is used to establish the
device and the current working directory (relative to the
MS-DOS file system), otherwise the default is assumed to be
A:/. How&acirc; <br>
ever, unlike MS-DOS, there is only one working directory for
all drives, and not one per drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VFAT-style long file names <br>
This version of mtools supports VFAT style long filenames.
If a Unix filename is too long to fit in a short DOS name,
it is stored as a VFAT long name, and a companion short name
<br>
is generated. This short name is what you see when you
examine the disk with a pre-7.0 version of DOS. <br>
The following table shows some examples of short names:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Long name MS-DOS name Reason for
the change <br>
--------- ---------- --------------------- <br>
thisisatest THISIS~1 filename too long <br>
alain.knaff ALAIN~1.KNA extension too long <br>
prn.txt PRN~1.TXT PRN is a device name <br>
.abc ABC~1 null filename <br>
hot+cold HOT_CO~1 illegal character</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As you see, the following
transformations happen to derive a short name:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Illegal characters are
replaced by underscores. The illegal characters are
;+=[]&rsquo;,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Extra dots, which cannot be
interpreted as a main name/extension separator are
removed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A ~n number is generated,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The name is shortened so as to
fit in the 8+3 limitation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The initial Unix-style file name
(whether long or short) is also called the primary name, and
the derived short name is also called the secondary
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mcopy /etc/motd
a:Reallylongname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mtools creates a VFAT entry for
Reallylongname, and uses REALLYLO as a short name.
Reallylongname is the primary name, and REALLYLO is the
secondary name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mcopy /etc/motd a:motd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Motd fits into the DOS filename
limits. Mtools doesn&rsquo;t need to derivate another name.
Motd is the primary name, and there is no secondary
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a nutshell: The primary name
is the long name, if one exists, or the short name if there
is no long name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although VFAT is much more
flexible than FAT, there are still names that are not
acceptable, even in VFAT. There are still some illegal
characters left ( <br>
names are still reserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unix name Long name Reason for
the change <br>
--------- ---------- --------------------- <br>
prn prn-1 PRN is a device name <br>
ab:c ab_c-1 illegal character</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As you see, the following
transformations happen if a long name is illegal:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Illegal characters are
replaces by underscores,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A -n number is generated,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name clashes <br>
When writing a file to disk, its long name or short name may
collide with an already existing file or directory. This may
happen for all commands which create new directory <br>
entries, such as mcopy, mmd, mren, mmove. When a name clash
happens, mtools asks you what it should do. It offers
several choices:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">overwrite <br>
Overwrites the existing file. It is not possible to
overwrite a directory with a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rename <br>
Renames the newly created file. Mtools prompts for the new
filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autorename <br>
Renames the newly created file. Mtools chooses a name by
itself, without prompting</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skip Gives up on this file, and
moves on to the next (if any)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To chose one of these actions,
type its first letter at the prompt. If you use a lower case
letter, the action only applies for this file only, if you
use an upper case letter, <br>
the action applies to all files, and you won&rsquo;t be
prompted again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may also chose actions (for
all files) on the command line, when invoking mtools:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D o Overwrites primary names by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D O Overwrites secondary names
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D r Renames primary name by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D R Renames secondary name by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D a Autorenames primary name by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D A Autorenames secondary name
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D s Skip primary name by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D S Skip secondary name by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D m Ask user what to do with
primary name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D M Ask user what to do with
secondary name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that for command line
switches lower/upper differentiates between
primary/secondary name whereas for interactive choices,
lower/upper differentiates between just-this- <br>
time/always.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The primary name is the name as
displayed in Windows 95 or Windows NT: i.e. the long name if
it exists, and the short name otherwise. The secondary name
is the &quot;hidden&quot; name, <br>
i.e. the short name if a long name exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the user is prompted
if the primary name clashes, and the secondary name is
autorenamed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a name clash occurs in a Unix
directory, mtools only asks whether to overwrite the file,
or to skip it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Case sensitivity of the VFAT
file system <br>
The VFAT file system is able to remember the case of the
filenames. However, filenames which differ only in case are
not allowed to coexist in the same directory. For example if
<br>
you store a file called LongFileName on a VFAT file system,
mdir shows this file as LongFileName, and not as
Longfilename. However, if you then try to add LongFilename
to the <br>
same directory, it is refused, because case is ignored for
clash checks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The VFAT file system allows to
store the case of a filename in the attribute byte, if all
letters of the filename are the same case, and if all
letters of the extension are the <br>
same case too. Mtools uses this information when displaying
the files, and also to generate the Unix filename when
mcopying to a Unix directory. This may have unexpected
results <br>
when applied to files written using an pre-7.0 version of
DOS: Indeed, the old style filenames map to all upper case.
This is different from the behavior of the old version of
<br>
mtools which used to generate lower case Unix filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">high capacity formats <br>
Mtools supports a number of formats which allow to store
more data on disk as usual. Due to different operating
system abilities, these formats are not supported on all
operating <br>
systems. Mtools recognizes these formats transparently where
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to format these disks,
you need to use an operating system specific tool. For
Linux, suitable floppy tools can be found in the fdutils
package at the following loca&acirc; <br>
tions~:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/fdutils/.
<br>

ftp://ibiblio.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/disk-management/fdutils-*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the manual pages included in
that package for further detail: Use superformat to format
all formats except XDF, and use xdfcopy to format XDF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More sectors <br>
The oldest method of fitting more data on a disk is to use
more sectors and more cylinders. Although the standard
format uses 80 cylinders and 18 sectors (on a 3 1/2 high
density <br>
disk), it is possible to use up to 83 cylinders (on most
drives) and up to 21 sectors. This method allows to store up
to 1743K on a 3 1/2 HD disk. However, 21 sector disks are
<br>
twice as slow as the standard 18 sector disks because the
sectors are packed so close together that we need to
interleave them. This problem doesn&rsquo;t exist for 20
sector formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These formats are supported by
numerous DOS shareware utilities such as fdformat and
vgacopy. In his infinite hubris, Bill Gate$ believed that he
invented this, and called it <br>
&lsquo;DMF disks&rsquo;, or &lsquo;Windows formatted
disks&rsquo;. But in reality, it has already existed years
before! Mtools supports these formats on Linux, on SunOS and
on the DELL Unix PC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bigger sectors <br>
By using bigger sectors it is possible to go beyond the
capacity which can be obtained by the standard 512-byte
sectors. This is because of the sector header. The sector
header <br>
has the same size, regardless of how many data bytes are in
the sector. Thus, we save some space by using fewer, but
bigger sectors. For example, 1 sector of 4K only takes up
<br>
header space once, whereas 8 sectors of 512 bytes have also
8 headers, for the same amount of useful data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This method allows to store up
to 1992K on a 3 1/2 HD disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mtools supports these formats
only on Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2m <br>
The 2m format was originally invented by Ciriaco Garcia de
Celis. It also uses bigger sectors than usual in order to
fit more data on the disk. However, it uses the standard
<br>
format (18 sectors of 512 bytes each) on the first cylinder,
in order to make these disks easier to handle by DOS. Indeed
this method allows to have a standard sized boot sector,
<br>
which contains a description of how the rest of the disk
should be read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, the drawback of this is
that the first cylinder can hold less data than the others.
Unfortunately, DOS can only handle disks where each track
contains the same amount of <br>
data. Thus 2m hides the fact that the first track contains
less data by using a shadow FAT. (Usually, DOS stores the
FAT in two identical copies, for additional safety. XDF <br>
stores only one copy, but tells DOS that it stores two. Thus
the space that would be taken up by the second FAT copy is
saved.) This also means that you should never use a 2m <br>
disk to store anything else than a DOS file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mtools supports these formats
only on Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XDF <br>
XDF is a high capacity format used by OS/2. It can hold 1840
K per disk. That&rsquo;s lower than the best 2m formats, but
its main advantage is that it is fast: 600 milliseconds per
<br>
track. That&rsquo;s faster than the 21 sector format, and
almost as fast as the standard 18 sector format. In order to
access these disks, make sure mtools has been compiled with
XDF <br>
support, and set the use_xdf variable for the drive in the
configuration file. See section Compiling mtools, and
&lsquo;miscellaneous variables&rsquo;, for details on how to
do this. Fast <br>
XDF access is only available for Linux kernels which are
more recent than 1.1.34.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mtools supports this format only
on Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution / Attention
distributors: If mtools is compiled on a Linux kernel more
recent than 1.3.34, it won&rsquo;t run on an older kernel.
However, if it has been compiled on an older <br>
kernel, it still runs on a newer kernel, except that XDF
access is slower. It is recommended that distribution
authors only include mtools binaries compiled on kernels
older than <br>
1.3.34 until 2.0 comes out. When 2.0 will be out, mtools
binaries compiled on newer kernels may (and should) be
distributed. Mtools binaries compiled on kernels older than
1.3.34 <br>
won&rsquo;t run on any 2.1 kernel or later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exit codes <br>
All the Mtools commands return 0 on success, 1 on utter
failure, or 2 on partial failure. All the Mtools commands
perform a few sanity checks before going ahead, to make sure
<br>
that the disk is indeed an MS-DOS disk (as opposed to, say
an ext2 or MINIX disk). These checks may reject partially
corrupted disks, which might otherwise still be readable. To
<br>
avoid these checks, set the MTOOLS_SKIP_CHECK environmental
variable or the corresponding configuration file variable
(see section global variables)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bugs <br>
An unfortunate side effect of not guessing the proper device
(when multiple disk capacities are supported) is an
occasional error message from the device driver. These can
be <br>
safely ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fat checking code chokes on
1.72 Mb disks mformatted with pre-2.0.7 mtools. Set the
environmental variable MTOOLS_FAT_COMPATIBILITY (or the
corresponding configuration file <br>
variable, &lsquo;global variables&rsquo;) to bypass the fat
checking.</p>
