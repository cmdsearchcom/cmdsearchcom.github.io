<p>SAXON8Q(1) User Commands SAXON8Q(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
saxon8q - manual page for saxon8q</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
saxon8q [options] query [ params...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
saxon8q runs a query contained in a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The options must come first, then the file name containing
the query, then the params.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows (in
any order):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cr classname <br>
Use the specified CollectionURIResolver to process
collection URIs passed to the collection() function. The
CollectionURIResolver is a user-defined class that
implements <br>
the net.sf.saxon.CollectionURIResolver interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ds Use the linked tree model
for source documents. See Choosing a Tree Model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dt Use the tinytree tree model
for source documents. This is the default tree model. See
Choosing a Tree Model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Display a query execution
plan. This is a representation of the expression tree after
rewriting by the optimizer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Causes line numbers to be
maintained for source documents. These are accessible using
the extension function saxon:line-number(). Line numbers are
useful when the purpose <br>
of the query is to find errors or anomalies in the source
XML file. Without this option, line numbers are available
while source documents are being parsed and validated, <br>
but they are not retained in the tree representation of the
document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mr classname <br>
Use the specified ModuleURIResolver to process all query
module URIs. The ModuleURIResolver is a user-defined class
that implements the net.sf.saxon.query.ModuleURIRe&acirc;
<br>
solver interface. It is invoked to process URIs used in the
import module declaration in the query prolog, and (if -u is
also specified, or if the file name begins with <br>
http: or file:) to process the URI of the query source file
provided on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noext Prevents the query
calling external Java functions. This is useful for safety
if the query is untrusted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o filename <br>
Send output to named file. In the absence of this option,
the results go to standard output. The output format depends
on whether the -wrap option is present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Use the PTreeURIResolver.
This option is available in Saxon-SA only. It cannot be used
in conjunction with the -r option, and it automatically
switches on the -u and -sa <br>
options. The effect is twofold. Firstly, Saxon-specific file
extensions are recognized in URIs (including the URI of the
source document on the command line). Currently <br>
the only Saxon-specific file extension is .ptree, which
indicates that the source document is supplied in the form
of a Saxon PTree. This is a binary representation of an <br>
XML document, designed for speed of loading. Secondly,
Saxon-specific query parameters are recognized in a URI.
Currently the only query parameter that is recognized is
<br>
val. This may take the values strict, lax, or strip. For
example, source.xml?validation=strict loads a document with
strict schema validation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pull Execute query in pull
mode. This may give performance advantages for certain kinds
of query, especially queries that construct intermediate
trees in memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r classname <br>
Use the specified URIResolver to process all URIs. The
URIResolver is a user-defined class, that implements the
URIResolver interface defined in JAXP, whose function is to
<br>
take a URI supplied as a string, and return a SAX
InputSource. It is invoked to process URIs used in the doc()
function, and (if -u is also specified) to process the URI
<br>
of the source file provided on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s filename-or-URI <br>
Take input from the specified file. If the -u option is
specified, or if the name begins with file: or http:, then
the name is assumed to be a URI rather than a filename. <br>
This file must contain an XML document. The document node of
the document is made available to the query as the context
item. The source document can be specified as - to <br>
take the source from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sall Strips all whitespace text
nodes from source documents before any further processing,
regardless of any xml:space attributes in the source
document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-signorable <br>
Strips all ignorable whitespace text nodes from source
documents before any further processing, regardless of any
xml:space attributes in the source document. Whitespace <br>
text nodes are ignorable if they appear in elements defined
in the DTD or schema as having element-only content.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-snone Strips no whitespace
before further processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-strip Equivalent to -sall:
retained for compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Display version and timing
information to the standard error output. The output also
traces the files that are read and written, and extension
modules that are loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Enable execution tracing.
This will cause a trace of the query execution to be output
to the standard error output. The events that are traced are
currently function calls <br>
(entry and exit) and element construction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-TJ Switches on tracing of the
binding of calls to external Java methods. This is useful
when analyzing why Saxon fails to find a Java method to
match an extension function <br>
call in the stylesheet, or why it chooses one method over
another when several are available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Indicates that the name of
the source document is a URI; otherwise it is taken as a
filename, unless it starts with http: or file:, in which
case they it is taken as a <br>
URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Indicates that source
documents are to be parsed using a validating parser (this
invokes DTD validation, not schema validation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-val This option is available
only with Saxon-SA, and it automatically switches on the -sa
option. It requests strict validation of source documents
using an XML Schema.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vlax This option is available
only with Saxon-SA, and it automatically switches on the -sa
option. It requests lax validation of source documents using
an XML Schema. That is, <br>
the document will be validated if a suitable schema is
available, and will not be validated otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vw Indicates that validation
errors found when validating the result tree should be
treated as warnings only. This option is available only with
the Saxon-SA version of the <br>
command, com.saxonica.Query.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wrap Wraps the result sequence
in an XML element structure that indicates the type of each
node or atomic value in the query result. This format can
handle any type of query <br>
result. In the absence of this option, the command
effectively wraps a document{} constructor around the
supplied query, so that the result is a single XML document,
which <br>
is then serialized. This will fail if the query result
includes constructs that cannot be added to a document node
in this way, notably free-standing attribute nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1.1 Allow XML 1.1 and XML
Namespaces 1.1 constructs. This option must be set if source
documents using XML 1.1 are to be read, or if result
documents are to be serialized as <br>
XML 1.1. This option also enables use of XML 1.1 constructs
within the query itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? Display command syntax</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">query Identifies the file
containing the query. Mandatory. The argument can be
specified as - to read the query from standard input. The
query can also be specified inline by <br>
enclosing it in curly braces (if it contains spaces, you
will also need quotes outside the curly braces to keep the
command line processor happy). For example java <br>
net.sf.saxon.Query {doc(&rsquo;a.xml&rsquo;)//p[1]} selects
elements within the file a.xml in the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A param takes the form
name=value, name being the name of the parameter, and value
the value of the parameter. These parameters are accessible
within the query as external <br>
variables, using the syntax, provided they are declared in
the query prolog. If there is no such declaration, the
supplied parameter value is silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A param preceded by a leading
plus sign (+) is interpreted as a filename or directory. The
content of the file is parsed as XML, and the resulting
document node is passed to the <br>
stylesheet as the value of the parameter. If the parameter
value is a directory, then all the immediately contained
files are parsed as XML, and the resulting sequence of
docu&acirc; <br>
ment nodes is passed as the value of the parameter. For
example, +lookup=lookup.xml sets the value of the external
variable lookup to the document node at the root of the tree
<br>
representing the parsed contents of the file lookup.xml.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A param preceded by a leading
exclamation mark is interpreted as a serialization
parameter. For example, !indent=yes requests indented
output, and !encoding=iso-8859-1 requests <br>
that the serialized output be in ISO 8859/1 encoding. This
is equivalent to specifying the option declaration declare
option saxon:output indent=yes; or declare option
saxon:out&acirc; <br>
put encoding=iso-8859-1; in the query prolog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under Windows, and some other
operating systems, it is possible to supply a value
containing spaces by enclosing it in double quotes, for
example name=John Smith. This is a fea&acirc; <br>
ture of the operating system shell, not something Saxon
does, so it may not work the same way under every operating
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the parameter name is in a
non-null namespace, the parameter can be given a value using
the syntax {uri}localname=value. Here uri is the namespace
URI of the parameter&rsquo;s name, <br>
and localname is the local part of the name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This applies also to output
parameters. For example, you can set the indentation level
to 4 by using the parameter
!{http://saxon.sf.net/}indent-spaces=4. For the extended set
of <br>
output parameters supported by Saxon, see Additional
serialization parameters.</p>
