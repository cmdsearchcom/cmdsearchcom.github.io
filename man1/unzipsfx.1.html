<i>unzipsfx</i> is a modified version of <i>unzip</i>(1L) designed to be
  prepended to existing ZIP archives in order to form self-extracting archives.
  Instead of taking its first non-flag argument to be the zipfile(s) to be
  extracted, <i>unzipsfx</i> seeks itself under the name by which it was invoked
  and tests or extracts the contents of the appended archive. Because the
  executable stub adds bulk to the archive (the whole purpose of which is to be
  as small as possible), a number of the less-vital capabilities in regular
  <i>unzip</i> have been removed. Among these are the usage (or help) screen,
  the listing and diagnostic functions ( <b>-l</b> and <b>-v</b>), the ability
  to decompress older compression formats (the ``reduce,'' ``shrink'' and
  ``implode'' methods). The ability to extract to a directory other than the
  current one can be selected as a compile-time option, which is now enabled by
  default since UnZipSFX version 5.5. Similarly, decryption is supported as a
  compile-time option but should be avoided unless the attached archive contains
  encrypted files. Starting with release 5.5, another compile-time option adds a
  simple ``run command after extraction'' feature. This feature is currently
  incompatible with the ``extract to different directory'' feature and remains
  disabled by default.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Note that</b> <b>self-extracting archives made with</b> <i>unzipsfx</i>
  <b>are no more (or less)</b> <b>portable across different operating systems
  than is</b> <b>the</b> <i>unzip</i> <b>executable itself.</b> In general a
  self-extracting archive made on a particular Unix system, for example, will
  only self-extract under the same flavor of Unix. Regular <i>unzip</i> may
  still be used to extract the embedded archive as with any normal zipfile,
  although it will generate a harmless warning about extra bytes at the
  beginning of the zipfile. <i>Despite this</i>, however, the self-extracting
  archive is technically <i>not</i> a valid ZIP archive, and PKUNZIP may be
  unable to test or extract it. This limitation is due to the simplistic manner
  in which the archive is created; the internal directory structure is not
  updated to reflect the extra bytes prepended to the original zipfile.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ARGUMENTS"><a class="selflink" href="#ARGUMENTS">ARGUMENTS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">[<i>file(s)</i>]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">An optional list of archive members to be processed.
      Regular expressions (wildcards) similar to those in Unix <i>egrep</i>(1)
      may be used to match multiple members. These wildcards may contain:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">*</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">matches a sequence of 0 or more characters</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">?</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">matches exactly 1 character</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">[...]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">matches any single character found inside the brackets;
      ranges are specified by a beginning character, a hyphen, and an ending
      character. If an exclamation point or a caret (`!' or `^') follows the
      left bracket, then the range of characters within the brackets is
      complemented (that is, anything <i>except</i> the characters inside the
      brackets is considered a match).</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(Be sure to quote any character that might otherwise be
      interpreted or modified by the operating system, particularly under Unix
      and VMS.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">[<b>-x</b>&#x00A0;<i>xfile(s)</i>]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">An optional list of archive members to be excluded from
      processing. Since wildcard characters match directory separators (`/'),
      this option may be used to exclude any files that are in subdirectories.
      For example, ``foosfx *.[ch] -x */*'' would extract all C source files in
      the main directory, but none in any subdirectories. Without the <b>-x</b>
      option, all C source files in all directories within the zipfile would be
      extracted.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>unzipsfx</i> is compiled with SFX_EXDIR defined, the following option is
  also enabled:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">[<b>-d</b>&#x00A0;<i>exdir</i>]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">An optional directory to which to extract files. By
      default, all files and subdirectories are recreated in the current
      directory; the <b>-d</b> option allows extraction in an arbitrary
      directory (always assuming one has permission to write to the directory).
      The option and directory may be concatenated without any white space
      between them, but note that this may cause normal shell behavior to be
      suppressed. In particular, ``-d&#x00A0;~'' (tilde) is expanded by Unix C
      shells into the name of the user's home directory, but ``-d~'' is treated
      as a literal subdirectory `` <b>~</b>'' of the current directory.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<i>unzipsfx</i> supports the following <i>unzip</i>(1L) options: <b>-c</b> and
  <b>-p</b> (extract to standard output/screen), <b>-f</b> and <b>-u</b>
  (freshen and update existing files upon extraction), <b>-t</b> (test archive)
  and <b>-z</b> (print archive comment). All normal listing options ( <b>-l</b>,
  <b>-v</b> and <b>-Z</b>) have been removed, but the testing option (
  <b>-t</b>) may be used as a ``poor man's'' listing. Alternatively, those
  creating self-extracting archives may wish to include a short listing in the
  zipfile comment.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See <i>unzip</i>(1L) for a more complete description of these options.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MODIFIERS"><a class="selflink" href="#MODIFIERS">MODIFIERS</a></h1>
<i>unzipsfx</i> currently supports all <i>unzip</i>(1L) modifiers: <b>-a</b>
  (convert text files), <b>-n</b> (never overwrite), <b>-o</b> (overwrite
  without prompting), <b>-q</b> (operate quietly), <b>-C</b> (match names
  case-insensitively), <b>-L</b> (convert uppercase-OS names to lowercase),
  <b>-j</b> (junk paths) and <b>-V</b> (retain version numbers); plus the
  following operating-system specific options: <b>-X</b> (restore VMS
  owner/protection info), <b>-s</b> (convert spaces in filenames to underscores
  [DOS, OS/2, NT]) and <b>-$</b> (restore volume label [DOS, OS/2, NT, Amiga]).
<div class="Pp"></div>
(Support for regular ASCII text-conversion may be removed in future versions,
  since it is simple enough for the archive's creator to ensure that text files
  have the appropriate format for the local OS. EBCDIC conversion will of course
  continue to be supported since the zipfile format implies ASCII storage of
  text files.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
See <i>unzip</i>(1L) for a more complete description of these modifiers.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT_OPTIONS">ENVIRONMENT
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
<i>unzipsfx</i> uses the same environment variables as <i>unzip</i>(1L) does,
  although this is likely to be an issue only for the person creating and
  testing the self-extracting archive. See <i>unzip</i>(1L) for details.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DECRYPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DECRYPTION">DECRYPTION</a></h1>
Decryption is supported exactly as in <i>unzip</i>(1L); that is, interactively
  with a non-echoing prompt for the password(s). See <i>unzip</i>(1L) for
  details. Once again, note that if the archive has no encrypted files there is
  no reason to use a version of <i>unzipsfx</i> with decryption support; that
  only adds to the size of the archive.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="AUTORUN_COMMAND"><a class="selflink" href="#AUTORUN_COMMAND">AUTORUN
  COMMAND</a></h1>
When <i>unzipsfx</i> was compiled with CHEAP_SFX_AUTORUN defined, a simple
  ``command autorun'' feature is supported. You may enter a command into the Zip
  archive comment, using the following format:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
$AUTORUN$&gt;[command line string]
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When <i>unzipsfx</i> recognizes the ``$AUTORUN$&gt;'' token at the beginning of
  the Zip archive comment, the remainder of the first line of the comment (until
  the first newline character) is passed as a shell command to the operating
  system using the C rtl ``system'' function. Before executing the command,
  <i>unzipsfx</i> displays the command on the console and prompts the user for
  confirmation. When the user has switched off prompting by specifying the
  <b>-q</b> option, autorun commands are never executed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In case the archive comment contains additional lines of text, the remainder of
  the archive comment following the first line is displayed normally, unless
  quiet operation was requested by supplying a <b>-q</b> option.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
To create a self-extracting archive <i>letters</i> from a regular zipfile
  <i>letters.zip</i> and change the new archive's permissions to be
  world-executable under Unix:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
cat unzipsfx letters.zip &gt; letters
chmod 755 letters
zip -A letters
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To create the same archive under MS-DOS, OS/2 or NT (note the use of the
  <b>/b</b> [binary] option to the <i>copy</i> command):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
copy /b unzipsfx.exe+letters.zip letters.exe
zip -A letters.exe
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Under VMS:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
copy unzipsfx.exe,letters.zip letters.exe
letters == &quot;$currentdisk:[currentdir]letters.exe&quot;
zip -A letters.exe
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(The VMS <i>append</i> command may also be used. The second command installs the
  new program as a ``foreign command'' capable of taking arguments. The third
  line assumes that Zip is already installed as a foreign command.) Under
  AmigaDOS:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
MakeSFX letters letters.zip UnZipSFX
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(MakeSFX is included with the UnZip source distribution and with Amiga binary
  distributions. ``zip -A'' doesn't work on Amiga self-extracting archives.) To
  test (or list) the newly created self-extracting archive:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
letters -t
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To test <i>letters</i> quietly, printing only a summary message indicating
  whether the archive is OK or not:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
letters -tqq
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To extract the complete contents into the current directory, recreating all
  files and subdirectories as necessary:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
letters
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To extract all *.txt files (in Unix quote the `*'):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
letters *.txt
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To extract everything <i>except</i> the *.txt files:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
letters -x *.txt
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To extract only the README file to standard output (the screen):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
letters -c README
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To print only the zipfile comment:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
letters -z
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LIMITATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#LIMITATIONS">LIMITATIONS</a></h1>
The principle and fundamental limitation of <i>unzipsfx</i> is that it is not
  portable across architectures or operating systems, and therefore neither are
  the resulting archives. For some architectures there is limited portability,
  however (e.g., between some flavors of Intel-based Unix).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another problem with the current implementation is that any archive with
  ``junk'' prepended to the beginning technically is no longer a zipfile (unless
  <i>zip</i>(1) is used to adjust the zipfile offsets appropriately, as noted
  above). <i>unzip</i>(1) takes note of the prepended bytes and ignores them
  since some file-transfer protocols, notably MacBinary, are also known to
  prepend junk. But PKWARE's archiver suite may not be able to deal with the
  modified archive unless its offsets have been adjusted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>unzipsfx</i> has no knowledge of the user's PATH, so in general an archive
  must either be in the current directory when it is invoked, or else a full or
  relative path must be given. If a user attempts to extract the archive from a
  directory in the PATH other than the current one, <i>unzipsfx</i> will print a
  warning to the effect, ``can't find myself.'' This is always true under Unix
  and may be true in some cases under MS-DOS, depending on the compiler used
  (Microsoft C fully qualifies the program name, but other compilers may not).
  Under OS/2 and NT there are operating-system calls available that provide the
  full path name, so the archive may be invoked from anywhere in the user's
  path. The situation is not known for AmigaDOS, Atari TOS, MacOS, etc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As noted above, a number of the normal <i>unzip</i>(1L) functions have been
  removed in order to make <i>unzipsfx</i> smaller: usage and diagnostic info,
  listing functions and extraction to other directories. Also, only stored and
  deflated files are supported. The latter limitation is mainly relevant to
  those who create SFX archives, however.
<div class="Pp"></div>
VMS users must know how to set up self-extracting archives as foreign commands
  in order to use any of <i>unzipsfx</i>'s options. This is not necessary for
  simple extraction, but the command to do so then becomes, e.g., ``run
  letters'' (to continue the examples given above).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>unzipsfx</i> on the Amiga requires the use of a special program, MakeSFX, in
  order to create working self-extracting archives; simple concatenation does
  not work. (For technically oriented users, the attached archive is defined as
  a ``debug hunk.'') There may be compatibility problems between the ROM levels
  of older Amigas and newer ones.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All current bugs in <i>unzip</i>(1L) exist in <i>unzipsfx</i> as well.
