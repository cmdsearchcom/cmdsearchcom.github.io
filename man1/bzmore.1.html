<p>BZMORE(1) General Commands Manual BZMORE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bzmore, bzless - file perusal filter for crt viewing of
bzip2 compressed text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bzmore [ name ... ] <br>
bzless [ name ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
In the following description, bzless and less can be used
interchangeably with bzmore and more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Bzmore is a filter which allows examination of compressed or
plain text files one screenful at a time on a soft-copy
terminal. bzmore works on files compressed with bzip2 and
<br>
also on uncompressed files. If a file does not exist, bzmore
looks for a file of the same name with the addition of a
.bz2 suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bzmore normally pauses after
each screenful, printing --More-- at the bottom of the
screen. If the user then types a carriage return, one more
line is displayed. If the user <br>
hits a space, another screenful is displayed. Other
possibilities are enumerated later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bzmore looks in the file
/etc/termcap to determine terminal characteristics, and to
determine the default window size. On a terminal capable of
displaying 24 lines, the default <br>
window size is 22 lines. Other sequences which may be typed
when bzmore pauses, and their effects, are as follows (i is
an optional integer argument, defaulting to 1) :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i&lt;space&gt; <br>
display i more lines, (or another screenful if no argument
is given)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^D display 11 more lines (a
&lsquo;&lsquo;scroll&rsquo;&rsquo;). If i is given, then the
scroll size is set to i.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d same as ^D (control-D)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iz same as typing a space except
that i, if present, becomes the new window size. Note that
the window size reverts back to the default at the end of
the current file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is skip i lines and print a
screenful of lines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if skip i screenfuls and print a
screenful of lines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q or Q quit reading the current
file; go on to the next (if any)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e or q When the prompt
--More--(Next file: file) is printed, this command causes
bzmore to exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s When the prompt --More--(Next
file: file) is printed, this command causes bzmore to skip
the next file and continue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= Display the current line
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i/expr search for the i-th
occurrence of the regular expression expr. If the pattern is
not found, bzmore goes on to the next file (if any).
Otherwise, a screenful is dis&acirc; <br>
played, starting two lines before the place where the
expression was found. The user&rsquo;s erase and kill
characters may be used to edit the regular expression.
Erasing back <br>
past the first column cancels the search command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in search for the i-th
occurrence of the last regular expression entered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!command <br>
invoke a shell with command. The character &lsquo;!&rsquo;
in &quot;command&quot; are replaced with the previous shell
command. The sequence &quot;&quot; is replaced by
&quot;!&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:q or :Q <br>
quit reading the current file; go on to the next (if any)
(same as q or Q).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">. (dot) repeat the previous
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The commands take effect
immediately, i.e., it is not necessary to type a carriage
return. Up to the time when the command character itself is
given, the user may hit the line <br>
kill character to cancel the numerical argument being
formed. In addition, the user may hit the erase character to
redisplay the --More-- message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At any time when output is being
sent to the terminal, the user can hit the quit key
(normally control-. Bzmore will stop sending output, and
will display the usual --More-- <br>
prompt. The user may then enter one of the above commands in
the normal manner. Unfortunately, some output is lost when
this is done, due to the fact that any characters
wait&acirc; <br>
ing in the terminal&rsquo;s output queue are flushed when
the quit signal occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The terminal is set to noecho
mode by this program so that the output can be continuous.
What you type will thus not show on your terminal, except
for the / and ! commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the standard output is not a
teletype, then bzmore acts just like bzcat, except that a
header is printed before each file.</p>
