perl5143delta - what is new for perl v5.14.3
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes differences between the 5.14.2 release and the 5.14.3
  release.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.0, first read
  perl5140delta, which describes differences between 5.12.0 and 5.14.0.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Core_Enhancements"><a class="selflink" href="#Core_Enhancements">Core
  Enhancements</a></h1>
No changes since 5.14.0.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;Digest&quot;_unsafe_use_of_eval_(CVE-2011-3597)"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;Digest&quot;_unsafe_use_of_eval_(CVE-2011-3597)">&quot;Digest&quot;
  unsafe use of eval (CVE-2011-3597)</a></h2>
The &quot;Digest-&gt;new()&quot; function did not properly sanitize input before
  using it in an <i>eval()</i> call, which could lead to the injection of
  arbitrary Perl code.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to exploit this flaw, the attacker would need to be able to set the
  algorithm name used, or be able to execute arbitrary Perl code already.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This problem has been fixed.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Heap_buffer_overrun_in_'x'_string_repeat_operator_(CVE-2012-5195)"><a class="selflink" href="#Heap_buffer_overrun_in_'x'_string_repeat_operator_(CVE-2012-5195)">Heap
  buffer overrun in 'x' string repeat operator (CVE-2012-5195)</a></h2>
Poorly written perl code that allows an attacker to specify the count to perl's
  'x' string repeat operator can already cause a memory exhaustion
  denial-of-service attack. A flaw in versions of perl before 5.15.5 can
  escalate that into a heap buffer overrun; coupled with versions of glibc
  before 2.16, it possibly allows the execution of arbitrary code.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This problem has been fixed.

Perl 5.14.3 represents approximately 12 months of development since Perl 5.14.2
  and contains approximately 2,300 lines of changes across 64 files from 22
  authors.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community
  of users and developers. The following people are known to have contributed
  the improvements that became Perl 5.14.3:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Abigail, Andy Dougherty, Carl Hayter, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dave Rolsky,
  David Mitchell, Dominic Hargreaves, Father Chrysostomos, Florian Ragwitz,
  H.Merijn Brand, Jilles Tjoelker, Karl Williamson, Leon Timmermans, Michael G
  Schwern, Nicholas Clark, Niko Tyni, Pino Toscano, Ricardo Signes, Salvador
  Fandin~o, Samuel Thibault, Steve Hay, Tony Cook.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
  from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of
  the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
  tracker.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
  included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
  helping Perl to flourish.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Reporting_Bugs"><a class="selflink" href="#Reporting_Bugs">Reporting
  Bugs</a></h1>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at
  http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
  included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
  sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl
  -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
  porting team.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
  inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
  to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
  unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able
  to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
  co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
  platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
  security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
  CPAN.
