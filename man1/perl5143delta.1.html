<p>PERL5143DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL5143DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5143delta - what is new for perl v5.14.3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.14.2
release and the 5.14.3 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.12.0, first read perl5140delta,
which describes differences between 5.12.0 and 5.14.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Core Enhancements <br>
No changes since 5.14.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
&quot;Digest&quot; unsafe use of eval (CVE-2011-3597) <br>
The &quot;Digest-&gt;new()&quot; function did not properly
sanitize input before using it in an eval() call, which
could lead to the injection of arbitrary Perl code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to exploit this flaw,
the attacker would need to be able to set the algorithm name
used, or be able to execute arbitrary Perl code already.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This problem has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Heap buffer overrun in
&rsquo;x&rsquo; string repeat operator (CVE-2012-5195) <br>
Poorly written perl code that allows an attacker to specify
the count to perl&rsquo;s &rsquo;x&rsquo; string repeat
operator can already cause a memory exhaustion
denial-of-service attack. A flaw <br>
in versions of perl before 5.15.5 can escalate that into a
heap buffer overrun; coupled with versions of glibc before
2.16, it possibly allows the execution of arbitrary
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This problem has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.14.0.
If any exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deprecations <br>
There have been no deprecations since 5.14.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
New Modules and Pragmata <br>
None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Updated Modules and Pragmata

which opening a filehandle to a glob copy caused assertion
failures (under debugging) or hangs or other erratic
behaviour without <br>
debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; ODBM_File and
NDBM_File were updated to allow building on GNU/Hurd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; IPC::Open3 has
been updated to fix a regression introduced in perl 5.12,
which broke &quot;IPC::Open3::open3($in, $out, $err,
&rsquo;-&rsquo;)&quot;. [perl #95748]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Digest has been
upgraded from version 1.16 to 1.16_01.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Security&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Module::CoreList
has been updated to version 2.49_04 to add data for this
release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Removed Modules and Pragmata
<br>
None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documentation <br>
New Documentation <br>
None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes to Existing
Documentation <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; perlcheat was
updated to 5.14.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration and Compilation
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; h2ph was updated to search correctly gcc
include directories on platforms such as Debian with
multi-architecture support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In Configure,
the test for procselfexe was refactored into a loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Support <br>
New Platforms <br>
None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Discontinued Platforms <br>
None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform-Specific Notes <br>
FreeBSD <br>

FreeBSD 10.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solaris and NetBSD <br>
Configure was updated for &quot;procselfexe&quot; support on
Solaris and NetBSD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HP-UX <br>
README.hpux was updated to note the existence of a broken
header in HP-UX 11.00.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Linux <br>
libutil is no longer used when compiling on Linux platforms,
which avoids warnings being emitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The system gcc (rather than any
other gcc which might be in the compiling user&rsquo;s path)
is now used when searching for libraries such as
&quot;-lm&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mac OS X <br>
The locale tests were updated to reflect the behaviour of
locales in Mountain Lion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LFS support was enabled in
GNU/Hurd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NetBSD <br>
The NetBSD hints file was corrected to be compatible with
NetBSD 6.*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bug Fixes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; A regression has been fixed that was
introduced in 5.14, in &quot;/i&quot; regular expression
matching, in which a match improperly fails if the pattern
is in UTF-8, the target string <br>
is not, and a Latin-1 character precedes a character in the
string that should match the pattern. [perl #101710]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In
case-insensitive regular expression pattern matching, no
longer on UTF-8 encoded strings does the scan for the start
of match only look at the first possible position. <br>
This caused matches such as &quot;&quot;fB00}&quot; =~
/ff/i&quot; to fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
sitecustomize support was made relocatableinc aware, so that
-Dusesitecustomize and -Duserelocatableinc may be used
together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The smartmatch
operator (&quot;~~&quot;) was changed so that the right-hand
side takes precedence during &quot;Any ~~ Object&quot;
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A bug has been
fixed in the tainting support, in which an
&quot;index()&quot; operation on a tainted constant would
cause all other constants to become tainted. [perl
#64804]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A regression has
been fixed that was introduced in perl 5.12, whereby
tainting errors were not correctly propagated through
&quot;die()&quot;. [perl #111654]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A regression has
been fixed that was introduced in perl 5.14, in which
&quot;/[[:lower:]]/i&quot; and &quot;/[[:upper:]]/i&quot; no
longer matched the opposite case. [perl #101970]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acknowledgements <br>
Perl 5.14.3 represents approximately 12 months of
development since Perl 5.14.2 and contains approximately
2,300 lines of changes across 64 files from 22 authors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl continues to flourish into
its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and
developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that <br>
became Perl 5.14.3:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Abigail, Andy Dougherty, Carl
Hayter, Chris &rsquo;BinGOs&rsquo; Williams, Dave Rolsky,
David Mitchell, Dominic Hargreaves, Father Chrysostomos,
Florian Ragwitz, H.Merijn Brand, Jilles <br>
Tjoelker, Karl Williamson, Leon Timmermans, Michael G
Schwern, Nicholas Clark, Niko Tyni, Pino Toscano, Ricardo
Signes, Salvador Fandin~o, Samuel Thibault, Steve Hay, Tony
Cook.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list above is almost
certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from
version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much <br>
appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl
bug tracker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the changes included in
this version originated in the CPAN modules included in
Perl&rsquo;s core. We&rsquo;re grateful to the entire CPAN
community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a more complete list of all
of Perl&rsquo;s historical contributors, please see the
AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . <br>
There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the
Perl Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the bug you are reporting has
security implications, which make it inappropriate to send
to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to
<br>
perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the
core committers, who be able to help assess the impact of
<br>
issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the
release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this
<br>
address for security issues in the Perl core, not for
modules independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
