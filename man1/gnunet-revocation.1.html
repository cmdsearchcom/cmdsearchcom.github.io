<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gnunet-revocation - revoke private keys (of egos) in
GNUnet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gnunet-revocation [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gnunet-revocation can be used to verify if a key has been
revoked, to create a revocation certificate for later
revocation, to instantly revoke a key and to use a
pre-generated <br>
revocation certificate to revoke a key. Upon successful
revocation, all peers will be informed about the invalidity
of the key. As this is an expensive operation, GNUnet <br>
requires the issuer of the revocation to perform an
expensive proof-of-work computation before he will be
allowed to perform the revocation. gnunet-revocation will
perform this <br>
computation. The computation can be performed ahead of time,
with the resulting revocation certificate being stored in a
file for later &quot;instant&quot; use. gnunet-revocation
also <br>
makes is possible to resume the pre-calculation of a
revocation --- simply abort a running proof-of-work
calculation with CTRL-C, and the existing revocation
certificate file <br>
will contain the status of the computation. Note that
performing a revocation proof-of-work is deliberately VERY
expensive. Depending on your CPU, the calculation can take
days <br>
or weeks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-t KEY, --test=KEY <br>
Check if the given KEY (ASCII-encoded public key required)
has been revoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R NAME, --revoke=NAME <br>
Calculate or perform revocation for the ego with the given
NAME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --perform <br>
Actually perform the revocation as soon as possible (do not
just generate a revocation certificate, use it). Must be
supplied to actually perform the revocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f NAME, --filename=NAME <br>
Use NAME as the name of the file that is to contain the
revocation certificate. Intermediate computation results
will be stored here, as well as the final revocation
cer&acirc; <br>
tificate. When used together with -p, this file will be
inspected to see if it contains a valid certificate for
instant revocation, in which case the revocation can be <br>
performed instantly. If the given file contains anything (a
valid certificate, with or without the completed
proof-of-work) there is no need to supply the &quot;-R&quot;
option or <br>
to still have the private key of the ego to perform the
revocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c FILENAME, --config=FILENAME
<br>
Use the configuration file FILENAME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print short help on options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L LOGLEVEL, --loglevel=LOGLEVEL
<br>
Use LOGLEVEL for logging. Valid values are DEBUG, INFO,
WARNING and ERROR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Print GNUnet version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Report bugs by using Mantis &lt;https://gnunet.org/bugs/&gt;
or by sending electronic mail to
&lt;gnunet-developers@gnu.org&gt;</p>
