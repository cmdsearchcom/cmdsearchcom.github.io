<p>MAILAGENT(1) General Commands Manual MAILAGENT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mailagent - an automatic mail-processing tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mailagent [ -dhilqtFIVU ] [ -s{umaryt} ] [ -f file ] [ -e
rule ] [ -c config ] [ -L loglevel ] [ -r rulefile ] [ -o
override ] [ mailfile ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Mailagent allows you to process your mail automatically.
Given a set of lex-like rules, you are able to fill mails to
specific folders, forward messages to a third person, pipe a
<br>
message to a command or even post the message to a
newsgroup. It is also possible to process messages
containing some commands. The mailagent is not usually
invoked manually but <br>
is rather called via the filter program, which is in turn
invoked by sendmail. That means you must have sendmail on
your system to use this. You also must have perl to run the
<br>
mailagent scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a set of options which
may be used when you invoke mailagent yourself. Please refer
to the OPTIONS section for a complete description. You may
use the -h option to get a <br>
cryptic usage reminder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Product Overview <br>
Mailagent has actually four distinct set of features, which
can be used simultaneously or one at a time. This
involves:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; An @SH command
processor, to remain compatible with the first
implementation. In this simplest usage, all the mail
messages are left in your mailbox (or the catch all <br>
folder required on Debian systems: Please see
/usr/share/doc/mailagent/SECURITY for details), with special
processing raised on messages whose subject is Command.
Please <br>
refer to the section entitled USING THE DEFAULT RULES if you
wish to use this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A complete mail
filter, which helps you sort your mail based on various
sorting criteria and actions. Filtering is specified in a
rule file and supersedes the default Com&acirc; <br>
mand mail processing (which may be turned on again by
explicitly setting up a rule for it). This should be the
most common use of mailagent and is fully documented under
the <br>
section entitled USING THE FILTER. You may deliver mail to
plain Unix-style folders but also to MMDF and MH ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A replacement
for the vacation program, which will automatically answer
your mail while you are not there. You only need to supply a
message to be sent back and the fre&acirc; <br>
quency at which this will occur. Some simple macro
substitutions allow you to re-use some parts of the mail
header into your vacation message, for a more personalized
reply. <br>
See the VACATION MODE section for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A generic mail
server, which will let you implement a real mail server
without the hassle of the lower-level concerns like error
recovery, logging or command parsing. The <br>
full documentation can be found in the section GENERIC MAIL
SERVER at the end of this manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to extend the
mailagent filtering commands by implementing them in perl
and then having them automagically loaded when used. Those
extended commands will behave <br>
exactly like built in ones, as documented in the EXTENDING
FILTERING COMMANDS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Learning From Examples <br>
It is quite possible that you will find this manual page too
complex for you. Unfortunately, it is not really meant to be
a tutorial but rather a reference material. If you <br>
wish, you may start by looking at the examples held in the
distribution source tree under agent/examples. This
directory contains two examples of rule files (look at the
README <br>
file first) and are verbosely commented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GETTING STARTED <br>
First, you need to install a minimum configuration and see
how it works. It would be useless to fully install the
program and then discover that it does not work as
advertised...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start the installation, you
have to set up a ~/.mailagent file which is the main
configuration file, and choose the right filter program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Choosing The Filter Program <br>
The distribution comes with two filter programs. One written
in shell and one in C. The shell version might be the one to
use if you can receive your mail on many different
plat&acirc; <br>
forms where your home directory is NFS-mounted (i.e. shared
among all those platforms). The C version is safer and much
faster, but you need to install it to a fixed location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some platforms, sendmail does
not correctly reset its UID when processing mails in its own
queue. In that case, you need to get a private copy of the C
filter program and make <br>
it setuid to yourself. The filter will then correctly reset
its UID if invoked with an effective UID different from
yours (it may also require the setgid bit to reset GID as
<br>
well). If this is indeed the case on your system, make sure
you use the path configuration variable to set a proper
PATH, as the filter will spawn a perl process with the
&rsquo;-S&rsquo; <br>
option, looking for a mailagent script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even if you do not need to get a
setuid copy of the filter program, it is wise to set up a
proper path: someone might break into your account by
putting a mailagent Trojan horse <br>
in the appropriate location. Also make sure the mailagent
program is protected against writing, as well as the
directory which holds it, or someone might substitute his
own ver&acirc; <br>
sion of the script and break security. I believe the setuid
filter program to be safe, but overlooking is always
possible so please report any security hole to me.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filter script can be found
in the Lib/mailagent directory. It needs some tailoring so
you should copy it into your home directory and edit it to
suit your needs. Comments <br>
held in it should be self explanatory. There is only a small
section at the head of the script which needs to be edited.
You&rsquo;ll have to delete shell comments in the filter
<br>
script by yourself if your shell cannot deal with them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of version 3.0 PL44, I advise
you to prefer the C version if you are concerned about
security. If you are in a position where multiple
architectures can process your .forward, <br>
then a shell wrapper selecting the proper executable based
on the architecture will be required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuring Mailagent <br>
If mailagent is in your path, you may automatically
configure a default installation by running:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mailagent -I</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which will create a ~/.mailagent
file from an existing template, customize some important
variables for your site, and make some basic sanity checks.
Everything the command does <br>
is output on the screen for checking purposes, and any
problem found is reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, you have to copy the
mailagent.cf file held in the mailagent sub-directory
/usr/share/mailagent (hereafter named Lib) as a .mailagent
in your home directory. Edit it <br>
to configure the whole processing. In particular, you have
to choose a spool directory (hereafter named Spool) and a
log directory (hereafter named Log).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that using the automatic
installation procedure above does not prevent you from going
through the file and modifying it as you wish. In fact, you
are greatly encouraged to <br>
do this, especially for the home directory setting, the
logging level and the path or p_host variables. Once you are
done, rerun the mailagent -I command to make sure everything
<br>
is fine. Still, you will have to plug in mailagent by
creating a ~/.forward file, as explained in a few
sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Following is a description of
each of the fields you will find in the ~/.mailagent file,
followed by a suggested value, when applicable. Fields
marked as optional may not be <br>
present in the configuration file. Some fields have a close
relationship with others, and that is given too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">agemax Period after which an
entry in the database should be removed (suggested: 1y) This
field is optional, but needed if autoclean is on. <br>
authfile Remote sending authorizations (not implemented
yet). <br>
autoclean Set to ON (case insensitively), mailagent will
perform automatic cleaning of the database entries under
hash by removing all the items older than agemax. This is an
<br>
optional field, omitting it defaults to OFF. (suggested:
OFF, unless you use ONCE, UNIQUE or RECORD commands, or
activate the vacation mode.) <br>
biff Whether or not biffing is wanted when mailagent
delivers mail to a folder. Set it to ON (case insensitively)
to allow local biffing if you are logged in. (optional, <br>
defaults to: OFF) <br>
biffhead When biffing is enabled, this variable lists which
headers should be printed out. Headers should be given in
their normalized format and be separated with commas. <br>
(optional, defaults to: From, To, Subject, Date). <br>
bifflen The maximum length of the message body that should
be printed when biffing. (optional, defaults to 560). <br>
bifflines The maximum number of lines of the message body
that should be printed when biffing. Actually, mailagent
attempts to print that amount of lines, provided the total
<br>
amount of characters printed is less than bifflen.
(optional, defaults to 7). <br>
biffmh When turned ON, the body of the message is compacted
before biffing by removing consecutive spaces and replacing
newlines with a single space. The message itself is <br>
not altered physically of course, only the output on the
screen is concerned. Since this may yield to a
difficult-to-read message, I suggest you also turn on
biffnice <br>
when using this option. (optional, defaults to: OFF). <br>
biffmsg The path to a file describing the format biffing
should use. If not set, a default hardwired format is used.
Season to taste. (suggested: ~/.biffmsg). <br>
biffnice Whether the message should be reformatted to nicely
fit into the terminal. (optional, defaults to OFF,
suggested: ON when biffmh is also ON). <br>
biffnl Controls whether &quot;blank&quot; body lines should
be printed or not. By &quot;blank&quot; lines, we mean lines
not containing words. Set it to ON to print such blank
lines, to OFF if <br>
you wish to get a more compact view of the body within the
limits fixed by bifflen and bifflines. (optional, defaults
to ON). <br>
biffquote Controls whether the leading attribution line
introducing a trimmed quotation should be part of the biff
message or not. When turned OFF, the attribution line is
<br>
trimmed along and this is reported in the trimming message,
when bifftrim is ON. (optional, defaults to ON). <br>
bifftrim Controls whether trimmed lines within the biff
message should be replaced by a message stating how many of
them were trimmed. Only used by the %-T biffing macro. When
<br>
turned OFF, it automatically turns off biffquote as well.
(optional, defaults to ON). <br>
bifftrlen States how many lines long a leading quotation
should be before performing any trimming. Only used by the
%-T biffing macro. (optional, defaults to 2). <br>
callout The name of the callout queue file where batched
jobs are kept. This parameter must be defined when using the
AFTER command. (suggested: $spool/callout) <br>
cleanlaps Cleaning period for database entries. The value of
the last clean up is saved into the context file. This is
optional, but needed if autoclean is on. (suggested: 1M)
<br>
comfile Name of the file containing authorized commands.
Needed when PROCESS is used. (suggested: $spool/commands).
<br>
compress Name of the file containing the list of compressed
folders. See section about folder compression. This is an
optional parameter. (suggested: ~/.compress). <br>
compspecs Name of the file containing specifications for how
to handle different types of compression formats. See
section about folder compression. This is an optional
parame&acirc; <br>
ter. (suggested: $spool/compressors). <br>
comptag The default compression tag when creating new
folders. If not specified, the default is
&rsquo;gzip&rsquo;. <br>
comserver Name of the file containing authorized SERVER
commands and their definition. This is an optional parameter
if you don&rsquo;t plan to use the generic mail server.
(sug&acirc; <br>
gested: $spool/server). <br>
context File holding the mailagent context. The context
saves some variables which need to be kept over the life of
the process. Needed if auto cleaning is activated.
(sug&acirc; <br>
gested: $spool/context) <br>
distlist A list of all the available distributions. See the
sample held in Lib/mailagent/distribs. Needed by PROCESS
only. (suggested: $spool/distribs) <br>
domain Your domain name, without the leading dot, as in
example.com. The value is appended to the value of email
when that variable does not have any &rsquo;@&rsquo;, to
construct a <br>
fully qualified e-mail address. See also the hidenet
variable. (optional, defaults to the domain name determined
at build time). <br>
email Your electronic mail address. If left unspecified,
mailagent will try to guess it. This address is used by
mailagent when trying to send something to the user (you!).
<br>
(suggested: specify your e-mail address). <br>
emergdir Name of the directory which should be used for
dumps, preferably. This is optional. (suggested:
~/tmp/lost+mail) <br>
execsafe Whether to be strict before using exec() to launch
a new process or not. The value of this variable is used in
place of secure when checking executable files. (defaults
<br>
to OFF, suggested: ON if possible). <br>
execskip Whether to skip the exec() security checks
alltogether. Don&rsquo;t turn this ON unless you really
trust all the users having access to your machine or file
server. <br>
(optional, default to OFF, suggested: OFF). <br>
fromall Whether or not mailagent should escape all the From
lines in the message, not only those it thinks should appear
dangerous (i.e. a From after a blank line). This option <br>
only makes sense when fromesc is also activated. It is
ignored otherwise, and therefore is optional. By default, it
is assumed to be OFF. (suggested: OFF, until you <br>
have reasons to believe your mail user-agent is confused in
this mode: when it happens, your user agent will split mail
for no apparent reason). <br>
fromesc Whether or not mailagent should escape potentially
dangerous From lines in mail messages. If you use MH or if
your mail reader does not use those lines to separate
mes&acirc; <br>
sages, then you may set it to OFF. (suggested: ON) <br>
fromfake Whether or not mailagent should fake a From: line
into the message header when it is absent. Naturally, it
requires a valid leading From line to operate! (optional,
<br>
defaults to ON, suggested: ON). <br>
groupsafe If turned OFF, then group-writable files will be
managed as if they were secure, from a security point of
view. Leave it to ON if possible, or you may pass by a huge
<br>
security hole without your noticing (optional, defaults to
ON, suggested: ON). <br>
hash The directory used for name hashing by the built-in
database used by ONCE, UNIQUE and RECORD commands. Optional,
unless you make use of those commands or activate auto <br>
cleaning. The directory is placed in the spool area.
(suggested: $spool/dbr). <br>
helpdir Directory where help files for SERVER commands are
kept. (suggested: $spool/help) <br>
hidenet When set to ON, the value of the variable domain is
the fully qualified name used. When OFF, the hostname is
prepended to the domain. If the hostname is already fully
<br>
qualified, then the value of domain is ignored. Assuuming
domain is set to example.com and the hostname is host, then
the fully qualified name will be host.example.com <br>
if hidenet is OFF, and example.com if ON. (optional,
defaults to whatever was determined at build time) <br>
home Defines where the home directory is. This must be
accurate. <br>
level Log level, see below for a definition of available
levels (suggested: 9). <br>
linkdirs When set to ON, carefully checks symbolic links to
directories when performing security checks on sensitive
files. This will (recursively) check for each symbolic link
<br>
level that the target directory is not world writable or
group writable and that the parent directory of each target
link is not world writable. If the secure option is <br>
OFF, this parameter is ignored. (optional, defaults to: ON,
suggested: ON when secure is also ON). <br>
lockdekay The delay in seconds between two locking attempts.
(optional, defaults to: 2). <br>
lockhold The maximum delay in seconds for holding a lock.
After that time, the lock will be broken. (optional,
defaults to: 3600). <br>
lockmax Maximum number of locking attempts before giving up.
(optional, defaults to: 20). <br>
locksafe When locking a file, mailagent normally makes
lockmax attempts separated by lockdelay seconds, and then
gives up. When facing a delivery to a mailbox, it may make
sense <br>
to continue even if no lock was grabbed, or even if only a
partial locking was done (e.g. one of the .lock or
flock()-style locking succeeded). This variable controls
<br>
how safe you want to be. Set it to OFF to let mailagent
continue its mailbox delivery even though no locking was
done, to ON if you want strict locking, to PARTIAL if <br>
you can live with partial locking. Messages not saved in a
folder are dumped to an emergency mailbox. (optional,
defaults to ON). On Debian systems, since mailagent can <br>
not grab locks,it should always be left ON, or else mail
garbling may occur. See /usr/share/doc/mailagent/SECURITY
for details. <br>
lockwarn This variable controls the time after which
mailagent should start emiting a warning when busy trying to
acquire a lock. It is a comma separated list of values, in
<br>
seconds. If two values are given, the first is the initial
time threshold, the second is the repeat period. For
instance, a value of &quot;15,60&quot; would cause a warning
after <br>
15 seconds, then every 60 seconds until the lock is taken or
the locking attempt time is expired (see lockmax and
lockdelay). If only one value is given, it is taken <br>
as being both the initial threshold and the period.
(optional, defaults to: 20,300). <br>
log Name of the log file which will be put in Log directory.
(suggested: agentlog). <br>
logdir Logging directory. (suggested: ~/var/log). <br>
mailbox The name of the system mailbox file, which by
default is the value of the user configuration variable.
This is an optional parameter. <br>
maildrop Location of the system mail spool directory. If
none is provided, then the mailagent will use the value
determined by Configure. <br>
mailopt Options to be passed to the mailer (see sendmail).
(optional, suggested: -odq -i, when using sendmail). <br>
maxcmds Maximum number of commands that are allowed to be
executed by a SERVER command before flushing the remaining
of the mail message. (suggested: 10). <br>
maxerrors Maximum number of errors for the SERVER command
before flushing the remaining of the mail message.
(suggested: 10). <br>
maxsize Maximum size in bytes of files before using kit for
sending files. This is used by PROCESS. (suggested: 150000).
<br>
mboxlock The format to be used for locking mailboxes before
delivering to them. This string goes through a small macro
substitution mechanism to make it more general. The file
<br>
name derived after macro substitution is the name of the
lock that will be used, given the name of the file that is
to be locked. Available macros are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%D: the file directory name <br>
%f: the file name to be locked (full path) <br>
%F: the file base name (last path component) <br>
%p: the current process pid number <br>
%%: a plain % character</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Common locking formats are
&quot;%f.lock&quot; and &quot;%D/.%F.lock&quot;. Of course,
to be able to use this feature, mailagent must not have been
configured to use flock()-style locking <br>
only. (optional, defaults to: %f.lock). This has no effect
on Debian systems, since mailagent can not get a lock
anyway, since it is not sgid mail. <br>
mhprofile The name of the MH profile to be used. This is
needed only when attempting to save in an MH folder. If this
optional parameter is not set, the default value
~/.mh_pro&acirc; <br>
file is used. <br>
mmdf Set this to ON if you wish to be able to save mail in
MMDF-style mailboxes. (suggested: OFF, unless you use MMDF
or MH). This is invalid on a Debian system. <br>
mmdfbox The value of this variable only matters when mmdf is
on. If set to ON, then new folders will be created as MMDF
ones. This variable is not used when saving to an
exist&acirc; <br>
ing folder, since in that case the mailagent will
automatically determine the type and save the message
accordingly. (suggested: OFF, unless you use MMDF or wish to
<br>
use MH&rsquo;s mshf). <br>
msgprefix Name of the file to put in directory folders,
specifying the message prefix to be used. Optional, defaults
to .msg_prefix. <br>
name First name of the user, used by mailagent when
referring to you. This sets the value of the %U macro. <br>
newcmd Name of the file describing new filtering commands.
See section Extending Filtering Commands for more details.
Leave this optional parameter out unless you are a
maila&acirc; <br>
gent expert. (suggested: $spool/newcmd). <br>
newsopt Options to be passed to the news posting program
(see sendnews). (optional, suggested: leave empty when using
inews). <br>
nfslock Set it to ON to ensure NFS-secure locks. The
difference is that the hostname is used in conjunction with
the PID to obtain a lock. However, mailagent has to
fork/exec <br>
to obtain that information. This is an optional parameter
which is set to OFF by default. (suggested: OFF if you
deliver mail from only one machine, even though it&rsquo;s
<br>
via NFS). <br>
passwd File where SERVER power passwords are kept --
encrypted usually. (suggested: $powers/passwd). <br>
path Minimum path to be used by C filter program. To set a
specific path for a machine host, set up a p_host variable.
This will be prepended to the default PATH variable <br>
supplied by other programs. (suggested:
/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/ucb). Note that the host name must be
specified without any domain name appended to it (e.g. for
an host name <br>
of lyon.eiffel.com, use variable p_lyon). If your host name
contains an &rsquo;-&rsquo; in it, you must write it as a
&rsquo;_&rsquo;, since &rsquo;-&rsquo; is not a valid
character for a perl variable <br>
name. <br>
perlib This variable may be used to change the perl search
path for required files. Directories should be separated
using a &rsquo;:&rsquo; character, just like a shell PATH.
This path <br>
is prepended to the default perl search path. Any directory
not starting with a &rsquo;/&rsquo; (after ~name
substitution) is taken relatively to the mailagent private
lib direc&acirc; <br>
tory determined at configuration time. <br>
plsave Name of the file used to save the patchlevels for
archived distributions. This is only used by the commands
invoked via PROCESS. (suggested: $spool/plsave). <br>
powerdir Directory listing user clearances for SERVER
powers. (suggested: $powers/clearance) <br>
powerlist Name of file containing SERVER power aliases.
Since power names can be arbitrary long but some filesystems
still have a 14 character limitation on filename length,
<br>
internal aliases are created and maintained by mailagent.
(suggested: $powers/aliases). <br>
powerlog File where SERVER power requests are logged, in
addition to the agentlog. Since those are a security
concern, it is a good idea to log them separately. If not
defined, <br>
log them only in agentlog. (suggested: $logdir/powerlog).
<br>
powers Directory for SERVER power administration.
(suggested: $spool/powers) <br>
proglist A small description for the available
distributions. See the sample held in
Lib/mailagent/proglist. This is used by PROCESS only.
(suggested: $spool/proglist) <br>
queue Queue directory (messages waiting to be processed).
Required, of course. (suggested: $spool/queue) <br>
queuehold Maximum number of seconds a mail can sit in the
mailagent queue before being actually processed. During that
time, mailagent will not try to process the message even
<br>
when -q is used. (optional, defaults to: 1800). <br>
queuelost Maximum number of seconds after which mailagent
should flag messages still in its queue as being old.
(optional, defaults to: 86400, i.e. a day). <br>
queuewait Time in seconds telling the C filter program how
long it must wait before launching mailagent. (optional,
defaults to: 60, but can be lowered to 0 if you don&rsquo;t
want to <br>
wait to delay getting new messages). <br>
rulecache The name of the file used to cache the latest
compiled rules. Since usually mailagent works mainly with
one same rule file, this saves the overhead of recompiling
all <br>
the rules each time. (optional, suggested:
$spool/rulecache). <br>
rulemac Set this to ON to enable macro substitutions in rule
patterns. (optional, defaults to: OFF). <br>
rules The name of the file holding the filtering rules
(optional on non Debian systems, suggested: ~/.rules). On
Debian systems, one must have a minimal rules file to
prevent <br>
mailagent from trying to put messages into
/var/spool/mail/$USER, since mailagent can&rsquo;t lock that
directory to prevent mail from being garbled. This is
because Debian <br>
policy requires all entities attempting locks on that
directory to be sgid mail, and making mailagent sgid
anything would be a security loophole. <br>
{ SAVE incoming }; <br>
is the suggested minimal rules file. <br>
runmax Timeout for RUN commands and friends. (optional,
defaults to: 3600). <br>
scriptcc Flag indicating whether a copy of the SERVER
session transcript should be send to the user running
mailagent. (suggested: OFF). <br>
secure When set to ON, mailagent and the C filter will
perform extensive security checks on sensitive files. This
includes checks for group writability, ownerships and
protec&acirc; <br>
tion testing on the directory where the file resides, and
checks on symbolic links to directories (mailagent only,
when linkdirs is ON too). Note that secure is assumed <br>
to be ON, whatever its real setting, when running as
super-user. (suggested: ON). <br>
sendmail The name of the program used to send mail. That
program must accept the mail message with headers on its
standard input and a list of recipients on the command line.
If <br>
not specified, will use the mailer chosen at configuration
time (sendmail usually). The command line used to mail a
message will be sendmail mailopt address(es). <br>
(optional, suggested: /usr/lib/sendmail). <br>
sendnews The name of the program used to post news. That
program must accept the news article with headers on its
standard input. If not specified, will use the news posting
<br>
program chosen at configuration time (inews usually). The
command line used to post an article will be sendnews -h
newsopt. (optional, suggested: <br>
/usr/local/bin/inews). <br>
seq File used to compute job numbers (suggested: .seq). <br>
servdir The directory name where shell and perl server
commands are stored. This is the default lookup place.
Optional parameter unless SERVER is used. (suggested: <br>
$spool/cmds). <br>
servshell This is the name of the shell used to launch
SERVER shell commands (actually to process the wrapper file
that will ultimately exec() the command). On some systems
like <br>
HPUX 10.x, this has to be set to /usr/old/bin/sh to get the
plain old Bourne shell, because /bin/sh is a braindead POSIX
shell that closes file descriptors greater than <br>
2 upon exec(), whereas the Bourne shell does not. (optional,
suggested: /bin/sh unless you&rsquo;re on HPUX 10.x, as
explained before). <br>
spool Spool directory, required (suggested:
~/var/mailagent). <br>
statfile File where statistics should be gathered. If no
such file exists, no statistics will be recorded (suggested:
$spool/mailagent.st). <br>
tofake Whether or not mailagent should fake a To: line into
the message header when it is absent, which will be used for
filtering purposes (no physical alteration of the <br>
header occur). It uses Alternate-To: headers if found,
otherwise it assumes the message was send to the user and
takes the value from the user configuration variable. <br>
(optional, defaults to ON, suggested: ON; turn it OFF only
if you want to identify missing To: lines to detect SPAM).
<br>
tome This optional variable may contain a comma separated
list of alternate logins that are also valid for the user
(mail aliases). This is used in vacation mode to check <br>
whether the mail was sent to the user or to a mailing list.
Matching is anchored on the login name, so saying
&quot;ro*&quot; will match both root and rom. <br>
track Set to on (case insensitively), this turns on the -t
option which tracks all the rule matches and the actions on
standard output. This is optional (suggested: OFF). <br>
timezone The time zone value for environment variable TZ
(optional). <br>
tmpdir Directory for temporary files. Required (suggested:
/tmp). <br>
umask Default umask which is reset by mailagent before
processing a message. Assumed to be decimal unless starting
with &rsquo;0&rsquo; (for octal) or &rsquo;0x&rsquo; (for
hexadecimal). The octal <br>
format is the easiest way to specify it nonetheless.
(optional, defaults to: 077). <br>
user Login name of the user who runs mailagent. This sets
the value of the %u macro. <br>
vacation A flag set to ON or OFF to switch the vacation mode
accordingly. <br>
vacfile The name of the file to be sent back in vacation
mode (suggested: ~/.vacation). <br>
vacfixed When ON, all changes to the vacation file (even
locally) by means of the VACATION command are forbidden.
This is useful if you usually have many customized vacation
<br>
messages for different people but temporarily want to force
one unique message (optional, defaults to: OFF). <br>
vacperiod The minimum time elapsed between two vacation
messages to a given address (suggested: 1d).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Available Logging Levels <br>
The following log levels can be used while running
mailagent:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 No logging <br>
1 Major problems only <br>
2 Failed deliveries <br>
3 Successful deliveries <br>
4 Deferred messages <br>
5 Successful filter actions <br>
6 Unusual but benign incidents <br>
7 Informative messages <br>
8 Non-delivery filter actions <br>
9 Mail reception <br>
12 Debug <br>
19 Verbose <br>
20 Lot more verbose</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Plugging Mailagent <br>
Once you have configured mailagent in a ~/.mailagent (where
~ stands for your home directory), you must tell sendmail
how to invoke it. This is done by setting a ~/.forward file
<br>
which looks like this (leading and trailing double quotes
are a mandatory part of it):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;| exec
/users/ram/mail/filter &gt;&gt;/users/ram/.bak
2&gt;&amp;1&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will pipe all your mails to
the filter program, redirecting all unusual messages to
~/.bak. A sample filter shell script may be found in
Lib/mailagent, as well as a C filter <br>
program. On some systems, it may be necessary to move the
&rsquo;|&rsquo; character before the leading quote, but
don&rsquo;t try this unless you have no other choice (i.e.
only as a last resort). <br>
Also, apparently Exim takes exeption to the exec, and even
perhaps to the redirection -- which would be a pity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is very important to redirect
error messages to some file within your home directory. For
one thing, that will get you out of trouble if strange
things start to happen, but <br>
more to the point, it makes your .forward file unique. Older
sendmail program, in an heroic attempt to
&quot;optimize&quot; delivery, will silently remove
duplicate recipients, and if a <br>
recipient has a .forward, its literal content is used in
place of his e-mail address. Therefore, two local recipients
with the same filtering string will be considered as one
<br>
unique recipient and only one of them will get the
message...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your system does not allow
shell redirection from within the .forward, you can use this
instead (only supported by the C filter):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;| exec
/users/ram/mail/filter -o /users/ram/.bak&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which in effect redirects stdout
and stderr to the specified file for you, appending data at
the end of the file. If the filter runs setuid or setgid,
you will not be allowed to <br>
create the file, nor to append to it unless the owner of the
file is the real uid invoking the program (for security
reasons).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the .forward file only
pipes the mail to the filter program and does not leave any
copy in the mailbox. It is up to you to decide in the rule
file whether you want to <br>
trash the mail away or leave it in the mailbox.(Note that on
Debian systems mailagent can not lock the spool directory,
and letting it leave mail in mailbox may cause it to get
<br>
garbled). If you do not have a rule file (i.e. you left a
blank entry in your ~/.mailagent, or you named a
non-existent file, or your file is simply empty), the
default action <br>
is to leave the mail in the mailbox, which is not a good
idea for Debian machines. Please onstall a minimal rules
file in any case, <br>
{ SAVE incoming }; <br>
is the suggested minimal rules file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allowed Commands <br>
The allowed command file (as specified by the comfile
variable in your ~/.mailagent) contains all the recognized
and allowed commands. The file commands held in directory
<br>
Lib/mailagent should be copied as-is into your Spool
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Testing Your Installation <br>
Now, assuming you have set a proper ~/.mailagent file and
edited the configuration section of the filter, it is time
to test your installation. Make sure your .forward is world
<br>
readable and that the filter has the execution bits set
(there is no reason to make the filter world readable). Set
a log-level of 20 and disable vacation mode (the vacation
<br>
entry in the ~/.mailagent should be OFF). Set the name of
the rule file to an file containing a catch-all rule: <br>
{ SAVE incoming }; <br>
You are ready to proceed...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send yourself a mail and give
mailagent time to process your mail. The subject of the
message should be &rsquo;test&rsquo; (in fact, anything but
&rsquo;Command&rsquo;). You may want to run a &quot;tail -f
<br>
logfile&quot; to see what&rsquo;s happening. At the end of
the processing, the logfile should contain something like
the following (names of temporaries may -and will- of course
differ; <br>
timestamps have been removed):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">got the right to process mail

mailagent exits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not get that, there is
a problem somewhere. Start by looking at the ~/.bak file (or
whatever file the .forward uses to redirect output of the
filter). If you see some&acirc; <br>
thing like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FATAL no valid queue directory
<br>
DUMPED in ~/mbox.filter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then it means the queue
parameter in your ~/.mailagent does not point to a valid
directory. Your mail has been dumped in an emergency
mailbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ~/.bak file may also contain
error messages stating that perl was not found. In that
case, there should be an error message in the logfile:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERROR mailagent failed, [qm7886]
left in queue</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In that case, make sure the mail
has correctly been queued in a file qm7886. The queue will
be processed again when another mail arrives or when the
mailagent is invoked with -q <br>
(however, to avoid race conditions, only mails which have
remained for a while will be processed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Queuing of mail also happens
when another mailagent is running. If the logfile says:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">denied right to process mail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then remove the perl.lock file
in the Spool directory. Old lock files are automatically
discarded by the mailagent anyway (after one hour).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If none of these occurs, then
maybe sendmail did not process your ~/.forward at all or the
file has a syntax error. Check your mailbox, and if your
mail is in there, your .for&acirc; <br>
ward has not been processed. Otherwise, ask your system
administrator to check sendmail&rsquo;s logfile. A correct
entry would appear as (with leading timestamps and syslog
stamps <br>
removed):</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">message-id=&lt;9202041919.AA07882@york.eiffel.com&gt;
<br>
from=ram, size=395, class=0, received from local <br>
to=&quot;| /york/ram/mail/filter &gt;&gt;/york/ram/.bak
2&gt;&amp;1&quot;, delay=00:00:05, stat=Sent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you still cannot find why the
mail was not correctly processed, you should make sure you
normally receive mail by removing (or renaming) your
~/.forward and sending yourself <br>
another test mail. Also make sure your home directory is
world readable and &quot;executable&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are using the C filter,
make sure it is running on the right platform. There may be
a low-level routing of all your mail to a mailhost machine,
responsible for the final <br>
delivery, and the filter program will run on that machine,
which may be a different platform than the one you compiled
filter on. Also make sure your home directory is mounted
<br>
on that machine, or the mail transport agent will be unable
to locate your .forward file, less process it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This kind of centralized mail
delivery is good only when a few people have mail processing
hooks (i.e. .forward files piping mail to a program);
otherwise it&rsquo;s better to route <br>
mail to each user&rsquo;s workstation or machine, for local
processing, to avoid an excessive workload on the mailhost
machine, especially if it is a dedicated NFS server. If you
are a <br>
system administrator installing mailagent and expect many
people to use it, keep this in mind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
There is a limited set of options which may be used when
calling the mailagent directly. Only one special option at a
time may be specified. Invoking mailagent as mailqueue is
<br>
equivalent to using the -l option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c file Specify an alternate
configuration file (~ substitution occurs). The default is
~/.mailagent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d The mailagent parses the rule
file, compiles the rules and dumps them on the standard
output. This option is mainly used to check the syntax of
the rule file and <br>
make sure the rules are what the user really thinks they
are.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e rule This option lets you
specify some rules on the command line, which will override
those specified via the ~/.mailagent, if any. There may be
as many -e as neces&acirc; <br>
sary, all the rules being concatenated together as one happy
array, which is then parsed the same way a rule file is. If
only one rule is given and there is no <br>
action specified between {...} braces, then the whole line
is enclosed between braces. Hence saying -e &rsquo;SAVE
foo&rsquo; will be understood as -e &rsquo;{SAVE
foo}&rsquo;, which will <br>
always match and be executed. Using the -d option in
conjunction with this one is a convenient way to debug a set
of rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f mailfile Using mailfile as a
UNIX-style mailbox (i.e. one where each mail is preceded by
a special From line stating the sender and the date the
message was issued), <br>
extract all its messages into the queue and process them as
if they were freshly arrived from the mail delivery
subsystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Force processing on already
seen messages. Usually, mailagent enters the special _SEEN_
state when it detects an X-Filter: line issued by itself,
but this option <br>
will have it continue as usual (although vacation messages
are disabled). Use this option when post-processing mail
already filtered. Also look at the -U switch if <br>
you are using the RECORD or UNIQUE actions in some
rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print out a usage message on
the standard error and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Interactive mode, directs
mailagent to print a copy of all the log messages on
stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Install a ~/.mailagent file
from template, or merge new configuration variables into an
existing file; then perform sanity checks and create
mandatory files or <br>
directories. This option may be viewed as an help into
setting up mailagent&rsquo;s environment. In any case, the
created/merged ~/.mailagent file should be manually <br>
verified before letting mailagent deal with your mail by
hooking it into ~/.forward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l List the mailagent queue.
Recently queued mails which are waited for by the filter are
skipped for about half an hour, to avoid race conditions.
This may be con&acirc; <br>
figured via the queuehold variable. Really old messages
(more than queuelost seconds old) are flagged with a
&rsquo;#&rsquo; character. Messages out of the queue (queue
vari&acirc; <br>
able) are flagged with a &rsquo;*&rsquo;, whilst old
messages out of the queue are signaled by an
&rsquo;@&rsquo;. Locked messages have a &rsquo;*&rsquo;
appended to their status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L level Override the log level
specified in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o override This option lets you
override a specific configuration option. The option must be
followed by a valid configuration line, which will be parsed
after the configura&acirc; <br>
tion file itself. For instance, the -L 4 option is
completely equivalent to -o &rsquo;level: 4&rsquo;. Note
that any white space must be protected against shell
interpretation <br>
by using the appropriate quoting mechanism. There may be as
many -o options on the command line as necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Force processing of
mailagent&rsquo;s queue. Only the mails not tagged as
skipped by the -l option will be processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r file Specify an alternate
rule file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s {umaryt} Build a summary of
all the statistics gathered so far. The output can be
controlled by appending one or more letters from the set
{umaryt}. Using -summary is a <br>
convenient way to get the whole history of the filter
actions. The u modifier will print only used rules. The m
will merge all the statistics at the end while a <br>
reports the mode the filter was in when the command was
executed. The r asks for rule-based statistics and the y is
pretty useless and is here only to get a nice <br>
mnemonic option. Note that specifying an option more than
once has no effect whatsoever on the option itself (i.e. you
may put three Uu and only one m, but you&rsquo;ll <br>
still get the summary!). The t letter may be followed by
digits specifying how many rule file versions relative to
the topmost (most recent) rule file we should <br>
extract from the statistics, that amount defaulting to 1:
using -surat will print a complete statistics report for the
last version of your rules, while -surt12a <br>
would do the same for the last twelve versions of those same
rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Put mailagent in a special
tracking mode where all the rule matches and executed
actions are printed on the standard output. This is mostly
useful for debugging a <br>
rule file. See also the track parameter in the configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print version number and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Prevent the UNIQUE and RECORD
commands from rejecting an already processed Message-ID the
first time they are run on a given message. This is useful
when process&acirc; <br>
ing messages that have been dropped in the emergdir
directory due to some abnormal (but transient) condition and
you wish to reprocess the message. Also see the -F <br>
switch if you are re-processing messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you invoke mailagent without
options and without any arguments, the program waits for a
mail on its standard input. If an argument is provided, it
is the name of a file hold&acirc; <br>
ing one mail to be processed. This is the normal calling
procedure from the filter, the argument being the location
of the queued mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING THE DEFAULT RULES <br>
If you do not want to use the filtering feature of
mailagent, (NOTE: This may cause mail to be garbled on
Debian systems, since mailagent can not lock the spol
directory under <br>
Debian policy restrictions) then the default built-in rules
will be used. Those are really simple: all the mails are
left in your mailbox and mails with a line &quot;Subject:
Com&acirc; <br>
mand&quot; anywhere in the message will be processed.
Commands are looked for on lines starting with
&quot;@SH&quot;. The remaining of the line is then given to
a shell for execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Available commands are read from
a file (entry comfile in your configuration file), one
command name per line. Only those listed there will be
executed, others will produce an <br>
error message. The mailagent traps the exit status and will
send an error report if a command fails (provided that the
command does not issue a message by itself, in which case
<br>
it should return a zero exit status).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not want to use the
default rules, you may skip the remaining of this
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuring Help <br>
The help text mailagent will send to people must be copied
from Lib/mailagent/agenthelp into your own spool directory,
as specified in your ~/.mailagent. Two macros may be
used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=DEST= This will be expanded to
the sender&rsquo;s address (the one who sent you the mail
currently processed by mailagent).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=MAXSIZE= This stands for the
maximum size set before kit is used to send files back
(parameter maxsize in your ~/.mailagent file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may use the default help
file or design one that will give even more details to the
poor user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Distribution Files <br>
The two files proglist and distribs held in Lib/mailagent
describe the distributions your mailagent will be able to
distribute. The samples given show the expected syntax. In
<br>
order to clarify things, here is what the format should
be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File proglist contains a small
description for programs. The name of the program appears
after a single star. It is followed by lines in free format.
An optional three-dashes <br>
line separates each program&rsquo;s description. Note that a
leading tab will be added to each line of description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The distribs file holds lines of
the following form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">progname version path archived
compressed patches</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">progname is the program name
(the same as the one mentioned in proglist).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version is the current version
number. If none, a three-dashed line may be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path is the path where the
distribution is stored. The ~ will be expanded into your
home directory. Note that if the distribution is stored in
archived form, the path name <br>
is the one of the archive without the ending extension
(which may be .cpio.Z or .tar.Z).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archived is either y or n
depending on whether the distribution is archived or
not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compressed <br>
is either y or n depending on whether the distribution is
compressed or not. This could be guessed from the
extension&rsquo;s name, but we must think of file systems
with <br>
short names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">patches is y or n depending on
whether the distribution is maintained or not by you. If you
put a p, this means official patches are available, although
you do not maintain the <br>
distribution. Finally, an o means that this is an old
version, where only patches are available, but maildist will
not work. In that case, assuming the version number <br>
is 1.0, old patches are expected in a bugs-1.0
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may include comments in both
files: all lines starting with a leading # will be
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Testing Your Mail Agent <br>
It is now time to make sure your mailagent works. Send
yourself the following mail:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subject: Command <br>
@SH mailhelp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should receive back a mail
from yourself with the subject set to: &quot;How to use my
mailagent&quot;. If you don&rsquo;t, check the file ~/.bak
(or whatever file you set in your .forward). <br>
If it is empty, look at the log file. If the log file is not
empty, then perhaps the mail has been queued. Check the
sendmail queue. Also make sure that you removed the
&rsquo;#&rsquo; com&acirc; <br>
ments in the filter script. On some systems, they cause some
trouble. If you are using the C filter, maybe your sendmail
is broken and you need to make your own setuid copy (or <br>
perl might complain that you have a kernel bug, etc...).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have done everything
right but it still does not work properly, increase log
level to 20 and resend your command mail. Then check the log
file. The diagnosis should be <br>
easier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once this works, you should
check your distribs and proglist files by sending yourself
the following mail:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subject: Command <br>
@SH maillist</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the list you have in return
is incorrect, then your distribution files are wrongly
written. If you do not get the list, there is a problem with
your mailagent&rsquo;s configuration. <br>
Retry with a log level set to 20 and look at the issued log
messages in your Log directory. Make sure that the file
listed in the plsave entry of your ~/.mailagent is correctly
<br>
updated after a maillist has been run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING THE FILTER <br>
The mailagent can also be used as a filter: mail is parsed
and some actions are taken based on simple lex-like rules.
Actions range from a simple saving in a folder, a forwarding
<br>
to another person, or even spawning of a shell command.
Before going further, here is a small example of a valid
rule file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From: root { FORWARD postmaster
}; <br>
To: gue@eiffel.fr { POST mail.gue }; <br>
Subject: /metaconfig/ { SAVE dist }; <br>
{ SAVE incoming };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are three distinct rules.
Rules are applied in sequence, until one matches (so the
order is important). Any mail coming from root will be
forwarded to user postmaster. A <br>
mail addressed to gue@eiffel.fr is a mail coming from a
mailing list. The mail is posted on a local newsgroup
mail.gue. Mails whose subject contains the word
&quot;metaconfig&quot; will be <br>
saved in a folder dist for delayed reading and will not
appear in the main mailbox. If no rule matched, the mail is
left in the folder incoming.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rule File Syntax <br>
Here is a non-formal description of the rule file. Parsing
of the file is done lexically, hence the choice of
non-ambiguous tokens like &rsquo;{&rsquo; or &rsquo;;&rsquo;
which are easily parsed. This <br>
introduces some limitations which are silently applied: for
instance, no &rsquo;{&rsquo; may be used as part of an
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comments are introduced by a
leading &rsquo;#&rsquo; , which must be on the left margin.
Unlike shell comments, a &rsquo;#&rsquo; which is not left
justified will not be understood as a comment. How&acirc;
<br>
ever, spaces or tabs are allowed in front of
&rsquo;#&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the statements in the rule
file must end with a &rsquo;;&rsquo;. There are mainly four
parts in each line. A list of comma separated modes, between
&rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; and &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo;, which give the
set of <br>
modes in which the rule applies. The special mode ALL will
match everything. The filter begins in the mode INITIAL.
Omitting the mode defaults to &quot;&lt;ALL&gt;&quot;. It is
possible to guard <br>
a rule against some specific mode by negating it, which is
done by prefixing the mode with &rsquo;!&rsquo;. Negated
modes take precedence other plain modes, meaning
&quot;&lt;!ALL&gt;&quot; will never be <br>
matched, ever, and that &quot;&lt;MODE, !MODE&gt;&quot; is
equivalent to &quot;&lt;!MODE&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then comes a list of selectors.
Those selectors must be space separated and end with
&rsquo;:&rsquo;. They represent the names of header fields
which must be looked at by the forthcoming <br>
pattern. An empty selector list defaults to
&quot;Subject:&quot;. Special selectors &quot;All:&quot;,
&quot;Body:&quot; and &quot;Head:&quot; apply to the whole
message, its body or its header. A commonly used
selec&acirc; <br>
tor list is &quot;To Cc:&quot; which tests the recipient
fields of the header. If the selector name is preceded by an
exclamation mark &rsquo;!&rsquo;, then the logical value of
the test for that <br>
selector is negated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list of selectors may end
with an optional range specification, given as &lt;min,
max&gt;, before the final &rsquo;:&rsquo; character marking
the end of the selector list. The minimum or the <br>
maximum may be given as &rsquo;-&rsquo;, in which case it is
replaced with the minimal or maximal possible value. Indices
for selection begin at 1 (not 0), for instance: &lt;3,
7&gt;. If no range <br>
selection is given, then the default &lt;1, -&gt; is used.
Ranges normally select lines within the matching buffer,
unless the selector is expecting a list in which case it
operates on <br>
the list items. For instance, Body &lt;3, 5&gt;: would
select lines #3 to #5 (included) from the mail body, whereas
To Cc &lt;1,3&gt;: would focus on the first three addresses
on each To: or <br>
Cc: header lines. Negative values refer to that many lines
or addresses back from the end, i.e. Cc &lt;-2,-&gt;:
selects the last two addresses on the Cc: line. A single
number such <br>
as &lt;2&gt; is understood as &lt;2, 2&gt;, i.e. it select
only one item in the list, &lt;-&gt; meaning everything (and
being therefore redundant).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The selector is then followed by
a pattern within &rsquo;/&rsquo; or by a single name. In
order to ease the writing of the rules, the semantic of a
single name varies depending on the <br>
selector used. For the special selectors &quot;From:&quot;,
&quot;To:&quot;, &quot;Cc:&quot;, &quot;Sender:&quot;, their
associated &quot;Resent-&quot; fields,
&quot;Reply-To:&quot;, &quot;Envelope:&quot; and
&quot;Apparently-To:&quot;, a single name is <br>
understood as a match on the login name of the address. Note
that if no &quot;To:&quot; field is present in the header,
one will be forged from the &quot;Apparently-To:&quot; for
the purpose of fil&acirc; <br>
tering only (i.e. no physical modification on the header is
done). If the login name of the address is a full name of
the form First.Last, only the last name is kept, and is <br>
lower-cased. If only a single name is given, only shell
metacharacters * and ? are allowed, as well as intervals
[].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the pattern is preceded by a
single exclamation mark &rsquo;!&rsquo;, then the matching
status is negated (i.e. it will succeed if the pattern is
not found). If a single word is used for <br>
non-special selectors, the same rules apply but the pattern
is anchored at the beginning and the end for an exact match.
With a pattern starting with &rsquo;/&rsquo;, any regular
expression <br>
understood by perl may be used and your pattern will not be
modified in any way. The other special selector
&quot;Newsgroups:&quot; works as &quot;To:&quot;, excepted
that newsgroups names are <br>
expected and a match is attempted on every item in the list.
Every pattern match on a single name for an address-type
field (i.e. &quot;Newsgroups:&quot; excluded), are made in
case-insen&acirc; <br>
sitive mode. Otherwise, you can force a case-insensitive
match by appending a trailing i option, as in
/pattern/i.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also a little magic
involved when matching on an address field. Namely, if the
pattern is not a single word and is anchored at the
beginning, then only the address part <br>
of the field will be kept. For instance, if we have a From:
field whose value is Raphael Manfredi
&lt;ram@eiffel.com&gt;, then the pattern /Raphael/ would
match, but not /^Raphael/. <br>
Instead, /^ram@.*$/ would match, but this is more easily
done with a single word pattern ram, for it only focuses on
the login name of the address and would also match if the
<br>
address was written as eiffel.com!ram. A single address in
Internet form, as in ram@eiffel.com is implicitely matching
on the address part of the field, and you must not escape
<br>
the &rsquo;.&rsquo; as you would have to in a regular
expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This may sound a little complex,
but this design is meant to make things easier for the user.
Here are some other examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Match ram@eiffel.com as well
as ram@educ.emse.fr. <br>
From: ram</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Match root@eiffel.com, ram but
not ribbon@eiffel.com <br>
From: r[oa]*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Match gue@eiffel.fr but not
algue@eiffel.fr <br>
To Cc: /^gue@eiffel.fr/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># This will match gue@eiffel.fr
as well as algue@eiffel.com <br>
To Cc: /gue@eiffel/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Match comp.lang.perl but not
comp.lang.perl.poetry (?) <br>
Newsgroups: comp.lang.perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Accept anything but messages
coming from root <br>
From: !root</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When attempting a match on
&quot;To:&quot;, &quot;Cc:&quot; or
&quot;Apparently-To:&quot;, a list of addresses separated by
a comma is expected, whereas only one address is expected
after &quot;From:&quot;. If you omit <br>
the pattern, it will be understood as * (recall that a
single word uses shell meta-characters), which will match
anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then comes the action to be
taken when a match occurs. There are only a limited set of
valid actions which will be described soon in detail. The
action is enclosed in curly <br>
braces &rsquo;{&rsquo; and &rsquo;}&rsquo; and actions are
separated or terminated (depending on your taste) by a
&rsquo;;&rsquo;. Action names are spelled in upper-case for
readability, but case is irrelevant. If <br>
you want to put a &rsquo;;&rsquo; within the rule, it must
be escaped by preceding it with a backslash. A double
backslash is translated into a single one, and any other
escape sequence <br>
involving the backslash character is ignored (i.e. would be
kept verbatim).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that a rule should be ended
by a single &rsquo;;&rsquo; after the last &rsquo;}&rsquo;.
It is possible to omit this final &rsquo;;&rsquo;, but that
single token is the re-synchronizing point for error
recov&acirc; <br>
ery. One could argue however that there should be no syntax
error, and thus the &rsquo;;&rsquo; ought to be safely
omitted. Whenever in doubt, check your rule file with the -d
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a prototypical rule
(using perl regular expressions; please refer to the
subsection Regular Expressions for more information):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;ROOT&gt; From: /^720</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That rule will only be taken
into account when the filter is in the mode ROOT (recall
that the processing starts in mode INITIAL; use BEGIN to
change the mode, as in lex). So in <br>
mode ROOT, anything which comes from a user located in the
eiffel.com site is saved in folder eiffel for deferred
reading. The mail will not appear in the mailbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to have more than
one selection for a rule. Identical selectors are logically
or&rsquo;ed while different ones are and&rsquo;ed. The
selections are comma separated. For <br>
instance, { D E eL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From: root, To: ram, From: ram,
Subject: /sE T E } ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will delete a mail from root or
ram if it is sent to ram and has the word test in its
subject. It is also possible to write the previous rule as:
{ D E eL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From: root, ram, To: ram,
Subject: /sE T E } ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">because if no selector is given,
the previous one is used (with the first selector being
&quot;Subject:&quot; by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anywhere in the rule file, it is
possible to define some variables. The list of recognized
variables is given later. For now, let&rsquo;s say that
maildir is the default folder direc&acirc; <br>
tory. This variable is used by the SAVE command when the
argument is not an absolute path. Setting</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maildir = ~/mail;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will direct the filter to use
~/mail as the folder directory (default is ~/Mail). Note the
~ substitution and the final &rsquo;;&rsquo;. It is not
possible (currently) to modify the environ&acirc; <br>
ment by setting PATH for instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, there is a special
construct to load patterns from a file. A pattern enclosed
in double quotes means that the patterns to be applied
should be taken from the specified <br>
file. The file is expected to be in the directory mailfilter
if it is not an absolute path (~ substitution occurs). If
the variable is not set maildir will be used. If by chance
<br>
(!) maildir is not set either, the home directory is used.
The file should contain one pattern per line, shell comments
(#) being allowed at the beginning of each line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An action may be followed by
other rules. Hence the following is perfectly valid:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From: <br>
ram { SAVE ram } <br>
/plc/i { SAVE plc } <br>
root { SAVE ~/admin } <br>
/xyz/ { DELETE } <br>
&quot;users&quot; { LEAVE } <br>
;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note the use of the file
inclusion: all the users listed in file users will have
their mail left in the system mailbox. The usual rules apply
for these loaded patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selector Combination <br>
A single rule may have a various set of selectors. For
instance, in the following rule:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From: ram, To Cc: root,
!Subject: /test/, From: raphael</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">we have the following set {
From, To Cc, !Subject }. The first two selectors are called
direct selectors, !Subject: is called a negated selector.
The To Cc: selector is a group <br>
selector decomposing into two direct selectors, while From:
is an atomic selector. Finally, From: is also a selector
with multiple occurrences. The value of a selector is its
<br>
matching status logical value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Let D be the set of direct
selectors and N the set of negated selectors, which form a
partition of R, the set of all the selectors in the rule.
That is to say, R is the union of <br>
D and N, and D intersected with N is the empty set (trivial
proof: a selector is either direct or negated). If either D
or N is empty, then it&rsquo;s not a partition but in that
case <br>
we have either D = R or else N = R.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Let&rsquo;s define the logical
value of a set S as being the logical value the filter would
return if those rules were actually written. Then the
logical value of D is the logical <br>
value of each of its item with the AND logical operator
distributed among them, i.e. the logical value of { a, b, c
} is the value of (a AND b AND c). Let&rsquo;s write it
AND(D). The <br>
logical value of each of the items is the logical value of
the selector itself if it is not multiple, or it is the
logical value of all the occurrences of the multiple
selector <br>
within the rule, with the logical OR operation distributed
among them. That is to say, in the above example, the value
of From is true iff the From: fields contains ram OR <br>
raphael. Let&rsquo;s write that OR[From].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To be sound, we have to apply De
Morgan&rsquo;s Law on N, hence the following rules: the
logical value of N is OR(N) and given a negated selector s,
its logical value is AND[s]. And <br>
finally, the logical value of R is that of D AND N, with by
convention having the logical value of the empty set be
true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For those who do not know De
Morgan&rsquo;s Law, here it is: given two logical
propositions p and q, then the following identities
occur:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOT (p AND q) &lt;=&gt; (NOT p)
OR (NOT q) <br>
NOT (p OR q) &lt;=&gt; (NOT p) AND (NOT q)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While we are in the logic of the
propositions, note also that OR and AND are mutually
distributive, that is to say, given three logical
propositions p, q and r, we have:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p AND (q OR r) &lt;=&gt; (p AND
q) OR (p AND r) <br>
p OR (q AND r) &lt;=&gt; (p OR q) AND (p OR r)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To be complete, OR and AND are
associative with themselves and commutative. And the B set {
0, 1 } equipped with the set of operations (NOT, OR, AND) is
an algebra (a Boolean <br>
one). I will spare you the definition of an algebra, which
really has nothing to do in this manual page (which is for a
mail agent, in case you don&rsquo;t remember :-).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The attentive reader will
certainly have noted that I have not specified the logical
value of a group selector. Well, given a group selector G,
we decompose it into a DG and NG <br>
partition, DG being the subset of (atomic) direct selectors
of G and NG being the subset of (atomic) negated selectors.
Then the logical value of DG is OR(DG) and the logical <br>
value of NG is AND(NG); the global logical value of G being
that of DG OR NG. In case either DG or NG is empty, then we
don&rsquo;t have a partition, but by convention the value of
<br>
the empty set is false, and one of the sets is equal to G.
Note that within a group selector, the rules are exactly the
dual of the rules within R.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now the only rule which is not
logical is whether a group selector belongs to D or N.
I&rsquo;ve chosen, for analogy reasons, to make the group
selector belong to D if it does not <br>
start by &rsquo;!&rsquo; and to N otherwise. That is, !To
Cc: belongs to N whilst Cc !To: belongs to D. Apart from
that, order within the group selector is irrelevant: To Cc:
is equivalent <br>
to Cc To:, so the behavior in the quotient set is sound.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are some examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Match anything: (not from ram
OR not from root) is always true. <br>
From: !ram, !root</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Match anything but reject
mails coming from ram OR root <br>
!From: ram, root</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Reject mails whose headers
matching /^Re.*/ contain the word test e <br>
!^Re.*: /s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Keep mails whose subject
contains test AND host <br>
!Subject: !/test/, !/host/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Matches if ram is listed in
the To OR the Cc line <br>
To Cc: ram</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimal Header <br>
A minimal set of selectors are guaranteed to be set,
regardless of the actual header of the message. This is for
the purpose of filtering only, no physical alteration is
per&acirc; <br>
formed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Envelope: This is the address
found in the mail envelope, i.e. the address where the mail
seems to originate from. This can be different from the
From: address field if the mail <br>
originates from a trusted user, in sendmail&rsquo;s
terminology. If you don&rsquo;t know what that is, simply
ignore it. <br>
From: User who wrote the mail. If this line is missing, uses
the address found in the first From line. <br>
Length: The physical length of the body, in bytes, once
content-transfer-encoding (if any) has been removed. <br>
Lines: The amount of lines in the body (decoded, if
necessary). <br>
To: The main recipient(s) of the message. If this line is
missing but a set of Apparently-To: lines is found, then
those addresses are used instead. If no such line exists,
<br>
then assume the mail was directed to the user (which seems a
reasonable assumption :-). <br>
Sender: User who sent the mail. This may differ from the
From: line. If no such field exists, then the address in the
first From line is used (mail envelope). <br>
Relayed: This computed header is a comma-separated list of
all the hosts where the message was relayed, in the proper
transmission order. Each item in this list can be a machine
<br>
name such as mail.hp.com or an IP address such as
[15.125.38.12]. The list is derived from the Received: lines
present in the message. <br>
Reply-To: Where any reply should be sent. If no Reply-To:
field is present, then the Return-Path is used (with
&lt;&gt; stripped out), or the From: line is parsed to
extract the e-mail <br>
address of the author.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variables <br>
The mailagent supports user-defined variables, which are
globals. They are set via the ASSIGN command and referred to
with the %# macro. Assuming we set a variable host, then
<br>
%#host would be replaced by the actual value of the
variable. This enables some variable propagation across the
rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, let&rsquo;s say the
user receives cron outputs from various machines and wishes
to save them on a per-machine basis, differentiating between
daily outputs and weekly ones. <br>
Here is a solution:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subject: /output for host (816
<br>
Subject: /^Daily output/ { SAVE %#host/daily.%D }; <br>
Subject: /^Weekly output/ { SAVE %#host/weekly.%m-%d };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Besides variable interpolation
via the %# escape, it is also possible to perform
substitutions and translations on the content of a variable
(or a back-reference, i.e. a number <br>
between 1 and 99). The two commands SUBST and TR will
respectively perform in-place substitutions and
translations. In that case however, the name of the variable
must be pre&acirc; <br>
ceded by a single #. This differentiates the back-reference
1 from the variable #1, although 1 is a funny name for a
variable. The need for # also prevents the common mistake of
<br>
writing %#, as mailagent will loudly complain if the first
parameter of SUBST or TR is not a digit between 1 and 99 or
does not start with a #.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are some actions to
canonicalize the host name into lower case and strip down
the domain name, if any:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ TR #host /A-Z/a-z/; SUBST
#host /^([^.]*)..*/$1/ };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Those actions are directly
translated into their perl equivalent, and any error in the
specification of the regular expression will be
reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the variable name begins with
a colon &rsquo;:&rsquo;, then the variable is made
persistent. That is to say it will keep its value across
different mailagent invocations. The variable is <br>
simply stored (with the leading &rsquo;:&rsquo; removed) in
mailagent&rsquo;s database and is thus subject to the aging
policy set up in the ~/.mailagent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Within PERL commands or mail
hooks using perl (see the MAIL HOOKS section), you can
manipulate those (so-called) external variables via a set of
interface functions located in <br>
the extern package (i.e. you must prefix each of the
function name with its package name, set becoming
extern&rsquo;set). The following three interface functions
are provided:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">val(name) Return the value of
the variable name (the leading &rsquo;:&rsquo; is not part
of the name, in any of these three interface functions).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set(name, value) <br>
Set the external variable name to hold value. No
interpretation is done by the function on the actual content
of the value you are providing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">age(name) Returns the age of the
variable, i.e. the elapsed time in seconds since the last
modification made by set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is currently no way for
erasing a variable from the database. But if you do not use
the variable any more, it will be removed when its age
becomes greater than the maximum <br>
age specified by the agemax configuration variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regular Expressions <br>
All the regular expressions follow the V8 syntax, as in
perl, with all the perl extensions. If a bracketing
construct (...) is used inside a rule, then the %digit macro
matches <br>
the digit&rsquo;s substring held inside the bracket. All
those back-references are memorized on a per-rule basis,
numbered from left to right. However, great care must be
taken when <br>
using a back-reference in multiply present selectors, as all
the matches will be performed up-to the first match, and
back-references are computed on the fly while doing pattern
<br>
matching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To: /(.*)/, Subject: /Output
from (744</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will save the To: field in
variable &rsquo;to&rsquo; and save the mail in a folder
derived from the host name specified in the subject.
However, if we say:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subject: /host (336</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then there will be only one
back-reference set, and it will come from the first pattern
matching if it succeeds, or from the second. Should the
second or the first pattern have <br>
no bracketing construct and still match, then the
back-reference would not be recorded at all, which means the
following is probably not what you want:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subject: /from/, /host (840</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">as if the /from/ pattern matches
then /host (3000 <br>
/host (1008</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, this behavior can be
used to selectively store a news article which has been
mailed to you in a folder whose name is the newsgroup name
in dot form. Assuming we want to <br>
give priority to comp.lang.perl, we could say:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Newsgroups: <br>
/(comp.lang.perl)/, <br>
/(comp.mail.mh)/, <br>
/(comp.compilers)/, <br>
/([^,]*)/ { SAVE %1 };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An article cross-posted to both
comp.lang.perl and comp.mail.mh would be saved in a
comp.lang.perl folder, since this is what would match first.
The last rules takes care of <br>
other articles: the folder used being whatever newsgroup
appears first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also a special macro
%&amp;, which lists (it&rsquo;s a comma separated list) all
the selectors specified via a regular expression which
indeed matched. For instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Re.*: /york/ { ASSIGN which
&rsquo;%&amp;&rsquo; };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would assign to which the list
of all the fields matching the /Re.*/ pattern which
contained &rsquo;york&rsquo;, be it a Received: field or a
Resent-From: field (as both match the selector <br>
specification). Assuming both those fields contained the
word york, the value of %&amp; would be
&rsquo;Received,Resent-From;&rsquo; (the fields are
alphabetically sorted).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Should you have more than one
such specified selector within a single rule, then it might
be worth knowing that all the set of matching selectors are
recorded within %&amp;, each set <br>
terminated with a &rsquo;;&rsquo;. If a negated selector is
used, then %&amp; will record all the fields which did not
contain the pattern, assuming the selection succeeded
(otherwise nothing is <br>
recorded).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Available Actions <br>
The following actions are available as filtering commands.
Case is irrelevant although the recommended style is to
spell them upper-cased. As explained later, most of the
actions <br>
record their exit status in a special variable which may be
tested via the -t and -f options of ABORT, REJECT and
RESTART. For every command returning such an exit status,
the <br>
failure or success conditions are given at the end of each
description. If nothing is specified, then the command does
not return a meaningful status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ABORT [-tf] [mode] <br>
Abort application of filtering rules immediately. See REJECT
for the meaning of the optional parameters. (Does not modify
existing status)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AFTER [-sanc] (time) action <br>
Records a callback for after the specified time, where
action will be performed. By default, a mailagent filtering
action is assumed (-a option), on the current mail <br>
message. A shell command (-c) may be given instead,
receiving the current mail message as standard input.
Finally, a plain shell command may be run (with no input)
<br>
using the -s option. The option -n may be used when the
current mail message does not need to be kept for input. For
instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AFTER -an (1 day) DO
~/process:proc&rsquo;run(%u)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would call proc&rsquo;run
defined in the ~/process file in one day from now, without
giving any input (the action here does not require any).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running mailagent commands,
the initial working mode is set to _CALLOUT_. This may
matter if you call APPLY for instance. If the recorded time
is less or equal <br>
than the current time (which is now), the callback will
occur when mailagent is done with the messages in its queue,
before exiting. This allows for the following cute <br>
trick, found out by Randal Schwartz:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AFTER (now) # fork a copy I can
mangle <br>
STRIP Reply-To ; RESYNC ; <br>
ANNOTATE -du Reply-To %2 ; RESYNC ; <br>
NOTIFY message %r ; DELETE ; <br>
;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the command is not
called AT because the call will only be performed at the
next mailagent invocation after the specified time has
elapsed. Dates are speci&acirc; <br>
fied using the same format as in SELECT. (Fails if the
action cannot be recorded in the callout queue).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ANNOTATE [-du] field value <br>
Annotate message by adding field into the mail header, with
the supplied value. This is like the MH command anno, but
the annotation is performed at the end of the <br>
header, whereas MH does it at the top. Normally, an extra
field is added, with the current date as field value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be suppressed by using
the -d option. If value is omitted, only the date field is
generated (hence it is an error to use the -d option without
supplying a <br>
value). As with all the commands which alter the header, a
RESYNC is necessary for the filter part to actually see the
new header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -u option means
&quot;unique&quot;, and prevents ANNOTATE from executing if
the specified field is already present in the header.
Don&rsquo;t forget to RESYNC between successive <br>
ANNOTATE commands using this option if the field refers to a
previous ANNOTATE target. (Fails when no annotation takes
place)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLY rulefile <br>
Get the rules held in rulefile and apply them to the current
message. The filter will begin in whatever mode you were
when using this command, but no feed back will <br>
occur, i.e. any mode changing will be lost when returning
from the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variables (see the %# macro) are
propagated back and forth through APPLY, meaning you see
variables set by the caller, and you may change their values
or create new <br>
variables for the caller to later use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If mail is saved during the
application of the rules, then the corresponding flag is set
in the main filter (the one that started the APPLY command).
You may nest them, <br>
of course. (Fails if mail is not saved by the rules held in
rulefile)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASSIGN var value <br>
Assign the value to the user-defined variable var, which may
further be accessed as &rsquo;%#var&rsquo; for macro
substitution or #var in the TR and SUBST commands in place
of the <br>
variable name. Note that there is no leading # in front of
the variable name. The value you provide is first ran
through perl to see if it contains some arithmetic <br>
operations. If the evaluation is successful, the resulting
value is used instead. If an error occurs in this evaluation
process, then the literal value provided is <br>
used. To avoid the evaluation, you may enclose the whole
value in simple quotes. Those will be trimmed before the
assignment takes place. If you actually want simple <br>
quotes in the first AND last position, you have to double
each of them. (Does not modify existing status)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BACK command <br>
Execute command and take its output as new actions to be
performed on the mail (hence performing something analogous
to &lsquo;command&lsquo; in shell). If there is no output,
<br>
nothing is done. BACK commands can be nested, although this
may lead to surprises this manpage will not disclose (but I
assure you it will be funny, assuming we have <br>
the same sense of humor... :-). Note that both the standard
output and the standard error from the command are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the command fails, the output
is mailed back to the user and no action is performed.
Furthermore, normal feedback does not occur here: any output
from the command is <br>
taken as filter actions, which means the semantics of PASS,
for instance, is changed: we do not take a body back but
commands. (The execution status is that of the <br>
command)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEEP [-l] count <br>
This command may be used to tune the amount of beeps emitted
when biffing on the terminal, for each %a expansion. By
default, that amount is set to 1. Using the -l <br>
option alters the beep count locally for the rule.
Otherwise, the default amount is changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this simply expands %a
into the suitable amount of Ctrl-G characters. Your terminal
must be allowed to issue consecutive bells for this to work.
Very often, <br>
terminals are configured so that the first bell received
disables further beeps for some period, to avoid cascades of
bells. If you use xterm for instance, you should <br>
use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xterm -xrm
&quot;XTerm*BellSuppressTime: 0&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to enable consecutive bells.
Otherwise, xterm will swallow them during 200 ms, hence
making the BEEP command ineffective, apparently. (Does not
modify existing status)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEGIN [-ft] state <br>
Enter a new state. An explicit REJECT or RESTART is
necessary to abort the processing of the current rule. The
processing begins in the state INITIAL. If the -f (resp.
<br>
-t) flag is specified, then the state change only occurs if
the last command status indicated a failure (resp. a
success). A state name can contain alphanumeric char&acirc;
<br>
acters and underscores. (Does not modify existing
status)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BIFF [-l] on|off|path <br>
Allow or disallow biffing dynamically. When biffing is
turned on via the configuration file or via this command, a
message is printed on some of the terminals where the <br>
user is logged when mail is received, as explained under the
section MAIL BIFFING.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of on or off, you can
specify a file name (~ substitution allowed) being the new
path to be used for the biffing format template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use the -l option,
changes are made locally, for the duration of the rule only.
If you REJECT to go to some other rule, your changes will be
lost. The global <br>
value of the altered parameters is changed on the first
local usage and restored when a new rule is entered. (Does
not alter execution status)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BOUNCE address(es) <br>
Bounce the message to the specified address(es) and acts as
if a save had been done. The only difference with FORWARD is
that no Resent-like lines are added to the <br>
header. If an address is specified in double quotes, it is
taken as the name of a file to be loaded to get addresses
(one address per line, shell comments (#) allowed). <br>
The file name resolving is the same as the one used for
pattern loading. (Fails if mail cannot be resent)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DO routine [(arg1, arg2, ... ,
argn)] <br>
Calls the perl routine, with the supplied arguments if any.
This is a very low level hook into mailagent&rsquo;s
internal. The routine can be specified by itself
(pack&acirc; <br>
age&rsquo;name, package being main by default), or
identified by a leading tag, followed by a &rsquo;:&rsquo;,
then the routine name as before. The tag can be a path to a
file where the <br>
routine is defined, or a command name (for user-defined
commands which are loaded dynamically). For instance</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DO
UNKIT:newcmd&rsquo;unkit(&rsquo;true&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would lookup the user-defined
UNKIT command, load the file where it is defined (in the
newcmd package), then call the routine with
&rsquo;true&rsquo; as argument. The package <br>
specified determines where the loading is done, so be sure
it is consistent with the definition in the file where the
routine is defined. (Fails if the routine cannot <br>
be located and executed)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DELETE Delete the current
message. Actually, this does not do anything, it just marks
the mail as saved. If no further action involving saving is
done, then the mail will <br>
never show up in the mailbox. (Never fails)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FEED [-be] program <br>
Feed the whole message to a program and get the output back
as the new message. Hence the program appears as a filter
for the whole message. It does not tag the mes&acirc; <br>
sage as having been saved. A RESYNC is automatically done
upon return. (Returns the status of program)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: Your program must be
able to properly parse a MIME message and must deal with
transfer-encoded bodies by itself. To make the program task
simpler, you can <br>
supply the -b switch which will let mailagent decode the
whole body for you, suppressing any
Content-Transfer-Encoding header (implying
&quot;binary&quot;). This is an invalid <br>
message format for sending the message, but it makes
processing easier. You still have to parse the MIME parts
yourself though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using -b does not prevent your
program from outputing a valid message back, one that can be
possibly sent on the network so you have two options: either
you do not sup&acirc; <br>
ply any Content-Transfer-Encoding in the headers, and
mailagent will recode the body for you using the initial
transfer encoding present in the message (a relatively <br>
safe option if you make only changes in the body at
well-defined spots without introducing 8-bit chars), or you
can supply the Content-Transfer-Encoding yourself and <br>
perform the body encoding manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To be completely safe and
minimize the work in your program, the -e switch will let
mailagent analyse the message body you are returning and
select the proper transfer <br>
encoding automatically. Since this will cause the whole body
to be analysed, and it can be potentially huge, that
behaviour must be explicitly asked for. If you need <br>
-e then you probably want -b as well (you can supply both by
saying -be naturally).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not supply any switch,
mailagent will give you the message as-is and will get your
message as-is without any additional magic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FORWARD address(es) <br>
Forward mail to the specified address(es). This acts as if a
save had been done, in order to avoid the DELETE. Usually
when you forward a mail, you do not wish to keep <br>
it. The command adds Resent-like lines in the header. As for
BOUNCE, file inclusion is possible (i.e. use an address
&quot;forward_list&quot; to forward a mail to all the users
<br>
listed in the file forward_list). (Fails if mail cannot be
resent)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GIVE program <br>
Give the body of the message to the specified program by
feeding its standard input. Any output is mailed to the user
who runs the mailagent. Note that the message is <br>
not tagged as having been saved. (Returns the status of
program)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: If the message had a body
that was encoded for transport (using one of the base64 or
quoted-printable transfer encoding), mailagent will
transparently decode it <br>
and supply a version that can be properly handled. In other
words, the program does not need to care about the body
being encoded in the message, as it will get a <br>
plain one. (Since no headers are supplied, this is the only
possible option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution though for MIME
messages: you should use PIPE for them to give a chance to
the program to properly handle the body, but then it needs
to be fully MIME-aware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEEP header_fields_list <br>
Keeps only the corresponding lines in the header of the
mail. For instance, a &quot;KEEP From To Cc Subject&quot;
will keep only the principal fields from the mail message.
This <br>
is suitable for archiving mailing lists messages. You may
add a &rsquo;:&rsquo; after each header field name if you
wish, but that is not strictly necessary. Headers may be
speci&acirc; <br>
fied using shell-style regular expressions, and file
inclusion is allowed to get headers from a file. (Does not
modify existing status)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LEAVE Leave incoming mail in the
system mailbox. This is the default action if no rule
matched or if no saving occurred. This is not recommended on
Debian systems. (Fails if <br>
mail cannot be saved)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MACRO [-rdp] name [= (value,
type)] <br>
Lets you specify user-defined macros, of the form %-(name).
See the paragraph on user-defined macros for explanation
about the available types (SCALAR, EXPR, CONST, FN, <br>
PROG, PROGC). A perl interface to the underlying user macros
is available for your perl commands. The -r option is used
to replace an existing macro (instead of push&acirc; <br>
ing a new instance on the stack), the -d is to delete all
the instances of a named macro (in that case it takes only
the first argument), and -p pops the last instance <br>
of the macro from the stack and reverts to the previous
definition, if any (otherwise, it acts as -d). If you wish
to define a simple SCALAR macro, you may omit the = <br>
(value, type) part and simply continue with the macro value.
(Does not modify existing status)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MESSAGE file <br>
Send message file back to the sender of the message (as
derived from the header of the message). The text of the
message is run through the macro substitution mechanism <br>
(described later on). (Fails if message cannot be sent)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOP [-ft] No operation. If this
seems a bit odd, think of it in terms of a ONCE command.
(Does not alter existing status unless -f or -t is used, in
which case it forces a false <br>
--failure-- or true success status)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTIFY file address(es) <br>
Send a notification message file to a given address list.
The text of the message is run through the macro
substitution mechanism (described later on). As with
FOR&acirc; <br>
WARD, file inclusion for address specification is possible.
(Fails if message cannot be sent)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ON (day list) command <br>
Execute the specified filter command only on the specified
day list. That list is a space-separated list of days,
specified using the English names. Only the first <br>
three characters are taken into account, case-insensitively.
Therefore, the shortest valid day specifications are Mon,
Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat and Sun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command can be used in
conjunction with SELECT to do time-based selective bouncing
of messages to, for instance, your home address:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ON (Mon Tue Wed Thu) SELECT
(18:30 .. 23:00) BOUNCE me@home.net; <br>
ON (Fri) SELECT (18:30 .. 23:59) BOUNCE me@home.net; <br>
ON (Sat Sun) BOUNCE me@home.net;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That would bounce messages only
on week-ends and during the week, after 18:30, and until
23:00 (assuming that&rsquo;s bed time, other messages will
be seen at work the next <br>
day). Note that on Fridays, we go as far as 23:59.
(Propagates status from command. If the command is not
executed, always return success)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ONCE (name, tag, period) command
<br>
Execute the specified filter command once per period. The
name and tag fields are used to record timestamps of the
last ONCE command. More on this later. (Propagates <br>
status from command. If the command is not executed, always
return success)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PASS program <br>
Feed the body of the message to the specified program and
get a new body back from the output of the program. Note
that the message is not tagged as having been saved. <br>
(Returns the status of program)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: If the message had a body
that was encoded for transport (using one of the base64 or
quoted-printable transfer encoding), mailagent will
transparently decode it <br>
and supply a version that can be properly handled. The body
generated by the program will then be automatically encoded
back using the same transfer encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution though for MIME
messages: you should use FEED for them to give a chance to
the program to properly handle the body, but then it needs
to be fully MIME-aware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL script [arguments] <br>
Escape to a perl script to perform some actions on the
message. This is fully described further in the manpage, and
is very different from a RUN perl script command. <br>
(Returns failure if the script did not compile or returned a
non-zero status).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PIPE [-b] program <br>
Pipe the whole message to the specified program, but do not
get anything back. Any output is mailed to the user who runs
the mailagent. The message is not tagged as <br>
having been saved in any case, so you must explicitly DELETE
it if piping was enough and it did not fail: &quot;REJECT
-f&quot; is your friend here to avoid unwanted deletion.
<br>
(Returns the status of program)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: Your program must be
able to properly parse a MIME message and must deal with
transfer-encoded bodies by itself. To make the program task
simpler, you can <br>
supply the -b switch which will let mailagent decode the
whole body for you, suppressing any
Content-Transfer-Encoding header (implying
&quot;binary&quot;). This is an invalid <br>
message format for sending the message, but it makes
processing easier. You still have to parse the MIME parts
yourself though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POST [-lb] newsgroup(s) <br>
Post the message to the specified newsgroup(s) after having
cleaned-up the header: mail-related fields like Received: or
In-Reply-To: are removed, a valid From: line is <br>
generated, the original To: and Cc: are renamed with an X-
prefix, the References: line is updated/generated if
necessary based on existing In-Reply-To, and NNTP-spe&acirc;
<br>
cific fields are stripped so that the server can add its
own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running POST successfully acts
as a saving.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the first name is -l as in
&quot;POST -l comp.mail.mh&quot;, then a &quot;Distribution:
local&quot; header is added to force a local delivery.
Otherwise, the default inews distribution <br>
will be used (world, usually).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -b switch is given, a
successful POST will result in biffing being activated (see
section MAIL BIFFING) for the resulting news article.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If more than one newsgroup is
specified, they should be space separated. It is possible to
get a newsgroup list via file inclusion. (Fails if message
cannot be posted)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROCESS Run the mailagent
processing which looks for @SH commands and executes them.
This was described before in the section dealing with
default rules. The action associated <br>
by default to a mail having [Cc]ommand as its subject is
PROCESS. (Always returns success)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROTECT [-lu] mode <br>
Sets the default protection mode that should be set on
created folders (or created files when saving into an MH
folder or a directory). By default, permissions are
gov&acirc; <br>
erned by the UMASK command, but this lets you override the
default. The specified mode should be preceded by a 0 as in
0644 to give the familiar octal permissions. Oth&acirc; <br>
erwise, it is interpreted as a decimal number, so
beware!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -l option may be used to
specify a mode locally for one rule. Otherwise, the
protection mode is set globally. The -u option unsets the
global (or local when com&acirc; <br>
bined with -l) mode, reverting to the default behaviour
where only the umask is taken into account by the
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that when saving into an MH
folder, the PROTECT command takes precedence over the
Msg-Protect field from your ~/.mh_profile file. (Does not
alter execution sta&acirc; <br>
tus)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PURIFY program <br>
Feed the header into a program and get new header back.
RESYNC is done automatically upon return. This may be used
to indeed purify the header by removing all the ver&acirc;
<br>
bose stuff added by so many mail transport agents (X-400
like lines for instance). Obviously, this does not flag the
message as having been saved. (Returns the status <br>
of program)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your program removes the
Content-Transfer-Encoding header in a MIME message,
mailagent will properly transform the message to have a
non-encoded body. If you change <br>
the value of the Content-Transfer-Encoding header, mailagent
will also correctly recode the body for you. The only
supported encodings are base64 and quoted-printable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUEUE Queue mail again. A
successful queuing counts as if mail has been saved. Mail
queued that way will not be processed during the next 30
minutes. Note that unless maila&acirc; <br>
gent is invoked on a regular basis by cron, the mail will
remain in the queue until another mail arrives. (Fails when
mail cannot be queued)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RECORD [-acr] [state]
[(tag-list)] <br>
Record message in the history and enters state _SEEN_ if the
message was already present there. If the message is
recorded for the first time, processing continues nor&acirc;
<br>
mally. Otherwise a REJECT is performed. This behavior may be
somewhat modified by using some options. See UNIQUE for a
complete description of the options and argu&acirc; <br>
ments. Naturally, when a state is specified, that overrides
the default _SEEN_. A state name can contain alphanumeric
characters and underscores.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a tag-list (comma-separated
list of names) is specified, the message is only recorded
and checked against all those tags, but only them. Not
specifying any tag <br>
list means any occurrence, whether it is tagged or not. See
paragraph Using Tags in Record and Unique for more
information. (Returns a failure status if mail was <br>
already recorded)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REJECT [-tf] [state] <br>
Abort execution of current action, and continue matching. If
-t is specified, the reject will occur only if the previous
action was successfully completed (return sta&acirc; <br>
tus of true), whilst -f would cause the reject only when a
failure occurred. If a state is specified, we enter that
state before rejection. REJECT resets the matching <br>
flag, which means that if no further match occurs, the
default action will apply. A state name can contain
alphanumeric characters and underscores. (Does not alter
<br>
execution status)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIRE file [package] <br>
Behaves like the perl require operator by loading a perl
file into memory. By default, the file is read in the newcmd
package, but you may specify whatever package you <br>
wish to load it in. This command will only perform the
loading once per (file, package) tuple. Unlike its perl
equivalent, the file &quot;value&quot; is not important,
i.e. it <br>
does not have to end with a statement returning a true
value. (Fails if file cannot be loaded)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTART [-tf] [state] <br>
Abort execution of current action and restart the matching
process from the beginning. To avoid loops, each rule may be
walked through once in a given state. See REJECT <br>
for the meaning of the optional parameters. RESTART resets
the matching flag, which means that the default action will
apply, should no further match occur. (Does not <br>
alter execution status)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESYNC Re-synchronize header
used for matching with the header of the mail. This is
probably useful only when a SUBST or ANNOTATE command was
run. (Does not alter execution <br>
status)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: At RESYNC time, mailagent
will check whether the Content-Transfer-Encoding header was
changed and will transparently recode the body if required,
so that the <br>
whole message remains valid despite header mangling. It will
also take care of updating Content-Length if required.
Whenever you do change these important headers via <br>
SUBST or ANNOTATE, be sure to call RESYNC before disposing
of the message or you run the risk of saving a corrupted
version that will not be properly understood by your <br>
mail user agent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUN program <br>
Run the specified program and mail any output to the user
who runs mailagent. This action does not flag the message as
having been saved. (Returns the status of pro&acirc; <br>
gram)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SAVE folder <br>
Save message in the specified folder. If folder name starts
with a &rsquo;+&rsquo;, it is handled as an MH-style folder
and rcvstore is emulated to deliver the message into that
<br>
folder. If folder is a directory, message is delivered in a
single file within that directory. See the FOLDERS section.
(Fails if message cannot be saved)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SELECT (start .. end) command
<br>
Execute the command only within the time selection period
specified. Dates can be specified in a wide range of
formats. The output of the date(1) command is an example
<br>
of a valid specification. If the date, the year or the month
is missing, then the current one is substituted in place of
it. The following dates are valid specifica&acirc; <br>
tions: &rsquo;10:04:25&rsquo;, &rsquo;now&rsquo;
,&rsquo;April 1 1992&rsquo;, &rsquo;Dec 25&rsquo;,
&rsquo;July 14 1789, 07:40&rsquo; (err... it&rsquo;s valid
according to the grammar, but it&rsquo;s before the Epoch so
it does not mean <br>
anything). Other fancy dates like &rsquo;last month - 5
minutes&rsquo; or &rsquo;3 weeks ago&rsquo; are also
enabled. (Isn&rsquo;t that great to have a real parser? The
filtering rules could have <br>
been more elaborated if only I had known about this Berkeley
yacc producing a perl parser...). (Returns the status of
command, if run, otherwise returns true).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SERVER [-t] [-d disabled
commands] <br>
Activate server processing. The body of the message is
interpreted as a list of commands to execute. See section
GENERIC MAIL SERVER for more information about the <br>
server itself. The -t option turns the server into trusted
mode, where powers may be gained. The -d option must be
followed by a list of disabled commands, separated by <br>
commas with no intervening spaces between them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPLIT [-adeiw] folder <br>
Split a mail in digest format into the specified folder
(same naming conventions as in SAVE). If no folder is
specified, each digest item is queued and will be analyzed
<br>
as a single mail by itself. The -d option deletes the digest
header. The -i option means split is done in-place and the
original mail is discarded. All the options may <br>
be used simultaneously provided they are stuck together at
the beginning (option parsing being really rudimentary).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the mail is not in digest
format and a folder is specified, then it is saved in that
folder. Otherwise, the SPLIT action fails and nothing occurs
(the filter contin&acirc; <br>
ues its processing though). The SPLIT command will correctly
burst RFC-934 digest messages and will try to do its best
otherwise. If the digest was not RFC-934 compli&acirc; <br>
ant and there is a chance SPLIT might have produced
something incorrect, then the original message is also saved
if -i, otherwise it is not tagged as saved (so that the <br>
default LEAVE command may apply). The -w (watch) requests
special care and will detect every non RFC-934 digest, even
when the non-compliance is otherwise harmless; <br>
furthermore, any trailing garbage longer that 100 bytes will
be saved as a digest item by itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -a option annotates every
digest item with an X-Digest-To: header line, which is the
concatenation of the To: and Cc: fields of the original
digest message. This <br>
may be used for instance to burst the digest into the queue
and then re-process each of its items according to this
added field. Finally, the -e option will discard <br>
the digest header only if its body is empty (i.e. the
moderator did not include any leading comment). (Returns
success if mail was in digest format and correctly split
<br>
without any error)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STORE folder <br>
Save message in the specified folder and leave a copy in the
system mailbox. The folder parameter follows the same naming
conventions as in SAVE. Again, because of <br>
locking issues, leaving mail in the mailbox is not
recommended on Debian machines. (Fails if message cannot be
saved either in the folder or in the mailbox)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STRIP header_fields_list <br>
Remove the corresponding lines in the header of the mail.
For instance, a &quot;STRIP Newsgroups Apparently-To&quot;
will remove the appropriate lines to wipe out any
Newsgroups: <br>
or Apparently-To: header. You may add a &rsquo;:&rsquo;
after each header field name if you wish, but that is not
strictly necessary. Headers may be specified via shell-style
regu&acirc; <br>
lar expressions or via &quot;file&quot; inclusion. (Does not
alter execution status)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUBST var/header expression <br>
Substitutes the expression on the specified user-defined
variable (name starting with a #) or back-reference (digit),
or header field (optionally ending with &rsquo;:&rsquo;).
For <br>
instance</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUBST #foo /w/y/g</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would substitute in user-defined
variable foo all the w by y. See also ASSIGN and TR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For substitutions on header
fields, like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUBST Subject: //;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">matching header lines will be
reformatted when the substitution is successful, which
likely means original continuations will not be preserved.
The target of the sub&acirc; <br>
stitution is the whole header, with continuations normalized
to one space. You are therefore guaranteed to be independent
from the actual header formatting in the <br>
original.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not forget to issue a RESYNC
after a header field SUBST, since some routines (like POST)
probe into the parsed header hash table to generate the
saved message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Fails if error in
expression)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TR var/header translation <br>
Perform the translation on the specified variable,
back-reference or header field. For instance</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TR 1 /A-Z/a-z/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would canonicalize content of
reference 1 into lowercase. Successfully transliterated
headers are reformatted, even when their overall size is not
changed. See also <br>
ASSIGN and SUBST. (Fails if error in translation)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UMASK [-l] mode <br>
Changes the process&rsquo;s umask to the specified mode,
which can be decimal, octal (if preceded by &rsquo;0&rsquo;)
or hexadecimal (starting with &rsquo;0x&rsquo;). The octal
notation is the <br>
clearest way to specify the umask anyway. Aren&rsquo;t
rumors saying that octal was invented for that purpose only?
;-) Use the -l option to change the umask for the duration
<br>
of the current action rule only. Note that the default umask
specified in your config file is used to reset
mailagent&rsquo;s umask at the start of each mail
processing. <br>
(Does not alter execution status)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNIQUE [-acr] [state]
[(tag-list)] <br>
Record message in the history and tag message as saved if it
was already present there. If the message is recorded for
the first time, processing continues normally. <br>
Otherwise a REJECT is performed. If -r was used, a RESTART
is used instead whilst -a would run an ABORT. For instance,
to remove duplicate messages from mailing lists, <br>
run a UNIQUE -a before saving the mail. The -c option may be
used alone to actually prevent the command from disturbing
the execution flow, and to later use the return <br>
status to see what happened: UNIQUE returns a failure status
if the message was already recorded. If an optional state
argument is given, then the automaton will enter <br>
that state if the mail was previously in the database. See
also RECORD, and the paragraph entitled Using Tags in Record
and Unique for more information about the tag- <br>
list. (Fails if mail was already recorded)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VACATION [-l] on|off|path
[period] <br>
Allow or disallow a vacation message. When vacation mode is
turned on via the configuration file, a message is sent
whenever the user receives a mail meeting some <br>
requirements, as explained under the section VACATION MODE.
One of the conditions is that the vacation flag modified by
this command be true. This makes it easy to <br>
disallow vacation messages, ever, to a group of people for
instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of on or off, you can
specify a file name (~ substitution allowed) being the new
path to be used for locating the vacation file. Optionally,
you may specify a <br>
last parameter, which will be taken as the period to apply
when sending the vacation message. Changes to the vacation
message path are forbidden when the configuration <br>
variable vacfixed is set to ON.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use the -l option,
changes are made locally, for the duration of the rule only.
If you REJECT to go to some other rule, your changes will be
lost. The global <br>
value of the altered parameters is changed on the first
local usage and restored when a new rule is entered. (Does
not alter execution status)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WRITE folder <br>
Write the message in the specified folder, removing any
pre-existing folder with the same name. Hence, successive
WRITE commands will overwrite the previous one. This <br>
is useful to store output of system commands ran by cron.
Don&rsquo;t try to use it with an MH folder or a directory
folder or it will behave like SAVE. (Fails if message <br>
cannot be written)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Execution Status <br>
Almost all the actions modify a variable which keeps track
of the execution status (analogous to the $? variable in the
shell). This variable can be tested via the -t or -f <br>
option of the REJECT command for instance. To give but a
single example, the SAVE action would return failed if it
could not save the mail in the specified folder. If that
SAVE <br>
command was followed by a &quot;REJECT -f FAILED&quot;, then
the execution of the current rule would stop and the
automaton would continue to analyze the mail in the FAILED
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of the actions however do
not modify this last execution status. Typically, those are
actions which make decisions based on that status, or simply
actions which may never <br>
fail. Those special actions are: ABORT, ASSIGN, BEGIN, KEEP,
MACRO, NOP, REJECT, RESTART, RESYNC, STRIP and VACATION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is unfortunate that ONCE or
SELECT commands cannot make the difference between a
non-execution and a successful execution of the specified
command. There may be a change in <br>
the way this scheme works, but it should remain backward
compatible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl Escape <br>
By using the PERL command, you have the ability to perform
filtering and other sophisticated actions directly in perl.
This is really different from what you could do by feeding
<br>
your mail to a perl script. First of all, no extra process
is created: the script is loaded directly into mailagent and
compiled in a special package called mailhook. Secondly,
<br>
you have a perl interface to all the filtering commands:
each filtering action is associated to a perl function
(spelled lower-cased). Finally, some pre-defined variables
are set <br>
for you by mailagent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before we go any further, please
note that as there is no extra process created, you must not
call the perl exit function. Use &amp;exit instead, so that
the exit may be trapped. <br>
&amp;exit takes one argument, the exit code. If you use 0,
this is understood as a success, any other value meaning
failure (i.e. the PERL command will return a failure
status). <br>
Using the perl exit function directly would kill mailagent
and would probably incur some mail losses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The scripts used should remain
simple. In particular, you should avoid the use of the
package directive or define functions with a package name
other than mailhook (i.e. the <br>
package where your script is loaded). Failure to do so may
raise some name clashes with mailagent&rsquo;s own routines.
In particular, avoid the main package. Note that since the
com&acirc; <br>
pilation environment is set-up to mailhook, not specifying
package names in your variables and subroutine is fine (in
fact, it&rsquo;s meant to work that way).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Your script is free to do
whatever it wants to the mail. Most of the time however, you
end up using the mailagent primitives to save the mail or
forward it (but you are free to <br>
redesign your own and call them instead, of course). The
interface is simple: each function takes but one argument, a
string, which is the arguments to the command, if any. For
<br>
instance, in a perl escape script, you would express:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ SAVE list; FORWARD
&quot;users&quot;; FEED ~/bin/newmail -tty; REJECT }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;save(&rsquo;list&rsquo;);
<br>
&amp;forward(&rsquo;&quot;users&quot;&rsquo;); <br>
&amp;feed(&rsquo;~/bin/newmail -tty&rsquo;); <br>
&amp;reject;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rule is simple: each command
is replaced by a function call, with the remaining
parameters enclosed in a string, if any. Alternatively, you
may specify parameters as a list: <br>
all the arguments you provide are joined into a big happy
string, using a space character as separator. The macro
substitution mechanism is then ran on this resulting
argument <br>
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each function returns a boolean
success status of the command (i.e. 1 means success). For
those functions which usually do not modify the
filter&rsquo;s last execution status variable, <br>
a success is always returned. This makes it possible to
(intuitively) write:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;exit(0) if
&amp;save(&rsquo;uucp&rsquo;); <br>
&amp;bounce(&rsquo;root&rsquo;) ||
&amp;save(&rsquo;emergency&rsquo;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and get the expected result. The
mail will be saved in the emergency folder only when saving
in uucp folder failed and the mail could not be bounced to
root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important to understand
that these commands have exactly the same effect on the
filtering process when they are run from a perl escape
script or from within the rule file <br>
as regular actions. A &amp;reject call will simply abandon
the execution of the current perl script and the filter
automaton will regain control and attempt a new match. But
perl <br>
brings you much more power, in particular system calls,
control structures like if and for, raw regular expressions,
etc...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special perl @INC array
(which controls the search path for require) is slightly
modified by prepending mailagent&rsquo;s own private library
path. This leaves the door open for <br>
future mailagent library perl scripts which may be required
by the perl script. Furthermore, the following special
variables are set-up by perl before invoking your
script:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@ARGV The arguments of the
script, which were given by the PERL command. This array is
set up the exact same way you would expect it to be set up
if you invoked the com&acirc; <br>
mand directly from the shell, excepted that @ARGV[0] is the
name of the script (since you cannot use perl&rsquo;s $0 to
get at it; that would give you mailagent&rsquo;s name). <br>
$address The address part of the From: line. <br>
$cc The raw content of the Cc: line. <br>
@cc The list of addresses on the Cc: line, with comments
suppressed. <br>
$envelope The mail envelope, as computed using the first
From line of the message. <br>
$friendly The comment part of the From: line, if any. <br>
$from The content of the From: line, with address and
comment part. <br>
%header This table, indexed by field name, returns the raw
content on the corresponding header line. See below. <br>
$msgpath The full path name of the folder (or message within
an MH folder) where the last saving operation has occurred.
This is intended to be used if you wish to con&acirc; <br>
struct your own mail reception notification. <br>
$length The message length, in bytes. <br>
$lines The number of lines in the message. <br>
$login The login name of the address on the From: line. <br>
$precedence The content of the Precedence: line, if any at
all. <br>
@relayed The list of host names (possibly raw IP addresses
if no DNS mapping) listed in the (computed) Relayed: header
line. <br>
$reply_to The e-mail address where a reply should be sent
to, with comment suppressed. <br>
$sender The sender of the message (may have a comment),
derived in the same way the Sender: line is computed by
mailagent. <br>
$subject The subject of the message. <br>
$to The raw content of the To: line. <br>
@to The list of addresses on the To: line, with comments
suppressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The associative array %header
gives you access to all the fields in the header of the
message. For instance, $to is really the value of
$header{&rsquo;To&rsquo;}. The key is specified using <br>
a normalized case, i.e. the first letter of each word is
uppercased, the remaining being lowercased. This is
independent of the actual physical representation in the
message <br>
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pseudo keys Head, Body and
All respectively gives you access to the raw header of the
message, the body and the whole message. The %header array
is really a reference to the <br>
mailagent&rsquo;s internal data structure, so modifying the
values will influence the filtering process. For instance,
the SAVE command writes the Head, the X-Filter: line, the
end of <br>
header (a single newline) and then the Body (this is an
example only, not a documented feature :-). The =Body= key
is special: it is a Perl reference to a scalar containing
the <br>
body with any content transfer encoding removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the $msgpath variable
holds only a snapshot of the folder path at the time where
the PERL escape was called. If you perform your own savings
in perl, then you need to <br>
look at the $main&rsquo;folder_saved variable instead to get
the up-to-date folder path value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a final note, resist the
temptation of reading the internals of the mailagent and
directly calling the routines you need. If it is not
documented in the manual page, it may be <br>
changed without notice by any further patch. (And this does
not say that documented features may not change also...
It&rsquo;s just more unlikely, and patches would clearly
state <br>
that, of course.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Program Environment <br>
All the programs started by mailagent via RUN and friends
inherit the following environment variables: HOME, USER and
NAME, respectively set from the configuration parameters
<br>
home, user and name. If the mailagent is invoked by the
filter, then the PATH is also set according to the
configuration file (if you are using the C filter) or to
whatever you <br>
set PATH (if you are using the shell filter).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the programs are executed
from within the home directory. This includes scripts
started via the PERL command and mail hooks. The latter will
be described in detail further <br>
down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File inclusion <br>
Some commands like FORWARD or KEEP allow you to specify a
file name between double quotes to actually load parameters
from this file. Unless a full path is given, the following
<br>
method is used to locate the file: first in the location
pointed to by the mailfilter variable if set, otherwise in
maildir and finally in the home directory. Note that this is
<br>
not a search path in the sense that if mailfilter is defined
and the file is not there, an error will be reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file should list each
parameter (be it an address, a header or a pattern) on a
line by itself. Shell-style comments (#) are allowed within
that file and leading white spaces <br>
are trimmed (but not trailing spaces).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Macros Substitutions <br>
All the commands go through a macro substitution mechanism
before being executed. The following macros are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%% A real percent sign <br>
%A The internet address extracted out of the From: field
(a.b.c in u@a.b.c), converted to lower-case. <br>
%C CPU name on which mailagent runs. That is a fully
qualified hostname with the domain name, e.g.
lyon.eiffel.com. <br>
%D Day of the week (0-6) <br>
%H Host name (name of the machine on which the mailagent
runs), without any domain name. Always in lower-case,
regardless of the machine name. <br>
%I The internet domain name extracted out of the From: field
(b.c in u@a.b.c), converted to lower-case. <br>
%L Length of the body part, in bytes, with
content-transfer-encoding removed. <br>
%N Full name of the sender (login name if none) <br>
%O The organization name extracted out of the From: field (b
in u@a.b.c), converted to lower-case. <br>
%R Subject of the original message with leading Re:
suppressed <br>
%S Re: subject of original message <br>
%T Time of the last modification on mailed file (commands
MESSAGE and NOTIFY) <br>
%U Full name of the user <br>
%Y Full year, with four digits (so-called yyyy format) <br>
%_ A white space (useful to put white spaces in single
patterns) <br>
%&amp; List of selectors which incurred match (among those
specified via a regular expression such as &rsquo;X-*:
/foo/i&rsquo;. If we find the foo substring in the X-Mailer:
header line, <br>
then %&amp; will be set to this value). Values in the list
are comma separated. <br>
%~ A null character, wiped out from the resulting string.
<br>
%digit Value of the corresponding back reference from the
last match. <br>
%#var Value of user-defined variable var <br>
%=var Value of the mailagent configuration variable var as
specified in the ~/.mailagent file. <br>
%d Day of the month (01-31) <br>
%e The user&rsquo;s e-mail address (yours!). <br>
%f Contents of the &quot;From:&quot; line, something like %N
&lt;%r&gt; or %r (%N) depending on how the mailer is
configured. <br>
%h Hour of the day (00-23) <br>
%i Message ID, if available (otherwise, this is a null
string) <br>
%l Number of lines in the message, once
content-transfer-encoding has been removed <br>
%m Month of the year (01-12) <br>
%n Lower-case login name of sender <br>
%o Organization (where mailagent runs) <br>
%r Return address of message <br>
%s Subject of original message <br>
%t Current hour and minute (in HH:MM format) <br>
%u Login name of the user <br>
%y Year (last two digits) <br>
%[To] Value of the header field (here To:)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User-defined Macros <br>
The mailagent lets you define your own macros in two ways:
at the filter level via the MACRO command, or at the perl
level in your own commands or perl actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once defined, a user macro (say
foo) can be substituted by using %-(foo). In the case of a
single-letter macro, that can be optimized into %-f for
instance, i.e. the parenthesis <br>
can be omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are six types of
macros:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCALAR A scalar value is given,
e.g: red. The macro&rsquo;s value is the literal scalar
value, no further interpretation is performed on the
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXPR A perl expression will be
evaled to get the value, e.g: $red. Note that the evaluation
will be performed within the usrmac package, so if you are
referring to a vari&acirc; <br>
able in another package, it would be wise to specify it, as
in $foo&rsquo;bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONST It&rsquo;s really the same
as EXPR, but the value is known to be a constant. So the
first time a substitution is made, the expression will be
evaluated, and then its result <br>
is cached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FN A perl function name (without
the leading &amp;), such as main&rsquo;do_this. The function
will be called with a single parameter: the name of the
macro itself. That leaves the <br>
door open for further user-defined conventions by forcing
evaluation through one single perl function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROG A program to run to get the
actual value. Only trailing newline is chopped, others are
preserved. The program is forked each time. In the argument
list given to the <br>
program, %n is expanded as the macro name we are trying to
evaluate. If you specify that in the filtering rules,
don&rsquo;t forget to escape the first %.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROGC Same as PROG really, but
the program is forked only once and the value is cached for
later perusal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the perl level, four
functions let you manipulate and define your macros (all
part of the usrmac package):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new(name, value, type) <br>
Replace or create a %-(name) macro. For instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new(&rsquo;foo&rsquo;,
&quot;$mailhook&rsquo;header{&rsquo;X-Foo&rsquo;}&quot;,
&rsquo;EXPR&rsquo;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would create a new macro foo
that would expand into the value of an hypothetical X-Foo
header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete(name) <br>
Delete all values recorded for the macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">push(name, value, type) <br>
Stack a new macro, creating it if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pop(name) Remove last macro
definition on the stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One macro stack is allocated for
each macro, so that some kind of crude dynamic scoping may
be implemented. Creating a macro via push is like taking a
local variable in perl, <br>
while creating one by new is simply assigning to a variable.
Likely, pop is like exiting a block with a local variable
definition and delete frees all the macro bearing that <br>
name, i.e. it deletes the whole stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the filter level, the MACRO
command has three options. By default, the command defines a
new macro by using push, and the other options each let you
access one of the other <br>
interface functions. Note that macro definitions persist
across APPLY commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User-defined Logging <br>
Most of the time when writing a new mailagent filtering
command or an perl hook, you will have a need for specific
logging, either to report a problem or to keep track of what
<br>
you are performing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, logs are appended into
the agentlog file by calling &amp;main&rsquo;add_log(string)
(see subsection General Purpose Routines). For plain
mailagent actions, this is fine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But mailagent lets you define
alternate logging files, referred to by name. This generic
logging interface is defined in the usrlog package:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new(name, file, flag) <br>
Records a new log file known as name and done in file. If
the pathname given for this file is not absolute, it is
rooted under the logdir directory. If flag is set to <br>
true, any logging done to this file will also be copied to
the default system-wide logfile. Nothing is done if a
logfile with the same name has already been defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete(name) <br>
Deletes the logfile known as name. Further logging done to
that file is redirected to the default logfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">main&rsquo;usr_log(name, string)
<br>
Adds an entry to the logfile name. The default logfile is
known as default and cannot be redefined nor deleted. Note
that this function is available from the main pack&acirc;
<br>
age. Calling it with name set to the string
&rsquo;default&rsquo; is mostly equivalent to calling
directly main&rsquo;add_log with the notable exception that
the -i mailagent option will <br>
not be honored in that case. This may or may not be useful
to you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you call
&amp;main&rsquo;usr_log with a non-existent logfile name,
logging is redirected to the default system-wide logfile
defined in your ~/.mailagent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dynamically Loading New Code
<br>
In you perl routines (user-defined commands, perl hooks,
etc...), you may feel the need to dynamically load some new
code into mailagent. You have direct access to the internal
<br>
routine used by mailagent to implement the REQUIRE command
or load your new filtering commands for example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the so-called dynload
interface buys you some extra features:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The mailagent
public library path is automatically prepended to the @INC
array, which lets you define your own system-wide or private
perl library files (the private library <br>
path is defined by the perlib configuration variable, the
public library path was defined at installation time).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Like
perl&rsquo;s require, mailagent keeps track of which files
were loaded into which packages and will not reload the same
file in the same package twice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It is possible
to make sure that a specific function be defined in the
loaded file, with an error reported if this is not the
case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You benefit from
the default logging done by dynload when some error
occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to do all this, you
call:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;dynload&rsquo;load(package,
file, function)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">specifying the package into
which you wish to load the file, and optionally the name of
a function that must be defined once the file has been
loaded (leave this field to undef <br>
if you do not have such a constraint). The routine returns
undef if the file cannot be loaded (non-existent file, most
probably), 0 if the file was loaded but contained a syntax
<br>
error or did not define the specified function, and 1 for
success.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using Once Commands <br>
The ONCE constructs lets you specify a given command to be
run once every period (day, week...). The command is
identified by a name and a tag, the combination of the two
being <br>
unique. Why not just a single identifier? Well, that would
be fine, but assume you want to send a message in reply to
someone once every week. You could use the e-mail address of
<br>
the person as the command identifier. But what if you also
want to send another message to the same address, this time
once a month?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a prototypical usage of
a ONCE, which acts like the vacation program, excepted that
it sends a reply only once a day for a given address:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ ONCE (%r, message, 1d) MESSAGE
~/.message };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This relies on the macro
substitution mechanism to send only once a day the message
held in ~/.message. Do not use the tag vacation, unless you
know what you are doing: this is <br>
the tag used internally by mailagent in vacation mode.
Recall that no selector nor pattern is understood as
&quot;Subject: *&quot;, hence the rule is always executed
because that pattern <br>
always matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The timestamps associated with
each commands are kept in files under the Hash directory.
The name is used as a hashing key to compute the name of the
file (the two first letters <br>
are used). Inside the file, timestamps are sorted by name,
then by tag. Of course, you could say (inverting tag and
name):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ ONCE (message, %r, 1d) MESSAGE
~/.message };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but that would be likely to be
less efficient, as the first hashing would be done on a
fixed word, hence all the timestamps would be located in the
file Hash/m/e (where Hash is <br>
the name of your hashing directory, which is the hash
parameter in the configuration file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using Tags in Record and Unique
<br>
Both the RECORD and UNIQUE commands let you specify a
comma-separated tag list between &rsquo;(&rsquo; and
&rsquo;)&rsquo;. For each tag present in the list, there is
a separate entry in the database <br>
associated with the message ID. When the message is recorded
for at least one of the tags, the command &quot;fails&quot;.
Not specifying any tags means looking for any occurrence of
that <br>
message ID, whether it is tagged or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is very useful when
receiving mail cross-posted to distinct mailing lists and
you want to save one instance of the message in each folder,
but still guard against dupli&acirc; <br>
cates. You may say:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To Cc: unix-wizards { <br>
UNIQUE (wizards); <br>
SAVE wizards; <br>
REJECT; <br>
}; <br>
To Cc: majordomo-users { <br>
UNIQUE (majordomo); <br>
SAVE majordomo; <br>
REJECT; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and only one instance of the
message will end up in each folder. When you have folders
with conflicting interests, you might use a tag list,
instead of a single tag. For <br>
instance, assuming you wish to keep a single copy for
messages cross-posted to both dist-users and agent-users,
but have a separate copy if also cross-posted to
majordomo-users, <br>
then say:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To Cc: majordomo-users { <br>
UNIQUE (majordomo); <br>
SAVE majordomo; <br>
REJECT; <br>
}; <br>
To Cc: dist-users { <br>
UNIQUE (dist, agent); <br>
SAVE dist-users; <br>
REJECT; <br>
}; <br>
To Cc: agent-users { <br>
UNIQUE (dist, agent); <br>
SAVE dist-users; <br>
REJECT; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have some rule using
UNIQUE without any tags, it will match when at least one
instance of the message has been recorded, no matter what
tag (if any at all) was used in the <br>
first place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying A Period <br>
The period parameter of the ONCE commands or the vacperiod
parameter of your configuration file has the following
format: a number followed by a modifier. The modifier is an
<br>
atomic period like a day or a week, the number is the number
of atomic periods the final period should be equal to. The
available modifiers are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m minute <br>
h hour (60 minutes) <br>
d day (24 hours) <br>
w week (7 days) <br>
M month (30 days) <br>
y year (365 days)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the periods are converted
internally in seconds, although you do not really care...
Examples of valid periods range from &quot;1m&quot; to
&quot;136y&quot; on a 32 bits machine (why ?).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Timeouts <br>
In order to avoid having a mailagent waiting for a command
forever, a maximum execution time of one hour is allowed by
default. Past that amount of time, the child is sent a <br>
SIGTERM signal. If it does not die within the next 30
seconds, a SIGKILL is sent. Output from the program, if any
so far, is mailed back to the user. This default behaviour
may <br>
be altered by setting a proper runmax variable in your
configuration file to allow more time for the command to
complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also a filter queue
timeout. In order to moderate system load, the C filter
program waits 60 seconds by default (or whatever queuewait
was set to in the config file) <br>
before launching mailagent. To avoid conflicts, messages
queued by the first filter (which will then sleep for
queuewait seconds) are not processed by mailagent&rsquo;s -q
option until <br>
they are at least queuehold seconds old. Another
queue-related parameter is queuelost, the amount of seconds
after which mailagent will flag messages as &quot;lost&quot;
when listing the <br>
queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, the locking timeout
policy may also be configured. By default, a lock is broken
when it is one hour old (configured by the lockhold
variable) and mailagent will only <br>
make lockmax attempts, spaced by lockdelay seconds to
acquire the lock. It will then proceed whether or not it got
that lock. If you want a secure locking policy, make sure
lock&acirc; <br>
max times lockdelay is greater than lockhold, that parameter
being &quot;large&quot; enough.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Avoiding Loops <br>
The mailagent leaves an &quot;X-Filter:&quot; header on each
filtered message, which in turn is used to detect loops. If
a message already filtered is to be processed, the mailagent
enters <br>
a special state _SEEN_. This state is special in the sense
it is built-in, it is not matched by ALL, and some actions
are not made available, namely: BACK, BOUNCE, FEED, FORWARD,
<br>
GIVE, NOTIFY, PASS, PIPE, POST, PURIFY, QUEUE and RUN. Also
note that although the ONCE and SELECT constructs are
enabled, they will not let you execute disallowed commands.
<br>
Otherwise, the _SEEN_ state behaves like any other state you
can select or negate, so a &lt;!_SEEN_&gt; guard will not
select the rule when we are in state _SEEN_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The _SEEN_ state makes it easy
to deal with mails which loop because of an alias loop you
have no control on. If no action is found in the _SEEN_
state, the mail is left in the <br>
mailbox, as usual. Moreover, if no saving is done, a LEAVE
is executed. This is the normal behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;X-Filter:&quot; header
is only added when the message is saved. Actions such as
PIPE or GIVE do not flag the message as being saved and
therefore they do not add that header <br>
line. You can add one via ANNOTATE if you wish to prevent
loops, in case the program to which you are feeding the
message might return it to you in some strange way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Message Files <br>
The text of the message to be sent back (for MESSAGE or
NOTIFY) is read from a file and passed through the macro
substitution mechanism. The special macro %T is set to the
date <br>
of last modification made on that file. The format is
month/day, and the year is added before the month only if it
differs from the current year.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the head of the message, you
may put header lines. Those lines will overwrite the default
supplied lines. That may be useful to change the default
subject or add some addi&acirc; <br>
tional fields like the name of your organization. The end of
your header is given by the first blank line encountered. If
the top of the message you wish to send looks like a <br>
mail header, you may protect it by adding a blank line at
the very top of the file. This dummy line will be removed
from the message and the whole file will be sent as a body
<br>
part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an example of a vacation
file. We add a carbon copy as well as the name of our
organization in the header:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cc: ram <br>
Organization: %o <br>
Precedence: bulk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Last revision made on %T]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dear %N:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I&rsquo;ve received your mail
regarding &quot;%R&quot;. <br>
It will be read as soon as I come back from vacation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sincerely, <br>
-- <br>
%U &lt;%u@%C&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VACATION MODE <br>
When it&rsquo;s time to take some vacation, it is possible
to set up mailagent in vacation mode. Every vacperiod, the
message vacfile will be sent back to the user (with macros
substi&acirc; <br>
tutions) if the user is explicitly listed in the To or Cc
field and if the sender is not a special user (root, uucp,
news, daemon, postmaster, newsmaster, usenet, Mailer-Daemon,
<br>
Mailer-Agent or nobody). Matches are done in a case
insensitive manner, so MAILER-DAEMON will also be recognized
as a special user. Furthermore, any message tagged with a
<br>
Precedence: field set to bulk, list or junk will not trigger
a vacation message. This built-in behavior can of course be
overloaded by suitable rules (by testing and issuing the
<br>
vacation message yourself via MESSAGE).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internally, mailagent uses a
ONCE command tagged (%r, vacation, $vacperiod). This implies
you must not use the vacation tag in your own ONCE commands,
unless you know what you <br>
are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Besides, the vacation message is
sent only if no &quot;VACATION off&quot; commands were
issued, or if another &quot;VACATION on&quot; overwrote the
previous one. Note that whether a rule matched or <br>
not is irrelevant to the algorithm. By default, of course,
the vacation message is allowed when the vacation
configuration parameter is set to on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are not pleased by the
fact that a vacation message is sent to people who addressed
you a carbon copy only, then you may write at the top of
your rule file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cc: ram { VACATION off; REJECT
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course, you have to
substitute your own login name in place of ram. You cannot
use the same scheme to allow vacation messages to special
users like root, because the test for <br>
&quot;specialness&quot; occurs after the vacation mode flag.
This is construed as a feature as it prevents stupid
mistakes, like using r* instead of ram in the previous
rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may also want to setup a
different vacation message, meant only for people in your
organization given the sensitive nature of the information
revealed ;-). A simple way of <br>
doing that is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From: /^192 <br>
{ VACATION ~/.hp_vacation 1w; REJECT HP };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assuming the domain of my
organization is .hp.com and that messages not bearing any
domain are local messages, the above rule sets up the file
~/.hp_vacation, sent once a week, <br>
for all HP employees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The VACATION command will not
let you change the message path (but will allow frequency
changes anyway) when the vacfixed configuration variable is
set to ON. This is meant to be <br>
used in emergency situations, when only one vacation message
will fit. For instance, when you are on a sick leave, a
simple trigger message to your mailagent from home could
<br>
change your ~/.mailagent configuration to force the
~/.i_am_sick message, regardless of what the various rules
have to say. Actually, this is precisely why this feature
was <br>
added, amazing... :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VARIABLES <br>
The following variables are paid attention to: they may come
from the environment or be set in the rule file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mailfilter <br>
indicates where loaded patterns are to be looked for, if the
name of the file is not fully qualified. If it is not set,
maildir will be used instead. If maildir is not <br>
set either, the home directory is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maildir is the location of your
mail folders. Any relative path is understood as starting
from maildir. If it is not set, ~/Mail is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Those variables remain active
while in the scope of the rule file. Should an alternate
rule file be used (via rules hook or the APPLY command), the
current values are propagated <br>
to the new rule set unless overridden in the alternate rule
file. In any case, the previous value is restored when
control is transferred back to the previous set of rules.
That <br>
is, those variables are dynamically instead of statically
scoped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTOMATIC ACKNOWLEDGMENTS <br>
Anywhere in the mail, there can be an @RR left-justified
line which will send back an acknowledgment to the sender of
the mail. The @RR may optionally be followed by an address,
<br>
in which case the acknowledgment will be sent to that
address instead. In fact (but let&rsquo;s keep that a
secret), this is a way for me to be able to see who runs my
mailagent pro&acirc; <br>
gram and who doesn&rsquo;t...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sendmail program usually
implements such a feature via a Return-Receipt-To: header
line, which sends the whole header back upon successful
delivery. However, this is not <br>
implemented on all mail transport agents, and @RR is a good
alternative :-).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTA BENE <br>
Throughout this manual page, I have always written header
fields with the first letter of each word uppercased, as in
Return-Receipt-To. But RFC-822 does not impose this spelling
<br>
convention, and a mailer could legally rewrite the previous
field as return-receipt-to (and in fact so does sendmail in
its own private mail queue files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, you must always specify
the headers in what could be called a normalized case (for
headers anyway). The mailagent will correctly recognize cc:,
CC: or Cc: in a mail mes&acirc; <br>
sage and will allow you to select those fields via the
normalized Cc: selector. In fact, it operates the
normalization for you, and a cc: selector would not be
recognized as <br>
such. Of course, no physical alteration is ever made on the
header itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is also true for headers
specified in the STRIP or KEEP command. If you write STRIP
Cc, it will correctly remove any cc: line. Likewise, if you
use regular expressions to <br>
specify a selector, Re.*: would match both original
received: and Return-path: fields, internally known through
their normalized representation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAIL HOOKS <br>
The mail hooks allow mailagent to transparently invoke some
scripts or perform further processing on the message. Those
hooks are activated via the SAVE, STORE or LEAVE commands.
<br>
Namely, saving in a folder whose executable bit is set will
raise a special processing. By default, the folder is taken
as a program where the mail should be piped to. If the <br>
&quot;folder&quot; program returns a zero status, then the
message is considered saved by the mailagent. Otherwise, all
the processing attached to failed save commands is started
(includ&acirc; <br>
ing emergency saving attempts). Executable folders provide a
transparent way (from the rule file point of view) to deal
with special kind of messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In fact, five different types of
hooks are available. The first one is the plain executable
folder we have just spoken about. But in fact, here is what
really happens when a sav&acirc; <br>
ing command detects an executable folder: the mailagent
scans the first line of the folder (in fact, the first 128
bytes) and looks for something starting with #: and followed
by <br>
a single word, describing a special kind of hook. This is
similar in the way the kernel deals with the #! hook in
executable programs. If no #: is found or #: is followed by
<br>
some garbage, then mailagent decides it is a simple program
and feeds the mail message to this program. End of the
story.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But if the #: token is followed
(spaces allowed, case is irrelevant) by one of the following
words, then special actions are taken:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rules The file holds a set of
mailagent rules which are to be applied. A new mailagent
process is created to actually deal with those and the exit
status is propagated back <br>
to the original mailagent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">audit This is similar in spirit
to what Martin Streicher&rsquo;s audit.pl package does,
hence the name of this hook. The special variables which are
set up by the PERL filter com&acirc; <br>
mands are initialized and the script is loaded in the
special mailhook package name space, which also gives you an
interface to the mailagent&rsquo;s own routines. You may
<br>
safely use the exit function here, since an extra fork is
done. This is the only difference between an audit and a
perl hook.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deliver Same thing as for the
audit hook, but the standard output of your script is
monitored by mailagent and understood as mailagent filtering
commands. Upon successful <br>
return, a mailagent process will be invoked to actually
execute those commands on the message. Again, this is
similar in spirit to Chip Salzenberg&rsquo;s deliver package
and <br>
gave the name of this hook.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl This hook is the same as
audit but it is executed without forking a new mailagent,
and you have the perl interface to mailagent&rsquo;s
filtering commands. There is no dif&acirc; <br>
ference with the PERL command, because it is implemented
that way, by calling a mailagent and forcing the PERL
command to be executed. This is similar in spirit to <br>
Larry Wall&rsquo;s famous perl language and it is
responsible for the name of this hook :-).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As mentioned earlier in this
manual page, the hook is invoked from with the home
directory specified in your ~/.mailagent (which may differ
from your real home directory, as far <br>
as mailagent or mailhook are concerned).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For those hooks which are
finally ran by perl, the special @INC array has
mailagent&rsquo;s own private library path prepended to it,
so that require first looks in this place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FOLDERS <br>
A folder is a file or a directory which can be the target of
a delivery by the mailagent, that is to say the argument of
SAVE-like commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Folder Format <br>
By default, mails are written into folders according to the
standard UNIX-style mailbox format: each mail starts with a
leading From line bearing the sender&rsquo;s address and the
<br>
date. However, by setting the mmdf parameter from the
~/.mailagent to ON, the mailagent will be able to save
messages in MMDF format: each message is sandwiched between
two lines <br>
of four Ctrl-A characters (ASCII code 1) and the leading
From line is removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When MMDF mode is activated,
each folder will be scanned to see if it is a UNIX-style or
MMDF-style mailbox and the message will be saved
accordingly. When saving to a new <br>
folder, the default is to create a UNIX-style mailbox,
unless the mmdfbox configuration variable was set to ON, in
which case the MMDF format prevails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the MMDF format is
also the standard for MH packed folders, so by enabling the
MMDF mode, you can actually deliver directly to those packed
folders. The MH command inc <br>
is able to incorporate mail from either form anyway, i.e. it
does not matter whether the folder is in UNIX format (also
called UUCP-style) or in MMDF format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MH-style folders are also
supported. It is mainly a directory in which messages are
stored in individual files. To save directly into an MH
folder, simply prefix the folder name <br>
with &rsquo;+&rsquo;, just as you would do with MH commands.
The unseen sequences specified in your MH profile (the
mhprofile parameter in your ~/.mailagent, default is
~/.mh_profile) will <br>
be correctly updated, as rcvstore would.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the target folder is a
directory, mailagent attempts the delivery in an individual
numbered file. If a prefix file is present (config parameter
msgprefix, default is <br>
.msg_prefix), its first line is used to specify the base
name of the message, then a number is appended to give the
name of the message file to use. That is, if there is no
such <br>
file, the folder will look like an MH one, without any MH
sequence file though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Folder Compression <br>
If you have one or more of the widely available file
compression utilities such as compress or gzip in your PATH
(as set up by ~/.mailagent), then you may wish to use folder
com&acirc; <br>
pression to save some disk space, especially when you are
away for some time and do not want to see your mail fill-up
the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To achieve folder compression,
you have to set up a file, referred to by the compress
configuration variable. This file must list folder names,
one per line, with blank lines <br>
ignored and shell-style (#) comments allowed. You may use
shell-style patterns to specify the folders, and the match
will be attempted on the full pathname of the folder (~
sub&acirc; <br>
stitution occurs). If you do not specify a pattern starting
with a leading &rsquo;/&rsquo; character, then the match
will be attempted on the basename of the folder (i.e. the
last component <br>
of the folder path). If you want to compress all your
folders, then simply put a single &rsquo;*&rsquo; inside
this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mailagent uses the filename
extension to determine what compression scheme is used for a
particular folder. The file referred to by the compspecs
configuration variable (default <br>
is $spool/compressors) is used to define the commands that
mailagent will use to perform the compress, uncompress, and
cat operations for a particular extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compressors file holds lines
of the following form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tag extension compression_prog
uncompress_prog cat_prog</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tag is the logical name for the
compression scheme. This is typically the same as the name
of the program used to provide the compression, but could be
different for some <br>
unforeseen reason. This must be unique across all records in
the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extension is the extension to
recognize as belonging to the specified tag. This must be
unique across all records in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compression_prog <br>
is the name of the command to run to compress a folder. The
program must replace the uncompressed file with the
compressed one with the extension appended to the
file&acirc; <br>
name (like compress or gzip).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uncompression_prog <br>
is the name of the command to run to uncompress a folder.
The program must replace the compressed file with the
uncompressed one without the extension (like uncompress <br>
or gunzip).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat_prog is the name of the
command to output the uncompressed contents of a compressed
folder to stdout (like zcat or gzcat).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fields are separated by TABS
to allow for the use of space characters in the command
fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file referred to by the
compspecs configuration variable cannot be accessed for
whatever reason, a default entry is hard-wired into
mailagent (knows about both compress <br>
and gzip programs):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compress &lt;TAB&gt; .Z
&lt;TAB&gt; compress &lt;TAB&gt; uncompress &lt;TAB&gt; zcat
<br>
gzip &lt;TAB&gt; .gz &lt;TAB&gt; gzip &lt;TAB&gt; gunzip
&lt;TAB&gt; gunzip -c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish to add more
compressors, you can copy the default compressors file from
mailagent&rsquo;s private library directory and setup a
correct entry for your alternate compressor. <br>
Keep in mind that the trailing extension needs to be unique
amongst all the listed programs, since that extension is
used to determine the type of compression performed on the
<br>
folder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the folder is created without
any existing compressed form around, a default compressor is
selected for you, as defined by the comptag configuration
variable. That refers to <br>
the tag name of the compspecs file, i.e. the first word on
the line (usually the name of the compression program, but
not necessarily).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When attempting delivery,
mailagent will check the folder name against the list of
patterns in the compress file. If there is a match, the
folder is flagged as compressed. Then <br>
mailagent attempts decompression if there is already a
compressed form (ie. the file has a recognized filename
extension) and if no uncompressed form is present. Delivery
is <br>
then made to the uncompressed folder. However,
re-compression is not done immediately, since it is still
possible to get messages to that folder in a single batch
delivery. <br>
Should disk space become so tight that decompression of
other folders is impossible, mailagent will re-compress the
folders it has already uncompressed. Otherwise, it waits
until <br>
the last moment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If for some reason there is a
compressed folder which cannot be decompressed, mailagent
will deliver the mail to the plain folder. Further delivery
to that folder will be faced <br>
with both a compressed and a plain version of the folder,
and that will get you a warning in the log file, but
delivery will be made automatically to the plain file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On newly created folders the
comptag configuration variable is referenced to determine
the compression type to use for the folder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAIL BIFFING <br>
If you are receiving and processing mail on your own
machine, then you have access to local mail biffing where
mailagent can warn you about new messages and tell you about
where <br>
they have been saved, printing a small subset of the header
and the first few lines of the body.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use biffing, all you need is
the setting of the few biff parameters in your ~/.mailagent
and make sure biff is set to ON. Actually, this is the only
parameter you need to set <br>
to get minimal default biffing behaviour. Don&rsquo;t forget
to run the shell command &quot;biff y&quot; on the terminals
where you want to get notification (you may do that on
several ttys, one <br>
for each virtual display for instance).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upon mail reception and saving
on a folder or posting to a newsgroup, mailagent locates all
the ttys where you are logged on, then selects those where
biffing was requested, <br>
finally emitting a message and making a beeping sound (if
your terminal supports this and you are using the standard
format--see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Customizing Biffing Output <br>
Should the default format not suit your needs, you may
customize the biffing message freely, setting the biffmsg
parameter to point to the file where the format is stored.
Stan&acirc; <br>
dard macros substitutions will be performed on your message,
the following macro set superseding and completing the
standard set:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%-A Same as writing %-H, new
line, %-B <br>
%-B The body part of the biffing message, with
content-transfer-encoding removed. If the message is a MIME
multipart one, the text/plain part is shown. If only a <br>
text/html part is available, the HTML markup is stripped for
biffing. <br>
%-H The header part of the biffing message. If shows only
From:, To: Subject: and Date: headers, or whatever you have
set the biffhead configuration variable to. All head&acirc;
<br>
ers are showed as one line of text, regardless of their
actual length. There will be three trailing dots at the end
to signal that truncation occurred. For a news <br>
article (biffing after a POST -b), the To: and Cc: fields
are never shown, even if specified in biffhead. <br>
%-T Same as %-B, but trimming is activated. The purpose of
trimming is to remove any leading quotation in the message,
to get only the most meaningful part. This assumes <br>
the quoting character is a single non-alphanumeric
character. The leading attribution line that may introduce
the quotation can be also removed, and a minimum length <br>
for the quotation can be set in the configuration file. <br>
%B The relative path under %d of the message folder, full
path (%p) if not saved under that directory. The newsgroup
name for news articles. <br>
%D The directory where the message is stored. If an MH
folder, this is the folder full path. The home directory is
replaced by a ~. Empty for news articles. <br>
%F The base name (last path component) of the message. For
an MH message, this is the message number. Empty for news
articles. <br>
%P The folder path. It has the correct semantics for MH and
directory folders, i.e. it points to the folder directory
itself. Otherwise, the same as %p. <br>
%a Alarm characters (^G). May expand to more than one under
the control of the BEEP filtering command. Use %b if you
only want a single bell. <br>
%b A beeping character (^G). As opposed to %a, this only
expands to give one bell. <br>
%d Full path where folders such as the one being saved into
are stored if not qualified (i.e. your MH path for MH
folders, of something like ~/Mail for other folders). <br>
Empty for news articles. <br>
%f Folder where mail was saved, home replaced by ~ for
short. The newsgroup when article was posted for news. <br>
%m A &rsquo;+&rsquo; sign if the folder is an MH one, empty
otherwise. <br>
%p The full path name (same as %f) of the message, but
without any ~ shortcut. The newsgroup name for news
articles. <br>
%t The type of message: usually &quot;mail&quot;, but set to
&quot;article&quot; for biffing after a POST command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can get the standard macro
expansion by using %:f for instance, since the %f macro is
superseded. The %: form lets you obtain the standard macro
definition anyway, no matter <br>
what, so you don&rsquo;t have to remember whether a given
macro is superseded in this context or not. Besides, it is
safer since new macros may be added here without notice.
Note <br>
that macros related to the message content all start with %-
and therefore are not conflicting with standard one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is the format you need to
use to get the same behaviour as the default hardwired
format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%b <br>
New %t for %u has arrived in %f: <br>
---- <br>
%-A <br>
----%b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the string ...more...
appears at the end of the body when it has not been
completely printed out on the screen and the remaining lines
are not blank or similar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trimming Leading Quotation <br>
It is a standard practice, when replying to a message, to
include an excerpt of the sentences being replied-to, using
a non-alphanumeric character such as &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; to
prefix quoted <br>
lines. Something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quoting John Doe: <br>
&gt; This is quoted material. <br>
&gt; Another line from John&rsquo;s mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is part of the reply to
John.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The leading &quot;Quoting
...&quot; line, called the attribution line, is optional and
may be missing or take another free form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, when biffing, this may
be seen as useless noise, especially nowadays where people
freely quote more and more in their replies. Since the biff
message only shows the top <br>
lines of the message, it may be desirable to automatically
trim those quoted lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Via the %-T macro in the
customized biff format, you may request trimming of the
leading quotation material, keeping the attribution line or
not, and even replace trimmed mate&acirc; <br>
rial with a notification that so many lines have been
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All this customization is done
from the ~/.mailagent configuration file, using the
bifftrim, bifftrlen and biffquote variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You first need to turn trimming
on by using a customized biff format using the %-T macro. By
setting bifftrlen to 3, you may request that only quotations
of at least 3 lines be <br>
trimmed. Turning bifftrim off will remove the trimming
notification, whilst turning biffquote off will also strip
the attribution line, when present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, assuming the
following settings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bifftrim : ON <br>
bifftrlen: 2 <br>
biffquote: OFF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then the above example would
produce the following biffing output (header of the message
not withstanding):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[trimmed 3 lines starting with a
leading &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; character &amp; attribution line]
<br>
This is part of the reply to John.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">because the blank line following
the quoted material is counted as being part of the
quotation. The &quot;[trimmed ..]&quot; message can be
turned off by setting bifftrim to OFF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The trimming algorithm considers
the first line of the body to see if it starts with a
non-alphanumeric character. If it does, then all the
following lines starting with that <br>
same character, or any blank line is removed, up to the
first non-blank line starting with another character.
Optionally, the first line (and that line only) is skipped
if the <br>
second one starts with a non-alphanumeric character, and the
first line is taken as being the attribution line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using Compact MH-style Biffing
<br>
The so-called MH-style biffing is a way of presenting a
compacted body where all the lines are joined together into
a big happy string with successive spaces turned into a
single <br>
space character. To enable it, you need to set the biffmh
variable to ON.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since this compacting is output
verbatim on the tty, line breaks will occur randomly and
this may make reading difficult. You may request an
automatic reformatting of the com&acirc; <br>
pacted body by turning biffnice to ON and the biff output
will fit nicely within the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately, it is not
possible to customize the amount of columns that should be
used for formatting: since you may biff to any tty you are
logged on, that would force maila&acirc; <br>
gent to probe the tty for its column size, for each possible
tty where output may go, and there is no reliable portable
way of doing that. Sorry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDING FILTERING COMMANDS
<br>
Once you&rsquo;ve reached the expert level, and provided you
have a fair knowledge of perl, you may feel the need for
more advanced commands which are not part of the standard
set. <br>
This section explains how you can achieve this dynamically,
without the need of diving deep inside the source code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you have extended the
filtering command set, you may use those commands inside the
rule file as if they were built-in. You may even choose to
redefine the standard commands <br>
if they do not suit you (however, if you wish to do that,
you should know exactly what you are doing, or you may start
losing some mail or get an unexpected behavior -- this also
<br>
voids your warranty :-).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ability to provide external
commands without actually modifying the main source code is,
I believe, a strong point in favor of having a program
written in an interpreted lan&acirc; <br>
guage like perl. This of course once you have convinced
yourself that it is a Good Thing to customize and extend a
program in the same language as the one used for the core,
<br>
meaning usually a fairly low-level language with fewer
user-friendly hooks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overview <br>
In order to implement a new command, say FOLD, you will need
to do the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Write a perl
subroutine to implement the FOLD action and put that into an
external file. Say we write the subroutine fold and we store
that in a fold.pl file. This is natu&acirc; <br>
rally the difficult part, where you need to know some basic
things about mailagent internals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Choose where you
want to store your fold.pl file. Then check the syntax with
perl -c, just to be sure...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Edit the newcmd
file (as given by the configuration file) to record your new
command. Then make sure this file is tightly protected. You
must own it, and it should not be <br>
writable by any other individual but you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Additionally,
you may want to specify whether FOLD is to modify the
existing execution status and whether or not it will be
allowed within the special _SEEN_ state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Write some rules
using the new FOLD command. This is the easy part! Note that
your command may also be used within perl hooks as if it
were a builtin command (this means <br>
there is an interface function built for you within the
mailhook package).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following sections,
we&rsquo;re going to describe the syntax of the newcmd file,
and we&rsquo;ll then present some low-level internal
variables which may be used when implementing new <br>
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Command File Format <br>
The newcmd file consists of a series of lines, each line
describing one command. Blank lines are ignored and
shell-style comments introduced by the sharp (#) character
are <br>
allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each line is formed by 3
principal fields and 2 optional ones; fields are separated
by spaces or tabs. Here is a skeleton:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;cmd_name&gt; &lt;path&gt;
&lt;function&gt; &lt;status_flag&gt; &lt;seen_flag&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The cmd_name is the name of the
command you wish to add. In our previous example, it would
be FOLD. The next field, path, tells mailagent where the
file containing the command <br>
implementation is located. Say we store it in
~/mail/cmds/fold.pl. The function field is the name of the
perl function implementing FOLD, which may be found in
fold.pl. Here, we <br>
named our function fold. Note that if your function has its
name within the newcmd package, which is the default
behavior if you do not specify any, then there is no need to
pre&acirc; <br>
fix the function name with the package. Otherwise, you must
use a fully qualified name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last two fields are
optional, and are boolean values which may be specified by
true or yes to express truth, and false or no to express
falsehood. If status_flag is set to <br>
true, then the command will modify the last execution status
variable. If seen_flag is true, then the command may be used
when the filter is in _SEEN_ state. The default values <br>
are respectively true and false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So in our example, we would have
written:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FOLD ~/mail/cmds/fold.pl fold no
yes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to allow FOLD even in _SEEN_
state and have it executed without modifying the current
value of the last-command-status variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Writing An Implementation <br>
Your perl function will be loaded when needed into the
special package newcmd, so that its own name-space is
protected and does not accidentally conflict with other
mailagent <br>
routines or variables. When you need to call the perl
interface of some common mailagent functions, you will have
to remember to use the fully qualified routine name, for
<br>
instance &amp;mailhook&rsquo;leave to actually execute the
LEAVE command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Normally, in PERL hooks, there
is no need for this prefixing since the perl script is
loaded in the mailhook package. When you are extending your
mailagent, you should be extra <br>
careful however, and it does not really hurt to use this
prefixing. You are free to use the perl package directive
within your function, hence switching to the mailhook
package <br>
in the body of the routine but leaving its name in the
newcmd package.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since mailagent will dynamically
load the implementation of your command the first time it is
run, by loading the specified perl script into memory and
evaluating it, I suggest <br>
you put each command implementation in a separate file, to
avoid storing potentially unneeded code in memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each command is called with one
argument, namely the full command string as read from the
filter rules. Additionally, the special @ARGV array is set
by performing a shell-style <br>
parsing of the command line (which will fail if quotes are
mismatched, but then you can do the parsing by yourself
since you get the command line). At the end of your routine,
<br>
you must return a failure status, i.e. 0 for success and 1
to signal failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Those are your only
requirements. You are free to do whatever you want inside
the routine. To ease your task however, some variables are
pre-computed for you, the same ones that <br>
are made available within mail hooks, only they are defined
within the newcmd package this time. There are also a few
special variables which you need to know about, and a set of
<br>
standard routines you may want to call. Please avoid calling
something which is not documented here, since it may change
without prior notice. If you would like to use one
rou&acirc; <br>
tine and it is not documented in this manual page, please
let me know.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each command is called from
within an eval construct, so you may safely use die or call
external library routines that use die. If you use require,
be aware that mailagent is <br>
setting up a special @INC array by putting its private
library path first, so you may place all your
mailagent-related library files in this place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special Variables <br>
The following special variables (some of them marked
read-only, meaning you shouldn&rsquo;t modify them, and
indeed you can&rsquo;t) made available directly within the
newcmd package, are <br>
pre-set by the filter automaton, and are used to control the
filtering process:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$mfile The base name of the mail
file being processed. This variable is read-only. It is
mainly used in log messages, as in [$mfile] to tag each log,
since a single <br>
mailagent process may deal with multiple messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ever_saved This is a boolean,
which should be set to 1 once a successful saving operation
has been completed. If at the end of the filtering, this
variable is still 0, then <br>
the default LEAVE will be executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$folder_saved The value of that
variable governs the $msgpath convenience variable set for
PERL escapes. It is updated whenever a message is written to
a file, to hold the path <br>
of the written file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$cont This is the continuation
status, a variable of the utmost importance when dealing
with the control flow. Four constants from the main package
can be used to spec&acirc; <br>
ify whether we should continue with the current rule
($FT_CONT), abandon current rule ($FT_REJECT), restart
filtering from the beginning ($FT_RESTART) or simply <br>
abort processing ($FT_ABORT). More on this later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$lastcmd The last failure status
recorded by the last command (among those which do modify
the execution status). You should not have to update this by
yourself unless you <br>
are implementing some encapsulation for other commands, like
BACK or ONCE, since by default $lastcmd will be set to the
value you return at the end of the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$wmode This records the current
state of the filter automaton (working mode), in a literal
string form, typically modified by the BEGIN command or as a
side effect, as in <br>
REJECT for instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the special variables set-up
for PERL escapes are also installed within the newcmd
package. Those are $login, %header, etc... You may peruse
them at will.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other variables you might have a
need for are configuration parameters, held in the
~/.mailagent configuration file. Well, the rule is simple.
The value of each parameter param <br>
from the configuration file is held in variable
$cf&rsquo;param. Variable $main&rsquo;loglvl is the copy of
$cf&rsquo;level, since it&rsquo;s always shorter to type in
$&rsquo;loglvl after each call to the <br>
logging routine &amp;add_log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is one more variable worth
knowing about: $main&rsquo;FILTER, which is the suitable
X-Filter line that should be appended in all the mail you
send via mailagent, in order to <br>
avoid loops. Also when you save mails to a folder,
it&rsquo;s wise adding this line in case a problem arises:
you may then identify the culprit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rule Environment <br>
An action might have a legitimate desire of altering the
environment for the scope of one rule only, reverting to the
previous value when exiting the rule. Or you might want to
<br>
change the value forever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When we speak about altering the
environment, we refer to the one set up via the
configuration file, whose values end-up in the cf package.
Well, some of those variables are <br>
copied in the env package before filtering of a message
starts (under the control of the @env&rsquo;Env array).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All rules should then refer to
the version in the env package, and not in the cf package,
to see alterations. Global changes are made by affecting
directly to the variable in the <br>
env package, while local changes are requested by calling
the &amp;env&rsquo;local routine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, the cf&rsquo;umask
value is copied as env&rsquo;umask because umask is held in
@env&rsquo;Env. Global changes are made by setting that copy
directly, while local changes may be made <br>
with:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;env&rsquo;local(&rsquo;umask&rsquo;,
0722);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to set-up a new local value. The
first time &amp;env&rsquo;local is called on a variable, its
value is saved somewhere, and will be restored upon exiting
the scope of the rule. Then the <br>
new value is affected to the variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variables requiring a side
effect when their value is changed (such as the umask
variable, which requires a system call to let the kernel see
the change) may specify it by <br>
accessing the %env&rsquo;Spec array, the key being the name
of the variable requiring a side effect, the value being
interpreted as a bit of perl code ran once the original
value is <br>
restored. For instance, we say somewhere (in
&amp;env&rsquo;init):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package env; <br>
$Spec{&rsquo;umask&rsquo;} =
&rsquo;umask($umask)&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to update the kernel view when
leaving scope. Note that the side effect is evaluated once
the variable has recovered its original value, and within
the env package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internally, the
&amp;analyze_mail routine calls &amp;env&rsquo;setup before
starting its processing to initialize the env package, and
&amp;env&rsquo;cleanup at the end before returning. Before
running <br>
the actions specified on a rule match, &amp;apply_rules
calls &amp;env&rsquo;restore to ensure a coherent view of
the environment while running the actions for that
particular rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Altering Control Flow <br>
When you want to alter control flow to perform a REJECT, a
RESTART or an ABORT, you have three choices. If you wish to
control that action via an option, the same way the
stan&acirc; <br>
dard UNIQUE does (with -c, -r or -a), you may call
&amp;main&rsquo;alter_execution(option, state) giving it two
parameters: the option letter and the state you wish to
change to before <br>
altering the control flow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may also want to directly
alter the $wmode and $cont variables, but then you&rsquo;ll
have to do your own logging if you want some. Or you may
call low-level routines <br>
&amp;main&rsquo;do_reject, &amp;main&rsquo;do_restart and
&amp;main&rsquo;do_abort to perform the corresponding
operation (with logging).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remember that the _SEEN_ state
is special and directly handled at the filter level, and the
filter begins in the INITIAL state. The default action is to
continue with the current <br>
rule, which is why there is no routine to perform this
task.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The preferred way is to invoke
the mailhook interface functions, &amp;mailhook&rsquo;begin,
&amp;mailhook&rsquo;reject, etc..., and that will work even
if you redefine those functions yourself. <br>
Besides, that&rsquo;s the only interface which is likely not
to be changed by new versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General Purpose Routines <br>
The following is a list of all the general routines you may
wish to call when performing some low-level tasks. Note that
this information is version-dependent. Since I document <br>
them, I&rsquo;ll try to keep them in new versions, but I
cannot guarantee I will not have to slightly change some of
their semantics. There is a good chance you will never have
to <br>
worry about that anyway.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;header&rsquo;format(rfc822-field)
<br>
Return a formatted RFC822 field to fit in 78 columns, with
proper continuations introduced by eight spaces.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;header&rsquo;normalize(rfc822-header-name)
<br>
Normalize case in RFC822 header and return the new header
name with every first letter uppercased.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;header&rsquo;reset <br>
This is part of an RFC822 header validation, mainly used
when splitting a digest. This resets the recognition
automaton (see &amp;header&rsquo;valid).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;header&rsquo;valid(line)
<br>
Returns a boolean status, indicating if all the lines given
so far to this function since the last
&amp;header&rsquo;reset are part of a valid RFC822 header.
The function under&acirc; <br>
stands the first From line which is part of UNIX mails. At
any time, the variable $header&rsquo;maybe may be checked to
see if so far we have found at least one essential <br>
mail header field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;main&rsquo;acs_rqst(file)
<br>
Perform a .lock locking on the file, returning 0 on success
and -1 on failure. If an old lock was present, it is removed
(time limit set to one hour). Use <br>
&amp;main&rsquo;free_file to release the lock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;main&rsquo;add_log(string)
<br>
Add the string to the logfile. The usual idiom is to postfix
that call with the if $&rsquo;loglvl &gt; value, where value
is the logging level you wish to have before emitting <br>
that kind of log ($&rsquo;loglvl is a short form for
$main&rsquo;loglvl).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;main&rsquo;free_file(file)
<br>
Remove a .lock on a file, obtained by
&amp;main&rsquo;acs_rqst. It returns 0 if the lock was
successfully removed, -1 if it was a stale lock (obtained by
someone else).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;main&rsquo;header_found(file)
<br>
Scan the head of a file and try to determine whether there
is a mail header at the beginning or not. Return true if a
header was found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;main&rsquo;history_record
<br>
Record the message ID of the current message and return 0 if
the message had not been previously seen, 1 if it is a
duplicate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;main&rsquo;hostname <br>
Return the value of the hostname, lowercased, with possible
domain name appended to it. The hostname is cached, since
its value must initially be obtained by forking. <br>
(see also &amp;main&rsquo;myhostname)</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;main&rsquo;internet_info(email-address)
<br>
Parse an e-mail internet address and return a three-element
array containing the host, the domain and the country part
of the internet host. For instance, if the <br>
address is user@d.c.b.a, it will return (c, b, a).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;main&rsquo;login_name(email-address)
<br>
Parse the e-mail internet address and return the login
name.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;main&rsquo;macros_subst(*line)
<br>
Perform in-place macro substitution (line passed as a type
glob) using the information currently held in the
%main&rsquo;Header array. Do not pass *_ as a parameter,
since <br>
internally macros_subst uses a local variable bearing that
name to perform the substitutions and you would end up with
an unmodified version. If you really want to pass <br>
*_, then you must use the returned value from macros_subst
which is the substituted text, but that&rsquo;s less
efficient than having it modified in place.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;main&rsquo;makedir(pathname,
mode) <br>
Make directory, creating all the intermediate directories
needed to make pathname a valid directory. Has no effect if
the directory already exists. The mode parameter <br>
is optional, 0700 is used (octal number) if not
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;main&rsquo;myhostname <br>
Returns the hostname of the current machine, without any
domain name. The hostname is cached, since its value must
initially be obtained by forking.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;main&rsquo;run_command(filter-command)
<br>
Execute the single filter command specified and return the
continuation status, which should normally be affected to
the $cont variable. You will need this routine when <br>
trying to implement commands which encapsulate other
commands, like ONCE or SELECT.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;main&rsquo;seconds_in_period(period)
<br>
Return the number of seconds in the period specified. See
section Specifying A Period to get valid period strings.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;main&rsquo;shell_command(program,
input, feedback) <br>
Run a shell command and return a failure status (0 for OK).
The input parameter may be one of the following constants
(defined in the main package): $NO_INPUT to close <br>
standard input, $BODY_INPUT to pipe the body of the current
message, $MAIL_INPUT to pipe the whole mail as-is,
$MAIL_INPUT_BINARY to pipe the whole mail after having <br>
removed any content transfer-encoding and $HEADER_INPUT to
pipe the message header. The feedback parameter may be one
of $FEEDBACK or $NO_FEEDBACK depending whether or <br>
not you wish to use the standard output to alter the
corresponding part of the message. If no feedback is wanted,
the output of the command is mailed back to the user. <br>
The $FEEDBACK_ENCODING is handled like $FEEDBACK but will
tell mailagent to look at the best suitable body encoding
when the input is the whole message.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;main&rsquo;parse_address(rfc822-address)
<br>
Parse an RFC822 e-mail address and return a two-elements
array containing the internet address and the comment part
of that address.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;main&rsquo;xeqte(filter-actions)
<br>
Execute a series of actions separated by the &rsquo;;&rsquo;
character, calling run_command to actually perform the job.
Return the continuation status. Note that $FT_ABORT will
<br>
never be returned, since mailagent usually stops after
having executed one set of actions, only continuing if it
saw an RESTART or a REJECT. What ABORT does is skipping <br>
the remaining commands on the line and exiting as if all the
commands had been run. You could say xeqte is the equivalent
of the eval function in perl, since it inter&acirc; <br>
prets a little filter script and returns control to the
caller once finished, and ABORT is perl&rsquo;s die.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may also use the three
functions from the extern package which manipulate
persistent variables (already documented in the section
dealing with variables) as well as the user- <br>
defined macro routines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example <br>
Writing your own commands is not easy, since it requires
some basic knowledge regarding mailagent internals. However,
once you are familiar with that, it should be relatively
<br>
straightforward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a small example. We want
to write a command to bounce back a mail message to the
original sender, the way sendmail does, with some leading
text to explain what happened. <br>
The command would have the following syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SENDBACK reason</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and we would like that command
to modify the existing status, returning a failure if the
mail cannot be bounced back. Since this command actually
sends something back, we do not <br>
want it to be executed in the _SEEN_ state. Here is my
implementation (untested):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub sendback { <br>
local($cmd_line) = @_; <br>
local($reason) = join(&rsquo; &rsquo;, @ARGV[1..$#ARGV]);
<br>
unless (open(MAILER, &quot;|/usr/lib/sendmail -odq
-t&quot;)) { <br>
&amp;&rsquo;add_log(&quot;ERROR cannot run sendmail to send
message&quot;) <br>
if $&rsquo;loglvl; <br>
return 1; <br>
} <br>
print MAILER &lt;&lt;EOF; <br>
From: mailagent <br>
To: $header{&rsquo;Sender&rsquo;} <br>
Subject: Returned mail: Mailagent failure <br>
$main&rsquo;FILTER</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--- Transcript Of Session</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$reason</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--- Unsent Message Follows</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$header{&rsquo;All&rsquo;} <br>
EOF <br>
close MAILER; <br>
$ever_saved = 1; # Don&rsquo;t want it in mailbox <br>
$? == 0 ? 0 : 1; # Failure status <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assuming this command is put
into ~/mail/cmds/sendback.pl, the line describing it in the
newcmd file would be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SENDBACK ~/mail/cmds/sendback.pl
sendback yes no</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now this command may be used
freely in any rule, and will be logged as a user-defined
command by the command dispatcher. Who said it was not easy
to do? :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note the use of the $ever_saved
variable to mark the mail as saved once it has been bounced.
Indeed, should the SENDBACK action be the only one action to
be run, we do not want <br>
mailagent to LEAVE the mail in the mailbox because it has
never been saved (this default behavior being a precaution
only -- better safe than sorry).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conclusion <br>
If along the way you imagine some useful commands which
could be made part of the standard command set, please
e-mail them to me and I&rsquo;ll consider integrating them.
In the <br>
future, I would also like to provide a standard library of
perl scripts to implement some weird commands which could be
needed in special cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that you may also use the
information presented here inside the perl escape scripts.
Via the require operator, it is easy to get the new command
implementation into your <br>
script and perform the same task. You will maybe need to set
up @ARGV by yourself if you rely on that feature in your
command implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command extension can also be
viewed as a way to reuse some other perl code, the mailagent
providing a fixed and reliable frame and the external
program providing the service. <br>
One immediate extension would be mailing list handling,
using this mechanism to interface with some mailing list
management software written in perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERIC MAIL SERVER <br>
One nice thing about mailagent is that it provides you with
the basic tools to implement a generic mail server. Indeed,
via the SERVER command, you can process a mail message, <br>
extract and then execute some predefined commands. For
instance, you may implement an archive server, or a mailing
list manager, etc...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The major limitation currently
is that only plain commands are accepted, or commands taking
some additional info as standard input or equivalent. There
is no notion of modes, <br>
with separate command sets for each mode or limited
name-space visibility, at least for now, so it is not easy
(albeit possible) to implement an ftpmail server, for
instance, <br>
since this implies the notion of mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overview <br>
In order to implement a mail server command (say send file,
which would send an arbitrary file from the file system in a
separate mail message), you need to do the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Think about the
command from a security point of view. Here, the command we
want to implement is a potentially dangerous one since it
can give access to any file on the <br>
machine the individual running mailagent has access to. So
we want to restrict that command to a limited number of
trusted people, who will be granted the power to run this
<br>
command. More on this later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Choose whether
you want to implement the command in perl or in another
programming language. If you do the latter, your command
will be known as a shell command (i.e. a com&acirc; <br>
mand runnable directly from a shell), while in the former
case, you have the choice of making it appear as a shell
command, or have it hooked to the mailagent in which case
<br>
it is known as a perl command. In that last case, your
command will be dynamically loaded into mailagent with all
the advantages that brings you. Here, we are going to write
<br>
our command as a shell script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Write the
command itself. That&rsquo;s the most difficult part in this
scheme. Later on, we will see a straightforward
implementation of the send command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Edit the
comserver file (defined in your ~/.mailagent) to record your
new command. Then make sure this file is tightly protected.
You must own it, and be the only one <br>
allowed to modify it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Additionally,
you may want to hide some of the arguments in the session
transcript (more on this later), allow the command to take a
flow of data as its standard input, <br>
assign a path to the command, etc... All those parameters
take place in your comserver file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Start using the
command... which of course is the nicest part in this
scheme!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following sections,
we&rsquo;ll learn about the syntax of the comserver file,
what powers are, how the session transcript is built, what
the command environment is, etc...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Builtin Commands Overview <br>
The mail server has a limited set of builtin commands,
dealing with user authentication and command environment
settings. User authentication is password based and is not
<br>
extremely strong since passwords are specified in clear
within the mail message itself, which could be easily
intercepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server maintains the notion
of powers. One user may have more than one power at a time,
each power granting only a limited access to some sensitive
area. A few powers are <br>
hardwired in the server, but the user may create new ones
when necessary. Those powers are software-enforced, meaning
the command must check for itself whether is has the
neces&acirc; <br>
sary power(s) to perform correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Powers are protected by a
password and a clearance file. Having the good password is
not enough, you have to be cleared in order to (ab)use it.
The clearance file is a list of e- <br>
mail address patterns, using the shell metacharacters
scheme, someone being cleared if and only if his e-mail
address matches at least one of the patterns from the
clearance <br>
file. The more use you will make of metacharacters, the
weaker this clearance scheme will be, so be careful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Your commands and the output
resulting from their execution is normally mailed back to
you as a session transcript. For security reasons, passwords
are hidden from the command <br>
line. Likewise, failure to get a power will not indicate
whether you lacked authorization or whether your password
was bad.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A user with the system power is
allowed to create new powers, delete other powers, change
power passwords, and list, remove or change power
clearances. This is somehow an impor&acirc; <br>
tant power which should be detained by a small number of
users with very strict clearance (no meta-characters in the
address, if possible). A good password should also protect
<br>
that power.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, a user with the system
power is not allowed to directly get another power without
specifying its password and being allowed to do so by the
associated clearance file. <br>
But it would be possible to achieve that indirectly by
removing the power and creating a new one bearing the same
name. In order to control people with the system power and
also <br>
for some tricky situation, there is another more god-like
power: the root power.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A user with the root power can
do virtually anything, since it instantly grants that
individual all the powers available on the server (but
security). The only limitation is that <br>
root cannot remove the root power alone. One needs to
specify the security password (another hardwired power) in
order to proceed. Needless to say, only one individual
should <br>
have both root and security clearance, and only one
individual should know the security password and be listed
in the clearance file. The system power cannot harm any of
those <br>
two powers. Eventually, more than one user could have the
root power, but do not grant that lightly...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Getting the root power is
necessary when system has messed with the system
configuration in an hopeless way, or when a long atomic
sequence of commands has to be issued: root is <br>
not subject to the maximum number of command that can be
issued in one single message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In case you think this mailagent
feature is dangerous for your account, do not create the
root and security powers, and do not write any sensitive
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Builtin Commands Definition <br>
Now let&rsquo;s have a look at those builtin commands.
Passwords of sensitive commands will be concealed in the
session transcript. Some commands accept input by reading
the mail mes&acirc; <br>
sage up to the EOF marker, which is a simple EOF string on a
line by itself (analogous with shell&rsquo;s here
documents).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">addauth power password <br>
Add users to clearance file for power. If the power password
is given, no special power is needed, otherwise the system
power is required. For root or security powers, <br>
the corresponding power is required, or the password must be
specified. The command reads the standard input up to the
EOF marker to get the new users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">approve password command <br>
Records the password in the command environment, then
executes the command. If a power is required and not yet
obtained, the command will look for the password in the <br>
environment and try to get the relevant power using that
password. Hence, approved command (with proper password)
will transparently execute without the hassle of <br>
requesting the power, issuing the command and then releasing
the power. It is up to the command to perform the approve
password test by looking at the approve variable <br>
in the command environment (see below). Since clearance
checks (such as those performed when requesting a power) are
not performed, no sensitive command should ever <br>
deal with the approve construct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delpower power password
[security] <br>
Delete a power from the system, and its associated clearance
list. The system power is required to delete most powers
except root and security. The security power may <br>
only be deleted by itself and the root power may only be
deleted when the security password is also specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getauth power password <br>
Get current clearance file for a given power. No special
power required if the password is given or the power is
already detained. Otherwise, the system power is needed <br>
for all powers but root or security where the corresponding
power is mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newpower power password [alias]
<br>
Add a new power to the system. The command then reads the
standard mail input until the EOF marker to get the power
clearance list. The system power is required to cre&acirc;
<br>
ate a new power, unless it&rsquo;s root or security: The
security power is required to create root and the root power
is required to create security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">passwd power old new <br>
Change power password. It does not matter if you already
hold the corresponding power, you must give the proper old
password. See also the password command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password power new <br>
Change power password. The corresponding power is required,
or you have to get the system power. To change the root or
security passwords, you need the corresponding <br>
power.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">power name password <br>
Ask for a new power. Of course, root does not need to
request for any other power but security, less give any
password. This command is not honored when the server is
<br>
not in trusted mode, unbeknownst to the user: the error
message in the transcript file is no different from the one
obtained with an invalid password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">powers regexp <br>
List all the powers matching the perl regular expression,
along with their respective clearance file. The system power
is required to get the list. The root or secu&acirc; <br>
rity power are required to get access to the root or
security information, respectively. If no arguments are
given, all the powers are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">release power <br>
Get rid of some power.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remauth power password <br>
Remove users from clearance file, getting the list by
reading the standard mail input until the EOF marker. This
command does not require any special power if the <br>
proper password is given or if the power is already
detained. Otherwise, the system power is needed. For root
and security clearance, the corresponding power is needed
<br>
as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set variable value <br>
Set the variable to the corresponding value. Useful to alter
internal variables like the EOF marker value, or change some
command environment. The user may define his <br>
own variables for his commands. For flag-type variable, a
value of on, yes or true sets the variable to 1, any other
string sets it to 0 (false). Used all by itself <br>
as set, the list of all the defined variables along with
their respective values is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setauth power password <br>
Replace power clearance file with one obtained from standard
mail input up to the EOF mark. The system power is needed
unless you specify the proper password or the <br>
power is already yours. As usual, root or security
clearances can only be changed when the power is
detained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user [e-mail [command]] <br>
Execute command by assuming the e-mail identity specified.
Powers are lost while executing the command. The e-mail
identity may be checked by the command itself, which <br>
may impose further restrictions on the execution, like
getting user-defined powers. Note that this command only
modifies the global environment, and that it&rsquo;s up to
the <br>
command implementation to make use of that information. If
no command is specified, the new identity is assumed until
changed by another user command and all the powers <br>
currently held by the user are released. If no e-mail
address is given, the original user ID is restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command Environment <br>
There are six types of commands and variables that can be
specified in server mode. Two of them, end and help types
are special and handled separately. Two types var and flag
<br>
refer to variables and the last two types perl and shell
refer to commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whenever mailagent fires a
server command, it sets up an environment for that command:
if it is a perl-type command, then a set of perl variables
are set before loading the com&acirc; <br>
mand; if it is a shell-type command, some environment
variables are initialized and file descriptor #3 is set up
to point directly to the mailagent session transcript.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A shell-type command is forked,
whilst a perl-type command is loaded directly in mailagent
within the cmdenv package. This operates much like the PERL
filtering command, only the <br>
target package differs and a distinct set of variables is
preset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some commands collect additional
data up to an end-of-file marker (by default the string EOF
on a line by itself) and those data are fed to shell
commands via stdin and to perl <br>
commands via the @buffer variable set up in the environment
package named cmdenv (in which the command is loaded and
run).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you define your own variables
(types var or flag), you may use the builtin set command to
modify their values. Note that no default value can be
provided when defining your <br>
variable. A suitable default value must be set within
commands making use of them, with the advantage that
different default values may be used by different
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following environment
variables are defined. Most are read-only, unless notified
otherwise, in which case the builtin set command may be used
on them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">approve The approve password for
approve commands, empty if not within a builtin approve
construct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auth A flag set to true when a
valid envelope was found in the mail message. When this flag
is false, the server cannot be put in trusted mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cmd The command line, as written
in the message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">collect Internal flag set to
true while collecting input from a here-document. It is
normally reset to false before calling the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug True when debug mode is
activated (may be set).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disabled A comma separated list
of disabled commands, with no space between them. This is
initialized when the SERVER command is invoked and the -d
option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eof The current end-of-file
marker for here-document commands. By default set to
&rsquo;EOF&rsquo; (may be changed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">errors Number of errors so
far.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jobnum The job number assigned
to the current mailagent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log What was logged in the
transcript, with some args possibly concealed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name The command name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pack Packing mode for file
sending (may be set).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path Destination address for
file sending or notification (may be set).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">powers A colon (:) separated
list of powers the user currently has successfully requested
and got.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">requests Number of requests
processed so far.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trace True when shell commands
want to be traced in transcript (may be set).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trusted True when server is in
trust mode, where powers may be gained. This is activated by
the -t option of the SERVER command, provided a valid mail
envelope was found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uid Address of the sender of the
message, where transcript is to be sent. By extension, the
real user ID for the server, which is the base of the power
clearance mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user The effective user ID,
originally the same as the uid, but may be changed via the
user builtin command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Session Transcript <br>
A session transcript is mailed back automatically to the
user who requested a server access. This transcript shows
the commands ran by the user and their status: OK or FAILED.
<br>
Between those two lines, the transcript show any output
explicitly made by the command to the transcript. Typically,
the transcript may be used to forward error messages back to
<br>
the user, but even commands executing correctly may want to
issue an explicit message, stating what has just been
done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A perl command may access the
transcript via the MAILER file handle, defined in the cmdenv
package, whilst a shell command may access it via its file
descriptor #3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the session transcript
is mailed to the sender of the message, i.e. whoever the
envelope header line says it is. As far as the server is
concerned, this e-mail address <br>
is used as the user ID, just like a plain login name can be
thought of as the user id. For sensitive commands,
authentication based on that information is really weak. A
more <br>
&quot;secure&quot; authentication is provided by the server
powers, which is password-based. Unfortunately, the clear
password has to be transmitted in the message itself and
could be <br>
eavesdropped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recording New Commands and
Variables <br>
Server commands and variables are defined in the comserver
file defined in your ~/.mailagent. The format of the file is
that of a table with items on a row separated by tabs <br>
characters. Each line defines one command or variable. Any
irrelevant field may be entered as a single &rsquo;-&rsquo;
(minus) character. The format allows for shell-style (#)
comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each row has the following
fields:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name type hide collect-data path
extra</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name is the name of the command
or variable as recognized by the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type is one of perl, shell, var,
flag, help or end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hide indicates which arguments
in the command are to be hidden (the command name being
argument zero) in the session transcript. Use
&rsquo;-&rsquo; if no arguments need to be hid&acirc; <br>
den. Typically, this is used to hide clear passwords in
commands. If more than one argument has to be hidden, then a
list of numbers separated by a &rsquo;,&rsquo; (comma) <br>
may be specified, with no spaces between them. For instance
&rsquo;2,4&rsquo; would hide arguments 2 and 4 in the
transcript.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">collect-data is a flag (specify
as either &rsquo;y&rsquo; or &rsquo;n&rsquo;, but you may
use complete words &rsquo;yes&rsquo; or &rsquo;no&rsquo;)
indicating whether the command collects additional data in a
here-document <br>
until the EOF marker. Alternatively, you may specify
&rsquo;-&rsquo; in place of &rsquo;n&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path specifies the path of the
command (~name substitution allowed). If not relevant (e.g.
when defining a variable) or when you want to leave it
blank, use &rsquo;-&rsquo;. If a <br>
blank path is specified for a perl or shell command, then
the implementation of that command is expected to be found
in servdir, as defined in ~/.mailagent. If the <br>
command name is cmd for instance, then perl command are
expected there in a file named cmd of cmd.pl, whereas shell
commands are expected to be found in a cmd of <br>
cmd.sh file. Note that a command is disabled if it cannot be
located at the time the comserver file is parsed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extra is any extra parameter
needed for the command. Unlike other fields, this should be
left blank if not needed. Anything up to the end of the line
is grabbed by this <br>
field. Perl commands should specify the name of the perl
function to call to execute the command; if none is
specified, the name of the command itself is called. <br>
Shell commands may use that field to supply additional
options, which will be inserted right after the command name
and before any other user-supplied arguments. <br>
Others should leave this alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special Command Types <br>
There are currently two special command types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The simplest is the end type.
This is used to specify commands which may end the server
processing. By default, processing continues until the end
of the file is reached or a <br>
signature delimiter &rsquo;--&rsquo; is found. For instance,
you may wish to define the command quit and give it the end
type. As soon as the server reaches that command, it aborts
process&acirc; <br>
ing and discards the remaining of the message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The help type is usually
attached to an help command and prints help on a command
basis, help for each command being stored under the helpdir
variable (defined in your ~/.maila&acirc; <br>
gent) in a file bearing the same name as the command itself.
For example, assuming a command shoot, its help file would
be expected in helpdir/shoot. If no file is found there,
<br>
mailagent looks in its public library (/usr/share/mailagent)
for an help file. Help is provided only when the help file
exists and is not zero-sized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Creating the Root Power <br>
In order to bootstrap the server, you need to create the
root power. All the other powers may then be created by
using the server interface, which ensures consistency and
logs <br>
your actions. If you don&rsquo;t plan using powers at all,
you may skip that section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, you need to pick up a
good password for the root power. Someone with the root
power can do virtually anything with the server, so be
careful. Let&rsquo;s assume you choose root- <br>
pass as a password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Edit passwd (defined in your
~/.mailagent) and add the following line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">root:&lt;root-pass&gt;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i.e. enter the password in clear
between &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; and &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo;. It
won&rsquo;t stay in that form for long, but this is the
easiest way to bootstrap it. Protect the passwd file tightly
(read- <br>
write permissions only for you). Then create a powerdir/root
file, protect it the same way and add your e-mail address to
it, on a line by itself. That must be the address that <br>
will show up in the From: line of your mails. Since
clearance files support shell-style patterns, you may use
login@*domain.top to allow mails from your login from any
machine in <br>
your domain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You are almost done. Now simply
issue the following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mailagent -i -e &rsquo;SERVER
-t&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and feed its standard input
with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From your e-mail address <br>
From: your e-mail address</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">power root root-pass <br>
password root root-pass <br>
^D</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the first From line is
mandatory here, since it&rsquo;s the envelope on which
authentication is based. Since we&rsquo;re feeding mailagent
with an handcrafted message, we must pro&acirc; <br>
vide a valid envelope or the server will not switch into
trusted mode...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The side effect of
re-instantiating your password will be to crypt it in the
passwd file, so that anybody looking at that file cannot
guess your root password, hopefully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you have a valid root power
installed, you may create the system power by using
newpower. Further powers may then be created and deleted
using the system power only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should also create the
security power and give it a different password than the
root password. This is really needed only if you wish to
remotely administrate the server. If <br>
you have local access and things get corrupted, it&rsquo;s
always possible to change the root password manually by
repeating this bootstrapping sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that clearance checks are
made using the envelope address of the message, which is a
little harder to forge than plain header fields like
Sender:. The envelope is extracted <br>
by looking at the first header line, which on Unix systems
looks like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From envelope-address
send-date</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and is inserted by the mail
transport agent (MTA). If you are using sendmail as the MTA,
then only trusted users declared in the sendmail.cf file are
able to create a &quot;fake&quot; <br>
envelope address, a feature typically used by mailing list
dispatchers, since that address is then used as the bounce
target in case the mail cannot be delivered. If that first
<br>
header line is absent, the sender is computed using the
Sender: field if present, then the From: field, but the auth
variable is set to false and the server will not switch into
<br>
trusted mode; in other words, it will not be possible to
gain powers in that session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Moreover, since the session
transcript is sent to that same envelope address used to
authenticate the eligibility for a power, the server feature
can hardly be used to retrieve <br>
confidential information held at the site where the
mailagent is run since the information would be sent to one
of the users cleared for that power. It is the
responsibility of <br>
you, the user, to make sure this cannot happen or you could
get into legal troubles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, sensitive commands
should be protected by a proper power, and great care should
be taken in writing the command implementation to ensure the
security cannot be circum&acirc; <br>
vented. But no, this mailagent feature is not believed to be
dangerous for the system or site it is used on, since a
determined user could implement one trivially via a five
line <br>
shell script. If security is really an issue, .forward files
using the piping feature should be prohibited and access to
cron forbidden in order to avoid automatic mail
process&acirc; <br>
ing (since it would be possible to have cron invoke a
mailagent process -or any other program for that matter- to
process the incoming mail in a comparable way).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example <br>
Here is an example showing the steps involved in creating a
shell command, which would take a script by collecting lines
until an EOF mark and feed it to a real shell for
execu&acirc; <br>
tion. Since allowing this feature without any safeguards
would be a real security hole, we protect that by requesting
the power shell before allowing the execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is my implementation of the
shell command (available in the mailagent distribution under
misc/shell):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Execute commands from stdin,
as transmitted by the mailagent server. <br>
# File descriptor #3 is a channel to the session
transcript.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Make sure we have the shell
power. <br>
# Don&rsquo;t even allow the root power to bypass that for
security reasons. <br>
case &quot;:$powers:&quot; in <br>
*:shell:*) ;; <br>
*) <br>
echo &quot;Permission denied.&quot; &gt;&amp;3 <br>
exit 1 <br>
;; <br>
esac</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Perhaps a shell was defined...
Otherwise, use /bin/sh <br>
case &quot;$shell&quot; in <br>
&rsquo;&rsquo;) shell=&rsquo;/bin/sh&rsquo;;; <br>
esac</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Normally, a shell command has
its output included in the transcript only in <br>
# case of error or when the user requests the trace. Here
however, we need to <br>
# see what happened, so everything is redirected to the
session transcript.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec $shell -x &gt;&amp;3
2&gt;&amp;3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note how we make access to the
$powers and $shell environment variable. That last one is
user-defined to allow dynamic set-up of a shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assuming we store that command
under servdir/shell.sh (don&rsquo;t forget to add the
execution bit on the file...), here is how we declare it and
its variable in the comserver file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell shell - y - <br>
shell var - - -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example shows that there is
a separate name-space for variables and commands. Moreover,
the command bears the same name as its type -- don&rsquo;t
let that confuse you :-).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, assuming you have already
created a system power and protected it with a password
(let&rsquo;s assume sys-pass for the purpose of this
example), you need to create the shell <br>
power. Although you could do it manually (like when you
handcrafted the root power), it&rsquo;s better to use the
SERVER interface since it ensures consistency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to create the shell
power required to use the newly created shell command, you
need to add the following rule to your rule file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subject: Server { SAVE server;
SERVER -t };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which will save all server mail
in a dedicated folder and process them. Note the -t option,
which allows trusted mode, in which powers may be gained.
Now send yourself the fol&acirc; <br>
lowing mail:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subject: Server <br>
power system sys-pass <br>
newpower shell shell-pass <br>
ram@acri.fr <br>
EOF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which requests for the system
power (needed to created most powers), and then creates a
new power shell, assigning shell-pass as its password and
clearing ram@acri.fr for it. <br>
Note the here-document fill-in for the newpower command, up
to the EOF marker. Of course, you need to replace the
address by your real address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You will receive a session
transcript along these lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">---- Mailagent session
transcript for ram@acri.fr ----</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">----&gt; power system ********
<br>
OK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">====&gt; newpower shell ********
<br>
OK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">====&gt; -- <br>
End of processing (.signature)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">---- End of mailagent session
transcript ----</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note the concealed passwords,
and the prompt change once the system power has been
granted. Since my mailer automatically appends a signature,
the processing stops on it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now let&rsquo;s use this new
command... Send yourself the following mail:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subject: Server <br>
set shell /bin/ksh <br>
set eof END <br>
shell <br>
ls -l /etc/passwd <br>
END <br>
power shell shell-pass <br>
shell <br>
ls -l /etc/passwd <br>
END</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you everything is right, you
should receive back a transcript looking like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">---- Mailagent session
transcript for ram@acri.fr ----</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">----&gt; set shell /bin/ksh <br>
OK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">----&gt; set eof END <br>
OK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">----&gt; shell <br>
Permission denied. <br>
Command returned a non-zero status (1). <br>
FAILED.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">----&gt; power shell ********
<br>
OK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">====&gt; shell <br>
+ ls -l /etc/passwd <br>
-rw-r--r-- 1 root system 691 Oct 01 14:24 /etc/passwd <br>
OK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">====&gt; -- <br>
End of processing (.signature)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">---- End of mailagent session
transcript ----</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first invocation of the
shell command fails since we lack the shell power. The
string &quot;Permission denied.&quot; is echoed by the
command itself into file descriptor #3 and makes <br>
it to the transcript.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conclusion <br>
The generic mail server implemented in mailagent can be used
to implement a mailing list manager, a vote server, an
archive server, etc... Unfortunately, it does not currently
<br>
have the notion of state, with a command set dedicated to
each state, so it is not possible to implement an
intelligent archive server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you implement new simple
server commands and feel they are generic enough to be
contributed, please send them to me and I will gladly
integrate them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Here are some examples of rule files. First, if you do not
specify a rule file or if it is empty, the following
built-in rule applies:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All: /^Subject: [Cc]ommand/ {
LEAVE; PROCESS };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every mail is left in the
mailbox. Besides, mail with &quot;Subject: Command&quot;
anywhere in the message are processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following rule file is the
one I am currently using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maildir = ~/mail;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All: /^Subject: [Cc]ommand/ {
SAVE cmds; PROCESS };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To: /^gue@eiffel.fr/ { POST -l
mail.gue }; <br>
Apparently-To: ram, <br>
Newsgroups: mail.gue { BOUNCE gue@eiffel.fr };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;_SEEN_&gt; <br>
Apparently-To: ram, <br>
Newsgroups: mail.gue { DELETE };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From: root, To: root { BEGIN
ROOT; REJECT }; <br>
&lt;ROOT&gt; /^Daily run output/ { WRITE
~/var/log/york/daily.%D }; <br>
&lt;ROOT&gt; /^Weekly run output/ { WRITE
~/var/log/york/weekly }; <br>
&lt;ROOT&gt; /^Monthly run output/ { WRITE
~/var/log/york/monthly };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From: ram { BEGIN RAM; REJECT };
<br>
&lt;RAM&gt; To: ram { LEAVE }; <br>
&lt;RAM&gt; X-Mailer: /mailagent/ { LEAVE }; <br>
&lt;RAM&gt; { DELETE };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The folder directory is set to
~/mail. All command mails are saved in the folder
~/mail/cmds and processed. They do not show up in my
mailbox. Mails directed to the gue mailing <br>
list (French Eiffel&rsquo;s Users Group, namely Groupe des
Utilisateurs Eiffel) are posted on the local newsgroup
mail.gue and do not appear in my mailbox either. Any
follow-up made on <br>
this group is mailed to me by inews (and not directly to the
mailing list, because those mails would get back to me again
and be fed to the newsgroup, which in turn would have <br>
them mailed back to the list, and so on, and so forth).
Hence the next rule which catches those follow-ups and
bounces them to the mailing list. Those mails will indeed
come <br>
back, but the _SEEN_ rule will simply delete them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On my machine, the mails for
root are forwarded to me. However, everyday, the cron daemon
starts some processes to do some administration clean-up
(rotating log files, etc...), <br>
and mails the results back. They are redirected into
specific folders with the WRITE command, to ensure they do
not grow up without limit. Note the macro substitution for
the <br>
daily output (on Mondays, the output is stored in daily.1
for instance).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next group of rules prevents
the mail system from sending back mails when I am in a group
alias expansion. This is a sendmail option which I disabled
on my machine. Care is <br>
taken however to keep mails coming from the mailagent which
I receive as a blind carbon copy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEAT <br>
In order to limit the load overhead on the system, only one
mailagent process is allowed to run the commands. If some
new mail arrives while another mailagent is running, that
<br>
mail is queued and will be processed later by the main
mailagent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the same reason, messages
sent back by mailagent are queued by sendmail, to avoid the
cost of mail transfer while processing commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
First, let me discuss what security means here. It does not
mean system safety against intruder attacks. If your system
allows .forward hooks and/or cron jobs to be set by
regu&acirc; <br>
lar users, then your system is not secure at all. Period. So
we&rsquo;re not bothering with security at the system level,
but rather at your own account level where all sort of
pre&acirc; <br>
cious data is held.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To avoid any pernicious
intrusion via Trojan horses, the C filter will refuse to run
if the configuration file ~/.mailagent or the rule file
specified are world writable or not <br>
owned by the user. Those tests are enforced even if the
filter does not run setuid, because they compromise the
security of your account. The mailagent will also perform
some of <br>
those checks, in case it is not invoked via the C
filter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Indeed, if someone can write
into your ~/.mailagent file, then he can easily change your
rules configuration parameter to point to another faked rule
file and then send you a <br>
mail, which will trigger mailagent, running as you. Via the
RUN command, this potential intruder could run any command,
using your privileges, and could set a Trojan horse for <br>
later perusal. Applying the same logic, the rule file must
also be protected tightly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And, no surprise, the same rules
apply for your newcmd file, which is used to describe
extended filtering commands. Otherwise it would allow
someone to quietly redefine a com&acirc; <br>
monly used standard command like LEAVE and later be able to
assume your identity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Versions after 3.0 PL44 come
with an improved (from a security point of view) C filter
that will not only perform the aforementionned checks but
will also ensure that the perl <br>
executable and the mailagent script it is about to exec are
not loosely protected (when execsafe is ON or when running
with superuser privileges). Furthermore, if the filter is
<br>
set up in your .forward as described in this man page, it
will be able to check itself for safety and will warn you
loundly if it can be tampered with, which could defeat all
<br>
security checks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mailagent was also extended so
that all programs executed via RUN and friends, as well as
mail hooks, are checked for obvious protection flaws before
being actually run Inter&acirc; <br>
preted scripts (starting with the #! magic token) and perl
scripts following the magic &quot;exec perl if
$under_shell&quot; incantation are specially checked for
further security of the <br>
relevant interpretor. Those checks are performed
systematically (when execsafe is ON or when running with
superuser privileges) even if the secure parameter was not
set to ON. <br>
Also, all files about to be exec()ed are checked using the
same extended check method used when secure is ON (ownership
tests are skipped however when checking for exec()-ness of
<br>
a file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.mailagent configuration file for mailagent. <br>
~/agent.trace trace dump from a PROCESS command when error
cannot be mailed back. <br>
~/mbox.filter mailbox used by filter in case of error <br>
~/mbox.urgent mailbox used by mailagent in case of error
<br>
~/mbox.&lt;username&gt; mailbox used if writing access is
denied in the mail spool directory <br>
/usr/share/mailagent/mailagent <br>
directory holding templates and samples. <br>
Log/agentlog mailagent&rsquo;s log file. <br>
Spool/agent.wait list of mails waiting to be processed and
stored outside of mailagent&rsquo;s queue directory. Even
when logically empty, this file is kept around and still
holds <br>
one blank line to reserve a block on the filesystem. <br>
Queue/qmXXXXX mail spooled by filter. <br>
Queue/fmXXXXX mail spooled by mailagent. <br>
Queue/cmXXXXX mail spooled by the AFTER command. <br>
Hash/X/Y hash files used by RECORD, UNIQUE, ONCE commands
and vacation mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
There is a small chance that mail arrives while the main
mailagent is about to finish its processing. That mail will
be queued and not processed until another mail arrives (the
<br>
main mailagent always processes the queue after having dealt
with the message that invoked it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A version number must currently
contain a dot. Moreover, an old system (i.e. a system with
an o in the patches column) must have a version number, so
that mailagent can compute <br>
the name of the directory holding the patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The lock file is deliberately
ignored when -q option is used (in fact, it is ignored
whenever an option is specified). This may result in having
mails processed more than once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mailagent is at the mercy of any
perl bug, and there is little I can do about it. Some
spurious warnings may be emitted by the data-loaded version,
although they do not appear <br>
with the plain version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parsing of the rule file should
be done by a real parser and not lexically. Or at least, it
should be possible to escape otherwise meaningful characters
like &rsquo;;&rsquo; or &rsquo;}&rsquo; within <br>
the rules.</p>
