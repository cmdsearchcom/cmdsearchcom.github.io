<p>AT(1) General Commands Manual AT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
at, batch, atq, atrm - queue, examine or delete jobs for
later execution</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
at [-V] [-q queue] [-f file] [-mMlv] timespec... <br>
at [-V] [-q queue] [-f file] [-mMkv] [-t time] <br>
at -c job [job...] <br>
atq [-V] [-q queue] <br>
at [-rd] job [job...] <br>
atrm [-V] job [job...] <br>
batch <br>
at -b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
at and batch read commands from standard input or a
specified file which are to be executed at a later time,
using /bin/sh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">at executes commands at a
specified time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">atq lists the user&rsquo;s
pending jobs, unless the user is the superuser; in that
case, everybody&rsquo;s jobs are listed. The format of the
output lines (one for each job) is: Job <br>
number, date, hour, queue, and username.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">atrm deletes jobs, identified by
their job number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">batch executes commands when
system load levels permit; in other words, when the load
average drops below 0.8, or the value specified in the
invocation of atd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At allows fairly complex time
specifications, extending the POSIX.2 standard. It accepts
times of the form HH:MM to run a job at a specific time of
day. (If that time is <br>
already past, the next day is assumed.) You may also specify
midnight, noon, or teatime (4pm) and you can have a
time-of-day suffixed with AM or PM for running in the
morning or <br>
the evening. You can also say what day the job will be run,
by giving a date in the form month-name day with an optional
year, or giving a date of the form MMDD[CC]YY, <br>
MM/DD/[CC]YY, DD.MM.[CC]YY or [CC]YY-MM-DD. The
specification of a date must follow the specification of the
time of day. You can also give times like now + count
time-units, <br>
where the time-units can be minutes, hours, days, or weeks
and you can tell at to run the job today by suffixing the
time with today and to run the job tomorrow by suffixing the
<br>
time with tomorrow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to run a job at 4pm
three days from now, you would do at 4pm + 3 days, to run a
job at 10:00am on July 31, you would do at 10am Jul 31 and
to run a job at 1am tomor&acirc; <br>
row, you would do at 1am tomorrow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The definition of the time
specification can be found in
/usr/share/doc/at-3.1.13/timespec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For both at and batch, commands
are read from standard input or the file specified with the
-f option and executed. The working directory, the
environment (except for the vari&acirc; <br>
ables BASH_VERSINFO, DISPLAY, EUID, GROUPS, SHELLOPTS, TERM,
UID, and _) and the umask are retained from the time of
invocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As at is currently implemented
as a setuid program, other environment variables (e.g.
LD_LIBRARY_PATH or LD_PRELOAD) are also not exported. This
may change in the future. As a <br>
workaround, set these variables explicitly in your job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An at - or batch - command
invoked from a su(1) shell will retain the current userid.
The user will be mailed standard error and standard output
from his commands, if any. Mail <br>
will be sent using the command /usr/sbin/sendmail. If at is
executed from a su(1) shell, the owner of the login shell
will receive the mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The superuser may use these
commands in any case. For other users, permission to use at
is determined by the files /etc/at.allow and /etc/at.deny.
See at.allow(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-V prints the version number to standard error and exit
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q queue <br>
uses the specified queue. A queue designation consists of a
single letter; valid queue designations range from a to z
and A to Z. The a queue is the default for at and <br>
the b queue for batch. Queues with higher letters run with
increased niceness. The special queue &quot;=&quot; is
reserved for jobs which are currently running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a job is submitted to a queue
designated with an uppercase letter, the job is treated as
if it were submitted to batch at the time of the job. Once
the time is <br>
reached, the batch processing rules with respect to load
average apply. If atq is given a specific queue, it will
only show jobs pending in that queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Send mail to the user when
the job has completed even if there was no output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Never send mail to the
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f file Reads the job from file
rather than standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t time run the job at time,
given in the format [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Is an alias for atq.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Is an alias for atrm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Is an alias for atrm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b is an alias for batch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Shows the time the job will
be executed before reading the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Times displayed will be in the
format &quot;Thu Feb 20 14:50:00 1997&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c cats the jobs listed on the
command line to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/spool/at <br>
/var/spool/at/spool <br>
/proc/loadavg <br>
/var/run/utmp <br>
/etc/at.allow <br>
/etc/at.deny</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
at.allow(5), at.deny(5), atd(8), cron(1), nice(1), sh(1),
umask(2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The correct operation of batch for Linux depends on the
presence of a proc- type directory mounted on /proc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file /var/run/utmp is not
available or corrupted, or if the user is not logged on at
the time at is invoked, the mail is sent to the userid found
in the environment vari&acirc; <br>
able LOGNAME. If that is undefined or empty, the current
userid is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At and batch as presently
implemented are not suitable when users are competing for
resources. If this is the case for your site, you might want
to consider another batch sys&acirc; <br>
tem, such as nqs.</p>
