<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rzip - a large-file compression program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rzip [OPTIONS] &lt;files...&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
rzip is a file compression program designed to do
particularly well on very large files containing long
distance redundency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS SUMMARY <br>
Here is a summary of the options to rzip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-0 fastest (worst) compression
<br>
-6 default compression <br>
-9 slowest (best) compression <br>
-d decompress <br>
-o filename specify the output file name <br>
-S suffix specify compressed suffix (default
&rsquo;.rz&rsquo;) <br>
-f force overwrite of any existing files <br>
-k keep existing files <br>
-P show compression progress <br>
-V show version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Print an options summary page</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print the rzip version
number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-0..9 Set the compression level
from 0 to 9. The default is to use level 6, which is a
reasonable compromise between speed and compression. The
compression level is also <br>
strongly related to how much memory rzip uses, so if you are
running rzip on a machine with limited amounts of memory
then you will probably want to choose a smaller <br>
level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Decompress. If this option is
not used then rzip looks at the name used to launch the
program. If it contains the string &rsquo;runzip&rsquo; then
the -d option is automatically set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Set the output file name. If
this option is not set then the output file name is chosen
based on the input name and the suffix. The -o option cannot
be used if more than <br>
one file name is specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Set the compression suffix.
The default is &rsquo;.rz&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f If this option is not
specified then rzip will not overwrite any existing files.
If you set this option then rzip will silently overwrite any
files as needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k If this option is not
specified then rzip will delete the source file after
successful compression or decompression. When this option is
specified then the source files <br>
are not deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P If this option is specified
then rzip will show the percentage progress while
compressing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
Just install rzip in your search path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPRESSION ALGORITHM <br>
rzip operates in two stages. The first stage finds and
encodes large chunks of duplicated data over potentially
very long distances (up to nearly a gigabyte) in the input
file. <br>
The second stage is to use a standard compression algorithm
(bzip2) to compress the output of the first stage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The key difference between rzip
and other well known compression algorithms is its ability
to take advantage of very long distance redundency. The well
known deflate algorithm <br>
used in gzip uses a maximum history buffer of 32k. The block
sorting algorithm used in bzip2 is limited to 900k of
history. The history buffer in rzip can be up to 900MB long,
<br>
several orders of magnitude larger than gzip or bzip2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is quite common these days to
need to compress files that contain long distance
redundancies. For example, when compressing a set of home
directories several users might have <br>
copies of the same file, or of quite similar files. It is
also common to have a single file that contains large
duplicated chunks over long distances, such as pdf files
contain&acirc; <br>
ing repeated copies of the same image. Most compression
programs won&rsquo;t be able to take advantage of this
redundency, and thus might achieve a much lower compression
ratio than <br>
rzip can achieve.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The ideas behind rzip were first implemented in 1998 while I
was working on rsync. That version was too slow to be
practical, and was replaced by this version in 2003.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Unlike most Unix compression programs, rzip cannot compress
or decompress to or from standard input or standard output.
This is due to the nature of the algorithm that rzip uses
<br>
and cannot easily be fixed.</p>
