makepp_rules -- How to tell makepp to build something</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A rule is what tells makepp how
to build a file or a class of files. Makepp supports the
same rule syntax as other implementations of make, plus some
additions of its own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A rule has the general
format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target_expression :
dependency_expression [ : optional arguments] <br>
actions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list of targets may not
contain any automatic variables (except
&quot;$(foreach)&quot;). The dependency list may contain
only automatic variables referring to the target (i.e., <br>
&quot;$(output)&quot;, &quot;$(outputs)&quot;, or their
synonyms). The action may contain any automatic
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If makepp decides that the rule
needs to be executed, each line of the rule is executed
sequentially, and if any returns a non-zero status, the
remainder are not executed (and <br>
makepp aborts with an error unless you specified the
&quot;-k&quot; option on the command line.) Each action
should be only one line. If an action is too long to write
conveniently on a <br>
single line, you can split it into several lines and put a
backslash to indicate that the several lines should be
combined into one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to distinguish actions
from the next rule, the action should be indented more than
the line containing the targets and dependencies. Unlike
other implementations of <br>
make, makepp doesn&rsquo;t really care how much you indent
it or whether you use tab characters rather than spaces. To
keep backward compatibility with traditional make, the rules
<br>
makepp uses to decide when actions end and the next rule
begins are somewhat complicated:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The first action
line must be indented more than the line containing the
target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If a line is
indented by one tab character or 8 spaces or more, then it
is considered an action line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A blank line or
a comment line with the &quot;#&quot; character at the right
margin ends the rule, unless the next non-blank line is
indented more than 8 spaces (or more than one tab).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If a line is
indented as much or more than the first action line, then it
is considered an additional action line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a few special action
items:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp; This symbol shall be
followed by a command name and any number of arguments.
Shell syntax is not understood fully here, only single and
double quotes and backslashed <br>
characters within, as throughout makepp. The command name
either leads to a function &quot;c_name&quot; to be called
with the remaining strings as arguments. If such a function
can <br>
not be found, this is identical to calling &quot;run&quot;
from a &quot;perl&quot; block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This allows efficiently calling
a built-in, makefile-provided or external command. The
prefix &quot;&amp;&quot; has been chosen because it is the
function invoker in Perl, and because at <br>
the beginning it is illegal in Shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(ROOT)/include/%.h: %.h <br>
&amp;ln $(input) $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noecho <br>
@ Normally, each shell command is printed as it is executed.
However, if the first word of the action is
&quot;noecho&quot; (or if it begins with the character
&quot;@&quot;), then the command is <br>
not printed. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.o: %.cxx <br>
noecho $(LIBTOOL) --mode=compile $(CC) -c $(input)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that when the libtool
command is executed, it is not printed. (Libtool itself
usually prints the modified command that it executes, so
it&rsquo;s redundant to print it <br>
twice.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignore_error <br>
- Normally, if the shell command returns a non-zero status,
then makepp aborts because the command failed. However, some
programs incorrectly set the status on exit, or there <br>
may be an error which really isn&rsquo;t fatal and
shouldn&rsquo;t abort the whole compilation. You can cause
makepp to ignore the return status by specifying
&quot;ignore_error&quot; as the <br>
first word of the command line (or &quot;-&quot; as the
first character). For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(phony distribution): <br>
ignore_error rm -r my_program-$(VERSION) # Get rid of
previous junk. <br>
&amp;mkdir my_program-$(VERSION) <br>
&amp;cp $(FILES) my_program-$(VERSION) <br>
tar cf my_program-$(VERSION).tar my_program-$(VERSION)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command makes a directory,
copies a bunch of files into it, and then puts everything
into a tar file for distribution. It&rsquo;s a good idea to
clean out the previous <br>
contents of the directory, if there was anything there
previously, and that&rsquo;s what the first line does. The
&quot;rm&quot; might fail, but its return status is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl <br>
makeperl <br>
This is essentially the same as the perl statement, but it
is performed each time when running the rule, not when
reading the makefile. The first variant is plain Perl code,
<br>
while the second variant first passes the statement through
Make-style variable expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the two possibilities of
putting the braces of the body, see the explanation at
&quot;perl_perlcode&quot; in makepp_statements. Note that
the third variant explained there makes <br>
no sence here, because all action lines must be indented.
You must signal failure in Perl statements, by calling
&quot;die&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Per rule the Perl statements are
currently evaluated in a common subprocess, except on
Windows. That means they have only read access to any
makefile variables. It is also <br>
the process which executes non-Perl actions. So calling exec
or exit will confuse makepp. But this may change in the
future. For an efficient way to call Perl scripts, see <br>
the previous item &quot;&amp;&quot; or &quot;run&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(phony version): <br>
noecho perl {{ # $(target) &amp; $(VERSION) from Perl: <br>
print &quot;This is &quot;.f_target().&quot; $VERSION0; <br>
}} <br>
echo You can mix this with Shell commands <br>
-makeperl { print &quot;This is $(target) $(VERSION)0 }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several different
kinds of rules, each with different purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Explicit Rules <br>
target1 target2: dependency1 dependency2 ... <br>
actions to be performed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This syntax specifies that in
order to make either target1 or target2, all the files
dependency1, dependency2, etc., must already have been made.
Then the given actions are <br>
executed by the shell to make the targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first explicit rule in a
file is the default target, and is made if you do not
specify any targets on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike traditional make
programs, makepp usually assumes that one invocation of the
action makes all of the targets (unless there are no
dependencies). For example, one <br>
invocation of yacc creates both output files for this
rule:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">y.tab.c y.tab.h : parser.y <br>
$(YACC) -d parser.y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that other implementations
of make do not have a concept of a single command producing
multiple output files, and so when you specify multiple
targets they will execute the <br>
rule once per target. Makepp will revert to this behavior if
it looks like this is an old-style makefile. Specifically,
it will execute the rule once per target, instead of <br>
just once overall, if all of the following are true:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The rule action
mentions the automatic variable $@. (The synonyms
&quot;$(output)&quot; or &quot;$(target)&quot; do not
trigger this behavior.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The rule action
does not mention the automatic variable
&quot;$(outputs)&quot; (or its synonym
&quot;$(targets)&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; This is not a
pattern rule, and there is no foreach clause.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all test install: <br>
for subdir in $(SUBDIRS); do cd $$subdir &amp;&amp; $(MAKE)
$@; cd ..; done</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is a common idiom in makefiles,
and makepp supports it. (Note that you should never use
recursive make in any new makefiles you write--use the
&quot;load_makefile&quot; statement, or <br>
implicit makefile loading instead.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to have the same
rule executed once for each target (e.g., because the
targets have similar commands), it&rsquo;s preferable to use
either a pattern rule (see below) or a <br>
&quot;foreach&quot; clause. For example, if with a
traditional make program you would write:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a b c d: <br>
do_something to build $@ &gt; $@</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in makepp, you would probably
want to write it like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(foreach) : : foreach a b c d
<br>
do_something to build $(output) &gt; $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Phony targets</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A phony target is a target that
will never actually exist in the file system; it&rsquo;s
just a way of getting makepp to build some targets and
possibly execute some additional <br>
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A typical phony target is
&quot;all&quot;, which usually is used to cause everything
that can be built to be built, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all: prog1 prog2 subdir/prog3
subdir2/libmine.a <br>
@&amp;echo &quot;All done!&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you type &quot;makepp
all&quot;, or if you put all as the first explicit target in
your makefile (which is typical) and just type
&quot;makepp&quot;, then it will cause all the dependencies
to be <br>
built, then it will print &quot;All done!&quot;. At this
point, makepp will look for the file ./all and will discover
that it doesn&rsquo;t exist. It will complain loudly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To keep makepp from expecting
the file ./all to exit, you need to tell it that it&rsquo;s
a phony target. Just put a line like the following in your
makefile (it makes no difference <br>
where):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.PHONY: all</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An equivalent alternative which
is sometimes more convenient is to use the &quot;$(phony
)&quot; function, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(phony all): prog1 prog2
subdir/prog3 subdir2/libmine.a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Phony targets in one makefile
can refer to phony targets in another makefile. This is
often done with the &quot;clean&quot; target, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Top level makefile: <br>
# lots of rules and stuff here <br>
# .... <br>
$(phony clean): subdir1/clean subdir2/clean <br>
&amp;rm -fm my_program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then in the subdirectories, the
makefiles might read like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Makefile in a subdirectory
<br>
# ... <br>
$(phony clean): <br>
&amp;rm -fm $(wildcard *.o *.a)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But nowadays you would use the
&quot;makeppclean&quot; command, instead of a clean
target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wildcards</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is safe to specify wildcards
in the dependency list. Wildcards match not only files that
exist, but files which can be created given the rules in the
makefile. For example, <br>
to build a library from all .o files in a directory, you
could write this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">libmine.a: *.o <br>
&amp;rm -f $(output) <br>
ar cr $(output) $(inputs)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will work even if none of
the &quot;.o&quot; files have been created yet, because
makepp&rsquo;s wildcards match files which do not yet exist
but can be built. This will even pick up files <br>
whose rule is discovered later (in the same makefile, or one
not yet read). In this last point it differs from the
&quot;wildcard&quot; function, which is limited to the known
rules, as <br>
it must return its result when it is expanded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makepp supports all the usual
shell wildcards (&quot;*&quot;, &quot;?&quot;, and
&quot;[]&quot;). It also has a wildcard &quot;**&quot; which
matches any number of intervening directories. (This idea
was stolen from <br>
zsh.) For example, &quot;**/*.c&quot; matches all the .c
files in the entire source tree. &quot;objects/**/*.o&quot;
matches all the .o files contained anywhere in the
subdirectory objects or any <br>
of its subdirectories or any of their subdirectories. The
&quot;**&quot; wildcard will not follow soft links to
directories at any level. It also will never return phony
targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makepp&rsquo;s wildcards will
ignore files or directories which exist but cannot be read.
After all, such files cannot be used in the build process
anyway. Putting unreadable files <br>
in a directory is primarily useful to inhibit the automatic
import of the given file from a repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The initial assertion was that
this is safe. This is in the sence that it works whether the
files already exist, or need to be built first. However it
is unsafe in the sence <br>
that it will still match files that were built by makepp,
but no longer have a rule (e.g. you removed the .c file, but
the .o file is still there.) To prevent this, use the <br>
&quot;--rm-stale&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pattern rules <br>
A pattern rule is a rule that is applied based on some
textual pattern. This is used to apply the same rule to a
whole class of files. The syntax is the same as GNU
make&rsquo;s <br>
pattern rules:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.o: %.c <br>
$(CC) -c $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This says that any file in the
current directory which matches &quot;*.c&quot; can be
converted into the corresponding .o file using the given
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that several pattern
dependencies may be supplied. For example, if your xyz.o
file depends on the corresponding xyz.cpp file, and also on
a file called moc_xyz.cflags which <br>
contains the compiler options, this could be expressed
with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.o: %.cpp %.cflags <br>
$(CXX) &lsquo;cat $(stem).cflags&lsquo; -c $(inputs) -o
$(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may also have several
pattern targets. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.tab.h %.tab.c : %.y <br>
yacc -d $(input) <br>
&amp;mv y.tab.h $(stem).tab.h <br>
&amp;mv y.tab.c $(stem).tab.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ordinarily, pattern rules only
look for files in the current directories. You can force
them to search in the current directory and all directories
beneath it by setting</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makepp_percent_subdirs := 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">before the first pattern rule in
your makefile or on the command line for example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a clear difference
between &quot;%&quot; and the wildcard &quot;*&quot;, though
both match any string: The wildcard returns a list of files
that is completely used at that point. So this <br>
depends on all .o files buildable here:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prog: *.o <br>
$(LD) $(LDFLAGS) $(inputs) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This could not be achieved by
replacing &quot;*&quot; with &quot;%&quot;, because the
latter is for one-by-one matching of input to output,
producing internally one rule for each matched stem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Static pattern rules <br>
A static pattern rule is a pattern rule that is applied only
to a limited set of files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(SPECIAL_MODULES).o : %.o :
%.cpp <br>
$(CXX) -c $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This says that the pattern rule
applies only to the files in
&quot;$(SPECIAL_MODULES).o&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is mostly for compatibility
with GNU make; foreach rules (see below) are a more powerful
way of doing the same thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Foreach rules <br>
The above pattern rule syntax is powerful enough to support
almost all builds, but occasionally it is necessary to do
something more complicated. Makepp provides a more powerful
<br>
syntax: the &quot;:foreach&quot; clause for the rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target_expression :
dependency_expression : foreach file-list <br>
actions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The simplest kind of foreach
rule is just a pattern rule whose application is restricted
to a specific list of files. For example, suppose you have a
pattern rule that tells <br>
makepp how to compile all .c files. However, you have a list
of .c files for which you want to do something different.
You could do something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Here&rsquo;s the rule that
applies to everything: <br>
%.o : %.c <br>
$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.o : %.c : foreach
$(SPECIAL_MODULES) <br>
$(CC) $(SPECIAL_CFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An even more powerful use of
foreach rules takes advantage of the fact that the variable
&quot;$(foreach)&quot; is set in turn to each file matching
the file list and the target and <br>
dependency expressions are evaluated. The file-list may
contain wildcards, and these match even files which
don&rsquo;t exist yet but which can be built (see
&quot;Wildcards&quot; in <br>
makepp_rules).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is an unwieldy syntax but
it is extremely flexible, because the &quot;$(foreach)&quot;
variable may appear in any way in the expression. First,
note that pattern rules are in fact a <br>
special case of foreach rules; the pattern rule</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.o : %.c <br>
$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is exactly equivalent to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(patsubst %.c, %.o, $(foreach))
: $(foreach) : foreach *.c <br>
$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(In fact, it&rsquo;s converted
to approximately that internally.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example of how you would
use a &quot;:foreach&quot; clause where a pattern rule
isn&rsquo;t sufficient, suppose you have some .c files which
are built using some kind of preprocessor which <br>
takes as input files with a .k extension. You want to
compile those .c files with a different set of compilation
options than the usual .c files which are ordinary source
files. <br>
You could do something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Rule for ordinary .c files:
<br>
%.o : %.c <br>
$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Rule to make .c files from .k
files: <br>
%.c : %.k <br>
$(preprocessor) $(input) &gt; $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Special build rules for .c
files which are made from .k files: <br>
$(foreach:%.k=%.o) : $(foreach:%.c=%.k) : foreach *.k <br>
$(CC) $(SPECIAL_CFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(This uses the slightly more
concise substitution reference syntax rather than calling
&quot;patsubst&quot; explicitly.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if all you want to do
is to change the value of a variable (&quot;CFLAGS&quot; in
this case) it&rsquo;s sometimes more convenient to use
target-specific variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Legacy suffix rules <br>
For backward compatibility, makepp supports the old-style
suffix rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.suffix1.suffix2: <br>
actions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is equivalent to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.suffix2: %.suffix1 <br>
actions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but much harder to remember.
(Which suffix comes first?) Typically, a rule will appear in
a legacy makefile like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.c.o: <br>
$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $*.c -o $*.o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which is exactly equivalent
to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.o : %.c <br>
$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conflicting rules <br>
When there is more than one way to make a file, makepp uses
a simple procedure to determine which rule to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It is an error
to have conflicting explicit rules for building a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Pattern rules
and foreach rules with wildcards never override explicit
rules. Thus explicit rules can be used to specify exceptions
for pattern rules. (Note that simply <br>
using a &quot;:foreach&quot; clause doesn&rsquo;t make
something a pattern rule. It must have a wildcard (like
&quot;*&quot; or &quot;?&quot;) as part of the filename in
the &quot;:foreach&quot; clause. If it is just <br>
an explicit list of files, it is treated as an explicit rule
for each of those files.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When conflicting
pattern rules come from different makefiles, rules from
&quot;nearer&quot; makefiles override rules from
&quot;farther&quot; makefiles. &quot;Nearer&quot; means that
the makefile is <br>
located closer to the target in the directory hierarchy
(i.e., the file name of the target relative to the directory
the makefile is run from is shorter). If this doesn&rsquo;t
<br>
distinguish the makefiles, then the rule from the makefile
which is loaded latest is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that you can specify
a pattern rule that applies to all files in your entire
directory tree in just the top-level makefile, but then you
can override it in a <br>
lower-level makefile. For example, your top-level makefile
could contain:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.o : %.c : foreach **/*.c <br>
$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and you could have a makefile in
one of the subdirectories that says:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.o : %.c <br>
$(CC) $(SPECIAL_CFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Pattern rules
that have a shorter chain of inference are preferred over
other pattern rules. For example, if you had the following
rules (based on an example from the Linux <br>
kernel):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.s: %.c <br>
$(CC) -s $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.o: %.s <br>
$(AS) $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.o: %.c <br>
$(CC) -c $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If we need to build
&quot;xyz.o&quot;, we could either build the intermediate
&quot;.s&quot; file and then run that through the assembler
using the first two rules, or we could go directly to a <br>
&quot;.o&quot; file using the last rule. The last rule is
preferred because there are fewer steps in the chain of
inference (one instead of two).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Pattern rules
later in a makefile override pattern rules that are earlier.
(This is backwards from GNU make.) This means that you
should put your more general rules <br>
earlier, and your more specific rules later. For
example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.o: %.c # General compilation
rule. <br>
action</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">special_%.o: special_%.c #
Special rule for files with a <br>
different action # &quot;special_&quot; prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rule options <br>
Sometimes it is necessary to supply additional options to
modify how makepp executes the rule. These options are
specified as &quot;:optionname value&quot;, either on the
line containing <br>
the dependencies, or on the next line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supplying the options on
separate lines may make it possible for you to use the same
makefile with makepp and a traditional make. For
example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target : dependencies <br>
: signature target_newer <br>
actions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will work fine with a
traditional Unix make, because it interprets the &quot;:
signature&quot; line as a shell command, and a command
beginning with a colon does nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:build_cache
/path/to/build/cache <br>
target : dependencies <br>
: build_cache /put/cache/files/over/there <br>
actions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies the path to a build
cache to be used for files produced by this rule. This
overrides the effect of the &quot;build_cache&quot;
statement or the &quot;--build-cache&quot; command line <br>
option, if any, for this rule. See makepp_build_cache for
details about build caches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify &quot;none&quot;
instead of a path, you disable the build cache for this
particular rule. This can be useful to avoid wasting disk
space on files that you know aren&rsquo;t <br>
useful to cache, either because you are very sure they will
never be reused or because they are built so fast that
it&rsquo;s not worth caching them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:build_check build_check_method
<br>
target : dependencies <br>
: build_check target_newer <br>
actions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tells makepp what algorithm
to use to decide if the targets need to be rebuilt. See
makepp_build_check for more details. This overrides the
effect of the &quot;build_check&quot; <br>
statement or the &quot;--build-check-method&quot; command
line option, if any, for this rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:env VARIABLE ... <br>
Add a dependency on the values of the named environment
variables. If any of them differ from the previous build,
then the targets are considered out of date, if the <br>
build_check method so dictates. (All of the built-in build
check methods except for target_newer respect this.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VARIABLE may be of the form
&quot;filename in PATH_VARIABLE&quot; (in quotes), in which
case the targets are considered out of date if the first
directory from the colon-delimited <br>
value of PATH_VARIABLE in which filename exists is different
from the last build. This can be used to avoid rebuilding
the targets when PATH_VARIABLE changes in an <br>
irrelevant way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:dispatch command ... <br>
Enclose each shell action (but not Perl actions nor Perl
commands) in a &quot;sh -c &rsquo;...&rsquo;&quot; and
prefix it with command, but assume that the target
doesn&rsquo;t depend on command. This <br>
is useful if you want to send actions to a job queuing
system, but the result is assumed to be independent of the
queuing parameters, as well as to whether the queuing system
<br>
is used at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:include file_or_pattern <br>
Rule varies depending on compiler:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.o : %.c <br>
: include %.d : signature C <br>
gcc -MD -c ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.o : %.c <br>
: include %.u : signature C # IBM uses a different suffix
<br>
xlc -M -c ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub dependify { # Turn
Microsoft&rsquo;s chatter into useful format <br>
s/; ?0$1 ? &quot;&rsquo;$2&rsquo; <br>
s/(Note: including file: *)?(.+?) &quot; :
&quot;&rsquo;&quot;.f_output().&quot;&rsquo;: &quot;/e; <br>
} <br>
%.o : %.c <br>
: include %.d : signature C <br>
cl -showIncludes -c ... &gt;$(stem).d <br>
&amp;sed &amp;dependify -o +&lt;$(stem).d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some compilers (Intel&rsquo;s
icc just like gcc above, or IBM&rsquo;s xlc) can produce
dependency files on the fly. That is, while they compile,
they write a makefile that makepp can <br>
include. The advantage over makepp&rsquo;s scanner is that
it is guaranteed to be 100% correct, where we may only come
close.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option harnesses that in a
special way: If the file is not present, i.e. typically on
the 1st build, normal scanning occurs. But if the file is
present, no scanning <br>
occurs (which is why we specify a smart signature above --
not scanning falls back to the dumb default of timestamp and
size). Instead it includes the file, before executing <br>
the rule. After successfully executing the rule, it forgets
whatever it read the first time, given that the file might
have been outdated. Instead it reads the file again, <br>
if it changed, for having up-to-date build info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: This is inherently
unreliable. The dependency file gets produced by the very
rule for which it is a dependency. On the other hand, the
compiler knows about all <br>
it&rsquo;s internal sub-includes, which makepp usually
ignores. This is a reliability advantage only for the case
where a compiler patch fixes only the sub-includes. The
price is <br>
that makepp ends up looking at many more files, which takes
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a catch when you remove
an &quot;#include&quot; statement and the corresponding
file: It will still be mentioned in the dependency file from
the last time, when it was needed. <br>
In such a case you must edit the dependency file to remove
the dependency which is no longer fulfillable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature can not be used
with a build cache because fetching a file from there
requires knowing everything about the file. But a dependency
file depends on those files <br>
makepp learns about by reading it. Such a circular
dependency is not normally possible in a reliable build
system. This is an exception because after rebuilding and
<br>
rereading a dependency file everything is correct again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you build in your
repositories, makepp will pick up the dependency file from
the 1st repository which contains one. This is unlike other
files, where it takes the 1st <br>
with the expected signature. This is better than for build
caches, where for lack of signature, it can&rsquo;t even
find the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:last_chance <br>
Enable an open-ended rule, such as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.foo foo%.bar: :last_chance
<br>
&amp;echo $@ -o $@ <br>
&amp;cp $(outputs)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because a rule such as this
could generate an essentially infinite number of targets, a
target of this rule will not match a $(wildcard) function or
pattern rule unless <br>
something else has already instanced the rule by referencing
the target specifically. Furthermore, if
&quot;--rm-stale&quot; is specified, then a target left over
from a previous <br>
makepp run will appear stale if the only way to build it is
via a last_chance rule that hasn&rsquo;t been instanced for
the target yet, which is a desirable behavior because the
<br>
build will fail more consistently when it erroneously relies
on a wildcard to match targets from a previous run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;:last_chance&quot;
option is intended to call attention to the special behavior
of the rule with respect to matching wildcards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:parser parser <br>
This tells makepp how to parse the command for detecting
(include) files. Usually, makepp guesses how to do this
based on the words in the command itself (see <br>
makepp_scanning for details). However, if makepp guesses
wrongly, you may want to explicitly indicate the parser,
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.o: %.abc <br>
: parser c_compilation <br>
action here</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This causes makepp to perform
the same parsing and scanning that it does for C/C++ build
commands, even if it doesn&rsquo;t recognize the action as a
C compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default parser depends on
the command. If you do not specify a &quot;:parser&quot;
option, then the first word of each command is examined. For
example for a compile or link <br>
command, makepp will use the &quot;c_compilation&quot;
parser; or if the command looks like the GNU variant,
&quot;gcc_compilation&quot;. If no parser is found it uses
the &quot;none&quot; parser. For <br>
more details on this, or if you want to write your own
parser or change makepp&rsquo;s default parsers, see
makepp_scanning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this applies to every
command in the rule, which may not be what you want:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.o: %.c : parser c-compilation
<br>
@echo &rsquo;Building $(output)&rsquo; <br>
@funny_cc ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will also interpret
&quot;echo&quot; as a compiler and deduce its argument
&rsquo;Building mymodule.o&rsquo; as an implicit dependency.
This will lead to the complaint that it doesn&rsquo;t know
<br>
how to build such a file. In this case you would be better
off with &quot;register_parser&quot;. There you find an
explanation how parser can be given either as a classname or
as a <br>
function name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:signature signature_method <br>
target : dependencies <br>
: signature md5 <br>
actions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tells makepp what algorithm
to use to determine if the dependencies have changed. See
makepp_signatures for more details. Signature methods which
are included with the <br>
makepp distribution are are &quot;plain&quot;,
&quot;md5&quot;, &quot;C&quot; or
&quot;c_compilation_md5&quot;, and
&quot;shared_object&quot;. This overrides any signature
method specified with the &quot;-m&quot; or <br>
&quot;--signature-method&quot; command line options, or with
the &quot;signature&quot; statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special characters <br>
Makepp can support filenames that have special characters in
them like a colon or a space. Suppose, for example, you want
to create a file called &quot;a:thing&quot; from the file
<br>
&quot;b:thing&quot;. You can&rsquo;t write the rule this
way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a:thing : b:thing # This is a
syntax error <br>
&amp;cat $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">because makepp won&rsquo;t know
which colons separate targets from dependencies and which
are part of the filenames. Instead, simply enclose the name
in quotes, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;a:thing&quot; :
&quot;b:thing&quot; <br>
&amp;cat $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now the rule is unambiguous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makepp&rsquo;s quoting syntax is
quite similar to the shell&rsquo;s. You can, for example,
use single quotes instead of double quotes, or you can
escape special characters with a backslash:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">athing : &rsquo;b:thing&rsquo;
<br>
&amp;cat $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppose, for example, that your
filename is &quot;&rsquo;&quot;!;. Now why you&rsquo;d want
such a filename I don&rsquo;t know, but here are several
ways you could specify it to makepp (and the shell):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acute;&rsquo;&quot;!;&rsquo;
<br>
&quot;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pay attention as to when makepp
strips quotes and when the shell does. Makepp looks at
quotes only in the following cases:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; in the
&quot;ifeq&quot; family of tests</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; before and after
the rule colon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; in a makepp
builtin command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; in a function
that pertains to files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike the shell, makepp
doesn&rsquo;t expand quotes while assigning them to a
variable. Thus the following rules are identical:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE = &rsquo;name with
spaces&rsquo; <br>
x := $(print $(FILE)) # just to check that quotes are still
there <br>
$(FILE): # quotes around single file stripped by makepp <br>
&amp;echo hello -o$(FILE) # quotes around single file
stripped by makepp <br>
echo there &gt;&gt;$(FILE) # quotes around single file
stripped by Shell <br>
&rsquo;name with spaces&rsquo;: <br>
&amp;echo hello -o&rsquo;name with spaces&rsquo; <br>
echo there &gt;&gt;&rsquo;$(output)&rsquo; # quotes were
stripped above, add them again</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that (unlike the Shell)
variables beginning with &quot;$&quot; are expanded even
inside single quotes. Dollar signs cannot be protected by
quotes or backslashes. To get a literal <br>
dollar sign, use a double dollar sign, e.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(phony all): <br>
@&amp;echo This is a dollar sign: $$ <br>
@for val in a b c d; do echo $$val; done</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generally, you should be able to
deal with just about any special character by quoting it in
some way. This includes spaces, control characters, etc.
However, be aware that at <br>
present, makepp&rsquo;s comment stripping is somewhat
simplistic, and any &quot;#&quot; characters preceded by
whitespace will be interpreted as comments no matter how
they are quoted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a target or dependency name
is put into an automatic variable like
&quot;$(output)&quot;, then the quotes and any backslashes
are stripped. This means that if you want to reference <br>
the filename in the actions, you will probably have to quote
it again, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;a file name with
spaces&quot;: <br>
echo &quot;Special contents&quot; &gt; &quot;$@&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t put the
quotes around $@, then the shell will see the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo &quot;Special
contents&quot; &gt; a file name with spaces</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which writes the string
&quot;Special contents file name with spaces&quot; to the
file called a. This is probably not what you want.</p>
