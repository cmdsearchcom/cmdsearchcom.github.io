<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
map2slim - maps gene associations to a &rsquo;slim&rsquo;
ontology</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cd go <br>
map2slim GO_slims/goslim_generic.obo
ontology/gene_ontology.obo
gene-associations/gene_association.fb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Given a GO slim file, and a current ontology (in one or more
files), this script will map a gene association file
(containing annotations to the full GO) to the terms in the
GO <br>
slim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The script can be used to either
create a new gene association file, containing the most
pertinent GO slim accessions, or in count-mode, in which
case it will give distinct gene <br>
product counts for each slim term</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The association file format is
described here:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;http://www.geneontology.org/GO.annotation.shtml#file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
-b bucket slim file <br>
This argument adds bucket terms to the slim ontology; see
the documentation below for an explanation. The new slim
ontology file, including bucket terms will be written to
<br>
bucket slim file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-outmap slim mapping file <br>
This will generate a mapping file for every term in the full
ontology showing both the most pertinent slim term and all
slim terms that are ancestors. If you use this option, <br>
do NOT supply a gene-associations file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shownames <br>
(Only works with -outmap)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show the names of the term in
the slim mapping file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c This will force map2slim to
give counts of the assoc file, rather than map it</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t When used in conjunction with
-c will tab the output so that the indentation reflects the
tree hierarchy in the slim file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o out file <br>
This will write the mapped assocs (or counts) to the
specified file, rather than to the screen</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOWNLOAD <br>
This script is part of the go-perl package, available from
CPAN</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;http://search.cpan.org/~cmungall/go-perl/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This script will not work
without installing go-perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAPPING ALGORITHM <br>
GO is a DAG, not a tree. This means that there is often more
than one path from a GO term up to the root Gene_Ontology
node; the path may intersect multiple terms in the slim <br>
ontology - which means that one annotation can map to
multiple slim terms!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(note you need to view this
online to see the image below - if you are not viewing this
on the http://www.geneontology.org site, you can look at the
following URL: <br>

&lt;http://geneontology.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/geneontology/go-dev/go-perl/doc/map2slim.gif&gt;
)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A hypothetical example blue
circles show terms in the GO slim, and yellow circles show
terms in the full ontology. The full ontology subsumes the
slim, so the blue terms are <br>
also in the ontology.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GO ID MAPS TO SLIM ID ALL SLIM
ANCESTORS <br>
===== =============== ================== <br>
5 2+3 2,3,1 <br>
6 3 only 3,1 <br>
7 4 only 4,3,1 <br>
8 3 only 3,1 <br>
9 4 only 4,3,1 <br>
10 2+3 2,3,1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The 2nd column shows the most
pertinent ID(s) in the slim the direct mapping. The 3rd
column shows all ancestors in the slim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note in particular the mapping
of ID 9 although this has two paths to the root through the
slim via 3 and 4, 3 is discarded because it is subsumed by
4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the other hand, 10 maps to
both 2 and 3 because these are both the first slim ID in the
two valid paths to the root, and neither subsumes the
other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The algorithm used is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to map any one term in the full
ontology: find all valid paths through to the root node in
the full ontology</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for each path, take the first
slim term encountered in the path</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">discard any redundant slim terms
in this set ie slim terms subsumed by other slim terms in
the set</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUCKET TERMS <br>
If you run the script with the -b option, bucket terms will
be added. For any term P in the slim, if P has at least one
child C, a bucket term P&rsquo; will be created under P.
This is <br>
a catch-all term for mapping any term in the full ontology
that is a descendant of P, but NOT a descendant of any child
of P in the slim ontology.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the slim
generic.0208 has the following terms and structure:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%DNA binding ; GO:0003677 <br>
%chromatin binding ; GO:0003682 <br>
%transcription factor activity ; GO:0003700, GO:0000130</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After adding bucket terms, it
will look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%DNA binding ; GO:0003677 <br>
%chromatin binding ; GO:0003682 <br>
%transcription factor activity ; GO:0003700 ;
synonym:GO:0000130 <br>
@bucket:Z-OTHER-DNA binding ; slim_temp_id:12</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Terms from the full ontology
that are other children of DNA binding, such as
single-stranded DNA binding and its descendents will map to
the bucket term.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bucket term has a slim ID
which is transient and is there only to facilitate the
mapping. It should not be used externally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bucket term has the prefix
Z-OTHER; the Z is a hack to make sure that the term is
always listed last in the alphabetic ordering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The algorithm is slightly
modified if bucket terms are used. The bucket term has an
implicit relationship to all OTHER siblings not in the
slim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do I need bucket terms?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nowadays most slim files are
entirely or nearly &rsquo;complete&rsquo;, that is there are
no gaps. This means the the -b option will not produce
noticeable different results. For example, <br>
you may see a bucket term OTHER-binding created, with
nothing annotated to it: because all the children of binding
in the GO are represented in the slim file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bucket option is really only
necessary for some of the older archived slim files, which
are static and were generated in a fairly ad-hoc way; they
tend to accumulate &rsquo;gaps&rsquo; <br>
over time (eg GO will add a new child of binding, but the
static slim file won&rsquo;t be up to date, so any gene
products annotated to this new term will map to
OTHER-binding in the <br>
slim)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRAPH MISMATCHES <br>
Note that the slim ontology file(s) may be out of date with
respect to the current ontology.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently map2slim does not flag
graph mismatches between the slim graph and the graph in the
full ontology file; it takes the full ontology as being the
real graph. However, the <br>
slim ontology will be used to format the results if you
select -t -c as options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT <br>
In normal mode, a standard format gene-association file will
be written. The GO ID column (5) will contain GO slim IDs.
The mapping corresponds to the 2nd column in the table <br>
above. Note that the output file may contain more lines that
the input file. This is because some full GO IDs have more
than one pertinent slim ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COUNT MODE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">map2slim can be run with the -c
option, which will gives the counts of distinct gene
products mapped to each slim term. The columns are as
follows</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GO Term <br>
The first column is the GO ID followed by the term name (the
term name is provided as it is found in both the full GO and
slim ontologies - these will usually be the same but <br>
occasionally the slim file will lage behind changes in the
GO file)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Count of gene products for which
this is the most relevant slim term <br>
the number of distinct gene products for which this is the
most pertinent/direct slim ID. By most direct we mean that
either the association is made directly to this term, OR
<br>
the association is made to a child of this slim term AND
there is no child slim term which the association maps
to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For most slims, this count will
be equivalent to the number of associations directly mapped
to this slim term. However, some older slim files are
&quot;spotty&quot; in that they admit <br>
&quot;gaps&quot;. For example, if the slim has all children
of &quot;biological process&quot; with the exception of
&quot;behavior&quot; then all annotations to
&quot;behavior&quot; or its children will be counted <br>
here</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">see example below</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Count of gene products inferred
to be associated with slim term <br>
and the number of distinct gene products which are annotated
to any descendant of this slim ID (or annotated directly to
the slim ID).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">obsoletion flag <br>
GO ontology</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To take an example; if we use -t
and -c like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">map2slim -t -c
GO_slims/goslim_generic.obo ontology/gene_ontology.obo
gene-associations/gene_association.fb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then part of the results may
look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GO:0008150 biological_process
(biological_process) 34 10025 biological_process <br>
GO:0007610 behavior (behavior) 632 632 biological_process
<br>
GO:0000004 biological process unknown (biological process
unknown) 832 832 biological_process <br>
GO:0007154 cell communication (cell communication) 333 1701
biological_process <br>
GO:0008037 cell recognition (cell recognition) 19 19
biological_process <br>
19 products were mapped to GO:0008037 or one of its
children. (GO:0008037 is a leaf node in the slim, so the two
counts are identical).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the other hand, GO:0008150
only gets 34 products for which this is the most relevant
term. This is because most annotations would map to some
child of GO:0008150 in the slim, <br>
such as GO:0007610 (behavior). These 34 gene products are
either annotated directly to GO:0008150, or to some child of
this term which is not in the slim. This can point to <br>
&rsquo;gaps&rsquo; in the slim. Note that running map2slim
with the -b option will &rsquo;plug&rsquo; these gaps with
artificial filler terms.</p>
