Given a GO slim file, and a current ontology (in one or more files), this script
  will map a gene association file (containing annotations to the full GO) to
  the terms in the GO slim.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The script can be used to either create a new gene association file, containing
  the most pertinent GO slim accessions, or in count-mode, in which case it will
  give distinct gene product counts for each slim term
<div class="Pp"></div>
The association file format is described here:

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="MAPPING_ALGORITHM_"><a class="selflink" href="#MAPPING_ALGORITHM_">MAPPING
  ALGORITHM </a></h2>
GO is a DAG, not a tree. This means that there is often more than one path from
  a GO term up to the root Gene_Ontology node; the path may intersect multiple
  terms in the slim ontology - which means that one annotation can map to
  multiple slim terms!
<div class="Pp"></div>
( <b>note</b> you need to view this online to see the image below - if you are
  not viewing this on the http://www.geneontology.org site, you can look at the
  following URL:
  &lt;http://geneontology.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/geneontology/go-dev/go-perl/doc/map2slim.gif&gt;
  )
<div class="Pp"></div>
A hypothetical example blue circles show terms in the GO slim, and yellow
  circles show terms in the full ontology. The full ontology subsumes the slim,
  so the blue terms are also in the ontology.

  GO ID  MAPS TO SLIM ID        ALL SLIM ANCESTORS
  =====  ===============        ==================
  5      2+3                    2,3,1
  6      3 only                 3,1
  7      4 only                 4,3,1
  8      3 only                 3,1
  9      4 only                 4,3,1
  10     2+3                    2,3,1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 2nd column shows the most pertinent ID(s) in the slim the direct mapping.
  The 3rd column shows all ancestors in the slim.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note in particular the mapping of ID 9 although this has two paths to the root
  through the slim via 3 and 4, 3 is discarded because it is subsumed by 4.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On the other hand, 10 maps to both 2 and 3 because these are both the first slim
  ID in the two valid paths to the root, and neither subsumes the other.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The algorithm used is:
<div class="Pp"></div>
to map any one term in the full ontology: find all valid paths through to the
  root node in the full ontology
<div class="Pp"></div>
for each path, take the first slim term encountered in the path
<div class="Pp"></div>
discard any redundant slim terms in this set ie slim terms subsumed by other
  slim terms in the set
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="BUCKET_TERMS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUCKET_TERMS">BUCKET
  TERMS</a></h2>
If you run the script with the -b option, bucket terms will be added. For any
  term P in the slim, if P has at least one child C, a bucket term P' will be
  created under P. This is a catch-all term for mapping any term in the full
  ontology that is a descendant of P, but NOT a descendant of any child of P in
  the slim ontology.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, the slim generic.0208 has the following terms and structure:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    %DNA binding ; GO:0003677
     %chromatin binding ; GO:0003682 
     %transcription factor activity ; GO:0003700, GO:0000130
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
After adding bucket terms, it will look like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   %DNA binding ; GO:0003677
    %chromatin binding ; GO:0003682
    %transcription factor activity ; GO:0003700 ; synonym:GO:0000130
    @bucket:Z-OTHER-DNA binding ; slim_temp_id:12
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Terms from the full ontology that are other children of DNA binding, such as
  single-stranded DNA binding and its descendents will map to the bucket term.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The bucket term has a slim ID which is transient and is there only to facilitate
  the mapping. It should not be used externally.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The bucket term has the prefix Z-OTHER; the Z is a hack to make sure that the
  term is always listed last in the alphabetic ordering.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The algorithm is slightly modified if bucket terms are used. The bucket term has
  an implicit relationship to all OTHER siblings not in the slim.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Do I need bucket terms?</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Nowadays most slim files are entirely or nearly 'complete', that is there are no
  gaps. This means the the -b option will not produce noticeable different
  results. For example, you may see a bucket term OTHER-binding created, with
  nothing annotated to it: because all the children of binding in the GO are
  represented in the slim file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The bucket option is really only necessary for some of the older archived slim
  files, which are static and were generated in a fairly ad-hoc way; they tend
  to accumulate 'gaps' over time (eg GO will add a new child of binding, but the
  static slim file won't be up to date, so any gene products annotated to this
  new term will map to OTHER-binding in the slim)
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="GRAPH_MISMATCHES"><a class="selflink" href="#GRAPH_MISMATCHES">GRAPH
  MISMATCHES</a></h2>
Note that the slim ontology file(s) may be out of date with respect to the
  current ontology.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Currently map2slim does not flag graph mismatches between the slim graph and the
  graph in the full ontology file; it takes the full ontology as being the real
  graph. However, the slim ontology will be used to format the results if you
  select <b>-t -c</b> as options.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="OUTPUT"><a class="selflink" href="#OUTPUT">OUTPUT</a></h2>
In normal mode, a standard format gene-association file will be written. The GO
  ID column (5) will contain GO slim IDs. The mapping corresponds to the 2nd
  column in the table above. Note that the output file may contain more lines
  that the input file. This is because some full GO IDs have more than one
  pertinent slim ID.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>COUNT MODE</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
map2slim can be run with the -c option, which will gives the counts of distinct
  gene products mapped to each slim term. The columns are as follows
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">GO Term</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The first column is the GO ID followed by the term name
      (the term name is provided as it is found in both the full GO and slim
      ontologies - these will usually be the same but occasionally the slim file
      will lage behind changes in the GO file)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Count of gene products for which this is the most relevant
    slim term</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">the number of distinct gene products for which this is the
      most pertinent/direct slim ID. By most direct we mean that either the
      association is made directly to this term, OR the association is made to a
      child of this slim term AND there is no child slim term which the
      association maps to.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For most slims, this count will be equivalent to the number of associations
      directly mapped to this slim term. However, some older slim files are
      &quot;spotty&quot; in that they admit &quot;gaps&quot;. For example, if
      the slim has all children of &quot;biological process&quot; with the
      exception of &quot;behavior&quot; then all annotations to
      &quot;behavior&quot; or its children will be counted here
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    see example below</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Count of gene products inferred to be associated with slim
    term</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">and the number of distinct gene products which are
      annotated to any descendant of this slim ID (or annotated directly to the
      slim ID).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">obsoletion flag</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">GO ontology</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To take an example; if we use -t and -c like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  map2slim -t -c GO_slims/goslim_generic.obo ontology/gene_ontology.obo gene-associations/gene_association.fb
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then part of the results may look like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 GO:0008150 biological_process (biological_process)     34      10025           biological_process
  GO:0007610 behavior (behavior)        632     632             biological_process
  GO:0000004 biological process unknown (biological process unknown)    832     832             biological_process
  GO:0007154 cell communication (cell communication)    333     1701            biological_process
   GO:0008037 cell recognition (cell recognition)       19      19              biological_process                                                              
19 products were mapped to GO:0008037 or one of its children. (GO:0008037 is a leaf node in the slim, so the two counts are identical).
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
On the other hand, GO:0008150 only gets 34 products for which this is the most
  relevant term. This is because most annotations would map to some child of
  GO:0008150 in the slim, such as GO:0007610 (behavior). These 34 gene products
  are either annotated directly to GO:0008150, or to some child of this term
  which is not in the slim. This can point to 'gaps' in the slim. Note that
  running map2slim with the -b option will 'plug' these gaps with artificial
  filler terms.
