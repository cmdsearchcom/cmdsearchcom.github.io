<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pamtotga - convert a Netpbm image to a TrueVision Targa
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pamtotga [-mono|-cmap|-rgb] [-norle] [-name=name
[pamfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options can be abbreviated
to their shortest unique prefix. You may use two hyphens
instead of one to designate an option. You may use either
white space or equals signs <br>
between an option name and its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamtotga reads a PBM, PGM, PPM,
or PAM image as input and produces a TrueVision Targa file
as output. The PAM image may be either a BLACKANDWHITE,
GRAYSCALE, RGB, or RGB_ALPHA <br>
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create a TGA image with
transparency (i.e. with an alpha mask), use RGB_ALPHA PAM
input. Some Netpbm programs that generate images with alpha
masks generate them in that for&acirc; <br>
mat. For another way to create the proper input stream, see
pamstack(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is unclear that anything
except pamtotga knows about TGAs with transparency. The
history behind this feature of pamtotga is not clear. The
format pamtotga produces is simply <br>
the same as an ordinary RGB TGA image except with a 4th
plane added for transparency. The PixelSize field of the TGA
header specifies 32 bits instead of 24 and the raster has an
<br>
extra byte added to each pixel, at the tail end. The value
of that byte has the same meaning as in a PAM image with
maxval 255.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-cmap Make output Targa file of type 24 bit colormapped.
Input must contain no more than 256 distinct colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mono Make output Targa file of
type 8 bit monochrome. Input must be PBM or PGM or a PAM
with BLACKANDWHITE or GRAYSCALE tuple type. See -cmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may specify at most one of
-mono, -cmap, and -rgb. If you specify neither, the default
image type is the most highly constrained compatible type is
used, where mono&acirc; <br>
chrome is more constrained than colormapped which is in turn
more constrained than unmapped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rgb Make output Targa file of
type 24 bit unmapped color. See -cmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-norle Do not use run-length
encoding in the output Targa file. Run-length encoded files
are smaller, but Some Targa readers can&rsquo;t read
run-length encoded files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-name=name <br>
This is the value for the image ID stated in the header of
the TGA output file. pamtotga truncates it as necessary to
meet TGA standards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, pamtotga uses the
input file name argument, up to the first period (or the
whole thing if there is no period). It truncates it as
necessary to meet TGA stan&acirc; <br>
dards. If you specify (or default to) Standard Input,
pamtotga omits the image ID from the TGA header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
This program was called ppmtotga until Netpbm 10.6 (July
2002). That was always a misnomer, though, because a PPM
class program would not be able to tell the difference
between <br>
PGM and PPM input (it would all look like PPM), and thus
could not choose the output Targa image type based on the
type of the input. Netpbm 10.6 also added the ability to
han&acirc; <br>
dle an alpha channel, so it became a PAM class program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Netpbm 10.15 (April 2003),
the program became the first in the Netpbm package to
recognize an alpha channel in a PAM. It recognized tuple
type &rsquo;RGBA&rsquo;. But when this kind of <br>
PAM image was later added to the PAM specification, it was
specified with tuple type &rsquo;RGB_ALPHA&rsquo;. So in
Netpbm 10-26 (January 2005), pamtotga changed to recognize
&rsquo;RGB_ALPHA&rsquo; <br>
instead of &rsquo;RGBA&rsquo;.</p>
