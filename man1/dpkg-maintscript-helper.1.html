<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is designed to be run within maintainer scripts
to achieve some tasks that dpkg can&rsquo;t (yet) handle
natively either because of design decisions or due to
current lim&acirc; <br>
itations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of those tasks require
coordinated actions from several maintainer scripts
(preinst, postinst, prerm, postrm). To avoid mistakes the
same call simply needs to be put in all <br>
scripts and the program will automatically adapt its
behaviour based on the environment variable
DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_NAME and on the maintainer scripts
arguments that you have to <br>
forward after a double hyphen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMON PARAMETERS <br>
prior-version <br>
Defines the latest version of the package whose upgrade
should trigger the operation. It is important to calculate
prior-version correctly so that the operations are
cor&acirc; <br>
rectly performed even if the user rebuilt the package with a
local version. If prior-version is empty or omitted, then
the operation is tried on every upgrade (note: it&rsquo;s
<br>
safer to give the version and have the operation tried only
once).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the conffile has not been
shipped for several versions, and you are now modifying the
maintainer scripts to clean up the obsolete file,
prior-version should be based on <br>
the version of the package that you are now preparing, not
the first version of the package that lacked the conffile.
This applies to all other actions in the same way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, for a conffile
removed in version 2.0-1 of a package, prior-version should
be set to 2.0-1~. This will cause the conffile to be removed
even if the user <br>
rebuilt the previous version 1.0-1 as 1.0-1local1. Or a
package switching a path from a symlink (shipped in version
1.0-1) to a directory (shipped in version 2.0-1), but <br>
only performing the actual switch in the maintainer scripts
in version 3.0-1, should set prior-version to 3.0-1~.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package <br>
The package name. When the package is &acirc;Multi-Arch:
same&acirc; this parameter must include the architecture
qualifier, otherwise it should not usually include the
architecture <br>
qualifier (as it would disallow cross-grades, or switching
from being architecture specific to architecture all or vice
versa). If the parameter is empty or omitted, the <br>
DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE and DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_ARCH
environment variables (as set by dpkg) will be used to
generate an arch-qualified package name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- All the parameters of the
maintainer scripts have to be forwarded to the program after
--.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFFILE RELATED TASKS <br>
When upgrading a package, dpkg will not automatically remove
a conffile (a configuration file for which dpkg should
preserve user changes) if it is not present in the newer
ver&acirc; <br>
sion. There are two principal reasons for this; the first is
that the conffile could&rsquo;ve been dropped by accident
and the next version could restore it, users wouldn&rsquo;t
want their <br>
changes thrown away. The second is to allow packages to
transition files from a dpkg-maintained conffile to a file
maintained by the package&rsquo;s maintainer scripts,
usually with a <br>
tool like debconf or ucf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that if a package is
intended to rename or remove a conffile, it must explicitly
do so and dpkg-maintscript-helper can be used to implement
graceful deletion and mov&acirc; <br>
ing of conffiles within maintainer scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Removing a conffile <br>
If a conffile is completely removed, it should be removed
from disk, unless the user has modified it. If there are
local modifications, they should be preserved. If the
package <br>
upgrades aborts, the newly obsolete conffile should not
disappear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of this is implemented by
putting the following shell snippet in the preinst, postinst
and postrm maintainer scripts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpkg-maintscript-helper
rm_conffile conffile prior-version package --
&quot;$@&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">conffile is the filename of the
conffile to remove.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Current implementation: in the
preinst, it checks if the conffile was modified and renames
it either to conffile.dpkg-remove (if not modified) or to
conffile.dpkg-backup (if mod&acirc; <br>
ified). In the postinst, the latter file is renamed to
conffile.dpkg-bak and kept for reference as it contains user
modifications but the former will be removed. If the package
<br>
upgrade aborts, the postrm reinstalls the original conffile.
During purge, the postrm will also delete the .dpkg-bak file
kept up to now.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Renaming a conffile <br>
If a conffile is moved from one location to another, you
need to make sure you move across any changes the user has
made. This may seem a simple change to the preinst script at
<br>
first, however that will result in the user being prompted
by dpkg to approve the conffile edits even though they are
not responsible of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Graceful renaming can be
implemented by putting the following shell snippet in the
preinst, postinst and postrm maintainer scripts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpkg-maintscript-helper
mv_conffile old-conffile new-conffile prior-version package
-- &quot;$@&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">old-conffile and new-conffile
are the old and new name of the conffile to rename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Current implementation: the
preinst checks if the conffile has been modified, if yes
it&rsquo;s left on place otherwise it&rsquo;s renamed to
old-conffile.dpkg-remove. On configuration, the <br>
postinst removes old-conffile.dpkg-remove and renames
old-conffile to new-conffile if old-conffile is still
available. On abort-upgrade/abort-install, the postrm
renames old- <br>
conffile.dpkg-remove back to old-conffile if required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYMLINK AND DIRECTORY SWITCHES
<br>
When upgrading a package, dpkg will not automatically switch
a symlink to a directory or vice-versa. Downgrades are not
supported and the path will be left as is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switching a symlink to directory
<br>
If a symlink is switched to a real directory, you need to
make sure before unpacking that the symlink is removed. This
may seem a simple change to the preinst script at first,
<br>
however that will result in some problems in case of admin
local customization of the symlink or when downgrading the
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Graceful renaming can be
implemented by putting the following shell snippet in the
preinst, postinst and postrm maintainer scripts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpkg-maintscript-helper
symlink_to_dir pathname old-target prior-version package --
&quot;$@&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pathname is the absolute name of
the old symlink (the path will be a directory at the end of
the installation) and old-target is the target name of the
former symlink at path&acirc; <br>
name. It can either be absolute or relative to the directory
containing pathname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Current implementation: the
preinst checks if the symlink exists and points to
old-target, if not then it&rsquo;s left in place, otherwise
it&rsquo;s renamed to pathname.dpkg-backup. On con&acirc;
<br>
figuration, the postinst removes pathname.dpkg-backup if
pathname.dpkg-backup is still a symlink. On
abort-upgrade/abort-install, the postrm renames
pathname.dpkg-backup back to <br>
pathname if required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switching a directory to symlink
<br>
If a real directory is switched to a symlink, you need to
make sure before unpacking that the directory is removed.
This may seem a simple change to the preinst script at
first, <br>
however that will result in some problems in case the
directory contains conffiles, pathnames owned by other
packages, locally created pathnames, or when downgrading the
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Graceful switching can be
implemented by putting the following shell snippet in the
preinst, postinst and postrm maintainer scripts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpkg-maintscript-helper
dir_to_symlink pathname new-target prior-version package --
&quot;$@&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pathname is the absolute name of
the old directory (the path will be a symlink at the end of
the installation) and new-target is the target of the new
symlink at pathname. It can <br>
either be absolute or relative to the directory containing
pathname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Current implementation: the
preinst checks if the directory exists, does not contain
conffiles, pathnames owned by other packages, or locally
created pathnames, if not then it&rsquo;s <br>
left in place, otherwise it&rsquo;s renamed to
pathname.dpkg-backup, and an empty staging directory named
pathname is created, marked with a file so that dpkg can
track it. On configu&acirc; <br>
ration, the postinst finishes the switch if
pathname.dpkg-backup is still a directory and pathname is
the staging directory; it removes the staging directory mark
file, moves the <br>
newly created files inside the staging directory to the
symlink target new-target/, replaces the now empty staging
directory pathname with a symlink to new-target, and removes
<br>
pathname.dpkg-backup. On abort-upgrade/abort-install, the
postrm renames pathname.dpkg-backup back to pathname if
required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTEGRATION IN PACKAGES <br>
When using a packaging helper, please check if it has native
dpkg-maintscript-helper integration, which might make your
life easier. See for example dh_installdeb(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Given that
dpkg-maintscript-helper is used in the preinst, using it
unconditionally requires a pre-dependency to ensure that the
required version of dpkg has been unpacked <br>
before. The required version depends on the command used,
for rm_conffile and mv_conffile it is 1.15.7.2, for
symlink_to_dir and dir_to_symlink it is 1.17.14:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pre-Depends: dpkg (&gt;=
1.17.14)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But in many cases the operation
done by the program is not critical for the package, and
instead of using a pre-dependency we can call the program
only if we know that the <br>
required command is supported by the currently installed
dpkg:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if dpkg-maintscript-helper
supports command; then <br>
dpkg-maintscript-helper command ... <br>
fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command supports will return
0 on success, 1 otherwise. The supports command will check
if the environment variables as set by dpkg and required by
the script are present, <br>
and will consider it a failure in case the environment is
not sufficient.</p>
