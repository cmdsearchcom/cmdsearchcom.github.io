cjpeg - compress an image file to a JPEG file
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>cjpeg</b> [ <i>options</i> ] [ <i>filename</i> ]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>cjpeg</b> compresses the named image file, or the standard input if no file
  is named, and produces a JPEG/JFIF file on the standard output. The currently
  supported input file formats are: PPM (PBMPLUS color format), PGM (PBMPLUS
  gray-scale format), BMP, Targa, and RLE (Utah Raster Toolkit format). (RLE is
  supported only if the URT library is available.)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
All switch names may be abbreviated; for example, <b>-grayscale</b> may be
  written <b>-gray</b> or <b>-gr</b>. Most of the &quot;basic&quot; switches can
  be abbreviated to as little as one letter. Upper and lower case are equivalent
  (thus <b>-BMP</b> is the same as <b>-bmp</b>). British spellings are also
  accepted (e.g., <b>-greyscale</b>), though for brevity these are not mentioned
  below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The basic switches are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-quality</b><i> N[,...]</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Scale quantization tables to adjust image quality. Quality
      is 0 (worst) to 100 (best); default is 75. (See below for more info.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-grayscale</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Create monochrome JPEG file from color input. Be sure to
      use this switch when compressing a grayscale BMP file, because
      <b>cjpeg</b> isn't bright enough to notice whether a BMP file uses only
      shades of gray. By saying <b>-grayscale</b>, you'll get a smaller JPEG
      file that takes less time to process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-rgb</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Create RGB JPEG file. Using this switch suppresses the
      conversion from RGB colorspace input to the default YCbCr JPEG
    colorspace.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-optimize</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Perform optimization of entropy encoding parameters.
      Without this, default encoding parameters are used. <b>-optimize</b>
      usually makes the JPEG file a little smaller, but <b>cjpeg</b> runs
      somewhat slower and needs much more memory. Image quality and speed of
      decompression are unaffected by <b>-optimize</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-progressive</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Create progressive JPEG file (see below).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-targa</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Input file is Targa format. Targa files that contain an
      &quot;identification&quot; field will not be automatically recognized by
      <b>cjpeg</b>; for such files you must specify <b>-targa</b> to make
      <b>cjpeg</b> treat the input as Targa format. For most Targa files, you
      won't need this switch.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-quality</b> switch lets you trade off compressed file size against
  quality of the reconstructed image: the higher the quality setting, the larger
  the JPEG file, and the closer the output image will be to the original input.
  Normally you want to use the lowest quality setting (smallest file) that
  decompresses into something visually indistinguishable from the original
  image. For this purpose the quality setting should be between 50 and 95; the
  default of 75 is often about right. If you see defects at <b>-quality</b> 75,
  then go up 5 or 10 counts at a time until you are happy with the output image.
  (The optimal setting will vary from one image to another.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-quality</b> 100 will generate a quantization table of all 1's, minimizing
  loss in the quantization step (but there is still information loss in
  subsampling, as well as roundoff error). This setting is mainly of interest
  for experimental purposes. Quality values above about 95 are <b>not</b>
  recommended for normal use; the compressed file size goes up dramatically for
  hardly any gain in output image quality.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the other direction, quality values below 50 will produce very small files of
  low image quality. Settings around 5 to 10 might be useful in preparing an
  index of a large image library, for example. Try <b>-quality</b> 2 (or so) for
  some amusing Cubist effects. (Note: quality values below about 25 generate
  2-byte quantization tables, which are considered optional in the JPEG
  standard. <b>cjpeg</b> emits a warning message when you give such a quality
  value, because some other JPEG programs may be unable to decode the resulting
  file. Use <b>-baseline</b> if you need to ensure compatibility at low quality
  values.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-quality</b> option has been extended in this version of <b>cjpeg</b> to
  support separate quality settings for luminance and chrominance (or, in
  general, separate settings for every quantization table slot.) The principle
  is the same as chrominance subsampling: since the human eye is more sensitive
  to spatial changes in brightness than spatial changes in color, the
  chrominance components can be quantized more than the luminance components
  without incurring any visible image quality loss. However, unlike subsampling,
  this feature reduces data in the frequency domain instead of the spatial
  domain, which allows for more fine-grained control. This option is useful in
  quality-sensitive applications, for which the artifacts generated by
  subsampling may be unacceptable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-quality</b> option accepts a comma-separated list of parameters, which
  respectively refer to the quality levels that should be assigned to the
  quantization table slots. If there are more q-table slots than parameters,
  then the last parameter is replicated. Thus, if only one quality parameter is
  given, this is used for both luminance and chrominance (slots 0 and 1,
  respectively), preserving the legacy behavior of cjpeg v6b and prior. More (or
  customized) quantization tables can be set with the <b>-qtables</b> option and
  assigned to components with the <b>-qslots</b> option (see the
  &quot;wizard&quot; switches below.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
JPEG files generated with separate luminance and chrominance quality are fully
  compliant with standard JPEG decoders.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>CAUTION:</b> For this setting to be useful, be sure to pass an argument of
  <b>-sample 1x1</b> to <b>cjpeg</b> to disable chrominance subsampling.
  Otherwise, the default subsampling level (2x2, AKA &quot;4:2:0&quot;) will be
  used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-progressive</b> switch creates a &quot;progressive JPEG&quot; file. In
  this type of JPEG file, the data is stored in multiple scans of increasing
  quality. If the file is being transmitted over a slow communications link, the
  decoder can use the first scan to display a low-quality image very quickly,
  and can then improve the display with each subsequent scan. The final image is
  exactly equivalent to a standard JPEG file of the same quality setting, and
  the total file size is about the same --- often a little smaller.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Switches for advanced users:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-arithmetic</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use arithmetic coding. <b>Caution:</b> arithmetic coded
      JPEG is not yet widely implemented, so many decoders will be unable to
      view an arithmetic coded JPEG file at all.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-dct int</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use integer DCT method (default).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-dct fast</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use fast integer DCT (less accurate).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-dct float</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use floating-point DCT method. The float method is very
      slightly more accurate than the int method, but is much slower unless your
      machine has very fast floating-point hardware. Also note that results of
      the floating-point method may vary slightly across machines, while the
      integer methods should give the same results everywhere. The fast integer
      method is much less accurate than the other two.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-restart</b><i> N</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Emit a JPEG restart marker every N MCU rows, or every N MCU
      blocks if &quot;B&quot; is attached to the number. <b>-restart 0</b> (the
      default) means no restart markers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-smooth</b><i> N</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Smooth the input image to eliminate dithering noise. N,
      ranging from 1 to 100, indicates the strength of smoothing. 0 (the
      default) means no smoothing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-maxmemory</b><i> N</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set limit for amount of memory to use in processing large
      images. Value is in thousands of bytes, or millions of bytes if
      &quot;M&quot; is attached to the number. For example, <b>-max 4m</b>
      selects 4000000 bytes. If more space is needed, temporary files will be
      used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-outfile</b><i> name</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Send output image to the named file, not to standard
      output.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-memdst</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Compress to memory instead of a file. This feature was
      implemented mainly as a way of testing the in-memory destination manager
      (jpeg_mem_dest()), but it is also useful for benchmarking, since it
      reduces the I/O overhead.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-verbose</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Enable debug printout. More <b>-v</b>'s give more output.
      Also, version information is printed at startup.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-debug</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Same as <b>-verbose</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-restart</b> option inserts extra markers that allow a JPEG decoder to
  resynchronize after a transmission error. Without restart markers, any damage
  to a compressed file will usually ruin the image from the point of the error
  to the end of the image; with restart markers, the damage is usually confined
  to the portion of the image up to the next restart marker. Of course, the
  restart markers occupy extra space. We recommend <b>-restart 1</b> for images
  that will be transmitted across unreliable networks such as Usenet.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-smooth</b> option filters the input to eliminate fine-scale noise. This
  is often useful when converting dithered images to JPEG: a moderate smoothing
  factor of 10 to 50 gets rid of dithering patterns in the input file, resulting
  in a smaller JPEG file and a better-looking image. Too large a smoothing
  factor will visibly blur the image, however.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Switches for wizards:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-baseline</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Force baseline-compatible quantization tables to be
      generated. This clamps quantization values to 8 bits even at low quality
      settings. (This switch is poorly named, since it does not ensure that the
      output is actually baseline JPEG. For example, you can use
      <b>-baseline</b> and <b>-progressive</b> together.)</dd>

The &quot;wizard&quot; switches are intended for experimentation with JPEG. If
  you don't know what you are doing, <b>don't use them</b>. These switches are
  documented further in the file wizard.txt.

This example compresses the PPM file foo.ppm with a quality factor of 60 and
  saves the output as foo.jpg:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>cjpeg -quality</b> <i>60 foo.ppm</i> <b>&gt;</b>
      <i>foo.jpg</i></dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="HINTS"><a class="selflink" href="#HINTS">HINTS</a></h1>
Color GIF files are not the ideal input for JPEG; JPEG is really intended for
  compressing full-color (24-bit) images. In particular, don't try to convert
  cartoons, line drawings, and other images that have only a few distinct
  colors. GIF works great on these, JPEG does not. If you want to convert a GIF
  to JPEG, you should experiment with <b>cjpeg</b>'s <b>-quality</b> and
  <b>-smooth</b> options to get a satisfactory conversion. <b>-smooth 10</b> or
  so is often helpful.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Avoid running an image through a series of JPEG compression/decompression
  cycles. Image quality loss will accumulate; after ten or so cycles the image
  may be noticeably worse than it was after one cycle. It's best to use a
  lossless format while manipulating an image, then convert to JPEG format when
  you are ready to file the image away.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-optimize</b> option to <b>cjpeg</b> is worth using when you are making a
  &quot;final&quot; version for posting or archiving. It's also a win when you
  are using low quality settings to make very small JPEG files; the percentage
  improvement is often a lot more than it is on larger files. (At present,
  <b>-optimize</b> mode is always selected when generating progressive JPEG
  files.)

Support for GIF input files was removed in cjpeg v6b due to concerns over the
  Unisys LZW patent. Although this patent expired in 2006, cjpeg still lacks GIF
  support, for these historical reasons. (Conversion of GIF files to JPEG is
  usually a bad idea anyway.)

Not all variants of BMP and Targa file formats are supported.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-targa</b> switch is not a bug, it's a feature. (It would be a bug if the
  Targa format designers had not been clueless.)</div>
