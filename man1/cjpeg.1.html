<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cjpeg - compress an image file to a JPEG file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cjpeg [ options ] [ filename ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cjpeg compresses the named image file, or the standard input
if no file is named, and produces a JPEG/JFIF file on the
standard output. The currently supported input file
for&acirc; <br>
mats are: PPM (PBMPLUS color format), PGM (PBMPLUS
gray-scale format), BMP, Targa, and RLE (Utah Raster Toolkit
format). (RLE is supported only if the URT library is
available.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
All switch names may be abbreviated; for example, -grayscale
may be written -gray or -gr. Most of the &quot;basic&quot;
switches can be abbreviated to as little as one letter.
Upper and <br>
lower case are equivalent (thus -BMP is the same as -bmp).
British spellings are also accepted (e.g., -greyscale),
though for brevity these are not mentioned below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The basic switches are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quality N[,...] <br>
Scale quantization tables to adjust image quality. Quality
is 0 (worst) to 100 (best); default is 75. (See below for
more info.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-grayscale <br>
Create monochrome JPEG file from color input. Be sure to use
this switch when compressing a grayscale BMP file, because
cjpeg isn&rsquo;t bright enough to notice whether a BMP <br>
file uses only shades of gray. By saying -grayscale,
you&rsquo;ll get a smaller JPEG file that takes less time to
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rgb Create RGB JPEG file. Using
this switch suppresses the conversion from RGB colorspace
input to the default YCbCr JPEG colorspace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-optimize <br>
Perform optimization of entropy encoding parameters. Without
this, default encoding parameters are used. -optimize
usually makes the JPEG file a little smaller, but <br>
cjpeg runs somewhat slower and needs much more memory. Image
quality and speed of decompression are unaffected by
-optimize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-progressive <br>
Create progressive JPEG file (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-targa Input file is Targa
format. Targa files that contain an
&quot;identification&quot; field will not be automatically
recognized by cjpeg; for such files you must specify -targa
to <br>
make cjpeg treat the input as Targa format. For most Targa
files, you won&rsquo;t need this switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -quality switch lets you
trade off compressed file size against quality of the
reconstructed image: the higher the quality setting, the
larger the JPEG file, and the closer <br>
the output image will be to the original input. Normally you
want to use the lowest quality setting (smallest file) that
decompresses into something visually indistinguishable <br>
from the original image. For this purpose the quality
setting should be between 50 and 95; the default of 75 is
often about right. If you see defects at -quality 75, then
go up <br>
5 or 10 counts at a time until you are happy with the output
image. (The optimal setting will vary from one image to
another.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quality 100 will generate a
quantization table of all 1&rsquo;s, minimizing loss in the
quantization step (but there is still information loss in
subsampling, as well as roundoff <br>
error). This setting is mainly of interest for experimental
purposes. Quality values above about 95 are not recommended
for normal use; the compressed file size goes up
dramat&acirc; <br>
ically for hardly any gain in output image quality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the other direction, quality
values below 50 will produce very small files of low image
quality. Settings around 5 to 10 might be useful in
preparing an index of a large <br>
image library, for example. Try -quality 2 (or so) for some
amusing Cubist effects. (Note: quality values below about 25
generate 2-byte quantization tables, which are consid&acirc;
<br>
ered optional in the JPEG standard. cjpeg emits a warning
message when you give such a quality value, because some
other JPEG programs may be unable to decode the resulting
<br>
file. Use -baseline if you need to ensure compatibility at
low quality values.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -quality option has been
extended in this version of cjpeg to support separate
quality settings for luminance and chrominance (or, in
general, separate settings for every <br>
quantization table slot.) The principle is the same as
chrominance subsampling: since the human eye is more
sensitive to spatial changes in brightness than spatial
changes in <br>
color, the chrominance components can be quantized more than
the luminance components without incurring any visible image
quality loss. However, unlike subsampling, this feature <br>
reduces data in the frequency domain instead of the spatial
domain, which allows for more fine-grained control. This
option is useful in quality-sensitive applications, for <br>
which the artifacts generated by subsampling may be
unacceptable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -quality option accepts a
comma-separated list of parameters, which respectively refer
to the quality levels that should be assigned to the
quantization table slots. If <br>
there are more q-table slots than parameters, then the last
parameter is replicated. Thus, if only one quality parameter
is given, this is used for both luminance and chromi&acirc;
<br>
nance (slots 0 and 1, respectively), preserving the legacy
behavior of cjpeg v6b and prior. More (or customized)
quantization tables can be set with the -qtables option and
<br>
assigned to components with the -qslots option (see the
&quot;wizard&quot; switches below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JPEG files generated with
separate luminance and chrominance quality are fully
compliant with standard JPEG decoders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAUTION: For this setting to be
useful, be sure to pass an argument of -sample 1x1 to cjpeg
to disable chrominance subsampling. Otherwise, the default
subsampling level (2x2, <br>
AKA &quot;4:2:0&quot;) will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -progressive switch creates
a &quot;progressive JPEG&quot; file. In this type of JPEG
file, the data is stored in multiple scans of increasing
quality. If the file is being transmit&acirc; <br>
ted over a slow communications link, the decoder can use the
first scan to display a low-quality image very quickly, and
can then improve the display with each subsequent scan. <br>
The final image is exactly equivalent to a standard JPEG
file of the same quality setting, and the total file size is
about the same --- often a little smaller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switches for advanced users:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-arithmetic <br>
Use arithmetic coding. Caution: arithmetic coded JPEG is not
yet widely implemented, so many decoders will be unable to
view an arithmetic coded JPEG file at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dct int <br>
Use integer DCT method (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dct fast <br>
Use fast integer DCT (less accurate).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dct float <br>
Use floating-point DCT method. The float method is very
slightly more accurate than the int method, but is much
slower unless your machine has very fast floating-point <br>
hardware. Also note that results of the floating-point
method may vary slightly across machines, while the integer
methods should give the same results everywhere. The <br>
fast integer method is much less accurate than the other
two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-restart N <br>
Emit a JPEG restart marker every N MCU rows, or every N MCU
blocks if &quot;B&quot; is attached to the number. -restart
0 (the default) means no restart markers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-smooth N <br>
Smooth the input image to eliminate dithering noise. N,
ranging from 1 to 100, indicates the strength of smoothing.
0 (the default) means no smoothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maxmemory N <br>
Set limit for amount of memory to use in processing large
images. Value is in thousands of bytes, or millions of bytes
if &quot;M&quot; is attached to the number. For example,
<br>
-max 4m selects 4000000 bytes. If more space is needed,
temporary files will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-outfile name <br>
Send output image to the named file, not to standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-memdst <br>
Compress to memory instead of a file. This feature was
implemented mainly as a way of testing the in-memory
destination manager (jpeg_mem_dest()), but it is also useful
<br>
for benchmarking, since it reduces the I/O overhead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Enable debug printout. More -v&rsquo;s give more output.
Also, version information is printed at startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-debug Same as -verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -restart option inserts
extra markers that allow a JPEG decoder to resynchronize
after a transmission error. Without restart markers, any
damage to a compressed file will <br>
usually ruin the image from the point of the error to the
end of the image; with restart markers, the damage is
usually confined to the portion of the image up to the next
<br>
restart marker. Of course, the restart markers occupy extra
space. We recommend -restart 1 for images that will be
transmitted across unreliable networks such as Usenet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -smooth option filters the
input to eliminate fine-scale noise. This is often useful
when converting dithered images to JPEG: a moderate
smoothing factor of 10 to 50 gets <br>
rid of dithering patterns in the input file, resulting in a
smaller JPEG file and a better-looking image. Too large a
smoothing factor will visibly blur the image, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switches for wizards:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-baseline <br>
Force baseline-compatible quantization tables to be
generated. This clamps quantization values to 8 bits even at
low quality settings. (This switch is poorly named, <br>
since it does not ensure that the output is actually
baseline JPEG. For example, you can use -baseline and
-progressive together.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-qtables file <br>
Use the quantization tables given in the specified text
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-qslots N[,...] <br>
Select which quantization table to use for each color
component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sample HxV[,...] <br>
Set JPEG sampling factors for each color component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-scans file <br>
Use the scan script given in the specified text file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;wizard&quot; switches
are intended for experimentation with JPEG. If you
don&rsquo;t know what you are doing, don&rsquo;t use them.
These switches are documented further in the file wiz&acirc;
<br>
ard.txt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
This example compresses the PPM file foo.ppm with a quality
factor of 60 and saves the output as foo.jpg:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cjpeg -quality 60 foo.ppm &gt;
foo.jpg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HINTS <br>
Color GIF files are not the ideal input for JPEG; JPEG is
really intended for compressing full-color (24-bit) images.
In particular, don&rsquo;t try to convert cartoons, line
draw&acirc; <br>
ings, and other images that have only a few distinct colors.
GIF works great on these, JPEG does not. If you want to
convert a GIF to JPEG, you should experiment with
cjpeg&rsquo;s <br>
-quality and -smooth options to get a satisfactory
conversion. -smooth 10 or so is often helpful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Avoid running an image through a
series of JPEG compression/decompression cycles. Image
quality loss will accumulate; after ten or so cycles the
image may be noticeably worse <br>
than it was after one cycle. It&rsquo;s best to use a
lossless format while manipulating an image, then convert to
JPEG format when you are ready to file the image away.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -optimize option to cjpeg is
worth using when you are making a &quot;final&quot; version
for posting or archiving. It&rsquo;s also a win when you are
using low quality settings to make very <br>
small JPEG files; the percentage improvement is often a lot
more than it is on larger files. (At present, -optimize mode
is always selected when generating progressive JPEG <br>
files.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
JPEGMEM <br>
If this environment variable is set, its value is the
default memory limit. The value is specified as described
for the -maxmemory switch. JPEGMEM overrides the default
<br>
value specified when the program was compiled, and itself is
overridden by an explicit -maxmemory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Support for GIF input files was removed in cjpeg v6b due to
concerns over the Unisys LZW patent. Although this patent
expired in 2006, cjpeg still lacks GIF support, for these
<br>
historical reasons. (Conversion of GIF files to JPEG is
usually a bad idea anyway.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not all variants of BMP and
Targa file formats are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -targa switch is not a bug,
it&rsquo;s a feature. (It would be a bug if the Targa format
designers had not been clueless.)</p>
