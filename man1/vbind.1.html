<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVERVIEW <br>
This manual page describes the ShapeTools Version Binding
mechanism, available in most commands of the toolkit. The
general version binding options described on this page are
<br>
available in many commands such like vl(1), vcat(1),
vadm(1), save(1) and retrv(1) (just to name the most
important ones). The vbind command specific options are
private to the <br>
vbind command (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version binding is the process
of selecting one or more versions from a filenames history
in order to provides access to these version(s). This is
conducted by version bind <br>
directives (or just version bindings), which may be one of
the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version numbers <br>
&quot;1.2&quot; (version), &quot;1.&quot; (generation),
&quot;.2&quot; (revision)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version alias names <br>
&quot;ShapeTools-1.4&quot;, or &quot;AtFS-2.0&quot; <br>
Version alias names are symbolic names tagged to single
versions. They must be unique throughout a history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">date specifications <br>
&quot;10.2.93&quot; or &quot;4.3.&quot; (European),
&quot;Feb 10, 1993&quot; or &quot;Mar 4{ (American) <br>
A date may additionally contain a time in the form hh:mm or
hh:mm:ss. See sttime(3) for a complete list of recognized
date formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind rule names <br>
&quot;most_recent:&quot; (plain),
&quot;from_release(VC-4.0):&quot; (with argument) <br>
The colon is not part of the rule name. See the bindrules(7)
manual page for a description on how to define version bind
rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, version binding
selects all versions fulfilling the given version bind
requirements. The -uniq option changes this behavior and
treats only unique identification as <br>
success. With this option given, version bind ignores all
histories with more than one selected version. The -last and
-lastsaved options unify a non unique selection by choosing
<br>
the last version (modification/saving time) or the last
saved version (saving time) from the bind hit set of each
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file
$SHAPETOOLS/lib/shape/BindRules contains predefined rules
for various cases. You may also define your own rule file
and invoke this by either the -rulefile option or by <br>
extending the search space defined by the SHAPETOOLS
environment variable. For information on how to write
version bind rules, see the bindrules(7) manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION BINDING IN ACTION <br>
Version bind directives can be given either in brackets,
directly following the name to be bound, or as option
arguments. Options may be user to set version bindings to be
<br>
applied to all name arguments (-bind and -rule options) or
to define version ranges (-since and -before options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version identification by
version number or version alias either results in a unique
selection or fails, when no appropriate version was
found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foo[1.2] Identifies a specific
version by it&rsquo;s version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foo[release-2] Is interpreted as
identification by version alias name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version identification by date
selects the versions from a history that have been the most
recently saved versions at the given date. Identification by
date may lead to multiple <br>
versions when development work in multiple generations
happened simultaneously at the given date. Vbind understands
various date formats such as in the list below. The
sttime(3) <br>
manual page lists all recognized date formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foo[Jan 31, 1992]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foo[92/01/31]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foo[10.5.92 7:00:00]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version bind rules describe
general version binding policies. They are usually not
dependent on particular file histories and may be applied to
all histories. Version bind rules <br>
may have arguments enclosed in parentheses following the
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foo[bind_rule:]</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">foo[bind_rule(arg1,arg2,...argN):]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the colon at the end of the
rule name in brackets is omitted, vbind first interprets the
given string as version alias. When no version with this
alias name was found, <br>
vbind treats the string as rule name and gives it a second
try.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Plain filenames are those not
followed by any version bind directive in square brackets.
Without a rule given with the -rule option on the command
line, plain filenames are bound <br>
using the default version bind rule. It selects the busy
version if there is one, or the most recent non busy version
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eq (state, busy); max
(version).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default version binding may
also be indicated by an empty pair of brackets: foo[]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME PATTERNS <br>
The ShapeTools version binding mechanism performs filename
substitution for given name patterns similar to sh(1). This
is necessary, as shell filename substitution does not
rec&acirc; <br>
ognize the names of saved versions. Magic cookies are
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* matching any string, including
the empty string,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? matching any single
character,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[c...] matching any one of the
characters enclosed in the square brackets,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[l-r] matching any character
lexically between the left (l) and the right (r) character,
inclusive, and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[!c...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[!l-r] matching any character
not recognized by their counterparts above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As square brackets on the
command line may either be part of a pattern (e.g. *.[ch])
or a version binding (e.g. *[release-2]), this may lead to
some confusion. The leftmost pair <br>
of brackets is always interpreted as version binding. Hence,
in the first case, the string will be misinterpreted and you
must add an explicit version binding to avoid this (e.g.
<br>
*.[ch][], default version binding added).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL VERSION BINDING OPTIONS
<br>
-before baseline <br>
Define the lower boundary of a time interval for selecting
all versions evolved in this interval. Baseline can be any
version bind directive uniquely selecting a version <br>
(e.g. version number, version alias, or date). The saving
date of the baseline version is the interval start time. The
boundary version (exactly matching the time given) <br>
is not included in the result set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bind version binding <br>
Use version binding for binding each name on the command
line, that has no explicit version binding in brackets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-last Select the last
(modification/saving time) version of each nonunique
selection. This causes the resulting version list to contain
at most one version of each history. <br>
-last may be combined with other version bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lastsaved <br>
Like -last, but busy versions are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nonuniq <br>
Force non-unique version identification. This option can be
used to swich off the default behavior of some commands
(e.g. vadm) that suggests unique version identifica&acirc;
<br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rule rulename | rulebody <br>
With a name argument, this option sets the named rule as
default rule for binding all names on the command line.
Alternatively, a rule body (a version selection rule
with&acirc; <br>
out a name) may be given as argument, which will be
evaluated for each name on the command line. This option
disables any previous -bind or -rule definition. It does not
<br>
affect names with a version binding in brackets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rulefile filename <br>
Read in the named rule file and add all contained rules to
the list of known rules. A syntactical error, detected while
parsing a rule causes the according rule to be <br>
skipped. Use vbind(1) with the -ruleerr option for
inspecting bind rule files. Multiple rule files may be
specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-since baseline <br>
Define the upper boundary of a time interval for selecting
all versions evolved in this interval. Baseline can be any
version bind directive uniquely selecting a version <br>
(e.g. version number, version alias, or date. The saving
date of the baseline version is the interval end time. The
boundary version (exactly matching the time given) is <br>
not included in the result set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-trace Trace the evaluation.
Each evaluated predicate is reported to standard output.
Additionally, the set of versions fulfilling the expressed
(the hits set) is displayed <br>
after evaluation of each predicate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-uniq Require unique version
identification. All history names on the command line, where
multiple versions meet the version bind requirements are
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE VBIND COMMAND <br>
Vbind performs a version binding and returns a bound
filename for each selected version. A bound filename is a
filename followed by a version number enclosed in brackets
(e.g. <br>
foo[1.2]).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, -help <br>
Display a short usage description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-alias version alias <br>
Use version alias for binding all names on the command line.
This disables any previous -alias, -bind, -date, -rule or
-vnum definition. It does not affect names in <br>
pseudo bound version notation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-date date <br>
Use date for binding all names occurring on the command
line. This disables any previous -alias, -bind, date, -rule
or -vnum definition. It does not affect names in <br>
pseudo bound version notation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nomsgSuppress output produced
by version bind rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ruledump <br>
The -ruledump option causes all known version bind rules to
be written to standard output. The generated output contains
all rule definitions in regular format and may be <br>
used as input rulefile for subsequent calls of vbind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ruleerr <br>
This option makes sense, when testing a new, hand written
file containing bind rules. The -ruleerr option causes
syntax errors detected in the rule file to be reported to
<br>
standard error. Make sure, that this option occurs on the
command line prior to the rulefile to be inspected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rulelist <br>
Write a list of all known rule names to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ruletest <br>
Interpret all names on the command line as rule names and
test the existence of equally named rules in the list of
known rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Print version identification of vbind command and used
libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vnum version number <br>
Use version number for binding all names on the command
line. This disables any previous -alias, -bind, -date, -rule
or -vnum definition. It does not affect names in <br>
pseudo bound version notation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
SHAPETOOLS - list of path names as search space for files
containing version bind rules. The bind rule files must be
named BindRules. Default path is /usr/local/lib/shape.</p>
