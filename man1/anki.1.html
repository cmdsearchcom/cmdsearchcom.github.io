<p>ANKI(1) General Commands Manual ANKI(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
anki - flexible, intelligent flashcard program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Anki is a program designed to help you remember facts (such
as words and phrases in a foreign language) as easily,
quickly and efficiently as possible. To do this, it tracks
how <br>
well you remember each fact, and uses that information to
optimally schedule review times. With a minimal amount of
effort, you can greatly increase the amount of material you
<br>
remember, making study more productive, and more fun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anki is based on a theory called
spaced repetition. In simple terms, it means that each time
you review some material, you should wait longer than last
time before reviewing it <br>
again. This maximizes the time spent studying difficult
material and minimizes the time spent reviewing things you
already know. The concept is simple, but the vast majority
of <br>
memory trainers and flashcard programs out there either
avoid the concept all together, or implement inflexible and
suboptimal methods that were originally designed for pen and
<br>
paper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b ~/.anki Use ~/.anki instead of ~/Anki as Anki&rsquo;s
base folder</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p ProfileName Load a specific

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l &lt;lang&gt; Start the
