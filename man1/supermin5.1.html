<p>SUPERMIN(1) Virtualization Support SUPERMIN(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
supermin - Tool for creating and building supermin
appliances</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
supermin --prepare -o OUTPUTDIR PACKAGE [PACKAGE ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">supermin --build -o OUTPUTDIR -f
chroot|ext2 INPUT [INPUT ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Supermin is a tool for building supermin appliances. These
are tiny appliances (similar to virtual machines), usually
around 100KB in size, which get fully instantiated on-the-
<br>
fly in a fraction of a second when you need to boot one of
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program used to be called
febootstrap. This manual page documents supermin 5.x which
is a complete rewrite and quite different from febootstrap
2.x. If you are looking for <br>
the febootstrap 2.x tools, then this is not the right
place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BASIC OPERATION <br>
The supermin tool can be used in two modes, preparing a tiny
supermin appliance, which is done on a build system. And
building, which takes the supermin appliance and constructs
<br>
a full, bootable appliance, which is done on the end
user&rsquo;s system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supermin does not need to be run
as root, and generally should not be run as root. It does
not affect the host system or the packages installed on the
host system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREPARE MODE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--prepare creates the tiny
supermin appliance in the given output directory. You give
it a list of packages that you want installed, and supermin
will automatically find the <br>
dependencies. The list of packages has to be installed on
the host machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">supermin --prepare bash
coreutils -o supermin.d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">creates a supermin appliance
containing the packages &quot;bash&quot; and
&quot;coreutils&quot;. Specifically, it creates some files
in directory supermin.d. This directory is the supermin <br>
appliance. (See &quot;SUPERMIN APPLIANCES&quot; below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is intended that the
--prepare step is done on a central build machine, and the
supermin appliance is distributed to end users (which is
easy because supermin appliances are <br>
so small).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUILD MODE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--build (previously a separate
program called &quot;supermin-helper&quot;) builds the full
appliance from the supermin appliance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">supermin --build --format ext2
supermin.d -o appliance.d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will create files called
appliance.d/kernel, appliance.d/root etc, which is the full
sized bootable appliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is intended that the --build
step is done on the end user&rsquo;s machine at the last
second before the appliance is needed. The packages in the
supermin appliance (those specified <br>
when the supermin appliance was prepared) must be installed
on the end user&rsquo;s machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Build and cache</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typically you want to rebuild
the appliance on the end user machine only on demand.
Supermin has some extra options to make this easy:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">supermin --build --if-newer
--lock /run/user/&lsquo;id -u&lsquo;/supermin.lock --format
ext2 supermin.d -o appliance.d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multiple programs run this
command in parallel, the instances will wait on the lock
file. The full appliance only gets rebuilt if it
doesn&rsquo;t exist or if it is older than the <br>
input files and host package database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the lock file must not
be stored inside the -o directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PACKAGES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By &quot;package&quot; we mean
the RPM, Debian, (etc.) package, eg. &quot;coreutils&quot;,
&quot;perl&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In all cases supermin can only
build a supermin appliance which is identical in distro,
version and architecture to the host. It does not do
cross-builds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--help <br>
Display brief command line usage, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--build <br>
Build the full appliance from the supermin appliance. This
used to be a separate program called
&quot;supermin-helper&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--copy-kernel <br>
(--build mode only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copy the kernel (and device
tree, if created) instead of symlinking to the kernel in
/boot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is fractionally slower, but
is necessary if you want to change the permissions or
SELinux label on the kernel or device tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dtb WILDCARD <br>
(--build mode only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If specified, search for a
device tree which is compatible with the selected kernel and
the name of which matches the given wildcard. You can use a
wildcard such as <br>
&quot;vexpress-*a9*.dtb&quot; which would match
vexpress-v2p-ca9.dtb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You may need to
quote the wildcard to prevent it from being expanded by your
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If no --dtb
option is given, no device tree will be looked for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You only need a
device tree on architectures such as ARM and PowerPC which
use them. On other architectures, don&rsquo;t use this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you use this
option and no compatible device tree can be found, supermin
will exit with an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f FORMAT <br>
--format FORMAT <br>
(--build mode only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select the output format for the
full appliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no default. When using
--build you must specify the --format option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possible formats are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chroot <br>
A directory tree in the host filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filesystem tree is written
to OUTPUTDIR (ie. the -o option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is called a
&quot;chroot&quot; because you could literally chroot(1)
into this directory afterwards, although it&rsquo;s a better
idea to use a container technology (LXC, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No kernel, initrd or dtb is
generated in this mode because it is assumed that you will
be running the appliance using the host kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ext2 <br>
An ext2 filesystem disk image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output kernel is written to
OUTPUTDIR/kernel, the device tree (if using) to
OUTPUTDIR/dtb, a small initramfs which can mount the
appliance to OUTPUTDIR/initrd, and <br>
the ext2 filesystem image to OUTPUTDIR/root. (Where
OUTPUTDIR is specified by the -o option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filesystem (OUTPUTDIR/root)
has a default size of 4 GB (see also the --size option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--host-cpu CPU <br>
(--build mode only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify the host CPU (eg.
&quot;i686&quot;, &quot;x86_64&quot;). This is used as a
substring match when searching for compatible kernels. If
not specified, it defaults to the host CPU that <br>
supermin was compiled on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--if-newer <br>
(--build mode only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output directory is checked
and it is not rebuilt unless it needs to be.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is done by consulting the
dates of the host package database (/var/lib/rpm etc), the
input supermin files, and the output directory. The
operation is only carried out <br>
if either the host package database or the input supermin
files are newer than the output directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also --lock below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--include-packagelist <br>
(--build mode only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add a /packagelist file inside
the generated chroot or ext2 filesystem, containing a sorted
list of all the packages used to build the appliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mostly useful for debugging, as
it makes it easier to find out e.g. which version of a
package was copied in the appliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-drivers <br>
List the package manager drivers compiled into supermin, and
whether the corresponding package manager is detected on the
current system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lock LOCKFILE <br>
(--build mode only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multiple parallel runs of
supermin need to build a full appliance, then you can use
the --lock option to ensure they do not stomp on each
other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The lock file is used to provide
mutual exclusion so only one instance of supermin will run
at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the lock file must not
be stored inside the output directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o OUTPUTDIR <br>
Select the output directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using --prepare, this is
the directory where the supermin appliance will be written.
When using --build, this is the directory where the full
appliance, kernel etc will <br>
be written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any previous contents of the
output directory are deleted, and a new output directory is
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output directory is created
(nearly) atomically by constructing a temporary directory
called something like OUTPUTDIR.abc543, then renaming the
old output directory (if <br>
present) and deleting it, and then renaming the temporary
directory to OUTPUTDIR. By combining this option with --lock
you can ensure that multiple parallel runs of supermin <br>
do not conflict with each other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--packager-config CONFIGFILE
<br>
(--prepare mode only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the configuration file for
the package manager. This allows you to specify alternate
software repositories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For ArchLinux, this sets the
pacman configuration file (default /etc/pacman.conf). See
pacman.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For Yum/RPM distributions, this
sets the yum configuration file (default /etc/yum.conf). See
yum.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--prepare <br>
Prepare the supermin appliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-installed <br>
(--prepare mode only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If packages are already
installed, use the contents (from the local filesystem)
instead of downloading them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this can cause
malformed appliances if local files have been changed from
what was originally in the package. This is particularly a
problem for configuration <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However this option is useful in
some controlled situations: for example when using supermin
inside a freshly installed chroot, or if you have no network
access during the <br>
build.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--size SIZE <br>
(--build mode only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select the size of the output
ext2 filesystem, where the size can be specified using
common names such as &quot;32G&quot; (32 gigabytes) etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the size is not specified, a
default size of 4 GB is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To specify size in bytes, the
number must be followed by the lowercase letter b, eg:
&quot;--size&Acirc;&nbsp;10737418240b&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
--verbose <br>
Enable verbose messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can give this option
multiple times to enable even more messages:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Debugging of overall
stages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v -v <br>
Detailed information within each stage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v -v -v <br>
Massive amounts of debugging (far too much for normal use,
but good if you are trying to diagnose a bug in
supermin).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
--version <br>
Print the package name and version number, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPERMIN APPLIANCES <br>
Supermin appliances consist of just enough information to be
able to build an appliance containing the same operating
system (Linux version, distro, release etc) as the host OS.
<br>
Since the host and appliance share many common files such as
/bin/bash and /lib/libc.so there is no reason to ship these
files in the appliance. They can simply be read from the
<br>
host on demand when the appliance is launched. Therefore to
save space we just store the names of the packages we want
from the host, and copy those in (plus dependencies) at <br>
build time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are some files which
cannot just be copied from the host in this way. These
include configuration files which the host admin might have
edited. So along with the list of <br>
host files, we also store a skeleton base image which
contains these files and the outline directory
structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Therefore the supermin appliance
normally consists of at least two control files (packages
and base.tar.gz).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">packages <br>
The list of packages to be copied from the host.
Dependencies are resolved automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file is plain text, one
package name per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">base.tar <br>
base.tar.gz <br>
This tar file (which may be compressed) contains the
skeleton filesystem. Mostly it contains directories and a
few configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All paths in the tar file should
be relative to the root directory of the appliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hostfiles <br>
Any other files that are to be copied from the host. This is
a plain text file with one pathname per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Paths can contain wildcards,
which are expanded when the appliance is created, eg:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would copy all of the *.repo
files into the appliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each pathname in the file should
start with a &quot;/&quot; character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supermin itself does not create
hostfiles (although before version&Acirc;&nbsp;5, this was
the main mechanism used to create the full appliance).
However you may drop one or more of <br>
these files into the supermin appliance directory if you
want to copy random unpackaged files into the full
appliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">excludefiles <br>
A list of filenames, directory names, or wildcards prefixed
by &quot;-&quot; which are excluded from the final
appliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is rather brutal since it
just removes things, potentially breaking packages. However
it can be used as a convenient way to minimize the size of
the final appliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supermin itself does not create
excludefiles. However you may drop one of more of these
files into the supermin appliance directory to stop packaged
files from being copied <br>
into the full appliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the names above are
just suggestions. You can use any names you want, as
supermin detects the contents of each file when it
reconstructs the appliance. You can also <br>
have multiple of each type of file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RECONSTRUCTING THE APPLIANCE
<br>
The separate mode &quot;supermin --build&quot; is used to
reconstruct an appliance from the supermin appliance
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program in fact iterates
recursively over the files and directories passed to it. A
common layout could look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">supermin.d/ <br>
supermin.d/base.tar.gz <br>
supermin.d/extra.tar.gz <br>
supermin.d/packages <br>
supermin.d/zz-hostfiles</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this way extra files can be
added to the appliance just by creating another tar file
(extra.tar.gz in the example above) and dropping it into the
directory, and additional <br>
host files can be added (zz-hostfiles in the example above).
When the appliance is constructed, the extra files will
appear in the appliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MINIMIZING THE SUPERMIN
APPLIANCE <br>
You may want to &quot;minimize&quot; the supermin appliance
in order to save time and space when it is instantiated.
Typically you might want to remove documentation, info
files, man <br>
pages and locales.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can do this by creating an
excludefiles that lists files, directories or wildcards that
you don&rsquo;t want to include. They are skipped when the
full appliance is built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-/boot/* <br>
-/lib/modules/* <br>
-/usr/share/doc/* <br>
-/usr/share/info/* <br>
-/usr/share/man/*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be careful what you remove
because files may be necessary for correct operation of the
appliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KERNEL AND KERNEL MODULES <br>
Usually the kernel and kernel modules are not included in
the supermin appliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the full appliance is
built, the kernel modules from the host are copied in, and
it is booted using the host kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING A CUSTOM KERNEL AND KERNEL
MODULES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supermin is able to choose the
best host kernel available to boot the appliance. However
you can override this by setting environment variables (see
&quot;ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES&quot; <br>
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you build a custom kernel
(eg. by compiling Linux from source), then you should do
something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mkdir /tmp/kmods <br>
make bzImage <br>
make modules <br>
make modules_install INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/tmp/kmods</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export
SUPERMIN_KERNEL=/path/to/linux.git/arch/x86/boot/bzImage
<br>
export SUPERMIN_MODULES=/tmp/kmods/lib/modules/3.xx.yy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">supermin --build -f ext2
[etc]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENFORCING AVAILABILITY OF
PACKAGES <br>
Supermin builds the appliance by copying in the packages
listed in packages. For this to work those packages must be
available. We usually enforce this by adding requirements
<br>
(eg. RPM &quot;Requires:&quot; lines) on the package that
uses the supermin appliance, so that package cannot be
installed without pulling in the dependent packages and thus
making sure <br>
the packages are installed for supermin to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
SUPERMIN_KERNEL <br>
If this environment variable is set, then automatic
selection of the kernel is bypassed and this kernel is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment variable should
point to a kernel file, eg. /boot/vmlinuz-3.0.x86_64</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPERMIN_MODULES <br>
This specifies the kernel modules directory to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment variable should
point to a module directory, eg.
/lib/modules/3.0.x86_64/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPERMIN_DTB <br>
Force the given device tree file to be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPERMIN_KERNEL_VERSION <br>
On non-x86 architectures, you may need to set this
environment variable if supermin cannot determine the kernel
version of &quot;SUPERMIN_KERNEL&quot; just by looking at
the file.</p>
