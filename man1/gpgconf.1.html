<p>GPGCONF(1) GNU Privacy Guard GPGCONF(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gpgconf - Modify .gnupg home directories</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gpgconf [options] --list-components <br>
gpgconf [options] --list-options component <br>
gpgconf [options] --change-options component</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The gpgconf is a utility to automatically and reasonable
safely query and modify configuration files in the
&acirc;.gnupg&acirc; home directory. It is designed not to
be invoked manually by <br>
the user, but automatically by graphical user interfaces
(GUI). ([Please note that currently no locking is done, so
concurrent access should be avoided. There are some
precau&acirc; <br>
tions to avoid corruption with concurrent usage, but results
may be inconsistent and some changes may get lost. The
stateless design makes it difficult to provide more
guaran&acirc; <br>
tees.])</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpgconf provides access to the
configuration of one or more components of the GnuPG system.
These components correspond more or less to the programs
that exist in the GnuPG <br>
framework, like GnuPG, GPGSM, DirMngr, etc. But this is not
a strict one-to-one relationship. Not all configuration
options are available through gpgconf. gpgconf provides a
<br>
generic and abstract method to access the most important
configuration options that can feasibly be controlled via
such a mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpgconf can be used to gather
and change the options available in each component, and can
also provide their default values. gpgconf will give
detailed type information that can <br>
be used to restrict the user&rsquo;s input without making an
attempt to commit the changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpgconf provides the backend of
a configuration editor. The configuration editor would
usually be a graphical user interface program, that allows
to display the current options, <br>
their default values, and allows the user to make changes to
the options. These changes can then be made active with
gpgconf again. Such a program that uses gpgconf in this way
<br>
will be called GUI throughout this section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
One of the following commands must be given:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-components <br>
List all components. This is the default command used if
none is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check-programs <br>
List all available backend programs and test whether they
are runnable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-options component <br>
List all options of the component component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--change-options component <br>
Change the options of the component component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check-options component <br>
Check the options for the component component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--apply-defaults <br>
Update all configuration files with values taken from the
global configuration file (usually
&acirc;/etc/gnupg/gpgconf.conf&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-dirs <br>
Lists the directories used by gpgconf. One directory is
listed per line, and each line consists of a colon-separated
list where the first field names the directory type <br>
(for example sysconfdir) and the second field contains the
percent-escaped directory. Although they are not
directories, the socket file names used by gpg-agent and
dirm&acirc; <br>
ngr are printed as well. Note that the socket file names and
the homedir lines are the default names and they may be
overridden by command line switches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-config [filename] <br>
List the global configuration file in a colon separated
format. If filename is given, check that file instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check-config [filename] <br>
Run a syntax check on the global configuration file. If
filename is given, check that file instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reload [component] <br>
Reload all or the given component. This is basically the
same as sending a SIGHUP to the component. Components which
don&rsquo;t support reloading are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--kill [component] <br>
Kill the given component. Components which support killing
are gpg-agent and scdaemon. Components which don&rsquo;t
support reloading are ignored. Note that as of now reload
<br>
and kill have the same effect for scdaemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options may be used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose <br>
Outputs additional information while running. Specifically,
this extends numerical field values by human-readable
descriptions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dry-run <br>
Do not actually change anything. This is currently only
implemented for --change-options and can be used for testing
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--runtime <br>
Only used together with --change-options. If one of the
modified options can be changed in a running daemon process,
signal the running daemon to ask it to reparse its <br>
configuration file after changing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that the changes will
take effect at run-time, as far as this is possible.
Otherwise, they will take effect at the next start of the
respective backend pro&acirc; <br>
grams.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
The command --list-components will list all components that
can be configured with gpgconf. Usually, one component will
correspond to one GnuPG-related program and contain the <br>
options of that programs configuration file that can be
modified using gpgconf. However, this is not necessarily the
case. A component might also be a group of selected options
<br>
from several programs, or contain entirely virtual options
that have a special effect rather than changing exactly one
option in one configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A component is a set of
configuration options that semantically belong together.
Furthermore, several changes to a component can be made in
an atomic way with a single opera&acirc; <br>
tion. The GUI could for example provide a menu with one
entry for each component, or a window with one tabulator
sheet per component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command argument
--list-components lists all available components, one per
line. The format of each line is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name:description:pgmname:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name This field contains a name
tag of the component. The name tag is used to specify the
component in all communication with gpgconf. The name tag is
to be used verbatim. <br>
It is thus not in any escaped format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">description <br>
The string in this field contains a human-readable
description of the component. It can be displayed to the
user of the GUI for informational purposes. It is percent-
<br>
escaped and localized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pgmname <br>
The string in this field contains the absolute name of the
program&rsquo;s file. It can be used to unambiguously invoke
that program. It is percent-escaped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: <br>
$ gpgconf --list-components <br>
gpg:GPG for OpenPGP:/usr/local/bin/gpg2: <br>
gpg-agent:GPG Agent:/usr/local/bin/gpg-agent: <br>
scdaemon:Smartcard Daemon:/usr/local/bin/scdaemon: <br>
gpgsm:GPG for S/MIME:/usr/local/bin/gpgsm: <br>
dirmngr:Directory Manager:/usr/local/bin/dirmngr:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Checking programs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command --check-programs is
similar to --list-components but works on backend programs
and not on components. It runs each program to test whether
it is installed and <br>
runnable. This also includes a syntax check of all config
file options of the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command argument
--check-programs lists all available programs, one per line.
The format of each line is:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">name:description:pgmname:avail:okay:cfgfile:line:error:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name This field contains a name
tag of the program which is identical to the name of the
component. The name tag is to be used verbatim. It is thus
not in any escaped format. <br>
This field may be empty to indicate a continuation of error
descriptions for the last name. The description and pgmname
fields are then also empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">description <br>
The string in this field contains a human-readable
description of the component. It can be displayed to the
user of the GUI for informational purposes. It is percent-
<br>
escaped and localized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pgmname <br>
The string in this field contains the absolute name of the
program&rsquo;s file. It can be used to unambiguously invoke
that program. It is percent-escaped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">avail The boolean value in this
field indicates whether the program is installed and
runnable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">okay The boolean value in this
field indicates whether the program&rsquo;s config file is
syntactically okay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cfgfile <br>
If an error occurred in the configuration file (as indicated
by a false value in the field okay), this field has the name
of the failing configuration file. It is per&acirc; <br>
cent-escaped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">line If an error occurred in the
configuration file, this field has the line number of the
failing statement in the configuration file. It is an
unsigned number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">error If an error occurred in
the configuration file, this field has the error text of the
failing statement in the configuration file. It is
percent-escaped and localized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following example the
dirmngr is not runnable and the configuration file of
scdaemon is not okay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ gpgconf --check-programs <br>
gpg:GPG for OpenPGP:/usr/local/bin/gpg2:1:1: <br>
gpg-agent:GPG Agent:/usr/local/bin/gpg-agent:1:1: <br>
scdaemon:Smartcard Daemon:/usr/local/bin/scdaemon:1:0: <br>
gpgsm:GPG for S/MIME:/usr/local/bin/gpgsm:1:1: <br>
dirmngr:Directory Manager:/usr/local/bin/dirmngr:0:0:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command configuration file
in the same manner as --check-programs, but only for the
component component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listing options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every component contains one or
more options. Options may be gathered into option groups to
allow the GUI to give visual hints to the user about which
options are related.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command argument lists all
options (and the groups they belong to) in the component
component, one per line. component must be the string in the
field name in the output of <br>
the --list-components command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is one line for each
option and each group. First come all options that are not
in any group. Then comes a line describing a group. Then
come all options that belong <br>
into each group. Then comes the next group and so on. There
does not need to be any group (and in this case the output
will stop after the last non-grouped option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of each line is:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">name:flags:level:description:type:alt-type:argname:default:argdef:value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name This field contains a name
tag for the group or option. The name tag is used to specify
the group or option in all communication with gpgconf. The
name tag is to be used <br>
verbatim. It is thus not in any escaped format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flags The flags field contains
an unsigned number. Its value is the OR-wise combination of
the following flag values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">group (1) <br>
If this flag is set, this is a line describing a group and
not an option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following flag values are
only defined for options (that is, if the group flag is not
used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">optional arg (2) <br>
If this flag is set, the argument is optional. This is never
set for type 0 (none) options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list (4) <br>
If this flag is set, the option can be given multiple
times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">runtime (8) <br>
If this flag is set, the option can be changed at
runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default (16) <br>
If this flag is set, a default value is available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default desc (32) <br>
If this flag is set, a (runtime) default is available. This
and the default flag are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no arg desc (64) <br>
If this flag is set, and the optional arg flag is set, then
the option has a special meaning if no argument is
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no change (128) <br>
If this flag is set, gpgconf ignores requests to change the
value. GUI frontends should grey out this option. Note, that
manual changes of the configuration files <br>
are still possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">level This field is defined for
options and for groups. It contains an unsigned number that
specifies the expert level under which this group or option
should be displayed. <br>
The following expert levels are defined for options (they
have analogous meaning for groups):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">basic (0) <br>
This option should always be offered to the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">advanced (1) <br>
This option may be offered to advanced users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expert (2) <br>
This option should only be offered to expert users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invisible (3) <br>
This option should normally never be displayed, not even to
expert users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">internal (4) <br>
This option is for internal use only. Ignore it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The level of a group will always
be the lowest level of all options it contains.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">description <br>
This field is defined for options and groups. The string in
this field contains a human-readable description of the
option or group. It can be displayed to the user of <br>
the GUI for informational purposes. It is percent-escaped
and localized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type This field is only defined
for options. It contains an unsigned number that specifies
the type of the option&rsquo;s argument, if any. The
following types are defined:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Basic types:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none (0) <br>
No argument allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string (1) <br>
An unformatted string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int32 (2) <br>
A signed number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uint32 (3) <br>
An unsigned number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Complex types:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pathname (32) <br>
A string that describes the pathname of a file. The file
does not necessarily need to exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ldap server (33) <br>
A string that describes an LDAP server in the format:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">hostname:port:username:password:base_dn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key fingerprint (34) <br>
A string with a 40 digit fingerprint specifying a
certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pub key (35) <br>
A string that describes a certificate by user ID, key ID or
fingerprint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sec key (36) <br>
A string that describes a certificate with a key by user ID,
key ID or fingerprint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias list (37) <br>
A string that describes an alias list, like the one used
with gpg&rsquo;s group option. The list consists of a key,
an equal sign and space separated values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More types will be added in the
future. Please see the alt-type field for information on how
to cope with unknown types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alt-type <br>
This field is identical to type, except that only the types
0 to 31 are allowed. The GUI is expected to present the user
the option in the format specified by type. But <br>
if the argument type type is not supported by the GUI, it
can still display the option in the more generic basic type
alt-type. The GUI must support all the defined basic <br>
types to be able to display all options. More basic types
may be added in future versions. If the GUI encounters a
basic type it doesn&rsquo;t support, it should report an
<br>
error and abort the operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">argname <br>
This field is only defined for options with an argument type
type that is not 0. In this case it may contain a
percent-escaped and localised string that gives a short <br>
name for the argument. The field may also be empty, though,
in which case a short name is not known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default <br>
This field is defined only for options for which the default
or default desc flag is set. If the default flag is set, its
format is that of an option argument (see: [For&acirc; <br>
mat conventions], for details). If the default value is
empty, then no default is known. Otherwise, the value
specifies the default value for this option. If the <br>
default desc flag is set, the field is either empty or
contains a description of the effect if the option is not
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">argdef This field is defined
only for options for which the optional arg flag is set. If
the no arg desc flag is not set, its format is that of an
option argument (see: [Format <br>
conventions], for details). If the default value is empty,
then no default is known. Otherwise, the value specifies the
default argument for this option. If the no arg <br>
desc flag is set, the field is either empty or contains a
description of the effect of this option if no argument is
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">value This field is defined only
for options. Its format is that of an option argument. If it
is empty, then the option is not explicitly set in the
current configuration, and <br>
the default applies (if any). Otherwise, it contains the
current value of the option. Note that this field is also
meaningful if the option itself does not take a real <br>
argument (in this case, it contains the number of times the
option appears).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changing options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command to change the
options of the component component to the specified values.
component must be the string in the field name in the output
of the --list-components com&acirc; <br>
mand. You have to provide the options that shall be changed
in the following format on standard input:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name:flags:new-value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name This is the name of the
option to change. name must be the string in the field name
in the output of the --list-options command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flags The flags field contains
an unsigned number. Its value is the OR-wise combination of
the following flag values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default (16) <br>
If this flag is set, the option is deleted and the default
value is used instead (if applicable).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new-value <br>
The new value for the option. This field is only defined if
the default flag is not set. The format is that of an option
argument. If it is empty (or the field is omit&acirc; <br>
ted), the default argument is used (only allowed if the
argument is optional for this option). Otherwise, the option
will be set to the specified value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output of the command is the
same as that of --check-options for the modified
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To set the force option, which
is of basic type none (0):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ echo &rsquo;force:0:1&rsquo; |
gpgconf --change-options dirmngr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To delete the force option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ echo &rsquo;force:16:&rsquo; |
gpgconf --change-options dirmngr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --runtime option can
influence when the changes take effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listing global options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes it is useful for
applications to look at the global options file
&acirc;gpgconf.conf&acirc;. The colon separated listing
format is record oriented and uses the first field to <br>
identify the record type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">k This describes a key record to
start the definition of a new ruleset for a user/group. The
format of a key record is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">k:user:group:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user This is the user field of
the key. It is percent escaped. See the definition of the
gpgconf.conf format for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">group This is the group field of
the key. It is percent escaped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r This describes a rule record.
All rule records up to the next key record make up a rule
set for that key. The format of a rule record is:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">r:::component:option:flags:value:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">component <br>
This is the component part of a rule. It is a plain
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">option This is the option part
of a rule. It is a plain string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flag This is the flags part of a
rule. There may be only one flag per rule but by using the
same component and option, several flags may be assigned to
an option. It <br>
is a plain string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">value This is the optional value
for the option. It is a percent escaped string with a single
quotation mark to indicate a string. The quotation mark is
only required <br>
to distinguish between no value specified and an empty
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unknown record types should be
ignored. Note that there is intentionally no feature to
change the global option file through gpgconf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/gnupg/gpgconf.conf <br>
If this file exists, it is processed as a global
configuration file. <br>
A commented example can be found in the
