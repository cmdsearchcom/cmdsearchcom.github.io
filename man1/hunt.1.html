  written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program
  does not have a manual page. Instead, it has documentation in the GNU Info

Please make sure you KNOW what you are doing before using hunt. It is
  recommended that you should test how it behaves on some test connections and
  then use it wisely. You may want to select &quot;options&quot; and then
  &quot;add conn policy entry&quot; as by default only telnet connections are
  monitored.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OVERVIEW"><a class="selflink" href="#OVERVIEW">OVERVIEW</a></h1>
Hunt is a program for intruding into a connection, watching it and resetting it.
  It has several features, which I didn't find in any product like Juggernaut or
  T-sight that inspired me in my development. I found Juggernaut not flexible
  enough for further development so I started from scratch (see FEATURES and
  DESIGN OVERVIEW). Note that hunt is operating on Ethernet and is best used for
  connections which can be watched through it. However, it is possible to do
  something even for hosts on another segments or hosts that are on switched
  ports. The hunt doesn't distinguish between local network connections and
  connections going to/from Internet. It can handle all connections it sees.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Connection hijacking is aimed primarily at the telnet or rlogin traffic but it
  can be used for another traffic too. The reset, watching, arp, ... features
  are common to all connections.

  EXPLANATION</a></h1>
Let me explain some technical issues which I use in hunt and which are essential
  for understanding how it works and what you should expect. The important terms
  are IP spoofing, ARP spoofing and ACK storm. Even if you are familiar with
  them, you can get some new information.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>IP spoofing</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You set the packet source address to the IP address of the
      host you pretend to be.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>ARP spoofing</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You set the packet source hardware address (source MAC
      address) to the address of the host you pretend to be.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Simple Active Attack against TCP connections - It is a
    well known type</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">of attack in which you send a packet with spoofed IP
      addresses and possibly also with spoofed ARP addresses (true MAC addresses
      of client and server - not fake ones as explained further). In this way,
      you can force a command to the stream but you are likely to receive the
      ACK storm (as explained further) unless the original client host of the
      connection is running Linux.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>ARP spoofing</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">I use this term also for forcing the remote host to think
      that the host I want to be has a different MAC address so the remote host
      sends replies to that MAC address and the original client host is not able
      to receive them (but hunt is watching carefully and handles all
      consequences) (Explaining how to force a host on the network to think that
      the other host has a different MAC I leave as an exercise - I encourage
      you to read the source code). Please note that I use the term ARP spoofing
      instead of the term ARP forcing or something like that. So don't be
      confused, if I say ARP spoofing, I mean using some MAC address of a host
      or just some fake MAC address. Note that ARP spoofing (with my meaning to
      force some MAC) doesn't work on Solaris2.5 because it has expiration
      timers on ARP entries so you can't easily force Solaris to drop an ARP
      entry. The entry usually expires after 20min or less (but you have a
      chance to force it and hunt supports this mode). The expiration timers on
      Solaris are set by:</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>ndd -set /dev/ip ip_ire_flush_interval 60000</b> <i>/* 1
      min */</i>
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>ndd -set /dev/arp arp_cleanup_interval 60</b> <i>/* 1 min */</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">I encourage you to ask your netadmin to set the above
      values on all Solaris machines. The Win95/NT4sp3, Linux2.0, OSF1 V4.0,
      HP-UX10.20 are not protected in this way so you can easily use the
      described technique on them (actually, they have timers, but they are not
      operating like in Solaris; in fact, only Solaris is the exception).
      Actually, hunt uses this technique such that it wants to force a fake MAC
      of the server to the client and a fake MAC of the client to the server.
      Then both the server and the client are sending packets to that faked MACs
      (and hunt can of course handle them). However, it is sufficient that only
      one host has a fake MAC of the other host. The ACK storm can't occur in
      this situation either. So you can use this technique even if one end is
      Solaris and the other isn't. You will just succeed in the other host and
      that is enough. So the only problem is when the connection is between two
      Solaris machines. However, if there is any root connection ongoing you can
      easily push the commands suggested above without ARP spoofing to the
      connection and alter the expiration timers of the ARP cache.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>ACK Storm</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The ACK storm is caused by majority of TCP stacks (!!!
      Linux2.0 is an exception !!!). Let's imagine that you send some data to an
      ongoing connection to the server (as if sent by the client - with expected
      seq. numbers, ... ). The server responds with the acknowledgment of the
      data you sent but this acknowledgment is received by the original client
      too. But from the original client point of view, the server has
      acknowledged data that doesn't exist on the client. So something strange
      occurred and the original client sends the &quot;right&quot; sequence
      number with ACK to the server. But the TCP rules say that it is required
      to generate an immediate acknowledgment when an out-of-order segment is
      received. This ACK should not be delayed. So the server sends the
      acknowledgment of non-existent data to the client again. And the client
      responses, ... Only if the source host of the connection is Linux then the
      ACK storm doesn't occur. Note that if you use ARP spoofing (forcing) then
      the ACK storm can't come because one or both ends will send packets with
      fake MACs and those packets are received by hunt rather than by the other
      host.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Connection Reset</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">With a single properly constructed packet you can reset the
      connection (RST flag in TCP header). Of course, you have to know the
      sequence number but it is not a problem for hunt which is watching all the
      time. You can reset server, client, or both. When you reset only one end
      the other end is reset when it tries to send data to the first host which
      will response with RST because of the connection reset on it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Connection sniffing/watching</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The simplest thing you can do is to silently sit in you
      chair and watch hunt output about any connection which you choose from the
      list.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Connection Synchronization</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Well, that's one of the main features of hunt. If you put
      some data to the TCP stream (through simple active attack or ARP
      spoofing), you desynchronize the stream from the server/original client
      point of view. After some work done on that connection you can just reset
      it or you can try to synchronize both original ends again. That is not an
      easy task. The user on the client is prompted to type some chars and some
      chars are sent to the client and server. The main goal of all stuff is to
      synchronize the sequence numbers on both client and server again.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Switch/Segment traffic rerouting</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">With ARP spoofing you can even force switch so that it will
      send you the traffic for hosts on another segment/switched port. This is
      because a switch will think that the MAC belongs to your port. Be careful
      if your switch has some security policy and MACs have been explicitly set
      up on a per port basis - but in fact I don't ever see such a configuration
      on &quot;ordinary&quot; network.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>ARP-relay daemon</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Don't be confused. I use this term for hunt daemon which is
      responsible for inserting packets to the network (rerouting) of all data
      it receives from ARP spoofed hosts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Switched environment</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Well, the hunt is now capable of watching and hijacking
      hosts that are on switched ports. In common you can't watch the hosts
      traffic on switched ports but if you first ARP spoof them (with ARP spoof
      daemon menu) you are able to look at the connections that are between that
      hosts. First you do arp spoof and the hosts will send you the traffic and
      from that time you can list the connections between them, then you can
      watch and hijack them. It is commonly accepted that the switches protect
      your connections again inside intruders and spoofers. Well, that is still
      true for carefully setuped switches. The switches that are plugged to the
      LAN without any port security configuration are useless in the job to
      protect your LAN.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESIGN_OVERVIEW"><a class="selflink" href="#DESIGN_OVERVIEW">DESIGN
  OVERVIEW</a></h1>
The development model is based on a packet engine (hunt.c) which runs in its own
  thread and captures packets from the network. The packet engine collects
  information of TCP connections/starting/termination, sequence numbers, and MAC
  addresses. It collects the MACs and seq. numbers from the server point of view
  and separate MACs and seq. numbers from the client point of view. So it is
  prepared for hijacking. This information (seq. num., MAC,
<div class="Pp"></div>
Modules can register functions with the packet engine which are then invoked
  when new packets are received. A module function determines if the module is
  interested in a packet or not and can place the packet in a module specific
  list of packets. A module function can also send some packet to the network if
  it is desirable to do it very fast. The module (usually in some other thread
  so it needs to be scheduled to be run) then gets packets from the list and
  analyzes them. In this way, you can easily develop modules which perform
  various activities.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Packets to be sent as a response to the network are described by structures so
  you don't have to care about some default fields or checksums. At this time,
  functions for TCP, ICMP and ARP traffic are already prepared. (UDP is missing
  because I don't use it in any module)
<div class="Pp"></div>
A separate set of daemons is used for host resolving (DNS). That is because the
  gethostbyname/gethostbyname_r function is protected by mutex (As far as I know
  - it was so two years ago - I didn't try it now) so you can't run it truly
  parallel in a multithreaded environment. Therefore, the commonly used
  workaround is to fire up some helper daemons through fork which will run
  gethostbyname.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USER_ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#USER_ENVIRONMENT">USER
  ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
Well, the user environment isn't graphical but I believe that you will like it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the title of all menus is some status information about hunt. First, there is
  an indication with which menu you are working. Second, the number of packets
  received by hunt is shown. Hunt pre-allocates some buffers for packets; the
  status of free and allocated buffers is displayed as the third value. The
  number of free buffers is low for a high loaded network or the ACK storm or if
  you have poor hardware. In my case, for example, the numbers 63/64 were
  normally indicated meaning that only one buffer was used, but after the ACK
  storm, I have something like 322/323. Note that the buffers once allocated are
  not freed. The low number of free buffers can also mean some bug in hunt but I
  think I carefully debugged all modules to this kind of bug. The last indicator
  reports which daemons (actually threads) are running. They are: R - reset
  daemon, Y - arp relayer, S - sniffer, M - MAC discoverer. If you switch on the
  verbose option you get additional information about how many packets were
  dropped - they were fragments (see the bugs) or were malformed, and how many
  packets belong to other protocols than TCP, UDP, ICMP and ARP. In the prompt
  for user input is indicator that will tell you through '*' char that hunt
  added new connection(s) to the connection list since last connection
  listening.

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>ARP/Simple hijack</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">ARP/Simple hijack offers you an interactive interface for
      the insertion of data to the selected connection. You can perform ARP
      spoofing for both connection ends, for only one end or you can not to do
      it at all. If you don't do ARP spoofing then you probably receive the ACK
      storm after typing the first char. When you do ARP spoofing, it is checked
      if it succeeds. If not, you are prompted if you want to wait until it
      succeeds (you can interrupt this waiting through CTRL-C of course). After
      inserting some data to the connection you type CTRL-] and then you can
      synchronize or reset the connection. If you choose synchronization, the
      user is prompted to type some chars and after he does so the connection
      will be in the synchronous state. You can interrupt the synchronization
      process with CTRL-C and then you can reset the connection. Note that
      CTRL-C is used widely for interrupting an ongoing process. The CTRL-]
      (like telnet) is used for finishing the interactive insertion of data to
      the connection. The ARP/Simple hijack doesn't automatically reset the
      connection after it detects the ACK storm so you have to do it yourself.
      Note also that ARP/Simple hijack works with the ARP relayer (as described
      further) so that other connections are not affected. Normally, if you ARP
      spoof two servers then the ARP/Simple hijack handles only one selected
      connection between these two hosts but other connections between these two
      hosts look like they freeze. If you start the ARP relayer, then these
      other connections are handled and rerouted through. So other connections
      from one spoofed host to the other are not affected at all. It is
      recommended to run ARP relayer if you do ARP hijacking of two servers.
      Note that if you ARP spoof (force) some client MAC to the server then only
      connections going from the server to that client are affected. Other
      connections from the server to other machines are untouched.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Simple hijack</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Simple hijack allows you to insert a command to the data
      stream of the connection. When you insert the command, hunt waits for it
      to complete up to a certain timeout and if the ACK storm doesn't occur,
      you are prompted for the next command. After that, you can synchronize or
      reset the connection. Note that you can use the interactive interface to
      simple hijack when you use ARP/simple hijack without ARP spoofing but if
      you use full interactive interface of ARP/simple hijack without ARP
      spoofing you are likely to get the ACK storm immediately after typing the
      first char. So this mode of hijacking is useful when you have to deal with
      the ACK storm because it sends your data to the connection in a single
      packet. When the ACK storm is in progress it is very hard to deliver other
      packets from hunt to the server as the network and server are
    congested.</dd>

I call them daemons but they are actually threads. All daemons can be started
  and stooped. Don't be surprised when you insert or modify some rule in a
  daemon and it does nothing. The daemon is not running - you have to start it.
  All daemons are by default stopped even though you can alter the
  configuration. Common commands in the daemons menu are:

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Reset daemon</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This daemon can be used to perform automatic resets of
      ongoing connections that hunt can see. You can describe which connections
      should be terminated by giving src/dst host/mask and src/dst ports. The
      SYN flag off means that all specified connections should be terminated
      (even ongoing). The SYN flag on means that only newly started connections
      are reset. So the connections that are in progress are not affected. Don't
      forget to start the daemon.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>ARP daemon</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Here you can do ARP spoofing of hosts. You enter src and
      dst addresses and desired srcMAC. The dst is then forced to think that src
      has srcMAC. You can use some fake MAC or better MAC of host that is
      currently down. You just want that the hosts will send you all the data
      (so you can even look at packets that are on a different segment or
      switched port that you will not normally see) The ARP module looks
      carefully for packets which will break ARP spoofing of hosts and handle
      them but you can even specify the refresh interval for ARP spoofing but it
      is not necessary to do it. Set the refresh interval only if you are
      experienced with some bad or strange behavior of spoofed hosts. Also there
      is the possibility to test the hosts for successful spoof with the ability
      to force that spoof - it is recommended to test the ARP spoof if something
      looks like it is wrong or the computer doesn't send the traffic to the
      hunt. The force option is handful if the first spoofing packets are
      discarded with switch so if you are running hunt against hosts on switched
      ports you can try to run the force mode by example for 10s and then break
      it with CTRL-C if the spoof continues to fail. The ARP relayer daemon is
      used to perform ARP relaying of ARP spoofed connections. When you insert
      some ARP spoof of hosts the ARP spoofing is performed immediately even if
      the relayer isn't running!!!. But if the ARP spoofing succeeds, the
      connections will look like they freeze. For rerouting (not IP routing !)
      these connections through your hunt you need to start the ARP relayer. The
      relayer works well with ARP/simple hijack so once you have hosts ARP
      spoofed with ARP relaying you can easily do ARP/simple hijack which will
      detect that the hosts are already ARP spoofed and takes over the
      connection immediately. With this technique you can easily become man in
      the middle from the beginning of the connection even though your host with
      hunt isn't an IP gateway. I encourage you to write other application
      specific protocol handlers for the man in the middle attack as it is
      really simple with this framework.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SECURITY_NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#SECURITY_NOTES">SECURITY
  NOTES</a></h1>
Please note the already known truth that telnet and similar programs which send
  passwords in clear text are vulnerable to the described attacks. Programs
  using one time passwords are also easily attacked and in fact they are useless
  if someone can run a program like hunt. Only full encrypted traffic isn't
  vulnerable to these attacks but note that you can become a man in the middle
  if you use ARP spoofing (forcing) without the ACK storm and you can try to do
  something. Also unconfigured switch doesn't protect you from sniffing or
  hijacking. It is necessary to carefully configure port security on the
  switches in order to protect the computers on the switched ports.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Detecting attacks isn't an easy task. For ARP spoofing there are tools which can
  detect it. The ACK storm is detectable by some sophisticated network analyzers
  (you can detect the pattern of the ACK storm or the statistics of ACKs without
  data). If you run hunt on your network you can detect the ACK storm because
  the hunt can detect the ACK storm pattern.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PERFORMANCE_NOTE"><a class="selflink" href="#PERFORMANCE_NOTE">PERFORMANCE
  NOTE</a></h1>
Make sure you are running hunt on idle machine with sufficient power (I used
  PII-233 with 128MB RAM) and without any other packet analyzer because if you
  use advanced features like arp spoofing or hijacking hunt needs to reply fast
  with it's own packets inserted into the traffic on the network.

  BUGS</a></h1>
<b>*</b> some structures are poorly locked through mutexes
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>*</b> if you watch connection then some escape sequences from that connection
  can influent your terminal. Note that your terminal is named &quot;Linux&quot;
  (&quot;xterm&quot; - if you run it from X, ...) but the escape sequences are
  for the client side terminal which may or may not be Linux so you can get some
  mess.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>*</b> sniff is not capable to search for a pattern which crosses the packet
  boundary. That means it can't search for a pattern of the user typed input as
  this input is usually transferred with 1B data long packets.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>*</b> hunt doesn't support defragmentation so the IP fragments have to be
  dropped.

Note that this software was written only for my fun in my free time and it was a
  great exercise of TCP/IP protocols. I am now familiar with seq. numbers, ACKs,
  timeouts, MACs, checksums, ... to the finest level. As I have some pretty good
  background this &quot;hunt&quot; challenge made me think that I hadn't known
  TCP/IP as great as I had thought. You are welcome to read the source code and
  to try to modify it or write your own modules.
