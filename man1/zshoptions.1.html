<p>ZSHOPTIONS(1) General Commands Manual ZSHOPTIONS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
zshoptions - zsh options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPECIFYING OPTIONS <br>
Options are primarily referred to by name. These names are
case insensitive and underscores are ignored. For example,
&lsquo;allexport&rsquo; is equivalent to
&lsquo;A__lleXP_ort&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sense of an option name may
be inverted by preceding it with &lsquo;no&rsquo;, so
&lsquo;setopt No_Beep&rsquo; is equivalent to
&lsquo;unsetopt beep&rsquo;. This inversion can only be done
once, so &lsquo;nonobeep&rsquo; <br>
is not a synonym for &lsquo;beep&rsquo;. Similarly,
&lsquo;tify&rsquo; is not a synonym for
&lsquo;nonotify&rsquo; (the inversion of
&lsquo;notify&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some options also have one or
more single letter names. There are two sets of single
letter options: one used by default, and another used to
emulate sh/ksh (used when the <br>
SH_OPTION_LETTERS option is set). The single letter options
can be used on the shell command line, or with the set,
setopt and unsetopt builtins, as normal Unix options
preceded <br>
by &lsquo;-&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sense of the single letter
options may be inverted by using &lsquo;+&rsquo; instead of
&lsquo;-&rsquo;. Some of the single letter option names
refer to an option being off, in which case the inver&acirc;
<br>
sion of that name refers to the option being on. For
example, &lsquo;+n&rsquo; is the short name of
&lsquo;exec&rsquo;, and &lsquo;-n&rsquo; is the short name
of its inversion, &lsquo;noexec&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In strings of single letter
options supplied to the shell at startup, trailing
whitespace will be ignored; for example the string &lsquo;-f
&rsquo; will be treated just as &lsquo;-f&rsquo;, but the
<br>
string &lsquo;-f i&rsquo; is an error. This is because many
systems which implement the &lsquo;#!&rsquo; mechanism for
calling scripts do not strip trailing whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION OF OPTIONS <br>
In the following list, options set by default in all
emulations are marked &lt;D&gt;; those set by default only
in csh, ksh, sh, or zsh emulations are marked &lt;C&gt;,
&lt;K&gt;, &lt;S&gt;, &lt;Z&gt; as <br>
appropriate. When listing options (by &lsquo;setopt&rsquo;,
&lsquo;unsetopt&rsquo;, &lsquo;set -o&rsquo; or &lsquo;set
+o&rsquo;), those turned on by default appear in the list
prefixed with &lsquo;no&rsquo;. Hence (unless <br>
KSH_OPTION_PRINT is set), &lsquo;setopt&rsquo; shows all
options whose settings are changed from the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changing Directories <br>
AUTO_CD (-J) <br>
If a command is issued that can&rsquo;t be executed as a
normal command, and the command is the name of a directory,
perform the cd command to that directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTO_PUSHD (-N) <br>
Make cd push the old directory onto the directory stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CDABLE_VARS (-T) <br>
If the argument to a cd command (or an implied cd with the
AUTO_CD option set) is not a directory, and does not begin
with a slash, try to expand the expression as if it <br>
were preceded by a &lsquo;~&rsquo; (see the section
&lsquo;Filename Expansion&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHASE_DOTS <br>
When changing to a directory containing a path segment
&lsquo;..&rsquo; which would otherwise be treated as
canceling the previous segment in the path (in other words,
&lsquo;foo/..&rsquo; would <br>
be removed from the path, or if &lsquo;..&rsquo; is the
first part of the path, the last part of the current working
directory would be removed), instead resolve the path to the
phys&acirc; <br>
ical directory. This option is overridden by
CHASE_LINKS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, suppose /foo/bar is
a link to the directory /alt/rod. Without this option set,
&lsquo;cd /foo/bar/..&rsquo; changes to /foo; with it set,
it changes to /alt. The same <br>
applies if the current directory is /foo/bar and &lsquo;cd
..&rsquo; is used. Note that all other symbolic links in the
path will also be resolved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHASE_LINKS (-w) <br>
Resolve symbolic links to their true values when changing
directory. This also has the effect of CHASE_DOTS, i.e. a
&lsquo;..&rsquo; path segment will be treated as referring
to the <br>
physical parent, even if the preceding path segment is a
symbolic link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSIX_CD <br>
Modifies the behaviour of cd, chdir and pushd commands to
make them more compatible with the POSIX standard. The
behaviour with the option unset is described in the
docu&acirc; <br>
mentation for the cd builtin in zshbuiltins(1). If the
option is set, the shell does not test for directories
beneath the local directory (&lsquo;.&rsquo;) until after
all directo&acirc; <br>
ries in cdpath have been tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, if the option is set, the
conditions under which the shell prints the new directory
after changing to it are modified. It is no longer
restricted to interactive <br>
shells (although printing of the directory stack with pushd
is still limited to interactive shells); and any use of a
component of CDPATH, including a &lsquo;.&rsquo; but
excluding an <br>
empty component that is otherwise treated as
&lsquo;.&rsquo;, causes the directory to be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS <br>
Don&rsquo;t push multiple copies of the same directory onto
the directory stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PUSHD_MINUS <br>
Exchanges the meanings of &lsquo;+&rsquo; and
&lsquo;-&rsquo; when used with a number to specify a
directory in the stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PUSHD_SILENT (-E) <br>
Do not print the directory stack after pushd or popd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PUSHD_TO_HOME (-D) <br>
Have pushd with no arguments act like &lsquo;pushd
$HOME&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Completion <br>
ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT &lt;D&gt; <br>
If unset, key functions that list completions try to return
to the last prompt if given a numeric argument. If set these
functions try to return to the last prompt if <br>
given no numeric argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALWAYS_TO_END <br>
If a completion is performed with the cursor within a word,
and a full completion is inserted, the cursor is moved to
the end of the word. That is, the cursor is moved to <br>
the end of the word if either a single match is inserted or
menu completion is performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTO_LIST (-9) &lt;D&gt; <br>
Automatically list choices on an ambiguous completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTO_MENU &lt;D&gt; <br>
Automatically use menu completion after the second
consecutive request for completion, for example by pressing
the tab key repeatedly. This option is overridden by <br>
MENU_COMPLETE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTO_NAME_DIRS <br>
Any parameter that is set to the absolute name of a
directory immediately becomes a name for that directory,
that will be used by the &lsquo;%~&rsquo; and related prompt
sequences, <br>
and will be available when completion is performed on a word
starting with &lsquo;~&rsquo;. (Otherwise, the parameter
must be used in the form &lsquo;~param&rsquo; first.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTO_PARAM_KEYS &lt;D&gt; <br>
If a parameter name was completed and a following character
(normally a space) automatically inserted, and the next
character typed is one of those that have to come <br>
directly after the name (like &lsquo;}&rsquo;,
&lsquo;:&rsquo;, etc.), the automatically added character is
deleted, so that the character typed comes immediately after
the parameter name. Com&acirc; <br>
pletion in a brace expansion is affected similarly: the
added character is a &lsquo;,&rsquo;, which will be removed
if &lsquo;}&rsquo; is typed next.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTO_PARAM_SLASH &lt;D&gt; <br>
If a parameter is completed whose content is the name of a
directory, then add a trailing slash instead of a space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH &lt;D&gt; <br>
When the last character resulting from a completion is a
slash and the next character typed is a word delimiter, a
slash, or a character that ends a command (such as a <br>
semicolon or an ampersand), remove the slash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BASH_AUTO_LIST <br>
On an ambiguous completion, automatically list choices when
the completion function is called twice in succession. This
takes precedence over AUTO_LIST. The setting of <br>
LIST_AMBIGUOUS is respected. If AUTO_MENU is set, the menu
behaviour will then start with the third press. Note that
this will not work with MENU_COMPLETE, since <br>
repeated completion calls immediately cycle through the list
in that case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPLETE_ALIASES <br>
Prevents aliases on the command line from being internally
substituted before completion is attempted. The effect is to
make the alias a distinct command for completion <br>
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPLETE_IN_WORD <br>
If unset, the cursor is set to the end of the word if
completion is started. Otherwise it stays there and
completion is done from both ends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLOB_COMPLETE <br>
When the current word has a glob pattern, do not insert all
the words resulting from the expansion but generate matches
as for completion and cycle through them like <br>
MENU_COMPLETE. The matches are generated as if a
&lsquo;*&rsquo; was added to the end of the word, or
inserted at the cursor when COMPLETE_IN_WORD is set. This
actually uses pattern <br>
matching, not globbing, so it works not only for files but
for any completion, such as options, user names, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that when the pattern
matcher is used, matching control (for example,
case-insensitive or anchored matching) cannot be used. This
limitation only applies when the <br>
current word contains a pattern; simply turning on the
GLOB_COMPLETE option does not have this effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HASH_LIST_ALL &lt;D&gt; <br>
Whenever a command completion or spelling correction is
attempted, make sure the entire command path is hashed
first. This makes the first completion slower but avoids
<br>
false reports of spelling errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIST_AMBIGUOUS &lt;D&gt; <br>
This option works when AUTO_LIST or BASH_AUTO_LIST is also
set. If there is an unambiguous prefix to insert on the
command line, that is done without a completion list <br>
being displayed; in other words, auto-listing behaviour only
takes place when nothing would be inserted. In the case of
BASH_AUTO_LIST, this means that the list will be <br>
delayed to the third call of the function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIST_BEEP &lt;D&gt; <br>
Beep on an ambiguous completion. More accurately, this
forces the completion widgets to return status 1 on an
ambiguous completion, which causes the shell to beep if the
<br>
option BEEP is also set; this may be modified if completion
is called from a user-defined widget.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIST_PACKED <br>
Try to make the completion list smaller (occupying less
lines) by printing the matches in columns with different
widths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIST_ROWS_FIRST <br>
Lay out the matches in completion lists sorted horizontally,
that is, the second match is to the right of the first one,
not under it as usual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIST_TYPES (-X) &lt;D&gt; <br>
When listing files that are possible completions, show the
type of each file with a trailing identifying mark.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MENU_COMPLETE (-Y) <br>
On an ambiguous completion, instead of listing possibilities
or beeping, insert the first match immediately. Then when
completion is requested again, remove the first <br>
match and insert the second match, etc. When there are no
more matches, go back to the first one again.
reverse-menu-complete may be used to loop through the list
in the <br>
other direction. This option overrides AUTO_MENU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REC_EXACT (-S) <br>
In completion, recognize exact matches even if they are
ambiguous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expansion and Globbing <br>
BAD_PATTERN (+2) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt; <br>
If a pattern for filename generation is badly formed, print
an error message. (If this option is unset, the pattern will
be left unchanged.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BARE_GLOB_QUAL &lt;Z&gt; <br>
In a glob pattern, treat a trailing set of parentheses as a
qualifier list, if it contains no &lsquo;|&rsquo;,
&lsquo;(&rsquo; or (if special) &lsquo;~&rsquo; characters.
See the section &lsquo;Filename Genera&acirc; <br>
tion&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BRACE_CCL <br>
Expand expressions in braces which would not otherwise
undergo brace expansion to a lexically ordered list of all
the characters. See the section &lsquo;Brace
Expansion&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CASE_GLOB &lt;D&gt; <br>
Make globbing (filename generation) sensitive to case. Note
that other uses of patterns are always sensitive to case. If
the option is unset, the presence of any charac&acirc; <br>
ter which is special to filename generation will cause
case-insensitive matching. For example, cvs(/) can match the
directory CVS owing to the presence of the globbing <br>
flag (unless the option BARE_GLOB_QUAL is unset).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CASE_MATCH &lt;D&gt; <br>
Make regular expressions using the zsh/regex module
(including matches with =~) sensitive to case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CSH_NULL_GLOB &lt;C&gt; <br>
If a pattern for filename generation has no matches, delete
the pattern from the argument list; do not report an error
unless all the patterns in a command have no <br>
matches. Overrides NOMATCH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EQUALS &lt;Z&gt; <br>
Perform = filename expansion. (See the section
&lsquo;Filename Expansion&rsquo;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED_GLOB <br>
Treat the &lsquo;#&rsquo;, &lsquo;~&rsquo; and
&lsquo;^&rsquo; characters as part of patterns for filename
generation, etc. (An initial unquoted &lsquo;~&rsquo; always
produces named directory expansion.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLOB (+F, ksh: +f) &lt;D&gt;
<br>
Perform filename generation (globbing). (See the section
&lsquo;Filename Generation&rsquo;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLOB_ASSIGN &lt;C&gt; <br>
If this option is set, filename generation (globbing) is
performed on the right hand side of scalar parameter
assignments of the form &lsquo;name=pattern (e.g.
&lsquo;foo=*&rsquo;). If the <br>
result has more than one word the parameter will become an
array with those words as arguments. This option is provided
for backwards compatibility only: globbing is <br>
always performed on the right hand side of array assignments
of the form &lsquo;name=(value)&rsquo; (e.g.
&lsquo;foo=(*)&rsquo;) and this form is recommended for
clarity; with this option set, it <br>
is not possible to predict whether the result will be an
array or a scalar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLOB_DOTS (-4) <br>
Do not require a leading &lsquo;.&rsquo; in a filename to be
matched explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLOB_SUBST &lt;C&gt; &lt;K&gt;
&lt;S&gt; <br>
Treat any characters resulting from parameter expansion as
being eligible for file expansion and filename generation,
and any characters resulting from command substitu&acirc;
<br>
tion as being eligible for filename generation. Braces (and
commas in between) do not become eligible for expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HIST_SUBST_PATTERN <br>
Substitutions using the :s and :&amp; history modifiers are
performed with pattern matching instead of string matching.
This occurs wherever history modifiers are valid, <br>
including glob qualifiers and parameters. See the section
Modifiers in zshexpn(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IGNORE_BRACES (-I) &lt;S&gt;
<br>
Do not perform brace expansion. For historical reasons this
also includes the effect of the IGNORE_CLOSE_BRACES
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IGNORE_CLOSE_BRACES <br>
When neither this option nor IGNORE_BRACES is set, a sole
close brace character &lsquo;}&rsquo; is syntactically
significant at any point on a command line. This has the
effect that <br>
no semicolon or newline is necessary before the brace
terminating a function or current shell construct. When
either option is set, a closing brace is syntactically
sig&acirc; <br>
nificant only in command position. Unlike IGNORE_BRACES,
this option does not disable brace expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, with both options
unset a function may be defined in the following
fashion:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">args() { echo $# }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while if either option is set,
this does not work and something equivalent to the following
is required:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">args() { echo $#; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KSH_GLOB &lt;K&gt; <br>
In pattern matching, the interpretation of parentheses is
affected by a preceding &lsquo;@&rsquo;, &lsquo;*&rsquo;,
&lsquo;+&rsquo;, &lsquo;?&rsquo; or &lsquo;!&rsquo;. See the
section &lsquo;Filename Generation&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST <br>
All unquoted arguments of the form
&lsquo;anything=expression&rsquo; appearing after the
command name have filename expansion (that is, where
expression has a leading &lsquo;~&rsquo; or &lsquo;=&rsquo;)
per&acirc; <br>
formed on expression as if it were a parameter assignment.
The argument is not otherwise treated specially; it is
passed to the command as a single argument, and not used
<br>
as an actual parameter assignment. For example, in echo
foo=~/bar:~/rod, both occurrences of ~ would be replaced.
Note that this happens anyway with typeset and similar <br>
statements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option respects the setting
of the KSH_TYPESET option. In other words, if both options
are in effect, arguments looking like assignments will not
undergo word split&acirc; <br>
ting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MARK_DIRS (-8, ksh: -X) <br>
Append a trailing &lsquo;/&rsquo; to all directory names
resulting from filename generation (globbing).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MULTIBYTE &lt;C&gt; &lt;K&gt;
&lt;Z&gt; <br>
Respect multibyte characters when found in strings. When
this option is set, strings are examined using the system
library to determine how many bytes form a character, <br>
depending on the current locale. This affects the way
characters are counted in pattern matching, parameter values
and various delimiters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option is on by default if
the shell was compiled with MULTIBYTE_SUPPORT except in sh
emulation; otherwise it is off by default and has no effect
if turned on. The <br>
mode is off in sh emulation for compatibility but for
interactive use may need to be turned on if the terminal
interprets multibyte characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the option is off a single
byte is always treated as a single character. This setting
is designed purely for examining strings known to contain
raw bytes or other val&acirc; <br>
ues that may not be characters in the current locale. It is
not necessary to unset the option merely because the
character set for the current locale does not contain <br>
multibyte characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option does not affect the
shell&rsquo;s editor, which always uses the locale to
determine multibyte characters. This is because the
character set displayed by the termi&acirc; <br>
nal emulator is independent of shell settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOMATCH (+3) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
<br>
If a pattern for filename generation has no matches, print
an error, instead of leaving it unchanged in the argument
list. This also applies to file expansion of an ini&acirc;
<br>
tial &lsquo;~&rsquo; or &lsquo;=&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NULL_GLOB (-G) <br>
If a pattern for filename generation has no matches, delete
the pattern from the argument list instead of reporting an
error. Overrides NOMATCH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NUMERIC_GLOB_SORT <br>
If numeric filenames are matched by a filename generation
pattern, sort the filenames numerically rather than
lexicographically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RC_EXPAND_PARAM (-P) <br>
Array expansions of the form &lsquo;foo${xx}bar&rsquo;,
where the parameter xx is set to (a b c), are substituted
with &lsquo;fooabar foobbar foocbar&rsquo; instead of the
default &lsquo;fooa b cbar&rsquo;. <br>
Note that an empty array will therefore cause all arguments
to be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMATCH_PCRE &lt;Z&gt; <br>
If set, regular expression matching with the =~ operator
will use Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions from the PCRE
library, if available. If not set, regular expressions <br>
will use the extended regexp syntax provided by the system
libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SH_GLOB &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; <br>
Disables the special meaning of &lsquo;(&rsquo;,
&lsquo;|&rsquo;, &lsquo;)&rsquo; and &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; for
globbing the result of parameter and command substitutions,
and in some other places where the shell accepts pat&acirc;
<br>
terns. If SH_GLOB is set but KSH_GLOB is not, the shell
allows the interpretation of subshell expressions enclosed
in parentheses in some cases where there is no space <br>
before the opening parenthesis, e.g. !(true) is interpreted
as if there were a space after the !. This option is set by
default if zsh is invoked as sh or ksh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNSET (+u, ksh: +u) &lt;K&gt;
&lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; <br>
Treat unset parameters as if they were empty when
substituting. Otherwise they are treated as an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARN_CREATE_GLOBAL <br>
Print a warning message when a global parameter is created
in a function by an assignment. This often indicates that a
parameter has not been declared local when it <br>
should have been. Parameters explicitly declared global from
within a function using typeset -g do not cause a warning.
Note that there is no warning when a local param&acirc; <br>
eter is assigned to in a nested function, which may also
indicate an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">History <br>
APPEND_HISTORY &lt;D&gt; <br>
If this is set, zsh sessions will append their history list
to the history file, rather than replace it. Thus, multiple
parallel zsh sessions will all have the new entries <br>
from their history lists added to the history file, in the
order that they exit. The file will still be periodically
re-written to trim it when the number of lines grows <br>
20% beyond the value specified by $SAVEHIST (see also the
HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BANG_HIST (+K) &lt;C&gt;
&lt;Z&gt; <br>
Perform textual history expansion, csh-style, treating the
character &lsquo;!&rsquo; specially.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED_HISTORY &lt;C&gt; <br>
Save each command&rsquo;s beginning timestamp (in seconds
since the epoch) and the duration (in seconds) to the
history file. The format of this prefixed data is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;: &lt;beginning
time&gt;:&lt;elapsed seconds&gt;;&lt;command&gt;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HIST_ALLOW_CLOBBER <br>
Add &lsquo;|&rsquo; to output redirections in the history.
This allows history references to clobber files even when
CLOBBER is unset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HIST_BEEP &lt;D&gt; <br>
Beep when an attempt is made to access a history entry which
isn&rsquo;t there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST <br>
If the internal history needs to be trimmed to add the
current command line, setting this option will cause the
oldest history event that has a duplicate to be lost before
<br>
losing a unique event from the list. You should be sure to
set the value of HISTSIZE to a larger number than SAVEHIST
in order to give you some room for the duplicated <br>
events, otherwise this option will behave just like
HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS once the history fills up with unique
events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HIST_FCNTL_LOCK <br>
When writing out the history file, by default zsh uses
ad-hoc file locking to avoid known problems with locking on
some operating systems. With this option locking is <br>
done by means of the system&rsquo;s fcntl call, where this
method is available. On recent operating systems this may
provide better performance, in particular avoiding history
<br>
corruption when files are stored on NFS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HIST_FIND_NO_DUPS <br>
When searching for history entries in the line editor, do
not display duplicates of a line previously found, even if
the duplicates are not contiguous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS <br>
If a new command line being added to the history list
duplicates an older one, the older command is removed from
the list (even if it is not the previous event).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HIST_IGNORE_DUPS (-h) <br>
Do not enter command lines into the history list if they are
duplicates of the previous event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HIST_IGNORE_SPACE (-g) <br>
Remove command lines from the history list when the first
character on the line is a space, or when one of the
expanded aliases contains a leading space. Only normal <br>
aliases (not global or suffix aliases) have this behaviour.
Note that the command lingers in the internal history until
the next command is entered before it vanishes, <br>
allowing you to briefly reuse or edit the line. If you want
to make it vanish right away without entering another
command, type a space and press return.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HIST_LEX_WORDS <br>
By default, shell history that is read in from files is
split into words on all white space. This means that
arguments with quoted whitespace are not correctly handled,
<br>
with the consequence that references to words in history
lines that have been read from a file may be inaccurate.
When this option is set, words read in from a history <br>
file are divided up in a similar fashion to normal shell
command line handling. Although this produces more
accurately delimited words, if the size of the history file
is <br>
large this can be slow. Trial and error is necessary to
decide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HIST_NO_FUNCTIONS <br>
Remove function definitions from the history list. Note that
the function lingers in the internal history until the next
command is entered before it vanishes, allowing <br>
you to briefly reuse or edit the definition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HIST_NO_STORE <br>
Remove the history (fc -l) command from the history list
when invoked. Note that the command lingers in the internal
history until the next command is entered before it <br>
vanishes, allowing you to briefly reuse or edit the
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS <br>
Remove superfluous blanks from each command line being added
to the history list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY &lt;D&gt; <br>
When the history file is re-written, we normally write out a
copy of the file named $HISTFILE.new and then rename it over
the old one. However, if this option is unset, <br>
we instead truncate the old history file and write out the
new version in-place. If one of the history-appending
options is enabled, this option only has an effect when <br>
the enlarged history file needs to be re-written to trim it
down to size. Disable this only if you have special needs,
as doing so makes it possible to lose history <br>
entries if zsh gets interrupted during the save.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When writing out a copy of the
history file, zsh preserves the old file&rsquo;s permissions
and group information, but will refuse to write out a new
file if it would change the <br>
history file&rsquo;s owner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HIST_SAVE_NO_DUPS <br>
When writing out the history file, older commands that
duplicate newer ones are omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HIST_VERIFY <br>
Whenever the user enters a line with history expansion,
don&rsquo;t execute the line directly; instead, perform
history expansion and reload the line into the editing
buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INC_APPEND_HISTORY <br>
This options works like APPEND_HISTORY except that new
history lines are added to the $HISTFILE incrementally (as
soon as they are entered), rather than waiting until the
<br>
shell exits. The file will still be periodically re-written
to trim it when the number of lines grows 20% beyond the
value specified by $SAVEHIST (see also the <br>
HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHARE_HISTORY &lt;K&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option both imports new
commands from the history file, and also causes your typed
commands to be appended to the history file (the latter is
like specifying <br>
INC_APPEND_HISTORY). The history lines are also output with
timestamps ala EXTENDED_HISTORY (which makes it easier to
find the spot where we left off reading the file <br>
after it gets re-written).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, history movement
commands visit the imported lines as well as the local
lines, but you can toggle this on and off with the
set-local-history zle binding. It <br>
is also possible to create a zle widget that will make some
commands ignore imported commands, and some include
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you find that you want more
control over when commands get imported, you may wish to
turn SHARE_HISTORY off, INC_APPEND_HISTORY on, and then
manually import commands <br>
whenever you need them using &lsquo;fc -RI&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Initialisation <br>
ALL_EXPORT (-a, ksh: -a) <br>
All parameters subsequently defined are automatically
exported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLOBAL_EXPORT (&lt;Z&gt;) <br>
If this option is set, passing the -x flag to the builtins
declare, float, integer, readonly and typeset (but not
local) will also set the -g flag; hence parameters <br>
exported to the environment will not be made local to the
enclosing function, unless they were already or the flag +g
is given explicitly. If the option is unset, <br>
exported parameters will be made local in just the same way
as any other parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is set by default
for backward compatibility; it is not recommended that its
behaviour be relied upon. Note that the builtin export
always sets both the -x <br>
and -g flags, and hence its effect extends beyond the scope
of the enclosing function; this is the most portable way to
achieve this behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLOBAL_RCS (-d) &lt;D&gt; <br>
If this option is unset, the startup files /etc/zprofile,
/etc/zshrc, /etc/zlogin and /etc/zlogout will not be run. It
can be disabled and re-enabled at any time, includ&acirc;
<br>
ing inside local startup files (.zshrc, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RCS (+f) &lt;D&gt; <br>
After /etc/zshenv is sourced on startup, source the .zshenv,
/etc/zprofile, .zprofile, /etc/zshrc, .zshrc, /etc/zlogin,
.zlogin, and .zlogout files, as described in the <br>
section &lsquo;Files&rsquo;. If this option is unset, the
/etc/zshenv file is still sourced, but any of the others
will not be; it can be set at any time to prevent the
remaining <br>
startup files after the currently executing one from being
sourced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input/Output <br>
ALIASES &lt;D&gt; <br>
Expand aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLOBBER (+C, ksh: +C) &lt;D&gt;
<br>
Allows &lsquo;&gt;&rsquo; redirection to truncate existing
files, and &lsquo;&gt;&gt;&rsquo; to create files. Otherwise
&lsquo;&gt;!&rsquo; or &lsquo;&gt;|&rsquo; must be used to
truncate a file, and &lsquo;&gt;&gt;!&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&gt;&gt;|&rsquo; to create a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CORRECT (-0) <br>
Try to correct the spelling of commands. Note that, when the
HASH_LIST_ALL option is not set or when some directories in
the path are not readable, this may falsely <br>
report spelling errors the first time some commands are
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shell variable
CORRECT_IGNORE may be set to a pattern to match words that
will never be offered as corrections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CORRECT_ALL (-O) <br>
Try to correct the spelling of all arguments in a line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DVORAK Use the Dvorak keyboard
instead of the standard qwerty keyboard as a basis for
examining spelling mistakes for the CORRECT and CORRECT_ALL
options and the spell-word edi&acirc; <br>
tor command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FLOW_CONTROL &lt;D&gt; <br>
If this option is unset, output flow control via start/stop
characters (usually assigned to ^S/^Q) is disabled in the
shell&rsquo;s editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IGNORE_EOF (-7) <br>
Do not exit on end-of-file. Require the use of exit or
logout instead. However, ten consecutive EOFs will cause the
shell to exit anyway, to avoid the shell hanging if <br>
its tty goes away.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, if this option is set and
the Zsh Line Editor is used, widgets implemented by shell
functions can be bound to EOF (normally Control-D) without
printing the normal <br>
warning message. This works only for normal widgets, not for
completion widgets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS (-k)
&lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; <br>
Allow comments even in interactive shells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HASH_CMDS &lt;D&gt; <br>
Note the location of each command the first time it is
executed. Subsequent invocations of the same command will
use the saved location, avoiding a path search. If this <br>
option is unset, no path hashing is done at all. However,
when CORRECT is set, commands whose names do not appear in
the functions or aliases hash tables are hashed in <br>
order to avoid reporting them as spelling errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HASH_DIRS &lt;D&gt; <br>
Whenever a command name is hashed, hash the directory
containing it, as well as all directories that occur earlier
in the path. Has no effect if neither HASH_CMDS nor <br>
CORRECT is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HASH_EXECUTABLES_ONLY <br>
When hashing commands because of HASH_COMMANDS, check that
the file to be hashed is actually an executable. This option
is unset by default as if the path contains a <br>
large number of commands, or consists of many remote files,
the additional tests can take a long time. Trial and error
is needed to show if this option is beneficial.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAIL_WARNING (-U) <br>
Print a warning message if a mail file has been accessed
since the shell last checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH_DIRS (-Q) <br>
Perform a path search even on command names with slashes in
them. Thus if &lsquo;/usr/local/bin&rsquo; is in the
user&rsquo;s path, and he or she types
&lsquo;X11/xinit&rsquo;, the command <br>
&lsquo;/usr/local/bin/X11/xinit&rsquo; will be executed
(assuming it exists). Commands explicitly beginning with
&lsquo;/&rsquo;, &lsquo;./&rsquo; or &lsquo;../&rsquo; are
not subject to the path search. This also <br>
applies to the &lsquo;.&rsquo; builtin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that subdirectories of the
current directory are always searched for executables
specified in this form. This takes place before any search
indicated by this option, <br>
and regardless of whether &lsquo;.&rsquo; or the current
directory appear in the command search path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH_SCRIPT &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
<br>
If this option is not set, a script passed as the first
non-option argument to the shell must contain the name of
the file to open. If this option is set, and the script <br>
does not specify a directory path, the script is looked for
first in the current directory, then in the command path.
See the section INVOCATION in zsh(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRINT_EIGHT_BIT <br>
Print eight bit characters literally in completion lists,
etc. This option is not necessary if your system correctly
returns the printability of eight bit characters (see <br>
ctype(3)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRINT_EXIT_VALUE (-1) <br>
Print the exit value of programs with non-zero exit
status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RC_QUOTES <br>
Allow the character sequence &lsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo; to
signify a single quote within singly quoted strings. Note
this does not apply in quoted strings using the format
$&rsquo;...&rsquo;, where a <br>
backslashed single quote can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RM_STAR_SILENT (-H) &lt;K&gt;
&lt;S&gt; <br>
Do not query the user before executing &lsquo;rm *&rsquo; or
&lsquo;rm path/*&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RM_STAR_WAIT <br>
If querying the user before executing &lsquo;rm *&rsquo; or
&lsquo;rm path/*&rsquo;, first wait ten seconds and ignore
anything typed in that time. This avoids the problem of
reflexively answer&acirc; <br>
ing &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to the query when one didn&rsquo;t
really mean it. The wait and query can always be avoided by
expanding the &lsquo;*&rsquo; in ZLE (with tab).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHORT_LOOPS &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
<br>
Allow the short forms of for, repeat, select, if, and
function constructs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUN_KEYBOARD_HACK (-L) <br>
If a line ends with a backquote, and there are an odd number
of backquotes on the line, ignore the trailing backquote.
This is useful on some keyboards where the return <br>
key is too small, and the backquote key lies annoyingly
close to it. As an alternative the variable KEYBOARD_HACK
lets you choose the character to be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Job Control <br>
AUTO_CONTINUE <br>
With this option set, stopped jobs that are removed from the
job table with the disown builtin command are automatically
sent a CONT signal to make them running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTO_RESUME (-W) <br>
Treat single word simple commands without redirection as
candidates for resumption of an existing job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BG_NICE (-6) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
<br>
Run all background jobs at a lower priority. This option is
set by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHECK_JOBS &lt;Z&gt; <br>
Report the status of background and suspended jobs before
exiting a shell with job control; a second attempt to exit
the shell will succeed. NO_CHECK_JOBS is best used <br>
only in combination with NO_HUP, else such jobs will be
killed automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The check is omitted if the
commands run from the previous command line included a
&lsquo;jobs&rsquo; command, since it is assumed the user is
aware that there are background or sus&acirc; <br>
pended jobs. A &lsquo;jobs&rsquo; command run from one of
the hook functions defined in the section SPECIAL FUNCTIONS
in zshmisc(1) is not counted for this purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HUP &lt;Z&gt; <br>
Send the HUP signal to running jobs when the shell
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LONG_LIST_JOBS (-R) <br>
List jobs in the long format by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MONITOR (-m, ksh: -m) <br>
Allow job control. Set by default in interactive shells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTIFY (-5, ksh: -b) &lt;Z&gt;
<br>
Report the status of background jobs immediately, rather
than waiting until just before printing a prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSIX_JOBS &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
<br>
This option makes job control more compliant with the POSIX
standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the option is not set, the
MONITOR option is unset on entry to subshells, so that job
control is no longer active. When the option is set, the
MONITOR option and job <br>
control remain active in the subshell, but note that the
subshell has no access to jobs in the parent shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the option is not set, jobs
put in the background or foreground with bg or fg are
displayed with the same information that would be reported
by jobs. When the option <br>
is set, only the text is printed. The output from jobs
itself is not affected by the option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the option is not set, job
information from the parent shell is saved for output within
a subshell (for example, within a pipeline). When the option
is set, the out&acirc; <br>
put of jobs is empty until a job is started within the
subshell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In previous versions of the
shell, it was necessary to enable POSIX_JOBS in order for
the builtin command wait to return the status of background
jobs that had already <br>
exited. This is no longer the case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prompting <br>
PROMPT_BANG &lt;K&gt; <br>
If set, &lsquo;!&rsquo; is treated specially in prompt
expansion. See EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in
zshmisc(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROMPT_CR (+V) &lt;D&gt; <br>
Print a carriage return just before printing a prompt in the
line editor. This is on by default as multi-line editing is
only possible if the editor knows where the start <br>
of the line appears.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROMPT_SP &lt;D&gt; <br>
Attempt to preserve a partial line (i.e. a line that did not
end with a newline) that would otherwise be covered up by
the command prompt due to the PROMPT_CR option. <br>
This works by outputting some cursor-control characters,
including a series of spaces, that should make the terminal
wrap to the next line when a partial line is present <br>
(note that this is only successful if your terminal has
automatic margins, which is typical).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a partial line is
preserved, by default you will see an inverse+bold character
at the end of the partial line: a &quot;%&quot; for a normal
user or a &quot;#&quot; for root. If set, <br>
the shell parameter PROMPT_EOL_MARK can be used to customize
how the end of partial lines are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: if the PROMPT_CR option is
not set, enabling this option will have no effect. This
option is on by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROMPT_PERCENT &lt;C&gt;
&lt;Z&gt; <br>
If set, &lsquo;%&rsquo; is treated specially in prompt
expansion. See EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in
zshmisc(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROMPT_SUBST &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
<br>
If set, parameter expansion, command substitution and
arithmetic expansion are performed in prompts. Substitutions
within prompts do not affect the command status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRANSIENT_RPROMPT <br>
Remove any right prompt from display when accepting a
command line. This may be useful with terminals with other
cut/paste methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scripts and Functions <br>
C_BASES <br>
Output hexadecimal numbers in the standard C format, for
example &lsquo;0xFF&rsquo; instead of the usual
&lsquo;16#FF&rsquo;. If the option OCTAL_ZEROES is also set
(it is not by default), octal <br>
numbers will be treated similarly and hence appear as
&lsquo;077&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;8#77&rsquo;. This option
has no effect on the choice of the output base, nor on the
output of bases <br>
other than hexadecimal and octal. Note that these formats
will be understood on input irrespective of the setting of
C_BASES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C_PRECEDENCES <br>
This alters the precedence of arithmetic operators to be
more like C and other programming languages; the section
ARITHMETIC EVALUATION in zshmisc(1) has an explicit
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD <br>
Run the DEBUG trap before each command; otherwise it is run
after each command. Setting this option mimics the behaviour
of ksh 93; with the option unset the behaviour is <br>
that of ksh 88.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERR_EXIT (-e, ksh: -e) <br>
If a command has a non-zero exit status, execute the ZERR
trap, if set, and exit. This is disabled while running
initialization scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The behaviour is also disabled
inside DEBUG traps. In this case the option is handled
specially: it is unset on entry to the trap. If the option
DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD is set, <br>
as it is by default, and the option ERR_EXIT is found to
have been set on exit, then the command for which the DEBUG
trap is being executed is skipped. The option is <br>
restored after the trap exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERR_RETURN <br>
If a command has a non-zero exit status, return immediately
from the enclosing function. The logic is identical to that
for ERR_EXIT, except that an implicit return <br>
statement is executed instead of an exit. This will trigger
an exit at the outermost level of a non-interactive
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EVAL_LINENO &lt;Z&gt; <br>
If set, line numbers of expressions evaluated using the
builtin eval are tracked separately of the enclosing
environment. This applies both to the parameter LINENO and
<br>
the line number output by the prompt escape %i. If the
option is set, the prompt escape %N will output the string
&lsquo;(eval)&rsquo; instead of the script or function name
as an <br>
indication. (The two prompt escapes are typically used in
the parameter PS4 to be output when the option XTRACE is
set.) If EVAL_LINENO is unset, the line number of the <br>
surrounding script or function is retained during the
evaluation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXEC (+n, ksh: +n) &lt;D&gt;
<br>
Do execute commands. Without this option, commands are read
and checked for syntax errors, but not executed. This option
cannot be turned off in an interactive shell, <br>
except when &lsquo;-n&rsquo; is supplied to the shell at
startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUNCTION_ARGZERO &lt;C&gt;
&lt;Z&gt; <br>
When executing a shell function or sourcing a script, set $0
temporarily to the name of the function/script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOCAL_OPTIONS &lt;K&gt; <br>
If this option is set at the point of return from a shell
function, most options (including this one) which were in
force upon entry to the function are restored; options <br>
that are not restored are PRIVILEGED and RESTRICTED.
Otherwise, only this option and the XTRACE and
PRINT_EXIT_VALUE options are restored. Hence if this is
explicitly <br>
unset by a shell function the other options in force at the
point of return will remain so. A shell function can also
guarantee itself a known shell configuration with a <br>
formulation like &lsquo;emulate -L zsh&rsquo;; the -L
activates LOCAL_OPTIONS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOCAL_TRAPS &lt;K&gt; <br>
If this option is set when a signal trap is set inside a
function, then the previous status of the trap for that
signal will be restored when the function exits. Note <br>
that this option must be set prior to altering the trap
behaviour in a function; unlike LOCAL_OPTIONS, the value on
exit from the function is irrelevant. However, it does <br>
not need to be set before any global trap for that to be
correctly restored by a function. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unsetopt localtraps <br>
trap - INT <br>
fn() { setopt localtraps; trap &rsquo;&rsquo; INT; sleep 3;
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will restore normal handling of
SIGINT after the function exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MULTI_FUNC_DEF &lt;Z&gt; <br>
Allow definitions of multiple functions at once in the form
&lsquo;fn1 fn2...()&rsquo;; if the option is not set, this
causes a parse error. Definition of multiple functions with
the <br>
function keyword is always allowed. Multiple function
definitions are not often used and can cause obscure
errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MULTIOS &lt;Z&gt; <br>
Perform implicit tees or cats when multiple redirections are
attempted (see the section &lsquo;Redirection&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OCTAL_ZEROES &lt;S&gt; <br>
Interpret any integer constant beginning with a 0 as octal,
per IEEE Std 1003.2-1992 (ISO 9945-2:1993). This is not
enabled by default as it causes problems with parsing <br>
of, for example, date and time strings with leading
zeroes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sequences of digits indicating a
numeric base such as the &lsquo;08&rsquo; component in
&lsquo;08#77&rsquo; are always interpreted as decimal,
regardless of leading zeroes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOURCE_TRACE <br>
If set, zsh will print an informational message announcing
the name of each file it loads. The format of the output is
similar to that for the XTRACE option, with the <br>
message &lt;sourcetrace&gt;. A file may be loaded by the
shell itself when it starts up and shuts down
(Startup/Shutdown Files) or by the use of the
&lsquo;source&rsquo; and &lsquo;dot&rsquo; builtin <br>
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TYPESET_SILENT <br>
If this is unset, executing any of the &lsquo;typeset&rsquo;
family of commands with no options and a list of parameters
that have no values to be assigned but already exist will
dis&acirc; <br>
play the value of the parameter. If the option is set, they
will only be shown when parameters are selected with the
&lsquo;-m&rsquo; option. The option &lsquo;-p&rsquo; is
available whether or <br>
not the option is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERBOSE (-v, ksh: -v) <br>
Print shell input lines as they are read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XTRACE (-x, ksh: -x) <br>
Print commands and their arguments as they are executed. The
output is proceded by the value of $PS4, formatted as
described in the section EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES <br>
in zshmisc(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shell Emulation <br>
BASH_REMATCH <br>
When set, matches performed with the =~ operator will set
the BASH_REMATCH array variable, instead of the default
MATCH and match variables. The first element of the <br>
BASH_REMATCH array will contain the entire matched text and
subsequent elements will contain extracted substrings. This
option makes more sense when KSH_ARRAYS is also <br>
set, so that the entire matched portion is stored at index 0
and the first substring is at index 1. Without this option,
the MATCH variable contains the entire matched <br>
text and the match array variable contains substrings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BSD_ECHO &lt;S&gt; <br>
Make the echo builtin compatible with the BSD echo(1)
command. This disables backslashed escape sequences in echo
strings unless the -e option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTINUE_ON_ERROR <br>
If a fatal error is encountered (see the section ERRORS in
zshmisc(1)), and the code is running in a script, the shell
will resume execution at the next statement in the <br>
script at the top level, in other words outside all
functions or shell constructs such as loops and conditions.
This mimics the behaviour of interactive shells, where the
<br>
shell returns to the line editor to read a new command; it
was the normal behaviour in versions of zsh before
5.0.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY &lt;C&gt;
<br>
A history reference without an event specifier will always
refer to the previous command. Without this option, such a
history reference refers to the same event as the <br>
previous history reference, defaulting to the previous
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CSH_JUNKIE_LOOPS &lt;C&gt; <br>
Allow loop bodies to take the form &lsquo;list; end&rsquo;
instead of &lsquo;do list; done&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CSH_JUNKIE_QUOTES &lt;C&gt; <br>
Changes the rules for single- and double-quoted text to
match that of csh. These require that embedded newlines be
preceded by a backslash; unescaped newlines will cause <br>
an error message. In double-quoted strings, it is made
impossible to escape &lsquo;$&rsquo;, &lsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;
or &lsquo;&quot;&rsquo; (and &lsquo;&acute; itself no longer
needs escaping). Command substitutions are only <br>
expanded once, and cannot be nested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CSH_NULLCMD &lt;C&gt; <br>
Do not use the values of NULLCMD and READNULLCMD when
running redirections with no command. This make such
redirections fail (see the section
&lsquo;Redirection&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KSH_ARRAYS &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
<br>
Emulate ksh array handling as closely as possible. If this
option is set, array elements are numbered from zero, an
array parameter without subscript refers to the first <br>
element instead of the whole array, and braces are required
to delimit a subscript (&lsquo;${path[2]}&rsquo; rather than
just &lsquo;$path[2]&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KSH_AUTOLOAD &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
<br>
Emulate ksh function autoloading. This means that when a
function is autoloaded, the corresponding file is merely
executed, and must define the function itself. (By <br>
default, the function is defined to the contents of the
file. However, the most common ksh-style case - of the file
containing only a simple definition of the function - <br>
is always handled in the ksh-compatible manner.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KSH_OPTION_PRINT &lt;K&gt; <br>
Alters the way options settings are printed: instead of
separate lists of set and unset options, all options are
shown, marked &lsquo;on&rsquo; if they are in the
non-default state, <br>
&lsquo;off&rsquo; otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KSH_TYPESET &lt;K&gt; <br>
Alters the way arguments to the typeset family of commands,
including declare, export, float, integer, local and
readonly, are processed. Without this option, zsh will <br>
perform normal word splitting after command and parameter
expansion in arguments of an assignment; with it, word
splitting does not take place in those cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT <br>
Treat use of a subscript of value zero in array or string
expressions as a reference to the first element, i.e. the
element that usually has the subscript 1. Ignored if <br>
KSH_ARRAYS is also set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither this option nor
KSH_ARRAYS is set, accesses to an element of an array or
string with subscript zero return an empty element or
string, while attempts to set <br>
element zero of an array or string are treated as an error.
However, attempts to set an otherwise valid subscript range
that includes zero will succeed. For example, if <br>
KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT is not set,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">array[0]=(element)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is an error, while</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">array[0,1]=(element)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is not and will replace the
first element of the array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is for compatibility
with older versions of the shell and is not recommended in
new code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSIX_ALIASES &lt;K&gt;
&lt;S&gt; <br>
When this option is set, reserved words are not candidates
for alias expansion: it is still possible to declare any of
them as an alias, but the alias will never be <br>
expanded. Reserved words are described in the section
RESERVED WORDS in zshmisc(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alias expansion takes place
while text is being read; hence when this option is set it
does not take effect until the end of any function or other
piece of shell code <br>
parsed as one unit. Note this may cause differences from
other shells even when the option is in effect. For example,
when running a command with &lsquo;zsh -c&rsquo;, or even
&lsquo;zsh <br>
-o posixaliases -c&rsquo;, the entire command argument is
parsed as one unit, so aliases defined within the argument
are not available even in later lines. If in doubt, avoid
<br>
use of aliases in non-interactive code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSIX_BUILTINS &lt;K&gt;
&lt;S&gt; <br>
When this option is set the command builtin can be used to
execute shell builtin commands. Parameter assignments
specified before shell functions and special builtins are
<br>
kept after the command completes unless the special builtin
is prefixed with the command builtin. Special builtins are
., :, break, continue, declare, eval, exit, export, <br>
integer, local, readonly, return, set, shift, source, times,
trap and unset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, various error
conditions associated with the above builtins or exec cause
a non-interactive shell to exit and an interactive shell to
return to its top-level <br>
processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSIX_IDENTIFIERS &lt;K&gt;
&lt;S&gt; <br>
When this option is set, only the ASCII characters a to z, A
to Z, 0 to 9 and _ may be used in identifiers (names of
shell parameters and modules).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the option is unset and
multibyte character support is enabled (i.e. it is compiled
in and the option MULTIBYTE is set), then additionally any
alphanumeric characters <br>
in the local character set may be used in identifiers. Note
that scripts and functions written with this feature are not
portable, and also that both options must be set <br>
before the script or function is parsed; setting them during
execution is not sufficient as the syntax variable=value has
already been parsed as a command rather than an <br>
assignment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multibyte character support
is not compiled into the shell this option is ignored; all
octets with the top bit set may be used in identifiers. This
is non-standard but <br>
is the traditional zsh behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSIX_STRINGS &lt;K&gt;
&lt;S&gt; <br>
This option affects processing of quoted strings. Currently
it only affects the behaviour of null characters, i.e.
character 0 in the portable character set corresponding <br>
to US ASCII.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this option is not set,
null characters embedded within strings of the form
$&rsquo;...&rsquo; are treated as ordinary characters. The
entire string is maintained within the <br>
shell and output to files where necessary, although owing to
restrictions of the library interface the string is
truncated at the null character in file names, environment
<br>
variables, or in arguments to external programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this option is set, the
$&rsquo;...&rsquo; expression is truncated at the null
character. Note that remaining parts of the same string
beyond the termination of the quotes are <br>
not trunctated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the command line
argument a$&rsquo;b c&rsquo;d is treated with the option off
as the characters a, b, null, c, d, and with the option on
as the characters a, b, d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSIX_TRAPS &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
<br>
When the is option is set, the usual zsh behaviour of
executing traps for EXIT on exit from shell functions is
suppressed. In that case, manipulating EXIT traps always
<br>
alters the global trap for exiting the shell; the
LOCAL_TRAPS option is ignored for the EXIT trap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SH_FILE_EXPANSION &lt;K&gt;
&lt;S&gt; <br>
Perform filename expansion (e.g., ~ expansion) before
parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic
expansion and brace expansion. If this option is unset, it
is <br>
performed after brace expansion, so things like
&lsquo;~$USERNAME&rsquo; and &lsquo;~{pfalstad,rc}&rsquo;
will work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SH_NULLCMD &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
<br>
Do not use the values of NULLCMD and READNULLCMD when doing
redirections, use &lsquo;:&rsquo; instead (see the section
&lsquo;Redirection&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SH_OPTION_LETTERS &lt;K&gt;
&lt;S&gt; <br>
If this option is set the shell tries to interpret single
letter options (which are used with set and setopt) like ksh
does. This also affects the value of the - special <br>
parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SH_WORD_SPLIT (-y) &lt;K&gt;
&lt;S&gt; <br>
Causes field splitting to be performed on unquoted parameter
expansions. Note that this option has nothing to do with
word splitting. (See the section &lsquo;Parameter
Expan&acirc; <br>
sion&rsquo;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRAPS_ASYNC <br>
While waiting for a program to exit, handle signals and run
traps immediately. Otherwise the trap is run after a child
process has exited. Note this does not affect the <br>
point at which traps are run for any case other than when
the shell is waiting for a child process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shell State <br>
INTERACTIVE (-i, ksh: -i) <br>
This is an interactive shell. This option is set upon
initialisation if the standard input is a tty and commands
are being read from standard input. (See the discussion <br>
of SHIN_STDIN.) This heuristic may be overridden by
specifying a state for this option on the command line. The
value of this option can only be changed via flags
sup&acirc; <br>
plied at invocation of the shell. It cannot be changed once
zsh is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGIN (-l, ksh: -l) <br>
This is a login shell. If this option is not explicitly set,
the shell becomes a login shell if the first character of
the argv[0] passed to the shell is a &lsquo;-&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRIVILEGED (-p, ksh: -p) <br>
Turn on privileged mode. This is enabled automatically on
startup if the effective user (group) ID is not equal to the
real user (group) ID. Turning this option off <br>
causes the effective user and group IDs to be set to the
real user and group IDs. This option disables sourcing user
startup files. If zsh is invoked as &lsquo;sh&rsquo; or
&lsquo;ksh&rsquo; <br>
with this option set, /etc/suid_profile is sourced (after
/etc/profile on interactive shells). Sourcing ~/.profile is
disabled and the contents of the ENV variable is <br>
ignored. This option cannot be changed using the -m option
of setopt and unsetopt, and changing it inside a function
always changes it globally regardless of the <br>
LOCAL_OPTIONS option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTED (-r) <br>
Enables restricted mode. This option cannot be changed using
unsetopt, and setting it inside a function always changes it
globally regardless of the LOCAL_OPTIONS option. <br>
See the section &lsquo;Restricted Shell&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHIN_STDIN (-s, ksh: -s) <br>
Commands are being read from the standard input. Commands
are read from standard input if no command is specified with
-c and no file of commands is specified. If <br>
SHIN_STDIN is set explicitly on the command line, any
argument that would otherwise have been taken as a file to
run will instead be treated as a normal positional
parame&acirc; <br>
ter. Note that setting or unsetting this option on the
command line does not necessarily affect the state the
option will have while the shell is running - that is purely
<br>
an indicator of whether on not commands are actually being
read from standard input. The value of this option can only
be changed via flags supplied at invocation of the <br>
shell. It cannot be changed once zsh is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SINGLE_COMMAND (-t, ksh: -t)
<br>
If the shell is reading from standard input, it exits after
a single command has been executed. This also makes the
shell non-interactive, unless the INTERACTIVE option <br>
is explicitly set on the command line. The value of this
option can only be changed via flags supplied at invocation
of the shell. It cannot be changed once zsh is run&acirc;
<br>
ning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zle <br>
BEEP (+B) &lt;D&gt; <br>
Beep on error in ZLE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMBINING_CHARS <br>
Assume that the terminal displays combining characters
correctly. Specifically, if a base alphanumeric character is
followed by one or more zero-width punctuation charac&acirc;
<br>
ters, assume that the zero-width characters will be
displayed as modifications to the base character within the
same width. Not all terminals handle this. If this option
<br>
is not set, zero-width characters are displayed separately
with special mark-up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is set, the
pattern test [[:WORD:]] matches a zero-width punctuation
character on the assumption that it will be used as part of
a word in combination with <br>
a word character. Otherwise the base shell does not handle
combining characters specially.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EMACS If ZLE is loaded, turning
on this option has the equivalent effect of &lsquo;bindkey
-e&rsquo;. In addition, the VI option is unset. Turning it
off has no effect. The option set&acirc; <br>
ting is not guaranteed to reflect the current keymap. This
option is provided for compatibility; bindkey is the
recommended interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVERSTRIKE <br>
Start up the line editor in overstrike mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SINGLE_LINE_ZLE (-M) &lt;K&gt;
<br>
Use single-line command line editing instead of
multi-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that although this is on by
default in ksh emulation it only provides superficial
compatibility with the ksh line editor and reduces the
effectiveness of the zsh line <br>
editor. As it has no effect on shell syntax, many users may
wish to disable this option when using ksh emulation
interactively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VI If ZLE is loaded, turning on
this option has the equivalent effect of &lsquo;bindkey
-v&rsquo;. In addition, the EMACS option is unset. Turning
it off has no effect. The option <br>
setting is not guaranteed to reflect the current keymap.
This option is provided for compatibility; bindkey is the
recommended interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZLE (-Z) <br>
Use the zsh line editor. Set by default in interactive
shells connected to a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTION ALIASES <br>
Some options have alternative names. These aliases are never
used for output, but can be used just like normal option
names when specifying options to the shell.</p>
