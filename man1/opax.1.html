<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
opax will read, write, and list the members of an archive
file, and will copy directory hierarchies. opax operation is
independent of the specific archive format, and supports a
<br>
wide variety of different archive formats. A list of
supported archive formats can be found under the description
of the -x option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The presence of the -r and the
-w options specifies which of the following functional modes
opax will operate under: list, read, write, and copy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;none&gt; List. opax will
write to standard output a table of contents of the members
of the archive file read from standard input, whose
pathnames match the specified patterns. <br>
The table of contents contains one filename per line and is
written using single line buffering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Read. opax extracts the
members of the archive file read from the standard input,
with pathnames matching the specified patterns. The archive
format and blocking is auto&acirc; <br>
matically determined on input. When an extracted file is a
directory, the entire file hierarchy rooted at that
directory is extracted. All extracted files are created <br>
relative to the current file hierarchy. The setting of
ownership, access and modification times, and file mode of
the extracted files are discussed in more detail under <br>
the -p option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Write. opax writes an archive
containing the file operands to standard output using the
specified archive format. When no file operands are
specified, a list of files to <br>
copy with one per line is read from standard input. When a
file operand is also a directory, the entire file hierarchy
rooted at that directory will be included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r -w Copy. opax copies the file
operands to the destination directory. When no file operands
are specified, a list of files to copy with one per line is
read from the standard <br>
input. When a file operand is also a directory the entire
file hierarchy rooted at that directory will be included.
The effect of the copy is as if the copied files were <br>
written to an archive file and then subsequently extracted,
except that there may be hard links between the original and
the copied files (see the -l option below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: The destination
directory must not be one of the file operands or a member
of a file hierarchy rooted at one of the file operands. The
result of a copy under <br>
these conditions is unpredictable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While processing a damaged
archive during a read or list operation, opax will attempt
to recover from media defects and will search through the
archive to locate and process the <br>
largest number of archive members possible (see the -E
option for more details on error handling).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directory operand specifies
a destination directory pathname. If the directory operand
does not exist, or it is not writable by the user, or it is
not of type directory, opax <br>
will exit with a non-zero exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pattern operand is used to
select one or more pathnames of archive members. Archive
members are selected using the pattern matching notation
described by fnmatch(3). When the <br>
pattern operand is not supplied, all members of the archive
will be selected. When a pattern matches a directory, the
entire file hierarchy rooted at that directory will be <br>
selected. When a pattern operand does not select at least
one archive member, opax will write these pattern operands
in a diagnostic message to standard error and then exit with
a <br>
non-zero exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file operand specifies the
pathname of a file to be copied or archived. When a file
operand does not select at least one archive member, opax
will write these file operand <br>
pathnames in a diagnostic message to standard error and then
exit with a non-zero exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Read an archive file from
standard input and extract the specified files. If any
intermediate directories are needed in order to extract an
archive member, these directo&acirc; <br>
ries will be created as if mkdir(2) was called with the
bitwise inclusive OR of S_IRWXU, S_IRWXG, and S_IRWXO as the
mode argument. When the selected archive format sup&acirc;
<br>
ports the specification of linked files and these files
cannot be linked while the archive is being extracted, opax
will write a diagnostic message to standard error and <br>
exit with a non-zero exit status at the completion of
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Write files to the standard
output in the specified archive format. When no file
operands are specified, standard input is read for a list of
pathnames with one per line <br>
without any leading or trailing
&acirc;&uml;blanks&acirc;&copy;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Append files to the end of an
archive that was previously written. If an archive format is
not specified with a -x option, the format currently being
used in the archive <br>
will be selected. Any attempt to append to an archive in a
format different from the format already used in the archive
will cause opax to exit immediately with a non-zero <br>
exit status. The blocking size used in the archive volume
where writing starts will continue to be used for the
remainder of that archive volume.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: Many storage devices
are not able to support the operations necessary to perform
an append operation. Any attempt to append to an archive
stored on such a device <br>
may damage the archive or have other unpredictable results.
Tape drives in particular are more likely to not support an
append operation. An archive stored in a regular <br>
file system file or on a disk device will usually support an
append operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-0 Use the NUL (&acirc; &acirc;)
character as a pathname terminator, instead of newline
(&acirc;0). This applies only to the pathnames read from
standard input in the write and copy modes, <br>
and to the pathnames written to standard output in list
mode. This option is expected to be used in concert with the
-print0 function in find(1) or the -0 flag in <br>
xargs(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b blocksize <br>
When writing an archive, block the output at a positive
decimal integer number of bytes per write to the archive
file. The blocksize must be a multiple of 512 bytes with a
<br>
maximum of 64512 bytes. Archives larger than 32256 bytes
violate the POSIX standard and will not be portable to all
systems. A blocksize can end with &acirc;k&acirc; or
&acirc;b&acirc; to spec&acirc; <br>
ify multiplication by 1024 (1K) or 512, respectively. A pair
of blocksizes can be separated by &acirc;x&acirc; to
indicate a product. A specific archive device may impose
additional <br>
restrictions on the size of blocking it will support. When
blocking is not specified, the default blocksize is
dependent on the specific archive format being used (see the
<br>
-x option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Match all file or archive
members except those specified by the pattern and file
operands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Cause files of type directory
being copied or archived, or archive members of type
directory being extracted, to match only the directory file
or archive member and not the <br>
file hierarchy rooted at the directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f archive <br>
Specify archive as the pathname of the input or output
archive, overriding the default standard input (for list and
read) or standard output (for write). A single archive <br>
may span multiple files and different archive devices. When
required, opax will prompt for the pathname of the file or
device of the next volume in the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Interactively rename files or
archive members. For each archive member matching a pattern
operand or each file matching a file operand, opax will
prompt to /dev/tty giving <br>
the name of the file, its file mode, and its modification
time. opax will then read a line from /dev/tty. If this line
is blank, the file or archive member is skipped. <br>
If this line consists of a single period, the file or
archive member is processed with no modification to its
name. Otherwise, its name is replaced with the contents of
<br>
the line. opax will immediately exit with a non-zero exit
status if EOF is encountered when reading a response or if
/dev/tty cannot be opened for reading and writing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Do not overwrite existing
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l (The lowercase letter
&acirc;ell.&acirc;) Link files. In the copy mode (-r -w),
hard links are made between the source and destination file
hierarchies whenever possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Select the first archive
member that matches each pattern operand. No more than one
archive member is matched for each pattern. When members of
type directory are <br>
matched, the file hierarchy rooted at that directory is also
matched (unless -d is also specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o options <br>
Information to modify the algorithm for extracting or
writing archive files which is specific to the archive
format specified by -x. In general, options take the form:
<br>
name=value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p string <br>
Specify one or more file characteristic options
(privileges). The string option-argument is a string
specifying file characteristics to be retained or discarded
on extrac&acirc; <br>
tion. The string consists of the specification characters a,
e, m, o, and p. Multiple characteristics can be concatenated
within the same string and multiple -p options <br>
can be specified. The meaning of the specification
characters are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a Do not preserve file access
times. By default, file access times are preserved whenever
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e &acirc;Preserve
everything&acirc;, the user ID, group ID, file mode bits,
file access time, and file modification time. This is
intended to be used by root, someone with all the <br>
appropriate privileges, in order to preserve all aspects of
the files as they are recorded in the archive. The e flag is
the sum of the o and p flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m Do not preserve file
modification times. By default, file modification times are
preserved whenever possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Preserve the user ID and group
ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p &acirc;Preserve&acirc; the
file mode bits. This is intended to be used by a user with
regular privileges who wants to preserve all aspects of the
file other than the ownership. <br>
The file times are preserved by default, but two other flags
are offered to disable this and use the time of extraction
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the preceding list,
&acirc;preserve&acirc; indicates that an attribute stored in
the archive is given to the extracted file, subject to the
permissions of the invoking process. <br>
Otherwise the attribute of the extracted file is determined
as part of the normal file creation action. If neither the e
nor the o specification character is specified, or <br>
the user ID and group ID are not preserved for any reason,
opax will not set the S_ISUID (setuid) and S_ISGID (setgid)
bits of the file mode. If the preservation of any of <br>
these items fails for any reason, opax will write a
diagnostic message to standard error. Failure to preserve
these items will affect the final exit status, but will not
<br>
cause the extracted file to be deleted. If the file
characteristic letters in any of the string option-arguments
are duplicated or conflict with each other, the one(s) <br>
given last will take precedence. For example, if <br>
-p eme <br>
is specified, file modification times are still
preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s replstr <br>
Modify the file or archive member names specified by the
pattern or file operands according to the substitution
expression replstr, using the syntax of the ed(1) utility
<br>
regular expressions. The format of these regular expressions
are: <br>
/old/new/[gp] <br>
As in ed(1), old is a basic regular expression and new can
contain an ampersand (&acirc;&amp;&acirc;), &acirc;0 (where
n is a digit) back-references, or subexpression matching.
The old string <br>
may also contain newline characters. Any non-null character
can be used as a delimiter (&acirc;/&acirc; is shown here).
Multiple -s expressions can be specified. The expressions
are <br>
applied in the order they are specified on the command line,
terminating with the first successful substitution. The
optional trailing g continues to apply the substitu&acirc;
<br>
tion expression to the pathname substring which starts with
the first character following the end of the last successful
substitution. The first unsuccessful substitution <br>
stops the operation of the g option. The optional trailing p
will cause the final result of a successful substitution to
be written to standard error in the following for&acirc;
<br>
mat: <br>
&lt;original pathname&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;new pathname&gt; <br>
File or archive member names that substitute to the empty
string are not selected and will be skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Reset the access times of any
file or directory read or accessed by opax to be the same as
they were before being read or accessed by opax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Ignore files that are older
(having a less recent file modification time) than a
pre-existing file or archive member with the same name.
During read, an archive member <br>
with the same name as a file in the file system will be
extracted if the archive member is newer than the file.
During write, a file system member with the same name as an
<br>
archive member will be written to the archive if it is newer
than the archive member. During copy, the file in the
destination hierarchy is replaced by the file in the <br>
source hierarchy or by a link to the file in the source
hierarchy if the file in the source hierarchy is newer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v During a list operation,
produce a verbose table of contents using the format of the
ls(1) utility with the -l option. For pathnames representing
a hard link to a previous <br>
member of the archive, the output has the format: <br>
&lt;ls -l listing&gt; == &lt;link name&gt; <br>
For pathnames representing a symbolic link, the output has
the format: <br>
&lt;ls -l listing&gt; =&gt; &lt;link name&gt; <br>
Where &lt;ls -l listing&gt; is the output format specified
by the ls(1) utility when used with the -l option. Otherwise
for all the other operational modes (read, write, and <br>
copy), pathnames are written and flushed to standard error
without a trailing newline as soon as processing begins on
that file or archive member. The trailing newline is <br>
not buffered and is written only after the file has been
read or written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x format <br>
Specify the output archive format, with the default format
being ustar. opax currently supports the following
formats:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpio The extended cpio
interchange format specified in the IEEE Std 1003.2
(&acirc;POSIX.2&acirc;) standard. The default blocksize for
this format is 5120 bytes. Inode and device <br>
information about a file (used for detecting file hard links
by this format) which may be truncated by this format is
detected by opax and is repaired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bcpio The old binary cpio
format. The default blocksize for this format is 5120 bytes.
This format is not very portable and should not be used when
other formats are <br>
available. Inode and device information about a file (used
for detecting file hard links by this format) which may be
truncated by this format is detected by opax <br>
and is repaired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sv4cpio The System V release 4
cpio. The default blocksize for this format is 5120 bytes.
Inode and device information about a file (used for
detecting file hard links <br>
by this format) which may be truncated by this format is
detected by opax and is repaired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sv4crc The System V release 4
cpio with file crc checksums. The default blocksize for this
format is 5120 bytes. Inode and device information about a
file (used for <br>
detecting file hard links by this format) which may be
truncated by this format is detected by opax and is
repaired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tar The old BSD tar format as
found in BSD4.3. The default blocksize for this format is
10240 bytes. Pathnames stored by this format must be 100
characters or less <br>
in length (including the trailing character, which means
that filenames can have a maximum length of 99 characters).
Only regular files, hard links, soft links, <br>
and directories will be archived (other file system types
are not supported). For backwards compatibility with even
older tar formats, a -o option can be used <br>
when writing an archive to omit the storage of directories.
This option takes the form: <br>
-o write_opt=nodir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ustar The extended tar
interchange format specified in the IEEE Std 1003.2
(&acirc;POSIX.2&acirc;) standard. The default blocksize for
this format is 10240 bytes. Filenames stored <br>
by this format must be 100 characters or less in length
(including the trailing character, which means that
filenames can have a maximum length of 99 charac&acirc; <br>
ters). Pathnames (directorynames + filenames) stored by this
format must be 250 characters or less in length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opax will detect and report any
file that it is unable to store or extract as the result of
any specific archive format restrictions. The individual
archive formats may <br>
impose additional restrictions on use. Typical archive
format restrictions include (but are not limited to): file
pathname length, file size, link pathname length, and the
<br>
type of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Use gzip(1) to compress
(decompress) the archive while writing (reading).
Incompatible with -a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B bytes <br>
Limit the number of bytes written to a single archive volume
to bytes. The bytes limit can end with &acirc;m&acirc;,
&acirc;k&acirc;, or &acirc;b&acirc; to specify
multiplication by 1048576 (1M), 1024 (1K) <br>
or 512, respectively. A pair of bytes limits can be
separated by &acirc;x&acirc; to indicate a product.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: Only use this option
when writing an archive to a device which supports an end of
file read condition based on last (or largest) write offset
(such as a regular <br>
file or a tape drive). The use of this option with a floppy
or hard disk is not recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D This option is the same as
the -u option, except that the file inode change time is
checked instead of the file modification time. The file
inode change time can be used <br>
to select files whose inode information (e.g., UID, GID,
etc.) is newer than a copy of the file in the destination
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E limit <br>
Limit the number of consecutive read faults while trying to
read a flawed archive to limit. With a positive limit, opax
will attempt to recover from an archive read error <br>
and will continue processing starting with the next file
stored in the archive. A limit of 0 will cause opax to stop
operation after the first read error is detected on an <br>
archive volume. A limit of NONE will cause opax to attempt
to recover from read errors forever. The default limit is a
small positive number of retries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: Using this option with
NONE should be used with extreme caution as opax may get
stuck in an infinite loop on a very badly flawed
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G group <br>
Select a file based on its group name, or when starting with
a #, a numeric gid. A &acirc;&acirc; can be used to escape
the #. Multiple -G options may be supplied and checking
stops <br>
with the first match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Follow only command-line
symbolic links while performing a physical file system
traversal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Follow all symbolic links to
perform a logical file system traversal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O Force the archive to be one
volume. If a volume ends prematurely, opax will not prompt
for a new volume. This option can be useful for automated
tasks where error recov&acirc; <br>
ery cannot be performed by a human.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Do not follow symbolic links,
perform a physical file system traversal. This is the
default mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T
[from_date][,to_date][/[c][m]] <br>
Allow files to be selected based on a file modification or
inode change time falling within a specified time range of
from_date to to_date (the dates are inclusive). If <br>
only a from_date is supplied, all files with a modification
or inode change time equal to or younger are selected. If
only a to_date is supplied, all files with a modifi&acirc;
<br>
cation or inode change time equal to or older will be
selected. When the from_date is equal to the to_date, only
files with a modification or inode change time of exactly
<br>
that time will be selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When opax is in the write or
copy mode, the optional trailing field [c][m] can be used to
determine which file time (inode change, file modification
or both) are used in <br>
the comparison. If neither is specified, the default is to
use file modification time only. The m specifies the
comparison of file modification time (the time when the <br>
file was last written). The c specifies the comparison of
inode change time (the time when the file inode was last
changed; e.g., a change of owner, group, mode, etc). <br>
When c and m are both specified, then the modification and
inode change times are both compared. The inode change time
comparison is useful in selecting files whose <br>
attributes were recently changed or selecting files which
were recently created and had their modification time reset
to an older time (as what happens when a file is <br>
extracted from an archive and the modification time is
preserved). Time comparisons using both file times is useful
when opax is used to create a time based incremental <br>
archive (only files that were changed during a specified
time range will be archived).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A time range is made up of six
different fields and each field must contain two digits. The
format is: <br>
[[[[[cc]yy]mm]dd]HH]MM[.SS] <br>
Where cc is the first two digits of the year (the century),
yy is the last two digits of the year, the first mm is the
month (from 01 to 12), dd is the day of the month <br>
(from 01 to 31), HH is the hour of the day (from 00 to 23),
MM is the minute (from 00 to 59), and SS is the seconds
(from 00 to 59). The minute field MM is required, while <br>
the other fields are optional and must be added in the
following order: <br>
HH, dd, mm, yy, cc. <br>
The SS field may be added independently of the other fields.
Time ranges are relative to the current time, so <br>
-T 1234/cm <br>
would select all files with a modification or inode change
time of 12:34 PM today or later. Multiple -T time range can
be supplied and checking stops with the first match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U user <br>
Select a file based on its user name, or when starting with
a #, a numeric UID. A &acirc;&acirc; can be used to escape
the #. Multiple -U options may be supplied and checking
stops <br>
with the first match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X When traversing the file
hierarchy specified by a pathname, do not descend into
directories that have a different device ID. See the st_dev
field as described in stat(2) <br>
for more information about device IDs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y This option is the same as
the -D option, except that the inode change time is checked
using the pathname created after all the file name
modifications have completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z This option is the same as
the -u option, except that the modification time is checked
using the pathname created after all the file name
modifications have completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options that operate on the
names of files or archive members (-c, -i, -n, -s, -u, -v,
-D, -G, -T, -U, -Y, and -Z) interact as follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When extracting files during a
read operation, archive members are &acirc;selected&acirc;,
based only on the user specified pattern operands as
modified by the -c, -n, -u, -D, -G, -T, -U <br>
options. Then any -s and -i options will modify in that
order, the names of these selected files. Then the -Y and -Z
options will be applied based on the final pathname. <br>
Finally, the -v option will write the names resulting from
these modifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When archiving files during a
write operation, or copying files during a copy operation,
archive members are &acirc;selected&acirc;, based only on
the user specified pathnames as modified by <br>
the -n, -u, -D, -G, -T, and -U options (the -D option only
applies during a copy operation). Then any -s and -i options
will modify in that order, the names of these selected <br>
files. Then during a copy operation the -Y and the -Z
options will be applied based on the final pathname.
Finally, the -v option will write the names resulting from
these modi&acirc; <br>
fications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When one or both of the -u or -D
options are specified along with the -n option, a file is
not considered selected unless it is newer than the file to
which it is compared.</p>

$ opax -w -f /dev/rst0 .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copies the contents of the
current directory to the device /dev/rst0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ opax -v -f filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gives the verbose table of
contents for an archive stored in filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ mkdir newdir; cd olddir; opax
-rw . newdir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This sequence of commands will
copy the entire olddir directory hierarchy to newdir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ opax -r -s
&rsquo;,^//*usr//*,,&rsquo; -f a.pax</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reads the archive a.pax, with
all files rooted in /usr into the archive extracted relative
to the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ opax -rw -i . dest_dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can be used to interactively
select the files to copy from the current directory to
dest_dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ opax -r -pe -U root -G bin -f
a.pax</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extract all files from the
archive a.pax which are owned by root with group bin and
preserve all file permissions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ opax -r -w -v -Y -Z home
/backup&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Update (and list) only those
files in the destination directory /backup which are older
(less recent inode change or file modification times) than
files with the same name found in <br>
the source file tree home.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
opax will exit with one of the following values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 All files were processed
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whenever opax cannot create a
file or a link when reading an archive or cannot find a file
when writing an archive, or cannot preserve the user ID,
group ID, or file mode when the <br>
-p option is specified, a diagnostic message is written to
standard error and a non-zero exit status will be returned,
but processing will continue. In the case where opax cannot
<br>
create a link to a file, opax will not create a second copy
of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the extraction of a file from
an archive is prematurely terminated by a signal or error,
opax may have only partially extracted a file the user
wanted. Additionally, the file <br>
modes of extracted files and directories may have incorrect
file bits, and the modification and access times may be
wrong.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the creation of an archive is
prematurely terminated by a signal or error, opax may have
only partially created the archive which may violate the
specific archive format speci&acirc; <br>
fication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If while doing a copy, opax
detects a file is about to overwrite itself, the file is not
copied, a diagnostic message is written to standard error
and when opax completes it will <br>
exit with a non-zero exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARDS <br>
The opax utility is a superset of the IEEE Std 1003.2
(&acirc;POSIX.2&acirc;) standard. The options -B, -D, -E,
-G, -H, -L, -O, -P, -T, -U, -Y, -Z, the archive formats
bcpio, sv4cpio, sv4crc, <br>
tar, and the flawed archive handling during list and read
operations are extensions to the POSIX standard.</p>
