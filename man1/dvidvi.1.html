The dvidvi program converts a dvi file into another dvi file, with perhaps
  certain changes.

-f n page n is first page selected
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
-l n page n is last page selected
<br/>
-n n select at most n pages. Notice that n is the number of pages selected,
  independently of the number of pages actually contained in a sheet -i { n1..n2
  | n1 }[,...]
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
include pages (ranges allowed). When this option is used, ONLY the specified
  pages are selected. However, we can exclude from these pages with the option
  -x -x { n1..n2 | n1 }[,...]
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
exclude pages (ranges allowed) -q work in quiet mode, that is do not print in
  the screen messages of how the work is being done. -r reverse the order of the
  pages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The page numbers for the above options -f -l -i and -x can be specified in
  different ways.
<br/>
1) If a number n is given, it is interpreted as the n'th page from the begining
  of the .dvi file. Of course, this number is independent of the page number
  assigned by TeX. 2) TeX page numbers are those who are actually written in the
  page; these page numbers can be modified, for example, by using the TeX
  commands \pagenumbering, \setcounter{page}{n}, and \addtocounter{page}{n}. A
  TeX page number can be specified by preceding the number n with the character
  @. Thus, if you specify -f @25 -l @30 you select the pages between 25 and 30,
  these numbers being those assigned by TeX. 3) However, several pages can have
  the same TeX page number in a .dvi file. For example, the introductory pages
  in a book are numbered i, ii, and so on until the first chapter begins and
  then, the pages are numbered 1, 2, etc. In this case, the pages numbered i and
  1 in the .dvi file have the same TeX page number. If you want to select for
  example the second occurrence of the page numbered 1, you can specify a page
  number as (@2)1. Thus @1 is equivalent to (@1)1. For example, if you specify
  -f (@2)1 -l(@2)10 you select the pages between 1 and 10 of the first chapter,
  not the introductory pages between i and x.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is another parameter that tells dvidvi how you want to change page layout
  and specifications. This is the -m parameter.
<br/>
* The number preceding the colon is the modulo value. Everything will be done in
  chunks of pages this big. If there is no colon, than the default value is
  assumed to be one. The last chunk of pages is padded with as many blank pages
  as necessary. * Following the colon is a comma-separated list of page numbers.
  These page numbers are with respect to the current chunk of pages, and must
  lie in the range zero to the modulo value less one. If a negative sign
  precedes the number, then the page is taken from the mirror chunk; if there
  are m chunks, then the mirror chunk of chunk n is the chunk numbered m-n-1.
  Put simply, it is the chunk numbered the same, only from the end. This can be
  used to reverse pages. If no number is given, the page number defaults to 1. *
  Following each page number is an optional offset value in parenthesis, which
  consists of a pair of comma-separated dimensions. Each dimension is a decimal
  number with an optional unit of measure. The default unit of measure is
  inches, or the last unit of measure used. All units are in true dimensions.
  Allowable units of measure are the same that TeX allows: in, mm, cm, pt, pc,
  dd, and cc.

-m - Reverses the order of the pages. This time, both the modulo and the page
  number are defaulted. -m 2:0 Selects the first, third, fifth, etc. pages from
  the file. Print this one after printing the next, taking the paper out of the
  feed tray and reinserting it into the paper feed. -m 2:-1 Selects the second,
  fourth, etc. pages, and writes them in reverse order. -m 4:-1,2(4.25in,0in) -m
  4:-3,0(4.25in,0in)
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Useful for printing a little booklet, four pages to a sheet, double-sided, for
  stapling in the middle. Print the first one, put the stack back into the
  printer upside down, and print the second. The `in' specifications are
  superfluous. -m ,(1pt,1)
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Scare your system administrator! Actually, things are so blurry with this
  option, you may want to send enemies letters printed like this. *Long*
  letters. -m 4:0(5.5in,4.25),3(0,4.25) -m 4:1(0in,4.25),2(5.5,4.25)
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Print a four-page card on one sheet. Print the first, rotate the paper 180
  degrees and feed it again. (PostScript people can do funny tricks with
  PostScript so this isn't necessary.)
