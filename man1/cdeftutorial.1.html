  of RRDtool's CDEF language.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you think some important feature is not explained properly, and if adding it
  to this document would benefit most users, please do ask me to add it. I will
  then try to provide an answer in the next release of this tutorial. No

  this tutorial?</a></h2>
One of the powerful parts of RRDtool is its ability to do all sorts of
  calculations on the data retrieved from its databases. However, RRDtool's many
  options and syntax make it difficult for the average user to understand. The
  manuals are good at explaining what these options do; however they do not (and
  should not) explain in detail why they are useful. As with my RRDtool
  tutorial: if you want a simple document in simple language you should read
  this tutorial. If you are happy with the official documentation, you may find
  this document too simple or even boring. If you do choose to read this
  tutorial, I also expect you to have read and fully understand my other
  tutorial.

If you have difficulties with the way I try to explain it please read Steve
  Rader's rpntutorial. It may help you understand how this all works.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="What_are_CDEFs?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_are_CDEFs?">What
  are CDEFs?</a></h1>
When retrieving data from an RRD, you are using a &quot;DEF&quot; to work with
  that data. Think of it as a variable that changes over time (where time is the
  x-axis). The value of this variable is what is found in the database at that
  particular time and you can't do any modifications on it. This is what CDEFs
  are for: they takes values from DEFs and perform calculations on them.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Syntax"><a class="selflink" href="#Syntax">Syntax</a></h1>
<pre>
   DEF:var_name_1=some.rrd:ds_name:CF
   CDEF:var_name_2=RPN_expression
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You first define &quot;var_name_1&quot; to be data collected from data source
  &quot;ds_name&quot; found in RRD &quot;some.rrd&quot; with consolidation
  function &quot;CF&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Assume the ifInOctets SNMP counter is saved in mrtg.rrd as the DS
  &quot;in&quot;. Then the following DEF defines a variable for the average of
  that data source:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   DEF:inbytes=mrtg.rrd:in:AVERAGE
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Say you want to display bits per second (instead of bytes per second as stored
  in the database.) You have to define a calculation (hence &quot;CDEF&quot;) on
  variable &quot;inbytes&quot; and use that variable (inbits) instead of the
  original:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   CDEF:inbits=inbytes,8,*
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This tells RRDtool to multiply inbytes by eight to get inbits. I'll explain
  later how this works. In the graphing or printing functions, you can now use
  inbits where you would use inbytes otherwise.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the variable name used in the CDEF (inbits) must not be the same as
  the variable named in the DEF (inbytes)!
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RPN-expressions"><a class="selflink" href="#RPN-expressions">RPN-expressions</a></h1>
RPN is short-hand for Reverse Polish Notation. It works as follows. You put the
  variables or numbers on a stack. You also put operations (things-to-do) on the
  stack and this stack is then processed. The result will be placed on the
  stack. At the end, there should be exactly one number left: the outcome of the
  series of operations. If there is not exactly one number left, RRDtool will
  complain loudly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Above multiplication by eight will look like:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Start with an empty stack</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Put the content of variable inbytes on the stack</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Put the number eight on the stack</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">4.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Put the operation multiply on the stack</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">5.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Process the stack</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">6.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Retrieve the value from the stack and put it in variable
      inbits</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We will now do an example with real numbers. Suppose the variable inbytes would
  have value 10, the stack would be:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">||</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">|10|</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">|10|8|</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">4.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">|10|8|*|</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">5.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">|80|</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">6.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">||</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Processing the stack (step 5) will retrieve one value from the stack (from the
  right at step 4). This is the operation multiply and this takes two values off
  the stack as input. The result is put back on the stack (the value 80 in this
  case). For multiplication the order doesn't matter, but for other operations
  like subtraction and division it does. Generally speaking you have the
  following order:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   y = A - B  --&gt;  y=minus(A,B)  --&gt;  CDEF:y=A,B,-
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is not very intuitive (at least most people don't think so). For the
  function f(A,B) you reverse the position of &quot;f&quot;, but you do not
  reverse the order of the variables.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Converting_your_wishes_to_RPN"><a class="selflink" href="#Converting_your_wishes_to_RPN">Converting
  your wishes to RPN</a></h1>
First, get a clear picture of what you want to do. Break down the problem in
  smaller portions until they cannot be split anymore. Then it is rather simple
  to convert your ideas into RPN.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Suppose you have several RRDs and would like to add up some counters in them.
  These could be, for instance, the counters for every WAN link you are
  monitoring.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You have:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   router1.rrd with link1in link2in
   router2.rrd with link1in link2in
   router3.rrd with link1in link2in
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Suppose you would like to add up all these counters, except for link2in inside
  router2.rrd. You need to do:
<div class="Pp"></div>
(in this example, &quot;router1.rrd:link1in&quot; means the DS link1in inside
  the RRD router1.rrd)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   router1.rrd:link1in
   router1.rrd:link2in
   router2.rrd:link1in
   router3.rrd:link1in
   router3.rrd:link2in
   --------------------   +
   (outcome of the sum)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a mathematical function, this could be written:
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;add(router1.rrd:link1in , router1.rrd:link2in , router2.rrd:link1in ,
  router3.rrd:link1in , router3.rrd:link2.in)&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
With RRDtool and RPN, first, define the inputs:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   DEF:a=router1.rrd:link1in:AVERAGE
   DEF:b=router1.rrd:link2in:AVERAGE
   DEF:c=router2.rrd:link1in:AVERAGE
   DEF:d=router3.rrd:link1in:AVERAGE
   DEF:e=router3.rrd:link2in:AVERAGE
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now, the mathematical function becomes: &quot;add(a,b,c,d,e)&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
In RPN, there's no operator that sums more than two values so you need to do
  several additions. You add a and b, add c to the result, add d to the result
  and add e to the result.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   push a:         a     stack contains the value of a
   push b and add: b,+   stack contains the result of a+b
   push c and add: c,+   stack contains the result of a+b+c
   push d and add: d,+   stack contains the result of a+b+c+d
   push e and add: e,+   stack contains the result of a+b+c+d+e
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
What was calculated here would be written down as:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   ( ( ( (a+b) + c) + d) + e) &gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is in RPN: &quot;CDEF:result=a,b,+,c,+,d,+,e,+&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is correct but it can be made more clear to humans. It does not matter if
  you add a to b and then add c to the result or first add b to c and then add a
  to the result. This makes it possible to rewrite the RPN into
  &quot;CDEF:result=a,b,c,d,e,+,+,+,+&quot; which is evaluated differently:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   push value of variable a on the stack: a
   push value of variable b on the stack: a b
   push value of variable c on the stack: a b c
   push value of variable d on the stack: a b c d
   push value of variable e on the stack: a b c d e
   push operator + on the stack:          a b c d e +
   and process it:                        a b c P   (where P == d+e)
   push operator + on the stack:          a b c P +
   and process it:                        a b Q     (where Q == c+P)
   push operator + on the stack:          a b Q +
   and process it:                        a R       (where R == b+Q)
   push operator + on the stack:          a R +
   and process it:                        S         (where S == a+R)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As you can see the RPN expression &quot;a,b,c,d,e,+,+,+,+,+&quot; will evaluate
  in &quot;((((d+e)+c)+b)+a)&quot; and it has the same outcome as
  &quot;a,b,+,c,+,d,+,e,+&quot;. This is called the commutative law of addition,
  but you may forget this right away, as long as you remember what it means.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now look at an expression that contains a multiplication:
<div class="Pp"></div>
First in normal math: &quot;let result = a+b*c&quot;. In this case you can't
  choose the order yourself, you have to start with the multiplication and then
  add a to it. You may alter the position of b and c, you must not alter the
  position of a and b.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You have to take this in consideration when converting this expression into RPN.
  Read it as: &quot;Add the outcome of b*c to a&quot; and then it is easy to
  write the RPN expression: &quot;result=a,b,c,*,+&quot; Another expression that
  would return the same: &quot;result=b,c,*,a,+&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
In normal math, you may encounter something like &quot;a*(b+c)&quot; and this
  can also be converted into RPN. The parenthesis just tell you to first add b
  and c, and then multiply a with the result. Again, now it is easy to write it
  in RPN: &quot;result=a,b,c,+,*&quot;. Note that this is very similar to one of
  the expressions in the previous paragraph, only the multiplication and the
  addition changed places.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you have problems with RPN or when RRDtool is complaining, it's usually a
  good thing to write down the stack on a piece of paper and see what happens.
  Have the manual ready and pretend to be RRDtool. Just do all the math by hand
  to see what happens, I'm sure this will solve most, if not all, problems you
  encounter.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Some_special_numbers"><a class="selflink" href="#Some_special_numbers">Some
  special numbers</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_unknown_value"><a class="selflink" href="#The_unknown_value">The
  unknown value</a></h2>
Sometimes collecting your data will fail. This can be very common, especially
  when querying over busy links. RRDtool can be configured to allow for one (or
  even more) unknown value(s) and calculate the missing update. You can, for
  instance, query your device every minute. This is creating one so called PDP
  or primary data point per minute. If you defined your RRD to contain an RRA
  that stores 5-minute values, you need five of those PDPs to create one CDP
  (consolidated data point). These PDPs can become unknown in two cases:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The updates are too far apart. This is tuned using the
      &quot;heartbeat&quot; setting.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The update was set to unknown on purpose by inserting no
      value (using the template option) or by using &quot;U&quot; as the value
      to insert.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a CDP is calculated, another mechanism determines if this CDP is valid or
  not. If there are too many PDPs unknown, the CDP is unknown as well. This is
  determined by the xff factor. Please note that one unknown counter update can
  result in two unknown PDPs! If you only allow for one unknown PDP per CDP,
  this makes the CDP go unknown!
<div class="Pp"></div>
Suppose the counter increments with one per second and you retrieve it every
  minute:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   counter value    resulting rate
   10'000
   10'060            1; (10'060-10'000)/60 == 1
   10'120            1; (10'120-10'060)/60 == 1
   unknown           unknown; you don't know the last value
   10'240            unknown; you don't know the previous value
   10'300            1; (10'300-10'240)/60 == 1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the CDP was to be calculated from the last five updates, it would get two
  unknown PDPs and three known PDPs. If xff would have been set to 0.5 which by
  the way is a commonly used factor, the CDP would have a known value of 1. If
  xff would have been set to 0.2 then the resulting CDP would be unknown.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You have to decide the proper values for heartbeat, number of PDPs per CDP and
  the xff factor. As you can see from the previous text they define the behavior
  of your RRA.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Working_with_unknown_data_in_your_database"><a class="selflink" href="#Working_with_unknown_data_in_your_database">Working
  with unknown data in your database</a></h2>
As you have read in the previous chapter, entries in an RRA can be set to the
  unknown value. If you do calculations with this type of value, the result has
  to be unknown too. This means that an expression such as
  &quot;result=a,b,+&quot; will be unknown if either a or b is unknown. It would
  be wrong to just ignore the unknown value and return the value of the other
  parameter. By doing so, you would assume &quot;unknown&quot; means
  &quot;zero&quot; and this is not true.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There has been a case where somebody was collecting data for over a year. A new
  piece of equipment was installed, a new RRD was created and the scripts were
  changed to add a counter from the old database and a counter from the new
  database. The result was disappointing, a large part of the statistics seemed
  to have vanished mysteriously ... They of course didn't, values from the old
  database (known values) were added to values from the new database (unknown
  values) and the result was unknown.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In this case, it is fairly reasonable to use a CDEF that alters unknown data
  into zero. The counters of the device were unknown (after all, it wasn't
  installed yet!) but you know that the data rate through the device had to be
  zero (because of the same reason: it was not installed).
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are some examples below that make this change.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Infinity"><a class="selflink" href="#Infinity">Infinity</a></h2>
Infinite data is another form of a special number. It cannot be graphed because
  by definition you would never reach the infinite value. You can think of
  positive and negative infinity depending on the position relative to zero.
<div class="Pp"></div>
RRDtool is capable of representing (-not- graphing!) infinity by stopping at its
  current maximum (for positive infinity) or minimum (for negative infinity)
  without knowing this maximum (minimum).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Infinity in RRDtool is mostly used to draw an AREA without knowing its vertical
  dimensions. You can think of it as drawing an AREA with an infinite height and
  displaying only the part that is visible in the current graph. This is
  probably a good way to approximate infinity and it sure allows for some neat
  tricks. See below for examples.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Working_with_unknown_data_and_infinity"><a class="selflink" href="#Working_with_unknown_data_and_infinity">Working
  with unknown data and infinity</a></h2>
Sometimes you would like to discard unknown data and pretend it is zero (or any
  other value for that matter) and sometimes you would like to pretend that
  known data is unknown (to discard known-to-be-wrong data). This is why CDEFs
  have support for unknown data. There are also examples available that show
  unknown data by using infinity.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Some_examples"><a class="selflink" href="#Some_examples">Some
  examples</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Example:_using_a_recently_created_RRD"><a class="selflink" href="#Example:_using_a_recently_created_RRD">Example:
  using a recently created RRD</a></h2>
You are keeping statistics on your router for over a year now. Recently you
  installed an extra router and you would like to show the combined throughput
  for these two devices.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you just add up the counters from router.rrd and router2.rrd, you will add
  known data (from router.rrd) to unknown data (from router2.rrd) for the bigger
  part of your stats. You could solve this in a few ways:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">While creating the new database, fill it with zeros from
      the start to now. You have to make the database start at or before the
      least recent time in the other database.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Alternatively, you could use CDEF and alter unknown data to
      zero.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Both methods have their pros and cons. The first method is troublesome and if
  you want to do that you have to figure it out yourself. It is not possible to
  create a database filled with zeros, you have to put them in manually.
  Implementing the second method is described next:
<div class="Pp"></div>
What we want is: &quot;if the value is unknown, replace it with zero&quot;. This
  could be written in pseudo-code as: if (value is unknown) then (zero) else
  (value). When reading the rrdgraph manual you notice the &quot;UN&quot;
  function that returns zero or one. You also notice the &quot;IF&quot; function
  that takes zero or one as input.
<div class="Pp"></div>
First look at the &quot;IF&quot; function. It takes three values from the stack,
  the first value is the decision point, the second value is returned to the
  stack if the evaluation is &quot;true&quot; and if not, the third value is
  returned to the stack. We want the &quot;UN&quot; function to decide what
  happens so we combine those two functions in one CDEF.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Lets write down the two possible paths for the &quot;IF&quot; function:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   if true  return a
   if false return b
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In RPN: &quot;result=x,a,b,IF&quot; where &quot;x&quot; is either true or false.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now we have to fill in &quot;x&quot;, this should be the &quot;(value is
  unknown)&quot; part and this is in RPN: &quot;result=value,UN&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
We now combine them: &quot;result=value,UN,a,b,IF&quot; and when we fill in the
  appropriate things for &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; we're finished:
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;CDEF:result=value,UN,0,value,IF&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may want to read Steve Rader's RPN guide if you have difficulties with the
  way I explained this last example.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to check this RPN expression, just mimic RRDtool behavior:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   For any known value, the expression evaluates as follows:
   CDEF:result=value,UN,0,value,IF  (value,UN) is not true so it becomes 0
   CDEF:result=0,0,value,IF         &quot;IF&quot; will return the 3rd value
   CDEF:result=value                The known value is returned
   For the unknown value, this happens:
   CDEF:result=value,UN,0,value,IF  (value,UN) is true so it becomes 1
   CDEF:result=1,0,value,IF         &quot;IF&quot; sees 1 and returns the 2nd value
   CDEF:result=0                    Zero is returned
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Of course, if you would like to see another value instead of zero, you can use
  that other value.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Eventually, when all unknown data is removed from the RRD, you may want to
  remove this rule so that unknown data is properly displayed.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Example:_better_handling_of_unknown_data,_by_using_time"><a class="selflink" href="#Example:_better_handling_of_unknown_data,_by_using_time">Example:
  better handling of unknown data, by using time</a></h2>
The above example has one drawback. If you do log unknown data in your database
  after installing your new equipment, it will also be translated into zero and
  therefore you won't see that there was a problem. This is not good and what
  you really want to do is:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If there is unknown data, look at the time that this sample
      was taken.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the unknown value is before time xxx, make it zero.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If it is after time xxx, leave it as unknown data.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is doable: you can compare the time that the sample was taken to some known
  time. Assuming you started to monitor your device on Friday September 17,
  1999, 00:35:57 MET DST. Translate this time in seconds since 1970-01-01 and it
  becomes 937'521'357. If you process unknown values that were received after
  this time, you want to leave them unknown and if they were
  &quot;received&quot; before this time, you want to translate them into zero
  (so you can effectively ignore them while adding them to your other routers
  counters).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Translating Friday September 17, 1999, 00:35:57 MET DST into 937'521'357 can be
  done by, for instance, using gnu date:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   date -d &quot;19990917 00:35:57&quot; +%s
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You could also dump the database and see where the data starts to be known.
  There are several other ways of doing this, just pick one.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now we have to create the magic that allows us to process unknown values
  different depending on the time that the sample was taken. This is a three
  step process:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the timestamp of the value is after 937'521'357, leave
      it as is.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the value is a known value, leave it as is.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Change the unknown value into zero.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Lets look at part one:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    if (true) return the original value
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We rewrite this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    if (true) return &quot;a&quot;
    if (false) return &quot;b&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We need to calculate true or false from step 1. There is a function available
  that returns the timestamp for the current sample. It is called, how
  surprisingly, &quot;TIME&quot;. This time has to be compared to a constant
  number, we need &quot;GT&quot;. The output of &quot;GT&quot; is true or false
  and this is good input to &quot;IF&quot;. We want &quot;if (time &gt;
  937521357) then (return a) else (return b)&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This process was already described thoroughly in the previous chapter so lets do
  it quick:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   if (x) then a else b
      where x represents &quot;time&gt;937521357&quot;
      where a represents the original value
      where b represents the outcome of the previous example
   time&gt;937521357       --&gt; TIME,937521357,GT
   if (x) then a else b --&gt; x,a,b,IF
   substitute x         --&gt; TIME,937521357,GT,a,b,IF
   substitute a         --&gt; TIME,937521357,GT,value,b,IF
   substitute b         --&gt; TIME,937521357,GT,value,value,UN,0,value,IF,IF
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We end up with:
  &quot;CDEF:result=TIME,937521357,GT,value,value,UN,0,value,IF,IF&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
This looks very complex, however, as you can see, it was not too hard to come up
  with.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Example:_Pretending_weird_data_isn't_there"><a class="selflink" href="#Example:_Pretending_weird_data_isn't_there">Example:
  Pretending weird data isn't there</a></h2>
Suppose you have a problem that shows up as huge spikes in your graph. You know
  this happens and why, so you decide to work around the problem. Perhaps you're
  using your network to do a backup at night and by doing so you get almost
  10mb/s while the rest of your network activity does not produce numbers higher
  than 100kb/s.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are two options:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the number exceeds 100kb/s it is wrong and you want it
      masked out by changing it into unknown.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You don't want the graph to show more than 100kb/s.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Pseudo code: if (number &gt; 100) then unknown else number or Pseudo code: if
  (number &gt; 100) then 100 else number.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second &quot;problem&quot; may also be solved by using the rigid option of
  RRDtool graph, however this has not the same result. In this example you can
  end up with a graph that does autoscaling. Also, if you use the numbers to
  display maxima they will be set to 100kb/s.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We use &quot;IF&quot; and &quot;GT&quot; again. &quot;if (x) then (y) else
  (z)&quot; is written down as &quot;CDEF:result=x,y,z,IF&quot;; now fill in x,
  y and z. For x you fill in &quot;number greater than 100kb/s&quot; becoming
  &quot;number,100000,GT&quot; (kilo is 1'000 and b/s is what we measure!). The
  &quot;z&quot; part is &quot;number&quot; in both cases and the &quot;y&quot;
  part is either &quot;UNKN&quot; for unknown or &quot;100000&quot; for 100kb/s.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The two CDEF expressions would be:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    CDEF:result=number,100000,GT,UNKN,number,IF
    CDEF:result=number,100000,GT,100000,number,IF
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Example:_working_on_a_certain_time_span"><a class="selflink" href="#Example:_working_on_a_certain_time_span">Example:

If you want a graph that spans a few weeks, but would only want to see some
  routers' data for one week, you need to &quot;hide&quot; the rest of the time
  frame. Don't ask me when this would be useful, it's just here for the example
  :)
<div class="Pp"></div>
We need to compare the time stamp to a begin date and an end date. Comparing
  isn't difficult:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        TIME,begintime,GE
        TIME,endtime,LE
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
These two parts of the CDEF produce either 0 for false or 1 for true. We can now
  check if they are both 0 (or 1) using a few IF statements but, as Wataru Satoh
  pointed out, we can use the &quot;*&quot; or &quot;+&quot; functions as
  logical AND and logical OR.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For &quot;*&quot;, the result will be zero (false) if either one of the two
  operators is zero. For &quot;+&quot;, the result will only be false (0) when
  two false (0) operators will be added. Warning: *any* number not equal to 0
  will be considered &quot;true&quot;. This means that, for instance,
  &quot;-1,1,+&quot; (which should be &quot;true or true&quot;) will become
  FALSE ... In other words, use &quot;+&quot; only if you know for sure that you
  have positive numbers (or zero) only.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Let's compile the complete CDEF:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DEF:ds0=router1.rrd:AVERAGE
        CDEF:ds0modified=TIME,begintime,GT,TIME,endtime,LE,*,ds0,UNKN,IF
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will return the value of ds0 if both comparisons return true. You could
  also do it the other way around:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DEF:ds0=router1.rrd:AVERAGE
        CDEF:ds0modified=TIME,begintime,LT,TIME,endtime,GT,+,UNKN,ds0,IF
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will return an UNKNOWN if either comparison returns true.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Example:_You_suspect_to_have_problems_and_want_to_see_unknown_data."><a class="selflink" href="#Example:_You_suspect_to_have_problems_and_want_to_see_unknown_data.">Example:
  You suspect to have problems and want to see unknown data.</a></h2>
Suppose you add up the number of active users on several terminal servers. If
  one of them doesn't give an answer (or an incorrect one) you get
  &quot;NaN&quot; in the database (&quot;Not a Number&quot;) and NaN is
  evaluated as Unknown.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In this case, you would like to be alerted to it and the sum of the remaining
  values is of no value to you.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It would be something like:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    DEF:users1=location1.rrd:onlineTS1:LAST
    DEF:users2=location1.rrd:onlineTS2:LAST
    DEF:users3=location2.rrd:onlineTS1:LAST
    DEF:users4=location2.rrd:onlineTS2:LAST
    CDEF:allusers=users1,users2,users3,users4,+,+,+
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you now plot allusers, unknown data in one of users1..users4 will show up as
  a gap in your graph. You want to modify this to show a bright red line, not a
  gap.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Define an extra CDEF that is unknown if all is okay and is infinite if there is
  an unknown value:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    CDEF:wrongdata=allusers,UN,INF,UNKN,IF
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;allusers,UN&quot; will evaluate to either true or false, it is the (x)
  part of the &quot;IF&quot; function and it checks if allusers is unknown. The
  (y) part of the &quot;IF&quot; function is set to &quot;INF&quot; (which means
  infinity) and the (z) part of the function returns &quot;UNKN&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The logic is: if (allusers == unknown) then return INF else return UNKN.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can now use AREA to display this &quot;wrongdata&quot; in bright red. If it
  is unknown (because allusers is known) then the red AREA won't show up. If the
  value is INF (because allusers is unknown) then the red AREA will be filled in
  on the graph at that particular time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   AREA:allusers#0000FF:combined user count
   AREA:wrongdata#FF0000:unknown data
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Same_example_useful_with_STACKed_data:"><a class="selflink" href="#Same_example_useful_with_STACKed_data:">Same
  example useful with STACKed data:</a></h2>
If you use stack in the previous example (as I would do) then you don't add up
  the values. Therefore, there is no relationship between the four values and
  you don't get a single value to test. Suppose users3 would be unknown at one
  point in time: users1 is plotted, users2 is stacked on top of users1, users3
  is unknown and therefore nothing happens, users4 is stacked on top of users2.
  Add the extra CDEFs anyway and use them to overlay the &quot;normal&quot;
  graph:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   DEF:users1=location1.rrd:onlineTS1:LAST
   DEF:users2=location1.rrd:onlineTS2:LAST
   DEF:users3=location2.rrd:onlineTS1:LAST
   DEF:users4=location2.rrd:onlineTS2:LAST
   CDEF:allusers=users1,users2,users3,users4,+,+,+
   CDEF:wrongdata=allusers,UN,INF,UNKN,IF
   AREA:users1#0000FF:users at ts1
   STACK:users2#00FF00:users at ts2
   STACK:users3#00FFFF:users at ts3
   STACK:users4#FFFF00:users at ts4
   AREA:wrongdata#FF0000:unknown data
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If there is unknown data in one of users1..users4, the &quot;wrongdata&quot;
  AREA will be drawn and because it starts at the X-axis and has infinite height
  it will effectively overwrite the STACKed parts.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You could combine the two CDEF lines into one (we don't use
  &quot;allusers&quot;) if you like. But there are good reasons for writing two
  CDEFS:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">It improves the readability of the script.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">It can be used inside GPRINT to display the total number of
      users.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you choose to combine them, you can substitute the &quot;allusers&quot; in
  the second CDEF with the part after the equal sign from the first line:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   CDEF:wrongdata=users1,users2,users3,users4,+,+,+,UN,INF,UNKN,IF
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you do so, you won't be able to use these next GPRINTs:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   COMMENT:&quot;Total number of users seen&quot;
   GPRINT:allusers:MAX:&quot;Maximum: %6.0lf&quot;
   GPRINT:allusers:MIN:&quot;Minimum: %6.0lf&quot;
   GPRINT:allusers:AVERAGE:&quot;Average: %6.0lf&quot;
   GPRINT:allusers:LAST:&quot;Current: %6.0lf\n&quot;

<div class="Pp"></div>
These two CDEFs are built from several functions. It helps to split them when
  viewing what they do. Starting with the first CDEF we would get:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 idat1,UN --&gt; a
 0        --&gt; b
 idat1    --&gt; c
 if (a) then (b) else (c)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The result is therefore &quot;0&quot; if it is true that &quot;idat1&quot;
  equals &quot;UN&quot;. If not, the original value of &quot;idat1&quot; is put
  back on the stack. Lets call this answer &quot;d&quot;. The process is
  repeated for the next five items on the stack, it is done the same and will
  return answer &quot;h&quot;. The resulting stack is therefore &quot;d,h&quot;.
  The expression has been simplified to &quot;d,h,+,8,*&quot; and it will now be
  easy to see that we add &quot;d&quot; and &quot;h&quot;, and multiply the
  result with eight.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The end result is that we have added &quot;idat1&quot; and &quot;idat2&quot; and
  in the process we effectively ignored unknown values. The result is multiplied
  by eight, most likely to convert bytes/s to bits/s.

<div class="Pp"></div>
This demo demonstrates two ways to use infinity. It is a bit tricky to see what
  happens in the &quot;background&quot; CDEF.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   &quot;val4,POP,TIME,7200,%,3600,LE,INF,UNKN,IF&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This RPN takes the value of &quot;val4&quot; as input and then immediately
  removes it from the stack using &quot;POP&quot;. The stack is now empty but as
  a side effect we now know the time that this sample was taken. This time is
  put on the stack by the &quot;TIME&quot; function.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;TIME,7200,%&quot; takes the modulo of time and 7'200 (which is two hours).
  The resulting value on the stack will be a number in the range from 0 to 7199.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For people who don't know the modulo function: it is the remainder after an
  integer division. If you divide 16 by 3, the answer would be 5 and the
  remainder would be 1. So, &quot;16,3,%&quot; returns 1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We have the result of &quot;TIME,7200,%&quot; on the stack, lets call this
  &quot;a&quot;. The start of the RPN has become &quot;a,3600,LE&quot; and this
  checks if &quot;a&quot; is less or equal than &quot;3600&quot;. It is true
  half of the time. We now have to process the rest of the RPN and this is only
  a simple &quot;IF&quot; function that returns either &quot;INF&quot; or
  &quot;UNKN&quot; depending on the time. This is returned to variable
  &quot;background&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second CDEF has been discussed earlier in this document so we won't do that
  here.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now you can draw the different layers. Start with the background that is either
  unknown (nothing to see) or infinite (the whole positive part of the graph
  gets filled).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Next you draw the data on top of this background, it will overlay the
  background. Suppose one of val1..val4 would be unknown, in that case you end
  up with only three bars stacked on top of each other. You don't want to see
  this because the data is only valid when all four variables are valid. This is
  why you use the second CDEF, it will overlay the data with an AREA so the data
  cannot be seen anymore.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If your data can also have negative values you also need to overwrite the other
  half of your graph. This can be done in a relatively simple way: what you need
  is the &quot;wipeout&quot; variable and place a negative sign before it:
  &quot;CDEF:wipeout2=wipeout,-1,*&quot;
