<p>MRTG-UNIX-GUIDE(1) mrtg MRTG-UNIX-GUIDE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mrtg-unix-guide - The MRTG 2.17.4 Linux/Unix Installation
Guide</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
MRTG comes to you in Source Code. This means that you have
to compile parts of it before you can use it on a Unix
machine. These instructions help you to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREPARATION <br>
In order to compile and use mrtg you need a C compiler and a
copy of perl installed on your machine. In most cases this
will already be available. In case it is not, here are <br>
some starting points. Below I&rsquo;ll give you a detailed
run through the whole compilation process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC The GNU C compiler comes
preinstalled on most of the free Unicies out there. For
commercial derivatives you may have to download and compile
it first. If you have no <br>
compiler at all there is a chicken and egg problem, but
there are also precompiled versions of gcc available for
most operating systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://gcc.gnu.org/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl <br>
Large parts of the MRTG system are written in the Perl
scripting language. Make sure there is a recent copy of perl
on your machine (try perl -v). At least version 5.005 is
<br>
required for mrtg to work well. If you use SNMPV3 and other
new features you should use at least 5.8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can get the latest perl
from</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.perl.com/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MRTG generates traffic graphs in
the PNG format. To be able to do this it needs several 3rd
party libraries. When compiling these libraries I urge you
to make sure you compile <br>
them as static libraries. There is just much less trouble
ahead if you are doing it like this. See the Instructions in
the next section for inspiration. Note that many free <br>
unices have all the required libraries already in place so
there is no need to install another copy. To check it is
best to skip all the library instructions below and go <br>
straight into the mrtg compile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the first attempt fails and
you do not get a working version of mrtg, try compiling new
copies of all libraries as explained below. Do this BEFORE
you send email to me about <br>
problems compiling mrtg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gd This is a basic graph drawing
library created by Thomas Boutell. Note that all releases
after Version 1.3 only create PNG images. This is because a)
Thomas got into trouble <br>
because the GIF format which it used to produce uses a
compression technology patented by Unisys. b) PNG is more
efficient and patent free. MRTG can work with old and new
<br>
version of the GD library. You can get a recent copy of GD
from:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.boutell.com/gd/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">libpng <br>
Is required by gd in order to produce PNG graphics files.
Get it from:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zlib <br>
Is needed by libpng to compress the graphics files you
create. Get a copy from</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.gzip.org/zlib</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And last but not least you also
need mrtg itself. In case you have not yet downloaded it,
you can find a copy on my website:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/pub</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIBRARY COMPILATION <br>
In this section I will give you step by step instructions on
how to compile the various libraries required for the
compilation of mrtg. Note that these libraries may already
be <br>
installed if you have a *BSD or Linux system so you can skip
recompiling them. The wget program used below is a simple
web downloader. You can also enter the address into your
<br>
netscape if you don&rsquo;t have wget available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First let&rsquo;s create a
directory for the compilation. Note that this may already
exist on your system. No problem, just use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mkdir -p /usr/local/src <br>
cd /usr/local/src</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not have zlib
installed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget
http://www.zlib.net/zlib-1.2.3.tar.gz <br>
gunzip -c zlib-*.tar.gz | tar xf - <br>
rm zlib-*.tar.gz <br>
mv zlib-* zlib <br>
cd zlib <br>
./configure <br>
make <br>
cd ..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t have libpng
installed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget
ftp://ftp.simplesystems.org/pub/libpng/png/src/libpng-1.2.40.tar.gz
<br>
gunzip -c libpng-1.2.34.tar.gz | tar xf - <br>
mv libpng-* libpng <br>
cd libpng <br>
env CFLAGS=&quot;-O3 -fPIC&quot; ./configure
--prefix=$INSTALL_DIR <br>
make <br>
rm *.so.* *.so <br>
cd ..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And now you can compile gd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For versions up to 1.8.4,
try:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget
http://www.boutell.com/gd/http/gd-1.8.4.tar.gz <br>
gunzip -c gd-*.tar.gz |tar xf - <br>
rm gd-*.tar.gz <br>
mv gd-* gd <br>
cd gd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &nbsp;characters at the end
of the following lines mean that all the following material
should actually be written on a single line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -i~ -p -e s/gd_jpeg.o//g
Makefile <br>
make INCLUDEDIRS=&quot;-I. -I../zlib -I../libpng&quot;
LIBDIRS=&quot;-L../zlib -L. -L../libpng&quot;
LIBS=&quot;-lgd -lpng -lz -lm&quot; CFLAGS=&quot;-O
-DHAVE_LIBPNG&quot; <br>
cd ..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For versions starting around
2.0.11, try:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wget
http://www.boutell.com/gd/http/gd-2.0.33.tar.gz <br>
gunzip -c gd-2.0.33.tar.gz |tar xf - <br>
mv gd-2.0.33 gd <br>
cd gd <br>
env CPPFLAGS=&quot;-I../zlib -I../libpng&quot;
LDFLAGS=&quot;-L../zlib -L../libpng&quot; ./configure
--disable-shared --without-freetype --without-jpeg <br>
make <br>
cp .libs/* .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MRTG COMPILATION <br>
Ok, now everything is ready for the mrtg compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd /usr/local/src <br>
gunzip -c mrtg-2.17.4.tar.gz | tar xvf - <br>
cd mrtg-2.17.4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If all the libraries have been
preinstalled on your system you can configure mrtg by doing
a simple:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./configure
--prefix=/usr/local/mrtg-2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise you may have to give
some hints on where to find the various libraries required
to compile mrtg:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./configure
--prefix=/usr/local/mrtg-2 --with-gd=/usr/local/src/gd
--with-z=/usr/local/src/zlib
--with-png=/usr/local/src/libpng</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have RRDtool available
you might want to tell mrtg about it so that you can opt to
use rrdtool with mrtg. Check mrtg-rrd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configure will make sure your
environment is fit for building mrtg. If it finds a problem,
it will tell you so and it will also tell you what to do
about it. If everything is <br>
OK, you will end up with a custom Makefile for your system.
Now type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">make</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This builds the rateup binary
and edits all the perl pathnames in the scripts. You can now
install mrtg by typing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">make install (requires gnu
install)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the software required by
MRTG is now installed under the /usr/local/mrtg-2
subdirectory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can now safely delete the
libraries we compiled above. Then again, you might want to
keep them around so that you have them available when
compiling the next version of mrtg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
The next step is to configure mrtg for monitoring a network
device. This is done by creating an mrtg.cfg file which
defines what you want to monitor. Luckily, you don&rsquo;t
have to <br>
dive straight in and start writing your own configuration
file all by yourself. Together with mrtg you also got a copy
of cfgmaker. This is a script you can point at a router of
<br>
your choice; it will create a mrtg configuration file for
you. You can find the script in the bin subdirectory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cfgmaker --global
&rsquo;WorkDir: /home/httpd/mrtg&rsquo; --global
&rsquo;Options[_]: bits,growright&rsquo; --output
/home/mrtg/cfg/mrtg.cfg community@router.abc.xyz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example above will create
an mrtg config file in /home/mrtg/cfg assuming this is a
directory visible on your webserver. You can read all about
cfgmaker in cfgmaker. One area <br>
you might want to look at is the possibility of using
--ifref=ip to prevent interface renumbering troubles from
catching you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to start rolling
your own mrtg configuration files, make sure you read
mrtg-reference to learn all about the possible configuration
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNNING MRTG <br>
Once you have created a configuration file, try the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/local/mrtg-2/bin/mrtg
/home/mrtg/cfg/mrtg.cfg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will query your router and
also create your first mrtg trafic graphs and webpages. When
you run mrtg for the first time there will be a lot of
complaints about missing log <br>
files. Don&rsquo;t worry, this is normal for the first 2
times you start mrtg. If it keeps complaining after this
time you might want to look into the problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting mrtg by hand is not
ideal in the long run. So when you are satisfied with the
results you can automate the process of running mrtg in
regular intervals (this means every <br>
5 minutes by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can either add mrtg to your
crontab with a line like this:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55
* * * * &lt;mrtg-bin&gt;/mrtg &lt;path to
mrtg-cfg&gt;/mrtg.cfg --logging /var/log/mrtg.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or if you live in Linux Land the
line may look like this if you are using &quot;crontab
-e&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*/5 * * * *
&lt;mrtg-bin&gt;/mrtg &lt;path to mrtg-cfg&gt;/mrtg.cfg
--logging /var/log/mrtg.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or like this if you use
/etc/crontab</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*/5 * * * * mrtg-user
&lt;mrtg-bin&gt;/mrtg &lt;path to mrtg-cfg&gt;/mrtg.cfg
--logging /var/log/mrtg.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also run mrtg as a
daemon process by adding the line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RunAsDaemon: Yes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to your mrtg configuration file
and then creating a startup script in your system startup
sequence. Unfortunately, adding startup scripts differs
widely amongst different unix <br>
systems. The modern ones normally have a directory called
/etc/init.d or /etc/rc.d/init.d where you put scripts which
starts the process you want to run when the system boots.
<br>
Further you must create a symbolic link in /etc/rc3.d or
/etc/rc.d/rc?.d called S65mrtg (this is just a sample name
... it is just important that it starts with S followed by a
<br>
two digit number). If you are not sure about this, make sure
you consult the documentation of your system to make sure
you get this right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A minimal script to put into
init.d might look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#! /bin/sh <br>
cd /usr/local/mrtg-2.17.4/bin &amp;&amp; ./mrtg
--user=mrtg-user /home/httpd/mrtg/mrtg.cfg --logging
/var/log/mrtg.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this will only work
with RunAsDaemon: Yes in your mrtg.cfg file.</p>
