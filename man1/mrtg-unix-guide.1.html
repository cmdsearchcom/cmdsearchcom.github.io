mrtg-unix-guide - The MRTG 2.17.4 Linux/Unix Installation Guide
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
MRTG comes to you in Source Code. This means that you have to compile parts of
  it before you can use it on a Unix machine. These instructions help you to do
  so.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PREPARATION"><a class="selflink" href="#PREPARATION">PREPARATION</a></h1>
In order to compile and use mrtg you need a C compiler and a copy of perl
  installed on your machine. In most cases this will already be available. In
  case it is not, here are some starting points. Below I'll give you a detailed
  run through the whole compilation process.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">GCC</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The GNU C compiler comes preinstalled on most of the free
      Unicies out there. For commercial derivatives you may have to download and
      compile it first. If you have no compiler at all there is a chicken and
      egg problem, but there are also precompiled versions of gcc available for
      most operating systems.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
 http://gcc.gnu.org/
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Perl</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Large parts of the MRTG system are written in the Perl
      scripting language. Make sure there is a recent copy of perl on your
      machine (try perl -v). At least version 5.005 is required for mrtg to work
      well. If you use SNMPV3 and other new features you should use at least
      5.8.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You can get the latest perl from
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

<div class="Pp"></div>
MRTG generates traffic graphs in the PNG format. To be able to do this it needs
  several 3rd party libraries. When compiling these libraries I urge you to make
  sure you compile them as <b>static</b> libraries. There is just much less
  trouble ahead if you are doing it like this. See the Instructions in the next
  section for inspiration. Note that many free unices have all the required
  libraries already in place so there is no need to install another copy. To
  check it is best to skip all the library instructions below and go straight
  into the mrtg compile.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the first attempt fails and you do not get a working version of mrtg, try
  compiling new copies of all libraries as explained below. Do this
  <b>BEFORE</b> you send email to me about problems compiling mrtg.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">gd</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is a basic graph drawing library created by Thomas
      Boutell. Note that all releases after Version 1.3 only create PNG images.
      This is because a) Thomas got into trouble because the GIF format which it
      used to produce uses a compression technology patented by Unisys. b) PNG
      is more efficient and patent free. MRTG can work with old and new version
      of the GD library. You can get a recent copy of GD from:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

<div class="Pp"></div>
And last but not least you also need mrtg itself. In case you have not yet
  downloaded it, you can find a copy on my website:
<div class="Pp"></div>

</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LIBRARY_COMPILATION"><a class="selflink" href="#LIBRARY_COMPILATION">LIBRARY
  COMPILATION</a></h1>
In this section I will give you step by step instructions on how to compile the
  various libraries required for the compilation of mrtg. Note that these
  libraries may already be installed if you have a <i>*BSD</i> or <i>Linux</i>
  system so you can skip recompiling them. The <b>wget</b> program used below is
  a simple web downloader. You can also enter the address into your
  <b>netscape</b> if you don't have <b>wget</b> available.
<div class="Pp"></div>
First let's create a directory for the compilation. Note that this may already
  exist on your system. No problem, just use it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 mkdir -p /usr/local/src
 cd /usr/local/src
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you do not have zlib installed:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 wget http://www.zlib.net/zlib-1.2.3.tar.gz
 gunzip -c zlib-*.tar.gz | tar xf -
 rm zlib-*.tar.gz
 mv zlib-* zlib
 cd zlib
 ./configure
 make
 cd ..
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you don't have libpng installed
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 wget ftp://ftp.simplesystems.org/pub/libpng/png/src/libpng-1.2.40.tar.gz
 gunzip -c libpng-1.2.34.tar.gz | tar xf -
 mv libpng-* libpng
 cd libpng
 env CFLAGS=&quot;-O3 -fPIC&quot; ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR 
 make
 rm *.so.* *.so
 cd ..
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And now you can compile gd
<div class="Pp"></div>
For versions up to 1.8.4, try:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 wget http://www.boutell.com/gd/http/gd-1.8.4.tar.gz
 gunzip -c gd-*.tar.gz |tar xf -
 rm gd-*.tar.gz
 mv gd-* gd
 cd gd
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The \ characters at the end of the following lines mean that all the following
  material should actually be written on a single line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 perl -i~ -p -e s/gd_jpeg.o//g Makefile            
 make INCLUDEDIRS=&quot;-I. -I../zlib -I../libpng&quot; \
      LIBDIRS=&quot;-L../zlib -L. -L../libpng&quot; \
      LIBS=&quot;-lgd -lpng -lz -lm&quot; \
      CFLAGS=&quot;-O -DHAVE_LIBPNG&quot;
 cd ..
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For versions starting around 2.0.11, try:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 wget http://www.boutell.com/gd/http/gd-2.0.33.tar.gz
 gunzip -c gd-2.0.33.tar.gz |tar xf -
 mv gd-2.0.33 gd
 cd gd
 env CPPFLAGS=&quot;-I../zlib -I../libpng&quot; LDFLAGS=&quot;-L../zlib -L../libpng&quot; \
     ./configure --disable-shared --without-freetype --without-jpeg
 make
 cp .libs/* .
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MRTG_COMPILATION"><a class="selflink" href="#MRTG_COMPILATION">MRTG
  COMPILATION</a></h1>
Ok, now everything is ready for the mrtg compilation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 cd /usr/local/src
 gunzip -c mrtg-2.17.4.tar.gz | tar xvf -
 cd mrtg-2.17.4
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If all the libraries have been preinstalled on your system you can configure
  mrtg by doing a simple:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mrtg-2
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Otherwise you may have to give some hints on where to find the various libraries
  required to compile mrtg:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mrtg-2       \
             --with-gd=/usr/local/src/gd      \
             --with-z=/usr/local/src/zlib     \
             --with-png=/usr/local/src/libpng
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have RRDtool available you might want to tell mrtg about it so that you
  can opt to use rrdtool with mrtg. Check mrtg-rrd.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Configure will make sure your environment is fit for building mrtg. If it finds
  a problem, it will tell you so and it will also tell you what to do about it.
  If everything is OK, you will end up with a custom Makefile for your system.
  Now type:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 make
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This builds the rateup binary and edits all the perl pathnames in the scripts.
  You can now install mrtg by typing
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 make install   (requires gnu install)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
All the software required by MRTG is now installed under the
  <i>/usr/local/mrtg-2</i> subdirectory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can now safely delete the libraries we compiled above. Then again, you might
  want to keep them around so that you have them available when compiling the
  next version of mrtg.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
The next step is to configure mrtg for monitoring a network device. This is done
  by creating an <i>mrtg.cfg</i> file which defines what you want to monitor.
  Luckily, you don't have to dive straight in and start writing your own
  configuration file all by yourself. Together with mrtg you also got a copy of
  <b>cfgmaker</b>. This is a script you can point at a router of your choice; it
  will create a mrtg configuration file for you. You can find the script in the
  <i>bin</i> subdirectory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 cfgmaker --global 'WorkDir: /home/httpd/mrtg'  \
          --global 'Options[_]: bits,growright' \
          --output /home/mrtg/cfg/mrtg.cfg    \
           community@router.abc.xyz
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This example above will create an mrtg config file in <i>/home/mrtg/cfg</i>
  assuming this is a directory visible on your webserver. You can read all about
  cfgmaker in cfgmaker. One area you might want to look at is the possibility of
  using <b>--ifref=ip</b> to prevent interface renumbering troubles from
  catching you.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to start rolling your own mrtg configuration files, make sure you
  read mrtg-reference to learn all about the possible configuration options.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RUNNING_MRTG"><a class="selflink" href="#RUNNING_MRTG">RUNNING
  MRTG</a></h1>
Once you have created a configuration file, try the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 /usr/local/mrtg-2/bin/mrtg /home/mrtg/cfg/mrtg.cfg
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will query your router and also create your first mrtg trafic graphs and
  webpages. When you run mrtg for the first time there will be a lot of
  complaints about missing log files. Don't worry, this is normal for the first
  2 times you start mrtg. If it keeps complaining after this time you might want
  to look into the problem.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Starting mrtg by hand is not ideal in the long run. So when you are satisfied
  with the results you can automate the process of running mrtg in regular
  intervals (this means every 5 minutes by default).
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can either add mrtg to your crontab with a line like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * \
       &lt;mrtg-bin&gt;/mrtg &lt;path to mrtg-cfg&gt;/mrtg.cfg \
                --logging /var/log/mrtg.log
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or if you live in Linux Land the line may look like this if you are using
  &quot;crontab -e&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 */5 * * * *  &lt;mrtg-bin&gt;/mrtg &lt;path to mrtg-cfg&gt;/mrtg.cfg \
                       --logging /var/log/mrtg.log
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or like this if you use <i>/etc/crontab</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 */5 * * * *  mrtg-user  &lt;mrtg-bin&gt;/mrtg &lt;path to mrtg-cfg&gt;/mrtg.cfg \
                                 --logging /var/log/mrtg.log
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also run mrtg as a daemon process by adding the line
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 RunAsDaemon: Yes
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
to your mrtg configuration file and then creating a startup script in your
  system startup sequence. Unfortunately, adding startup scripts differs widely
  amongst different unix systems. The modern ones normally have a directory
  called <i>/etc/init.d</i> or <i>/etc/rc.d/init.d</i> where you put scripts
  which starts the process you want to run when the system boots. Further you
  must create a symbolic link in <i>/etc/rc3.d</i> or <i>/etc/rc.d/rc?.d</i>
  called <i>S65mrtg</i> (this is just a sample name ... it is just important
  that it starts with S followed by a two digit number). If you are not sure
  about this, make sure you consult the documentation of your system to make
  sure you get this right.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A <b>minimal</b> script to put into <i>init.d</i> might look like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 #! /bin/sh
 cd /usr/local/mrtg-2.17.4/bin &amp;&amp; ./mrtg --user=mrtg-user \
       /home/httpd/mrtg/mrtg.cfg  --logging /var/log/mrtg.log
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that this will only work with <b>RunAsDaemon: Yes</b> in your mrtg.cfg
  file.
