<p>GIT-FAST-EXPORT(1) Git Manual GIT-FAST-EXPORT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-fast-export - Git data exporter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git fast-export [options] | git fast-import</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program dumps the given revisions in a form suitable to
be piped into git fast-import.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use it as a
human-readable bundle replacement (see git-bundle(1)), or as
a kind of an interactive git filter-branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--progress=&lt;n&gt; <br>
Insert progress statements every &lt;n&gt; objects, to be
shown by git fast-import during import.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--signed-tags=(verbatim|warn|warn-strip|strip|abort)
<br>
Specify how to handle signed tags. Since any transformation
after the export can change the tag names (which can also
happen when excluding revisions) the signatures will not
<br>
match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When asking to abort (which is
the default), this program will die when encountering a
signed tag. With strip, the tags will silently be made
unsigned, with warn-strip they <br>
will be made unsigned but a warning will be displayed, with
verbatim, they will be silently exported and with warn, they
will be exported, but you will see a warning.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tag-of-filtered-object=(abort|drop|rewrite)
<br>
Specify how to handle tags whose tagged object is filtered
out. Since revisions and files to export can be limited by
path, tagged objects may be filtered completely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When asking to abort (which is
the default), this program will die when encountering such a
tag. With drop it will omit such tags from the output. With
rewrite, if the tagged <br>
object is a commit, it will rewrite the tag to tag an
ancestor commit (via parent rewriting; see
git-rev-list(1))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, -C <br>
Perform move and/or copy detection, as described in the
git-diff(1) manual page, and use it to generate rename and
copy commands in the output dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that earlier versions of
this command did not complain and produced incorrect results
if you gave these options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--export-marks=&lt;file&gt; <br>
Dumps the internal marks table to &lt;file&gt; when
complete. Marks are written one per line as :markid SHA-1.
Only marks for revisions are dumped; marks for blobs are
ignored. <br>
Backends can use this file to validate imports after they
have been completed, or to save the marks table across
incremental runs. As &lt;file&gt; is only opened and
truncated at <br>
completion, the same path can also be safely given to
--import-marks. The file will not be written if no new
object has been marked/exported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--import-marks=&lt;file&gt; <br>
Before processing any input, load the marks specified in
&lt;file&gt;. The input file must exist, must be readable,
and must use the same format as produced by
--export-marks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any commits that have already
been marked will not be exported again. If the backend uses
a similar --import-marks file, this allows for incremental
bidirectional exporting <br>
of the repository by keeping the marks the same across
runs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fake-missing-tagger <br>
Some old repositories have tags without a tagger. The
fast-import protocol was pretty strict about that, and did
not allow that. So fake a tagger to be able to fast-import
<br>
the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-done-feature <br>
Start the stream with a feature done stanza, and terminate
it with a done command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-data <br>
Skip output of blob objects and instead refer to blobs via
their original SHA-1 hash. This is useful when rewriting the
directory structure or history of a repository without <br>
touching the contents of individual files. Note that the
resulting stream can only be used by a repository which
already contains the necessary objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--full-tree <br>
This option will cause fast-export to issue a
&quot;deleteall&quot; directive for each commit followed by
a full list of all files in the commit (as opposed to just
listing the files <br>
which are different from the commit&acirc;s first
parent).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[&lt;git-rev-list-args&gt;...]
<br>
A list of arguments, acceptable to git rev-parse and git
rev-list, that specifies the specific objects and references
to export. For example, master~10..master causes the <br>
current master reference to be exported along with all
objects added since its 10th ancestor commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
$ git fast-export --all | (cd /empty/repository &amp;&amp;
git fast-import)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will export the whole
repository and import it into the existing empty repository.
Except for reencoding commits that are not in UTF-8, it
would be a one-to-one mirror.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git fast-export
master~5..master | <br>
sed &quot;s|refs/heads/master|refs/heads/other|&quot; | <br>
git fast-import</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This makes a new branch called
other from master~5..master (i.e. if master has linear
history, it will take the last 5 commits).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this assumes that none
of the blobs and commit messages referenced by that revision
range contains the string refs/heads/master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
Since git fast-import cannot tag trees, you will not be able
to export the linux-2.6.git repository completely, as it
contains a tag referencing a tree instead of a commit.</p>
