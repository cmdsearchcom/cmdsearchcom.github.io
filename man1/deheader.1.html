<p>DEHEADER(1) Development Tools DEHEADER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
deheader - report which includes in C or C++ compiles can be
removed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
deheader [-h] [-m command] [-b builddir] [-i pattern] [-q]
[-r] [-v] [-x pattern] [-V] [file-or-dir]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This tool takes a list of C or C++ sourcefiles and generates
a report on which #includes can be omitted from them; also,
what standard inclusions may be required for portability.
<br>
The test, for each foo.c or foo.cc or foo.cpp, is simply
whether &quot;rm foo.o; make foo.o&quot; returns a zero
status (but the build command may be overridden).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exception: Under cmake, foo.o is
a phoney target. Therefore, when a &quot;CMakeList.txt&quot;
is detected, &quot;make clean&quot; is done rather than
&quot;rm foo.o&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optionally, with the -r switch,
the unneeded headers are removed from the sourcefiles.
Don&rsquo;t use this option unless you have your sourcefiles
safely under version control and can <br>
revert!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a sourcefile argument is a
directory, the report is generated on all source files
beneath it. Subdirectories beginning with a dot are assumed
to be repository directories for <br>
version-control systems and ignored. If no arguments are
given, the program runs as if the name of the current
directory had been passed to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inclusions within the scope of
#if/#ifdef/#else/#endif directives are left alone, because
trying to reason about potential combinations of -D and U
options would be too <br>
complicated and prone to weird errors. One exception:
headers protected only by S_SPLINT_S, the conditional for
blocking scanning by the static analysis tool splint(1), are
<br>
scanned normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tool will also emit warnings
about duplicate inclusions, and inclusions required for
portability but not present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is recommended that you
arrange to compile with options that will stop the compiler
on warnings when using this tool; otherwise it will report
headers that only declare <br>
prototypes and return types (and thus throw only warnings)
as being not required. Under gcc the compiler options to
accomplish this are -Werror -Wfatal-errors. If your makefile
<br>
follows normal conventions, running with -m &quot;make
CFLAGS=&rsquo;-Werror -Wfatal-errors&rsquo;&quot; may do the
right thing; you can check this by running with -v -v -v to
see what compilation <br>
commands are actually emitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On each test compile, the
original sourcefile is moved to a name with an .orig suffix
and restored on interrupt or after processing with its
original timestamp, unless the -r <br>
option was given and headers removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -b option is given, it
tells the program that generated .o files live in a file
tree parallel to the source tree but rooted at the specified
argument. If the argument is a <br>
relative path, it is interpreted relative to the directory
in which deaheader is run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the first test compilation
from the top-level directory fails, deheader descends into
the subdirectory of the source file and retries compiling
inside there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At verbosity level 0, only
messages indicating removable headers are issued. At
verbosity 1, test compilations are timed and progess
indicated with a twirling-baton prompt. At <br>
verbosity level 2, you get verbose progress messages on the
analysis. At verbosity level 3, you see the output from the
make and compilation commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -q (--quiet) option flag
was not set, the last line of the output will be a
statistical summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running deheader will leave a
lot of binaries in your directory that were compiled in ways
possibly not invoked by your normal build process. Running
&quot;make clean&quot; afterwards (or <br>
the equivalent under whatever build system you are using) is
strongly recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h <br>
Display some help and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m <br>
Set the build command used for test compiles. Defaults to
&rsquo;make&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b <br>
Set the build directory for object files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i <br>
Set a pattern for includes to be ignored. Takes a Python
regular expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q <br>
Suppress statistical summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r <br>
Remove header inclusions from sourcefiles where they are not
required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
Set verbosity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x <br>
Exclude files with names matching the specified Python
regexp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
Show version of program and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
Returns 1 if unneeded includes were found, 0 otherwise.
Thus, you can use it for pre-release sanity checking in
Makefile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Very rarely, test-compiling after running with -r may show
that this tool removed some headers that are actually
required for your build. This can happen because deheader
doesn&rsquo;t <br>
know about all the strange things your build system gets up
to, and the problem of analyzing your build to understand
them would be Turing-complete. Simply revert the altered
<br>
files and continue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to minor variations in
system headers, it is possible your program may not port
correctly to other Unix variants after being deheadered.
This is normally not a problem with <br>
the portion of the API specified by POSIX and ANSI C, but
may be for headers that are not standardized or only weakly
standardized. The sockets API (sys/select.h, sys/sockets.h,
<br>
and friends such as sys/types.h and sys.stat.h) is perhaps
the most serious trouble spot. deheader has an internal
table of rules that heads off the most common problems by
<br>
suppressing deletion of headers that are required for
portability, but your mileage may vary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The depenedency scanner does not
ignore the text of comments. This, e.g, a reference to
&quot;log10&quot; in a comment will produce a spurious
warning that &lt;math.h&gt; is required for <br>
portability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sufficiently perverse C++ can
silently invalidate the brute-force algorithm this tool
uses. Example: if an overloaded function has different
overloads from two different files, <br>
removing one may expose the other, changing runtime
semantics without a compile-time warning. Similarly,
removing a later file containing a template specialization
may lead to <br>
undefined behavior from a template defined in an earlier
file. Use this with caution near such features, and test
carefully.</p>
