This tool takes a list of C or C++ sourcefiles and generates a report on which
  #includes can be omitted from them; also, what standard inclusions may be
  required for portability. The test, for each foo.c or foo.cc or foo.cpp, is
  simply whether &quot;rm foo.o; make foo.o&quot; returns a zero status (but the
  build command may be overridden).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Exception: Under cmake, foo.o is a phoney target. Therefore, when a
  &quot;CMakeList.txt&quot; is detected, &quot;make clean&quot; is done rather
  than &quot;rm foo.o&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Optionally, with the <b>-r</b> switch, the unneeded headers are removed from the
  sourcefiles. Don't use this option unless you have your sourcefiles safely
  under version control and can revert!
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a sourcefile argument is a directory, the report is generated on all source
  files beneath it. Subdirectories beginning with a dot are assumed to be
  repository directories for version-control systems and ignored. If no
  arguments are given, the program runs as if the name of the current directory
  had been passed to it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Inclusions within the scope of #if/#ifdef/#else/#endif directives are left
  alone, because trying to reason about potential combinations of -D and U
  options would be too complicated and prone to weird errors. One exception:
  headers protected only by S_SPLINT_S, the conditional for blocking scanning by
  the static analysis tool <b>splint</b>(1), are scanned normally.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The tool will also emit warnings about duplicate inclusions, and inclusions
  required for portability but not present.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is recommended that you arrange to compile with options that will stop the
  compiler on warnings when using this tool; otherwise it will report headers
  that only declare prototypes and return types (and thus throw only warnings)
  as being not required. Under gcc the compiler options to accomplish this are
  -Werror -Wfatal-errors. If your makefile follows normal conventions, running
  with <b>-m &quot;make CFLAGS='-Werror -Wfatal-errors'&quot; </b> may do the
  right thing; you can check this by running with -v -v -v to see what
  compilation commands are actually emitted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On each test compile, the original sourcefile is moved to a name with an .orig
  suffix and restored on interrupt or after processing with its original
  timestamp, unless the <b>-r</b> option was given and headers removed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the -b option is given, it tells the program that generated .o files live in
  a file tree parallel to the source tree but rooted at the specified argument.
  If the argument is a relative path, it is interpreted relative to the
  directory in which deaheader is run.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the first test compilation from the top-level directory fails, deheader
  descends into the subdirectory of the source file and retries compiling inside
  there.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At verbosity level 0, only messages indicating removable headers are issued. At
  verbosity 1, test compilations are timed and progess indicated with a
  twirling-baton prompt. At verbosity level 2, you get verbose progress messages
  on the analysis. At verbosity level 3, you see the output from the make and
  compilation commands.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the -q (--quiet) option flag was not set, the last line of the output will be
  a statistical summary.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Running deheader will leave a lot of binaries in your directory that were
  compiled in ways possibly not invoked by your normal build process. Running
  &quot;make clean&quot; afterwards (or the equivalent under whatever build
  system you are using) is strongly recommended.

Returns 1 if unneeded includes were found, 0 otherwise. Thus, you can use it for
  pre-release sanity checking in Makefile.

Very rarely, test-compiling after running with <b>-r</b> may show that this tool
  removed some headers that are actually required for your build. This can
  happen because <b>deheader</b> doesn't know about all the strange things your
  build system gets up to, and the problem of analyzing your build to understand
  them would be Turing-complete. Simply revert the altered files and continue.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Due to minor variations in system headers, it is possible your program may not
  port correctly to other Unix variants after being deheadered. This is normally
  not a problem with the portion of the API specified by POSIX and ANSI C, but
  may be for headers that are not standardized or only weakly standardized. The
  sockets API (sys/select.h, sys/sockets.h, and friends such as sys/types.h and
  sys.stat.h) is perhaps the most serious trouble spot. <b>deheader</b> has an
  internal table of rules that heads off the most common problems by suppressing
  deletion of headers that are required for portability, but your mileage may
  vary.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The depenedency scanner does not ignore the text of comments. This, e.g, a
  reference to &quot;log10&quot; in a comment will produce a spurious warning
  that &lt;math.h&gt; is required for portability.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sufficiently perverse C++ can silently invalidate the brute-force algorithm this
  tool uses. Example: if an overloaded function has different overloads from two
  different files, removing one may expose the other, changing runtime semantics
  without a compile-time warning. Similarly, removing a later file containing a
  template specialization may lead to undefined behavior from a template defined
  in an earlier file. Use this with caution near such features, and test
  carefully.
