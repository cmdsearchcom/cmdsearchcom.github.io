wiggle - apply rejected patches and perform word-wise diffs
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>wiggle</b><i> [function] [options] file [files]</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The main function of <i>wiggle</i> is to apply a patch to a file in a similar
  manner to the <b>patch</b>(1) program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The distinctive difference of <i>wiggle</i> is that it will attempt to apply a
  patch even if the &quot;before&quot; part of the patch doesn't match the
  target file perfectly. This is achieved by breaking the file and patch into
  words and finding the best alignment of words in the file with words in the
  patch. Once this alignment has been found, any differences (word-wise) in the
  patch are applied to the file as best as possible.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Also, <i>wiggle</i> will (in some cases) detect changes that have already been
  applied, and will ignore them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>wiggle</i> ensures that every change in the patch is applied to the target
  file somehow. If a particular change cannot be made in the file, the file is
  annotated to show where the change should be made in a similar way to the
  <b>merge</b>(1) program with the <b>-A</b> option. Each annotation contains 3
  components: a portion of the original file where the change should be applied,
  a portion of the patch that couldn't be matched precisely in the file, and the
  text that should replace that portion of the patch. These are separated by
  lines containing precisely 7 identical characters, either '&lt;', '|', '=', or
  '&gt;', possibly followed by a descriptive word. So
<br/>
<pre>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; found
Some portion of the original file
||||||| expected
text to replace
=======
text to replace it with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; replacement
</pre>
<br/>
indicates that &quot;text to replace&quot; should be replaced by &quot;text to
  replace it with&quot; somewhere in the portion of the original file. However
  <i>wiggle</i> was not able to find a place to make this change.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>wiggle</i> can also produce conflict reports showing only the words that are
  involved rather than showing whole lines. In this case the output looks like:
  &lt;&lt;&lt;---original|||old===new---&gt;&gt;&gt;
<div class="Pp"></div>
One possible usage of <i>wiggle</i> is to run <i>patch</i> to apply some patch,
  and to collect a list of rejects by monitoring the error messages from patch.
  Then for each file for which a reject was found, run wiggle --replace
  originalfile originalfile.rej
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally each file must be examined to resolve any unresolved conflicts, and to
  make sure the applied patch is semantically correct.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Alternately, the original patch file can be fed to the <b>browse</b> mode as
  wiggle -B &lt; patchfile
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will allow the changes and conflicts to be inspected and, to some extent,
  modified; and then the results can be saved.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h2>
The following options are understood by <i>wiggle</i>. Some of these are
  explained in more detail in the following sections on MERGE, DIFF, EXTRACT,
  and BROWSE.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-m</b>, <b>--merge</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Select the &quot;merge&quot; function. This is the default
      function.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d</b>, <b>--diff</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Select the &quot;diff&quot; function. This displays the
      differences between files. This can be given after <b>--browse</b> (see
      below) in which case a patch or diff of two files can be viewed without
      the originals.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-x</b>, <b>--extract</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Select the &quot;extract&quot; function. This extracts one
      branch of a patch or merge file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-B</b>, <b>--browse</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Select the &quot;browse&quot; function. This is similar to
      &quot;merge&quot; (or &quot;diff&quot;) only with a different
      presentation. Instead of the result simply being sent to standard output,
      it is presented using an ncurses-based GUI so that each hunk of the patch
      can be examined to understand what conflicts where involved and what
      needed to be ignored in order of the patch to be wiggled in to place.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-w</b>, <b>--words</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Request that all operations and display be word based. This
      is the default for the &quot;diff&quot; function.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-l</b>, <b>--lines</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Request that all operations and display be line based.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-b</b>, <b>--ignore-blanks</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">De-emphasise white space (space, tab, and newline) is
      determining differences and changes.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally white space is treated like a word which can be matched or changed by a
  patch. When this flag is in force, white space serves only as a separator
  between other words and is not matched itself. The effect of this is that
  changes in the amount of white space are not treated as significant.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To be precise, any white space is combined with the preceeding word or, in the
  case of leading space on a line, with the following word. However it is not
  involved in any comparisons of that word. If a patch deletes a word, the
  attached white space is deleted as well. If a patch adds a word, the attached
  white space is added as well.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An empty line, or one that contains only blanks, will be treated as a single
  word that will match any other blank line, no matter how many spaces it has.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-b</b> has no effect in <b>--line</b> mode.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-p</b>, <b>--patch</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Treat the last named file as a patch instead of a file
      (with --diff) or a merge (--extract). In <i>merge</i> or <b>browse</b>
      mode, <b>-p</b> requires there be exactly one file which is a patch and
      which can contain patches to multiple files. The patches are merged into
      each file. When used in <i>merge</i> mode, this usage requires the
      <b>--replace</b> option as writing lots of merged files to standard-out is
      impractical.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
When processing a multi-file patch, <b>-p</b> can be followed by a numeric
  argument indicating how many file name components should be stripped from
  files named in the patch file. If no numeric argument is given, <i>wiggle</i>
  will deduce an appropriate number based what files are present in the
  filesystem.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-r</b>, <b>--replace</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Normally the merged output is written to standard-output.
      With <b>--replace</b>, the original file is replaced with the merge
      output. In <b>browse</b> mode, this instructs <i>wiggle</i> to always save
      the resulting merge when exiting.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-o</b>, <b>--output=</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Rather than writing the result to stdout or to replace the
      original file, this requests that the output be written to the given file.
      This is only meaningful with <b>--merge</b> or <b>--browse</b> when given
      a single merge to browse.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-i</b>, <b>--no-ignore</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Normally wiggle will ignore changes in the patch which

  <dd class="It-tag">When used with <b>--merge</b>, conflicts that can be

      in. This can be useful when <i>wiggle</i> is used for automatic merges as
      with <i>git</i>. If any wiggles happen, <i>git</i> will report the

</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="WORDS"><a class="selflink" href="#WORDS">WORDS</a></h2>
<i>wiggle</i> can divide a text into lines or words when performing it's tasks.
  A line is simply a string of characters terminated by a newline. A word is
  either a maximal contiguous string of alphanumerics (including underscore), a
  maximal contiguous string of space or tab characters, or any other single
  character.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="MERGE"><a class="selflink" href="#MERGE">MERGE</a></h2>
The merge function modifies a given text by finding all changes between two
  other texts and imposing those changes on the given text.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally <i>wiggle</i> focuses on which words have changed so as to maximise the
  possibility of finding a good match in the given text for the context of a
  given change. However it can consider only whole lines instead.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>wiggle</i> extracts the three texts that it needs from files listed on the
  command line. Either 1, 2, or 3 files may be listed, and any one of them may
  be a lone hyphen signifying standard-input.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If one file is given and the <b>-p</b> option is not present, the file is
  treated as a <b>merge</b> file, i.e. the output of &quot;merge -A&quot; or
  &quot;wiggle&quot;. Such a file implicitly contains three streams and these
  are extracted and compared.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If two files are given, then the first simply contains the primary text, and the
  second is treated as a patch file (the output of &quot;diff&#x00A0;-u&quot; or
  &quot;diff&#x00A0;-c&quot;, or a &quot;.rej&quot; file from <i>patch</i>) and
  the two other texts are extracted from that.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If one file is given together with the <b>-p</b> option, the file is treated as
  a patch file containing the names of the files that it patches. In this case
  multiple merge operations can happen and each takes one stream from a file
  named in the patch, and the other two from the patch itself. The
  <b>--replace</b> option is required and the results are written back to the
  target files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally if three files are listed, they are taken to contain the given text and
  the two other texts, in order.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally the result of the merge is written to standard-output. If the <b>-r</b>
  flag is given, the output is written to a file which replaces the original
  given file. In this case the original file is renamed to have a <b>.porig</b>
  suffix (for &quot;patched original&quot; which makes sense if you first use
  <i>patch</i> to apply a patch, and then use <i>wiggle</i> to wiggle the
  rejects in).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Further if the <b>-o</b> option is given with a file name, the output will be
  written to that file. In this case no backup is created.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If no errors occur (such as file access errors) <i>wiggle</i> will exit with a
  status of 0 if all changes were successfully merged, and with an exit status
  of 1 and a brief message if any changes could not be fully merged and were
  instead inserted as annotations. However if either <b>--report-wiggles</b> or
  <b>--show-wiggles</b> options were given, <i>wiggle</i> will also exist with
  status of 1 if any changes had to be wiggled in even though this was
  successful.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The merge function can operate in three different modes with respect to lines or
  words.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With the <b>--lines</b> option, whole lines are compared and any conflicts are
  reported as whole lines that need to be replaced.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With the <b>--words</b> option, individual words are compared and any conflicts
  are reported just covering the words affected. This uses the
  &lt;&lt;&lt;|||===&gt;&gt;&gt; conflict format.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Without either of these options, a hybrid approach is taken. Individual words
  are compared and merged, but when a conflict is found the whole surrounding
  line is reported as being in conflict.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>wiggle</i> will ensure that every change between the two other texts is
  reflected in the result of the merge somehow. There are four different ways
  that a change can be reflected.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If a change converts <b>A</b> to <b>B</b> and <b>A</b> is
      found at a suitable place in the original file, it is replaced with
      <b>B</b>. This includes the possibility that <b>B</b> is empty, but not
      that <b>A</b> is empty.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If a change is found which simply adds <b>B</b> and the
      text immediately preceding and following the insertion are found adjacent
      in the original file in a suitable place, then <b>B</b> is inserted
      between those adjacent texts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If a change is found which changes <b>A</b> to <b>B</b> and
      this appears (based on context) to align with <b>B</b> in the original,
      then it is assumed that this change has already been applied, and the
      change is ignored. When this happens, a message reflecting the number of
      ignored changes is printed by <i>wiggle</i>. This optimisation can be
      suppressed with the <b>-i</b> flag.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">4</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If a change is found that does not fit any of the above
      possibilities, then a conflict is reported as described earlier.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="DIFF"><a class="selflink" href="#DIFF">DIFF</a></h2>
The diff function is provided primarily to allow inspection of the alignments
  that <i>wiggle</i> calculated between texts and that it uses for performing a
  merge.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The output of the diff function is similar to the unified output of diff.
  However while diff does not output long stretches of common text,
  <i>wiggle</i>'s diff mode outputs everything.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When calculating a word-based alignment (the default), <i>wiggle</i> may need to
  show these word-based differences. This is done using an extension to the
  unified-diff format. If a line starts with a vertical bar, then it may contain
  sections surrounded by special multi-character brackets. The brackets
  &quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;++&quot; and &quot;++&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot; surround added text
  while &quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;--&quot; and &quot;--&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot; surround
  removed text.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>wiggle</i> can be given the two texts to compare in one of three ways.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If only one file is given, then it is treated as a patch and the two branches of
  that patch are compared. This effectively allows a patch to be refined from a
  line-based patch to a word-based patch.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If two files are given, then they are normally assumed to be simple texts to be
  compared.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If two files are given along with the --patch option, then the second file is
  assumed to be a patch and either the first (with -1) or the second (with -2)
  branch is extracted and compared with text found in the first file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This last option causes <i>wiggle</i> to apply a &quot;best-fit&quot; algorithm
  for aligning patch hunks with the file before computing the differences. This
  algorithm is used when merging a patch with a file, and its value can be seen
  by comparing the difference produced this way with the difference produced by
  first extracting one branch of a patch into a file, and then computing the
  difference of that file with the main file.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="EXTRACT"><a class="selflink" href="#EXTRACT">EXTRACT</a></h2>
The extract function of <i>wiggle</i> simply exposes the internal functionality
  for extracting one branch of a patch or a merge file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Precisely one file should be given, and it will be assumed to be a merge file
  unless <b>--patch</b> is given, in which case a patch is assumed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The choice of branch in made by providing one of <b>-1</b>, <b>-2</b>, or
  <b>-3</b> with obvious meanings.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="BROWSE"><a class="selflink" href="#BROWSE">BROWSE</a></h2>
The browse function of <i>wiggle</i> presents the result of a merge or (with
  <b>-d</b>) a diff in a text-based GUI that can be navigated using keystrokes
  similar to <i>vi</i>(1) or <i>emacs</i>(1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The browser allows each of the two or three streams to be viewed individually
  with colours used to highlight different sorts of text - green for added text,
  red for deleted text etc. It can also show the patch by itself, the full
  result of the merge, or the merge and the patch side-by-side.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The browser provides a number of context-sensitive help pages which can be
  accessed by typing '?'
<div class="Pp"></div>
The top right of the GUI will report the type of text under the cursor, which is
  also indicated by the colour of the text. Options are Unchanged, Changed,
  Unmatched, Extraneous, AlreadyApplied and Conflict. If the meanings of these
  are clear a little experimentations should help.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A limited amount of editing is permitted while in <b>browse</b> mode. Currently
  text that is unwanted can be discarded with <b>x</b>. This will convert a
  Conflict or Change to Unchanged, and an Unmatched to Changed (which
  effectively changes it to the empty string). Similarly a text can be marked as
  wanted with <b>c</b>. This will convert a Conflict or Extraneous to Changed.
  Using the same key again will revert the change.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, the uppercase <b>X</b> will revert all changes on the current line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To make more sweeping changes you can use <b>v</b> which runs an editor,
  preferring <b>$VISUAL</b> or <b>$EDITOR</b> if they are set in the
  environment.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you make any changes, then wiggle will ask you if you want to save the
  changes, even if <b>--replace</b> was not given.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WARNING"><a class="selflink" href="#WARNING">WARNING</a></h1>
Caution should always be exercised when applying a rejected patch with
  <i>wiggle</i>. When <i>patch</i> rejects a patch, it does so for a good
  reason. Even though <i>wiggle</i> may be able to find a believable place to
  apply each textual change, there is no guarantee that the result is correct in
  any semantic sense. The result should always be inspected to make sure it is
  correct.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<b> wiggle --replace file file.rej</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
This is the normal usage of <i>wiggle</i> and will take any changes in
  <b>file.rej</b> that <i>patch</i> could not apply, and merge them into
  <b>file</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b> wiggle -dp1 file file.rej</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
This will perform a word-wise comparison between the <b>file</b> and the
  <i>before</i> branch of the diff in <b>file.rej</b> and display the
  differences. This allows you to see where a given patch would apply.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b> wiggle --merge --help</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Get help about the merge function of <i>wiggle</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b> wiggle --browse --patch update.patch</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Parse the <b>update.patch</b> file for patches and present a list of patched
  files which can be browsed to examine each patch in detail.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>wiggle</i> can be integrated with <i>git</i> so that it is used as the
  default merge tool and diff tool. This can be achieved by adding the following
  lines to <b>.gitconfig</b> in the user's home directory.
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
[merge &quot;wiggle&quot;]
	name = &quot;Wiggle flexible merging&quot;
	driver = wiggle -o %A %A %O %B
	recursive = binary
[merge]
	tool = wiggle
[mergetool &quot;wiggle&quot;]
	cmd = wiggle -B -o $MERGED $LOCAL $BASE $REMOTE
[difftool &quot;wiggle&quot;]
	cmd = wiggle -Bd $LOCAL $REMOTE
</pre>
</div>
This will make <b>git mergetool</b> and <b>git difftool</b> use <i>wiggle</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want <i>git</i> to always use <i>wiggle</i> for merges (which may be
  dangerous), you can add
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">* merge=wiggle</div>
to an appropriate <i>gitattributes</i> file such as
  <b>$HOME/.config/git/attributes</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="QUOTE"><a class="selflink" href="#QUOTE">QUOTE</a></h1>
The name of <i>wiggle</i> was inspired by the following quote.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
The problem I find is that I often want to take
  (file1+patch) -&gt; file2,
when I don't have file1.  But merge tools want to take
  (file1|file2) -&gt; file3.
I haven't seen a graphical tool which helps you to wiggle a patch
into a file.
