<p>WIGGLE(1) General Commands Manual WIGGLE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
wiggle - apply rejected patches and perform word-wise
diffs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
wiggle [function] [options] file [files]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The main function of wiggle is to apply a patch to a file in
a similar manner to the patch(1) program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The distinctive difference of
wiggle is that it will attempt to apply a patch even if the
&quot;before&quot; part of the patch doesn&rsquo;t match the
target file perfectly. This is achieved by <br>
breaking the file and patch into words and finding the best
alignment of words in the file with words in the patch. Once
this alignment has been found, any differences (word- <br>
wise) in the patch are applied to the file as best as
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, wiggle will (in some
cases) detect changes that have already been applied, and
will ignore them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wiggle ensures that every change
in the patch is applied to the target file somehow. If a
particular change cannot be made in the file, the file is
annotated to show where the <br>
change should be made in a similar way to the merge(1)
program with the -A option. Each annotation contains 3
components: a portion of the original file where the change
should <br>
be applied, a portion of the patch that couldn&rsquo;t be
matched precisely in the file, and the text that should
replace that portion of the patch. These are separated by
lines con&acirc; <br>
taining precisely 7 identical characters, either
&rsquo;&lt;&rsquo;, &rsquo;|&rsquo;, &rsquo;=&rsquo;, or
&rsquo;&gt;&rsquo;, possibly followed by a descriptive word.
So <br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; found <br>
Some portion of the original file <br>
||||||| expected <br>
text to replace <br>
======= <br>
text to replace it with <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; replacement <br>
indicates that &quot;text to replace&quot; should be
replaced by &quot;text to replace it with&quot; somewhere in
the portion of the original file. However wiggle was not
able to find a place to <br>
make this change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wiggle can also produce conflict
reports showing only the words that are involved rather than
showing whole lines. In this case the output looks like:
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;---original|||old===new---&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One possible usage of wiggle is
to run patch to apply some patch, and to collect a list of
rejects by monitoring the error messages from patch. Then
for each file for which a <br>
reject was found, run <br>
wiggle --replace originalfile originalfile.rej</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally each file must be
examined to resolve any unresolved conflicts, and to make
sure the applied patch is semantically correct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternately, the original patch
file can be fed to the browse mode as <br>
wiggle -B &lt; patchfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will allow the changes and
conflicts to be inspected and, to some extent, modified; and
then the results can be saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are understood by wiggle. Some of
these are explained in more detail in the following sections
on MERGE, DIFF, EXTRACT, and BROWSE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --merge <br>
Select the &quot;merge&quot; function. This is the default
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --diff <br>
Select the &quot;diff&quot; function. This displays the
differences between files. This can be given after --browse
(see below) in which case a patch or diff of two files can
be <br>
viewed without the originals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --extract <br>
Select the &quot;extract&quot; function. This extracts one
branch of a patch or merge file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --browse <br>
Select the &quot;browse&quot; function. This is similar to
&quot;merge&quot; (or &quot;diff&quot;) only with a
different presentation. Instead of the result simply being
sent to standard output, it <br>
is presented using an ncurses-based GUI so that each hunk of
the patch can be examined to understand what conflicts where
involved and what needed to be ignored in order <br>
of the patch to be wiggled in to place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --words <br>
Request that all operations and display be word based. This
is the default for the &quot;diff&quot; function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --lines <br>
Request that all operations and display be line based.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --ignore-blanks <br>
De-emphasise white space (space, tab, and newline) is
determining differences and changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally white space is treated
like a word which can be matched or changed by a patch. When
this flag is in force, white space serves only as a
separator between other <br>
words and is not matched itself. The effect of this is that
changes in the amount of white space are not treated as
significant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To be precise, any white space
is combined with the preceeding word or, in the case of
leading space on a line, with the following word. However it
is not involved in any <br>
comparisons of that word. If a patch deletes a word, the
attached white space is deleted as well. If a patch adds a
word, the attached white space is added as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An empty line, or one that
contains only blanks, will be treated as a single word that
will match any other blank line, no matter how many spaces
it has.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b has no effect in --line
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --patch <br>
Treat the last named file as a patch instead of a file (with
--diff) or a merge (--extract). In merge or browse mode, -p
requires there be exactly one file which is a <br>
patch and which can contain patches to multiple files. The
patches are merged into each file. When used in merge mode,
this usage requires the --replace option as writ&acirc; <br>
ing lots of merged files to standard-out is impractical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When processing a multi-file
patch, -p can be followed by a numeric argument indicating
how many file name components should be stripped from files
named in the patch <br>
file. If no numeric argument is given, wiggle will deduce an
appropriate number based what files are present in the
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --replace <br>
Normally the merged output is written to standard-output.
With --replace, the original file is replaced with the merge
output. In browse mode, this instructs wiggle to <br>
always save the resulting merge when exiting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --output= <br>
Rather than writing the result to stdout or to replace the
original file, this requests that the output be written to
the given file. This is only meaningful with --merge <br>
or --browse when given a single merge to browse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option overrides -r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --reverse <br>
When used with the diff function, swap the files before
calculating the differences. When used with the merge or
browse functions, wiggle attempts to revert changes <br>
rather than apply them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --no-ignore <br>
Normally wiggle will ignore changes in the patch which
appear to already have been applied in the original. With
this flag those changes are reported as conflicts rather
<br>
than being ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W, --show-wiggles <br>
When used with --merge, conflicts that can be wiggled into
place are reported as conflicts with an extra stanza which
shows what the result would be if this flag had not <br>
been used. The extra stanza is introduce with a line
containing 7 ampersand (&amp;) characters thus: <br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; found <br>
Some portion of the original file <br>
||||||| expected <br>
text to replace <br>
======= <br>
text to replace it with <br>
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; resolution <br>
Text that would result from a successful wiggle <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; replacement</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--report-wiggles <br>
If a merge is successful in applying all changes, it will
normally exit with a success status (0), only reporting
failure (1) if a conflict occurred and was annotated. <br>
With --report-wiggles wiggle will also report failure if any
changes had to be wiggled in. This can be useful when wiggle
is used for automatic merges as with git. If <br>
any wiggles happen, git will report the failure, and the
results can be examined to confirm they are acceptable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a simple help message. If given after one of the
function selectors (--merge, --diff, --extract, --browse)
help specific to that function is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Display the version number of wiggle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Enable verbose mode. Currently this makes no difference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Enable quiet mode. This suppresses the message from the
merge function when there are unresolvable conflicts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WORDS <br>
wiggle can divide a text into lines or words when performing
it&rsquo;s tasks. A line is simply a string of characters
terminated by a newline. A word is either a maximal
contiguous <br>
string of alphanumerics (including underscore), a maximal
contiguous string of space or tab characters, or any other
single character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MERGE <br>
The merge function modifies a given text by finding all
changes between two other texts and imposing those changes
on the given text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally wiggle focuses on which
words have changed so as to maximise the possibility of
finding a good match in the given text for the context of a
given change. However it can <br>
consider only whole lines instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wiggle extracts the three texts
that it needs from files listed on the command line. Either
1, 2, or 3 files may be listed, and any one of them may be a
lone hyphen signifying <br>
standard-input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one file is given and the -p
option is not present, the file is treated as a merge file,
i.e. the output of &quot;merge -A&quot; or
&quot;wiggle&quot;. Such a file implicitly contains three
<br>
streams and these are extracted and compared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If two files are given, then the
first simply contains the primary text, and the second is
treated as a patch file (the output of &quot;diff -u&quot;
or &quot;diff -c&quot;, or a &quot;.rej&quot; file from <br>
patch) and the two other texts are extracted from that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one file is given together
with the -p option, the file is treated as a patch file
containing the names of the files that it patches. In this
case multiple merge operations <br>
can happen and each takes one stream from a file named in
the patch, and the other two from the patch itself. The
--replace option is required and the results are written
back <br>
to the target files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally if three files are
listed, they are taken to contain the given text and the two
other texts, in order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally the result of the merge
is written to standard-output. If the -r flag is given, the
output is written to a file which replaces the original
given file. In this case the <br>
original file is renamed to have a .porig suffix (for
&quot;patched original&quot; which makes sense if you first
use patch to apply a patch, and then use wiggle to wiggle
the rejects in).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Further if the -o option is
given with a file name, the output will be written to that
file. In this case no backup is created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no errors occur (such as file
access errors) wiggle will exit with a status of 0 if all
changes were successfully merged, and with an exit status of
1 and a brief message if <br>
any changes could not be fully merged and were instead
inserted as annotations. However if either --report-wiggles
or --show-wiggles options were given, wiggle will also exist
<br>
with status of 1 if any changes had to be wiggled in even
though this was successful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The merge function can operate
in three different modes with respect to lines or words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the --lines option, whole
lines are compared and any conflicts are reported as whole
lines that need to be replaced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the --words option,
individual words are compared and any conflicts are reported
just covering the words affected. This uses the
&lt;&lt;&lt;|||===&gt;&gt;&gt; conflict format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without either of these options,
a hybrid approach is taken. Individual words are compared
and merged, but when a conflict is found the whole
surrounding line is reported as <br>
being in conflict.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wiggle will ensure that every
change between the two other texts is reflected in the
result of the merge somehow. There are four different ways
that a change can be reflected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 If a change converts A to B
and A is found at a suitable place in the original file, it
is replaced with B. This includes the possibility that B is
empty, but not that A <br>
is empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 If a change is found which
simply adds B and the text immediately preceding and
following the insertion are found adjacent in the original
file in a suitable place, then B <br>
is inserted between those adjacent texts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 If a change is found which
changes A to B and this appears (based on context) to align
with B in the original, then it is assumed that this change
has already been <br>
applied, and the change is ignored. When this happens, a
message reflecting the number of ignored changes is printed
by wiggle. This optimisation can be suppressed with <br>
the -i flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 If a change is found that does
not fit any of the above possibilities, then a conflict is
reported as described earlier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIFF <br>
The diff function is provided primarily to allow inspection
of the alignments that wiggle calculated between texts and
that it uses for performing a merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output of the diff function
is similar to the unified output of diff. However while diff
does not output long stretches of common text,
wiggle&rsquo;s diff mode outputs every&acirc; <br>
thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When calculating a word-based
alignment (the default), wiggle may need to show these
word-based differences. This is done using an extension to
the unified-diff format. If a <br>
line starts with a vertical bar, then it may contain
sections surrounded by special multi-character brackets. The
brackets &quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;++&quot; and
&quot;++&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot; surround added text while
&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;--&quot; <br>
and &quot;--&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot; surround removed text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wiggle can be given the two
texts to compare in one of three ways.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If only one file is given, then
it is treated as a patch and the two branches of that patch
are compared. This effectively allows a patch to be refined
from a line-based patch <br>
to a word-based patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If two files are given, then
they are normally assumed to be simple texts to be
compared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If two files are given along
with the --patch option, then the second file is assumed to
be a patch and either the first (with -1) or the second
(with -2) branch is extracted and <br>
compared with text found in the first file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This last option causes wiggle
to apply a &quot;best-fit&quot; algorithm for aligning patch
hunks with the file before computing the differences. This
algorithm is used when merging a <br>
patch with a file, and its value can be seen by comparing
the difference produced this way with the difference
produced by first extracting one branch of a patch into a
file, and <br>
then computing the difference of that file with the main
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTRACT <br>
The extract function of wiggle simply exposes the internal
functionality for extracting one branch of a patch or a
merge file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Precisely one file should be
given, and it will be assumed to be a merge file unless
--patch is given, in which case a patch is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The choice of branch in made by
providing one of -1, -2, or -3 with obvious meanings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BROWSE <br>
The browse function of wiggle presents the result of a merge
or (with -d) a diff in a text-based GUI that can be
navigated using keystrokes similar to vi(1) or emacs(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The browser allows each of the
two or three streams to be viewed individually with colours
used to highlight different sorts of text - green for added
text, red for deleted text <br>
etc. It can also show the patch by itself, the full result
of the merge, or the merge and the patch side-by-side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The browser provides a number of
context-sensitive help pages which can be accessed by typing
&rsquo;?&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The top right of the GUI will
report the type of text under the cursor, which is also
indicated by the colour of the text. Options are Unchanged,
Changed, Unmatched, Extraneous, <br>
AlreadyApplied and Conflict. If the meanings of these are
clear a little experimentations should help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A limited amount of editing is
permitted while in browse mode. Currently text that is
unwanted can be discarded with x. This will convert a
Conflict or Change to Unchanged, and <br>
an Unmatched to Changed (which effectively changes it to the
empty string). Similarly a text can be marked as wanted with
c. This will convert a Conflict or Extraneous to <br>
Changed. Using the same key again will revert the
change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, the uppercase X will
revert all changes on the current line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make more sweeping changes
you can use v which runs an editor, preferring $VISUAL or
$EDITOR if they are set in the environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you make any changes, then
wiggle will ask you if you want to save the changes, even if
--replace was not given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
Caution should always be exercised when applying a rejected
patch with wiggle. When patch rejects a patch, it does so
for a good reason. Even though wiggle may be able to find
<br>
a believable place to apply each textual change, there is no
guarantee that the result is correct in any semantic sense.
The result should always be inspected to make sure it is
<br>
correct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
wiggle --replace file file.rej <br>
This is the normal usage of wiggle and will take any changes
in file.rej that patch could not apply, and merge them into
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wiggle -dp1 file file.rej <br>
This will perform a word-wise comparison between the file
and the before branch of the diff in file.rej and display
the differences. This allows you to see where a given patch
<br>
would apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wiggle --merge --help <br>
Get help about the merge function of wiggle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wiggle --browse --patch
update.patch <br>
Parse the update.patch file for patches and present a list
of patched files which can be browsed to examine each patch
in detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wiggle can be integrated with
git so that it is used as the default merge tool and diff
tool. This can be achieved by adding the following lines to
.gitconfig in the user&rsquo;s home <br>
directory. <br>
[merge &quot;wiggle&quot;] <br>
name = &quot;Wiggle flexible merging&quot; <br>
driver = wiggle -o %A %A %O %B <br>
recursive = binary <br>
[merge] <br>
tool = wiggle <br>
[mergetool &quot;wiggle&quot;] <br>
cmd = wiggle -B -o $MERGED $LOCAL $BASE $REMOTE <br>
[difftool &quot;wiggle&quot;] <br>
cmd = wiggle -Bd $LOCAL $REMOTE <br>
This will make git mergetool and git difftool use
wiggle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want git to always use
wiggle for merges (which may be dangerous), you can add <br>
* merge=wiggle <br>
to an appropriate gitattributes file such as
$HOME/.config/git/attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUOTE <br>
The name of wiggle was inspired by the following quote.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The problem I find is that I
often want to take <br>
(file1+patch) -&gt; file2, <br>
when I don&rsquo;t have file1. But merge tools want to take
<br>
(file1|file2) -&gt; file3. <br>
I haven&rsquo;t seen a graphical tool which helps you to
wiggle a patch <br>
into a file. <br>
-- Andrew Morton - 2002</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHORTCOMINGS <br>
- wiggle cannot read the extended unified-diff output that
it produces for --diff --words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- wiggle cannot read the
word-based merge format that it produces for --merge
--words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- wiggle does not understand
unicode and so will treat all non-ASCII characters much the
same as it treats punctuation - it will treat each one as a
separate word. The <br>
browser will not display non-ASCII characters properly.</p>
