<p>WAIT(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
WAIT(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
wait &acirc; await process completion</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
wait [pid...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
When an asynchronous list (see Section 2.9.3.1, Examples) is
started by the shell, the process ID of the last command in
each element of the asynchronous list shall become known
<br>
in the current shell execution environment; see Section
2.12, Shell Execution Environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the wait utility is invoked
with no operands, it shall wait until all process IDs known
to the invoking shell have terminated and exit with a zero
exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one or more pid operands are
specified that represent known process IDs, the wait utility
shall wait until all of them have terminated. If one or more
pid operands are speci&acirc; <br>
fied that represent unknown process IDs, wait shall treat
them as if they were known process IDs that exited with exit
status 127. The exit status returned by the wait utility
<br>
shall be the exit status of the process requested by the
last pid operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The known process IDs are
applicable only for invocations of wait in the current shell
execution environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pid One of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The unsigned decimal integer
process ID of a command, for which the utility is to wait
for the termination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. A job control job ID (see the
Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section
3.204, Job Control Job ID) that identifies a background
process group to be waited <br>
for. The job control job ID notation is applicable only for
invocations of wait in the current shell execution
environment; see Section 2.12, Shell Execution Envi&acirc;
<br>
ronment. The exit status of wait shall be determined by the
last command in the pipeline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The job control job ID
type of pid is only available on systems supporting the User
Portability Utilities option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of wait:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in argu&acirc; <br>
ments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
If one or more operands were specified, all of them have
terminated or were not known by the invoking shell, and the
status of the last operand specified is known, then the exit
<br>
status of wait shall be the exit status information of the
command indicated by the last operand specified. If the
process terminated abnormally due to the receipt of a
signal, <br>
the exit status shall be greater than 128 and shall be
distinct from the exit status generated by other signals,
but the exact value is unspecified. (See the kill &acirc;l
option.) <br>
Otherwise, the wait utility shall exit with one of the
following values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 The wait utility was invoked
with no operands and all process IDs known by the invoking
shell have terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1&acirc;126 The wait utility
detected an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">127 The command identified by
the last pid operand specified is unknown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
On most implementations, wait is a shell built-in. If it is
called in a subshell or separate utility execution
environment, such as one of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(wait) <br>
nohup wait ... <br>
find . &acirc;exec wait ... ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">it returns immediately because
there are no known process IDs to wait for in those
environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical implementations of
interactive shells have discarded the exit status of
terminated background processes before each shell prompt.
Therefore, the status of background <br>
processes was usually lost unless it terminated while wait
was waiting for it. This could be a serious problem when a
job that was expected to run for a long time actually
termi&acirc; <br>
nated quickly with a syntax or initialization error because
the exit status returned was usually zero if the requested
process ID was not found. This volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008
<br>
requires the implementation to keep the status of terminated
jobs available until the status is requested, so that
scripts like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">j1&amp; <br>
p1=$! <br>
j2&amp; <br>
wait $p1 <br>
echo Job 1 exited with status $? <br>
wait $! <br>
echo Job 2 exited with status $?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">work without losing status on
any of the jobs. The shell is allowed to discard the status
of any process if it determines that the application cannot
get the process ID for that <br>
process from the shell. It is also required to remember only
{CHILD_MAX} number of processes in this way. Since the only
way to get the process ID from the shell is by using the
<br>
&rsquo;!&rsquo; shell parameter, the shell is allowed to
discard the status of an asynchronous list if &quot;$!&quot;
was not referenced before another asynchronous list was
started. (This means that <br>
the shell only has to keep the status of the last
asynchronous list started if the application did not
reference &quot;$!&quot;. If the implementation of the shell
is smart enough to <br>
determine that a reference to &quot;$!&quot; was not saved
anywhere that the application can retrieve it later, it can
use this information to trim the list of saved information.
Note also <br>
that a successful call to wait with no operands discards the
exit status of all asynchronous lists.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the exit status of wait is
greater than 128, there is no way for the application to
know if the waited-for process exited with that value or was
killed by a signal. Since <br>
most utilities exit with small values, there is seldom any
ambiguity. Even in the ambiguous cases, most applications
just need to know that the asynchronous job failed; it does
<br>
not matter whether it detected an error and failed or was
killed and did not complete its job normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Although the exact value used when a process is terminated
by a signal is unspecified, if it is known that a signal
terminated a process, a script can still reliably determine
<br>
which signal by using kill as shown by the following
script:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sleep 1000&amp; <br>
pid=$! <br>
kill &acirc;kill $pid <br>
wait $pid <br>
echo $pid was terminated by a SIG$(kill &acirc;l $?)
signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the following sequence of
commands is run in less than 31 seconds:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sleep 257 | sleep 31 &amp; <br>
jobs &acirc;l %%</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">either of the following commands
returns the exit status of the second sleep in the
pipeline:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wait &lt;pid of sleep 31&gt;
<br>
wait %%</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The description of wait does not refer to the waitpid()
function from the System Interfaces volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 because that would needlessly overspecify
this interface. How&acirc; <br>
ever, the wording means that wait is required to wait for an
explicit process when it is given an argument so that the
status information of other processes is not consumed.
His&acirc; <br>
torical implementations use the wait() function defined in
the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 until
wait() returns the requested process ID or finds that the
requested <br>
process does not exist. Because this means that a shell
script could not reliably get the status of all background
children if a second background job was ever started before
the <br>
first job finished, it is recommended that the wait utility
use a method such as the functionality provided by the
waitpid() function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ability to wait for multiple
pid operands was adopted from the KornShell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This new functionality was added
because it is needed to determine the exit status of any
asynchronous list accurately. The only compatibility problem
that this change creates is <br>
for a script like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while sleep 60 do <br>
job&amp; echo Job started $(date) as $! done</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which causes the shell to
monitor all of the jobs started until the script terminates
or runs out of memory. This would not be a problem if the
loop did not reference &quot;$!&quot; or if <br>
the script would occasionally wait for jobs it started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
