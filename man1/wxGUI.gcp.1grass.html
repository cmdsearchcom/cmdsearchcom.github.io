<p style="margin-top: 1em">wxGUI GCP Manager DESCRIPTION
<br>
The GCP Manager is a wxGUI extension which allows the user
to create, edit, and manage Ground Control Points. It is
available from the menu &quot;File | Manage Ground Control
Points&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GCP Manager provides an
interactive graphical interface to manage and analyze Ground
Control Points. A backup copy of the initial POINTS file is
always maintained and updated <br>
only on request (Save GCPs to POINTS file). This guarantees
that accidental changes are not permanent and can be undone
by reloading the Ground Control Points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GCP Manager must be started
in the target location, not in the source location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GCP Manager is structured
into three panels:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The topmost
panel shows a list of Ground Control Points. Tools to
manipulate and analyze GCPs are provided in the toolbar.
This panel can be moved out of the GCP manager <br>
window by either dragging with the caption or by clicking on
the pin button on the right in the caption. This panel can
also be placed below the map displays by drag&acirc; <br>
ging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The two panels
in the lower part are used for map and GCP display, the left
pane showing a map from the source location and the right
pane showing a reference map from <br>
the target location. Numbered Ground Control Points are
shown on both map displays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Components of the GCP Manager
<br>
Toolbars</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two toolbars are provided with
the GCP Manager, one for managing the map displays and one
for managing the GCP list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List of ground control
points</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list of Ground Control
Points can be sorted by clicking on a column header.
Clicking on a cloumn header will sort the GCPs ascending, a
second click on the same column will <br>
sort the GCPs descending. Overall RMS error and individual
RMS errors of all points are often improved if the GCP with
the highest RMS error is adjusted. Individual coordinates
<br>
can be edited by double-clicking on a row.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first column holds a
checkbox and displays the point number. A GCP is only used
for RMS error calculation and georectification if its
checkbox on the left is checked. Uncheck <br>
to deactivate a GCP (mark as unused GCP).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two panels for map display</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The left panel is used to
display a map from the source location, the right panel to
display a map from the target loaction. Zooming in and out
is always possible with the mouse <br>
wheel and done for each map canvas separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCPs are displayed in different
colors, depending on whether a GCP has a high RMS error, is
currently unused or is currently selected. Optionally,
currently unused GCPs are not <br>
shown on the map display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Statusbar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the bottom of the GCP Manager
is a statusbar providing several functions. The default is
set to Go to GCP No. (see also below). Typing a number or
using the up/down arrows <br>
will center the maps on the given GCP, useful with a high
zoom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCP Map Display Toolbar <br>
Display map <br>
Displays maps for source and target canvas and re-renders
any layers that have changed since the last time the display
was updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Re-render map <br>
Re-renders both source and target canvas regardless of
whether they have changed or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Erase display <br>
Erases both source and target canvas to a white
background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Define GCP (Ground Control
Points) <br>
On left mouse click, coordinates are defined for the
currently selected GCP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pan <br>
Interactive selection of a new center of view in the active
display monitor. Drag the pan cursor while pressing the left
mouse button to pan. Alternatively left-click on the <br>
new center. Panning changes the location of the region
displayed but not the size of the area displayed or the
resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zoom in <br>
Interactive zooming with the mouse in the active map canvas
(source or target). Drawing a box or just a left click with
the mouse and zoom-in cursor causes the display to <br>
zoom in so that the area defined by the box fills the
display. The map resolution is not changed. Clicking with
the zoom-in cursor causes the display to zoom in by 30%,
cen&acirc; <br>
tered on the point where the mouse is clicked. Zooming
changes the display region extents (both size and location
of area displayed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zoom out <br>
Interactive zooming with the mouse in the active map canvas
(source or target). Drawing a box or just a left click with
the mouse and zoom-out cursor causes the display to <br>
zoom out so that the area displayed shrinks to fill the area
defined by the box. The map resolution is not changed.
Clicking with the zoom-out cursor causes the display to <br>
zoom out by 30%, centered on the point where the mouse is
clicked. Zooming changes the display region extents (both
size and location of area displayed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adjust display zoom <br>
Source and target display are adjusted by using the current
GCPs for coordinate transformation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adjust source display to target
display <br>
The extents of the source display are adjusted to the
current extents of the target display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adjust target display to source
display <br>
The extents of the source display are adjusted to the
current extents of the target display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set active map canvas <br>
Sets the currently active map canvas (source or target).
Click to set active map canvas for Return to previous zoom
or Zoom to extent of currently displayed map. Alterna&acirc;
<br>
tively, move the mouse over the map canvas to be used as
active canvas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Return to previous zoom <br>
Returns to the previous zoom extent. Up to 10 levels of zoom
back are maintained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zoom to extent of currently
displayed map <br>
Zoom to the extent of the currently displayed map in the
active map canvas (source or target).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Settings <br>
Shows a settings dialog for GCP management and display:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Symbology <br>
Settings for map and GCP display:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Highlight highest RMS error only
<br>
Only the GCP with the highest RMS error will be displayed in
a different colour, both in the list of GCPs and the GCP Map
Display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Factor for RMS error threshold =
M + SD * factor: <br>
All GCPs with an RMS error larger than mean RMS + RMS
standard deviation * this factor will be displayed in a
different colour, both in the list of GCPs and the GCP Map
Dis&acirc; <br>
play. As a rule of thumb, GCPs with an RMS error larger than
M + SD * 2 are most probably wrong. GCPs with an RMS error
larger than M + SD * 1 are worth closer inspection. <br>
This option is only available if Highlight highest RMS error
only is unchecked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Color <br>
Set the color for GCPs on the GCP Map Display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Color for high RMS error <br>
Set the color for GCPs with a high RMS error on the GCP Map
Display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Color for selected GCP <br>
Set the color for the currently selected GCP on the GCP Map
Display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show unused GCPs <br>
If unchecked, unused GCPs will not be shown on the GCP Map
Display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Color for unused GCPs <br>
Set the color for unused GCPs on the GCP Map Display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Symbol size <br>
Set the symbol size for GCPs on the GCP Map Display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Line width <br>
Set the line width for GCPs on the GCP Map Display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select source map to display
<br>
Select a source map for the left pane of the GCP Map
Display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select target map to display
<br>
Select a target map for the right pane of the GCP Map
Display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rectification <br>
Settings for georectification:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select rectification method <br>
Set the polynomial order for georectification. This order
will also be used for RMS error calculation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clip to computational region in
target location <br>
Clip raster maps to the current computational region in the
target location when georectifying.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extension for output maps <br>
Change the extension for output map names when doing the
actual georectification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show Help <br>
Show help page for the GCP Manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quit <br>
Quit the GCP Manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Toolbar for the GCP list <br>

marked for use (activated checkbox in first row).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Georectify <br>
Uses i.rectify to georectify all images in the source
imagery group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCP Map Display Statusbar <br>
The GCP map display statusbar is similar to the statusbar in
the regular GRASS GIS map display with two differences, Go
to has been replaced with Go to GCP No. and Projection has
<br>
been replaced with RMS error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Go to GCP No. is selected, a
GCP number can be given in the left side of the statusbar
and the source and target map canvas will be centered on the
given GCP. Clicking on the <br>
map canvas will update coordinates for this GCP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If RMS error is selected, the
overall forward and backward RMS error is displayed.</p>
