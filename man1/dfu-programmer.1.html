<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dfu-programmer - USB firmware upgrading for Atmel
microcontrollers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dfu-programmer target[:usb-bus,usb-addr] command [options]
[parameters] <br>
dfu-programmer --help <br>
dfu-programmer --targets <br>
dfu-programmer --version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dfu-programmer is a multi-platform command line Device
Firmware Upgrade (DFU) based programmer for the flash memory
on Atmel AVR, AVR32, XMEGA and 8051 based microcontrollers
<br>
which ship with a USB boot loader. It supports In System
Programming (ISP) for developers and potentially product
updates in the field. Those boot loaders are patterned after
<br>
the standard USB DFU 1.0 class specification, but depend on
extensions defined by Atmel to the extent that standard DFU
drivers will not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use it, first connect the
device to be programmed and ensure that it comes up in DFU
mode. The microcontrollers come up in that mode as shipped
by Atmel; or they may reenter <br>
that mode after a special hardware reset. Then invoke this
program to issue one or more DFU commands. You will normally
need to start by issuing the &quot;erase&quot; command; the
<br>
default security policies prevent extracting firmware, to
prevent reverse engineering of what is usually proprietary
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
There are no mechanisms to implement gang programming. By
default, the first device that matches the id codes for the
given target is selected. Many targets share the same id
<br>
codes. Accordingly, you will usually avoid connecting more
than one device of a given family (AVR, XMEGA, AVR32 or
8051) at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The target may be qualified with
the USB bus and address number of the device you wish to
program. This allows programming multiple devices of the
same family at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of these commands support
the &quot;global options&quot;. Unless you override it,
commands which write to the microcontroller will perform a
validation step that rereads the data <br>
which was written, compares it to the expected result, and
reports any errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that unlike Atmel&rsquo;s
BatchISP program, dfu-programmer will only perform a single
operation at a time. Erasing and programming require
separate commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">configure register
[--suppress-validation] data <br>
Bootloaders for 8051 based controllers support writing
certain configuration bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump <br>
Reads all the available flash memory, and writes it as
binary data to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump-eeprom <br>
Reads all the available eeprom memory, and writes it as
binary data to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump-user <br>
Reads the user space flash on the AVR32 chips and writes it
as binary data to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">erase [--suppress-validation]
<br>
Erases all the flash memory. This is required before the
bootloader will perform other commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flash [--suppress-validation]
[--suppress-bootloader-mem] [--serial=hexbytes:offset] file
or STDIN <br>
Writes flash memory. The input file (or stdin) must use the
&quot;ihex&quot; file format convention for a memory image.
--suppress-bootloader-mem ignores any data written to the
<br>
bootloader memory space when flashing the device. This
option is particularly useful for the AVR32 chips trampoline
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--serial provides a way to
inject a serial number or other unique sequence of bytes
into the memory image programmed into the device. This
allows using a single .ihex file to <br>
program multiple devices, and still give each device its own
unique serial number. For example, --serial=ABCDEF01:0x6000
would program the byte at 0x6000 with the hex value AB, <br>
the byte at 0x6001 with the value CD, and so on. There must
be an even number of hex digits, but the sequence can be any
length. The offset is assumed to be given in hex if it <br>
starts with a &quot;0x&quot; prefix, octal if it begins with
a &quot;0&quot;, otherwise is it assumed to be decimal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flash-user
[--suppress-validation] [--serial=hexbytes:offset] file or
STDIN <br>
Writes to user space flash on the AVR32 chips. This block of
flash is out of the normal range of flash blocks and is
designed to contain configuration parameters. The <br>
input file (or stdin) must use the &quot;ihex&quot; file
format convention for a memory image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flash-eeprom
[--suppress-validation] [--serial=hexbytes:offset] file or
STDIN <br>
Writes to eeprom memory. The input file (or stdin) must use
the &quot;ihex&quot; file format convention for a memory
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setsecure <br>
Sets the security bit on AVR32 chips. This prevents the
content being read back from the chip, except in the same
session in which it was programmed. When the security <br>
fuse is set, almost nothing will work without first
executing the erase command. The only way to clear the
security fuse once set is to use a JTAG chip erase, which
will <br>
also erase the bootloader.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get register <br>
Displays various product identifier bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reset <br>
Resets microcontroller using watchdog timer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start <br>
Starts the application firmware by having the
microcontroller jump to address zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Global Options <br>
--quiet - minimizes the output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug level - enables verbose
output at the specified level</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configure Registers <br>
The standard bootloader for 8051 based chips supports
writing data bytes which are not relevant for the AVR based
chips.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BSB - boot status byte <br>
SBV - software boot vector <br>
SSB - software security byte <br>
EB - extra byte <br>
HSB - hardware security byte</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Get Register <br>
bootloader-version - currently flashed bootloader version
<br>
ID1 - device boot identification 1 <br>
ID2 - device boot identification 2 <br>
manufacturer - the hardware manufacturer code <br>
family - the product family code <br>
product-name - the product name <br>
product-revision - the product revision <br>
HSB - same as the configure_register version <br>
BSB - same as the configure_register version <br>
SBV - same as the configure_register version <br>
SSB - same as the configure_register version <br>
EB - same as the configure_register version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
None known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN ISSUES <br>
The at90usb series chips do not make available any
read/write protect flags so the dump or flash command may
fail with a less than helpful error message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To remove any write or read
protection from any chips, a full chip erasure is required.
For AVR32 chips an erase operation over USB will remove
protection until the device is <br>
rebooted. To remove the protection more permanently requires
a JTAG erase (which will also erase the bootloader).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may need to be a member of
the uucp group in order to have access to the device without
needing to be root.</p>
