<b>Chase</b> is a small utility that tracks down the name of the actual file
  that is truly accessed, when one hits a symbolic link. It chases the link, so
  to speak.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In normal operation, you give <b>chase</b> a name of an existing file. The
  program will then show you (or, more accurately, print to the standard output
  stream) the name of the real file that the original file referred to. It does
  not matter if you give the program the name of a regular file; <b>chase</b>
  will just give you the same name back. You can give the utility the option
  <b>--verbose</b>, in order to have it be more verbose in its operation. You
  can also give the program a list of files from which it will read the file
  names to be chased (see the option <b>--from-file).</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
I'll give you a good example of a case where <b>chase</b> is useful. In a Debian
  GNU/Linux system, software installation is handled by the program
  <b>dpkg</b>(8). There is a way to query <b>dpkg</b>(8), which package a file
  belongs to. Unfortunately, this does not not grok all symlinks. This is a
  problem, since the Debian system uses symbolic links extensively for handling
  several flavours of a program (say, XEmacs and GNU Emacs and the versions 19
  and 20 of both). Now with <b>chase,</b> one can determine the real file easily
  and then using this result as an argument to <b>dpkg</b>(8). Observe:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
ajk@ugh:~$ dpkg -S `which xemacs20`
dpkg: /usr/bin/xemacs20 not found.
ajk@ugh:~$ dpkg -S `which xemacs20 | xargs chase`
xemacs20-nomule: /usr/bin/xemacs-20.4-nomule
ajk@ugh:~$ 
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When given multiple file names as arguments, <b>chase</b> will chase every one
  of them in order.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The following options are recognized by <b>chase</b>:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">--verbose</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Chat about what is being done.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-f, --from-file</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Treat the file names on the command line as sources for
      names to be chased. If this option is present, <b>chase</b> will read in
      each of the files given on the command line (both a sole dash
      &quot;-&quot; and the absence of file names will be taken as meaning the
      standard input stream). Each line in the files is taken as a verbatim file
      name that will be chased like it had been given on the command line of a
      run without this option. There is no means for quoting the newline
      character; therefore only file names that do not contain newlines can be
      specified via the files. This restriction is lifted by the -0 option,
      though. However, literal spaces are preserved and are not interpreted as
      special.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-0, --null</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option implies the option -f, which reads file names
      from a file. The -0 option modifies the behavior -f so that instead of
      treating lines in the file as file names, the file names are expected to
      be separated by null characters. This allows for specifying file names
      with newlines in them with -f.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-w WCOUNT, --loop-warn-threshold=WCOUNT</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-l LCOUNT, --loop-fail-threshold=LCOUNT</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set the threshold for warning about a possible symlink loop
      (WCOUNT) and for failing because of one (LCOUNT). There are default
      values, which you can find out by invoking <b>chase</b> with the argument
      --help. Using zero as WCOUNT or LCOUNT disables the check.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-D, --disable-loop-detection</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Normally <b>chase</b> keeps a record of all symlinks it has
      visited when chasing the current file. It uses this record to reliably
      detect symlink loops. However, checking the record slows the process a
      little (more for long chains of symlinks) and the record requires a small
      amount of memory (more for long chains of symlinks), so it may be
      desirable in some cases to inhibit this check. This option disables this
      loop detection and the associated recording of visited symlinks. When this
      option is in effect (assuming no bugs in the related code) <b>chase</b>
      runs in constant space and linear time relative to the length of the
      symlink chains encountered.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-h, --help</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Output a usage summary and exit successfully.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-v, --version</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Show version information and exit successfully.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DIAGNOSTICS"><a class="selflink" href="#DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</a></h1>
The exit status is 0 if and only if all files given in the command lines exist
  and none of them are dangling symlinks.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following messages are emitted by <b>chase</b> when it suspects or detects a
  symlink loop:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">quite many symlink hops, hope we're not looping...</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This means that the chain of symlinks is longer than a
      given threshold. This may mean that the chain is infinite (and thus
      contains a loop somewhere). The threshold can be specified by using the
      --loop-warn-threshold command line option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">too many symlink hops, giving up...</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This means that the chain of symlinks is longer than a
      given threshold. This usually means that the chain is infinite (and thus
      contains a loop somewhere). The threshold can be specified by using the
      --loop-fail-threshold command line option. If you see this message, it
      means that <b>chase</b> has given up on that file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">symlink loop detected, giving up...</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The symlink chain is looping and therefore there is no
      result for the chase. <b>Chase</b> has given up on that file.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Additionally, <b>Chase</b> emits several error messages under problematic
  conditions. They all come from the system libraries, so the program has no
  control over the actual wording of the messages. They all follow the format
  &quot;program name: file name: error message&quot;, where file name is the
  name of the offending file or directory.
