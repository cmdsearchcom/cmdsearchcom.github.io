<p>CHASE(1) Chase user&rsquo;s manual CHASE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
chase - chase symbolic links</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
chase [ --verbose | --from-file | -f | --null | -0 |
--loop-warn-threshold COUNT | -w COUNT |
--loop-fail-threshold COUNT | -l COUNT |
--disable-loop-detection | -D ] [file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chase -v | --version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chase -h | --help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Chase is a small utility that tracks down the name of the
actual file that is truly accessed, when one hits a symbolic
link. It chases the link, so to speak.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In normal operation, you give
chase a name of an existing file. The program will then show
you (or, more accurately, print to the standard output
stream) the name of the real <br>
file that the original file referred to. It does not matter
if you give the program the name of a regular file; chase
will just give you the same name back. You can give the <br>
utility the option --verbose, in order to have it be more
verbose in its operation. You can also give the program a
list of files from which it will read the file names to be
<br>
chased (see the option --from-file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I&rsquo;ll give you a good
example of a case where chase is useful. In a Debian
GNU/Linux system, software installation is handled by the
program dpkg(8). There is a way to query <br>
dpkg(8), which package a file belongs to. Unfortunately,
this does not not grok all symlinks. This is a problem,
since the Debian system uses symbolic links extensively for
<br>
handling several flavours of a program (say, XEmacs and GNU
Emacs and the versions 19 and 20 of both). Now with chase,
one can determine the real file easily and then using this
<br>
result as an argument to dpkg(8). Observe:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ajk@ugh:~$ dpkg -S &lsquo;which
xemacs20&lsquo; <br>
dpkg: /usr/bin/xemacs20 not found. <br>
ajk@ugh:~$ dpkg -S &lsquo;which xemacs20 | xargs
chase&lsquo; <br>
xemacs20-nomule: /usr/bin/xemacs-20.4-nomule <br>
ajk@ugh:~$</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When given multiple file names
as arguments, chase will chase every one of them in
order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are recognized by chase:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose <br>
Chat about what is being done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --from-file <br>
Treat the file names on the command line as sources for
names to be chased. If this option is present, chase will
read in each of the files given on the command line <br>
(both a sole dash &quot;-&quot; and the absence of file
names will be taken as meaning the standard input stream).
Each line in the files is taken as a verbatim file name that
will <br>
be chased like it had been given on the command line of a
run without this option. There is no means for quoting the
newline character; therefore only file names that do <br>
not contain newlines can be specified via the files. This
restriction is lifted by the -0 option, though. However,
literal spaces are preserved and are not interpreted <br>
as special.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-0, --null <br>
This option implies the option -f, which reads file names
from a file. The -0 option modifies the behavior -f so that
instead of treating lines in the file as file names, <br>
the file names are expected to be separated by null
characters. This allows for specifying file names with
newlines in them with -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w WCOUNT,
--loop-warn-threshold=WCOUNT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l LCOUNT,
--loop-fail-threshold=LCOUNT <br>
Set the threshold for warning about a possible symlink loop
(WCOUNT) and for failing because of one (LCOUNT). There are
default values, which you can find out by invoking <br>
chase with the argument --help. Using zero as WCOUNT or
LCOUNT disables the check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --disable-loop-detection
<br>
Normally chase keeps a record of all symlinks it has visited
when chasing the current file. It uses this record to
reliably detect symlink loops. However, checking the <br>
record slows the process a little (more for long chains of
symlinks) and the record requires a small amount of memory
(more for long chains of symlinks), so it may be <br>
desirable in some cases to inhibit this check. This option
disables this loop detection and the associated recording of
visited symlinks. When this option is in effect <br>
(assuming no bugs in the related code) chase runs in
constant space and linear time relative to the length of the
symlink chains encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Output a usage summary and exit successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Show version information and exit successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The exit status is 0 if and only if all files given in the
command lines exist and none of them are dangling
symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following messages are
emitted by chase when it suspects or detects a symlink
loop:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quite many symlink hops, hope
we&rsquo;re not looping... <br>
This means that the chain of symlinks is longer than a given
threshold. This may mean that the chain is infinite (and
thus contains a loop somewhere). The threshold can <br>
be specified by using the --loop-warn-threshold command line
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">too many symlink hops, giving
up... <br>
This means that the chain of symlinks is longer than a given
threshold. This usually means that the chain is infinite
(and thus contains a loop somewhere). The threshold <br>
can be specified by using the --loop-fail-threshold command
line option. If you see this message, it means that chase
has given up on that file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">symlink loop detected, giving
up... <br>
The symlink chain is looping and therefore there is no
result for the chase. Chase has given up on that file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, Chase emits
several error messages under problematic conditions. They
all come from the system libraries, so the program has no
control over the actual wording of <br>
the messages. They all follow the format &quot;program name:
file name: error message&quot;, where file name is the name
of the offending file or directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Chase may have bugs. If you find them, please report them to
&lt;rotty@debian.org&gt; or preferably via the Debian
bugtracking system.</p>
