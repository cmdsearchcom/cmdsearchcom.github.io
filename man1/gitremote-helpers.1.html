<p>GITREMOTE-HELPERS(1) Git Manual GITREMOTE-HELPERS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gitremote-helpers - Helper programs to interact with remote
repositories</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git remote-&lt;transport&gt; &lt;repository&gt;
[&lt;URL&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Remote helper programs are normally not used directly by end
users, but they are invoked by Git when it needs to interact
with remote repositories Git does not support natively. <br>
A given helper will implement a subset of the capabilities
documented here. When Git needs to interact with a
repository using a remote helper, it spawns the helper as an
<br>
independent process, sends commands to the helper&acirc;s
standard input, and expects results from the helper&acirc;s
standard output. Because a remote helper runs as an
independent process <br>
from Git, there is no need to re-link Git to add a new
helper, nor any need to link the helper with the
implementation of Git.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every helper must support the
&quot;capabilities&quot; command, which Git uses to
determine what other commands the helper will accept. Those
other commands can be used to discover and <br>
update remote refs, transport objects between the object
database and the remote repository, and update the local
object store.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Git comes with a
&quot;curl&quot; family of remote helpers, that handle
various transport protocols, such as git-remote-http,
git-remote-https, git-remote-ftp and git-remote-ftps. They
<br>
implement the capabilities fetch, option, and push.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INVOCATION <br>
Remote helper programs are invoked with one or (optionally)
two arguments. The first argument specifies a remote
repository as in Git; it is either the name of a configured
<br>
remote or a URL. The second argument specifies a URL; it is
usually of the form &lt;transport&gt;://&lt;address&gt;, but
any arbitrary string is possible. The GIT_DIR environment
variable is <br>
set up for the remote helper and can be used to determine
where to store additional data or from which directory to
invoke auxiliary Git commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When Git encounters a URL of the
form &lt;transport&gt;://&lt;address&gt;, where
&lt;transport&gt; is a protocol that it cannot handle
natively, it automatically invokes git
remote-&lt;transport&gt; <br>
with the full URL as the second argument. If such a URL is
encountered directly on the command line, the first argument
is the same as the second, and if it is encountered in a
<br>
configured remote, the first argument is the name of that
remote.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A URL of the form
&lt;transport&gt;::&lt;address&gt; explicitly instructs Git
to invoke git remote-&lt;transport&gt; with &lt;address&gt;
as the second argument. If such a URL is encountered
directly on <br>
the command line, the first argument is &lt;address&gt;, and
if it is encountered in a configured remote, the first
argument is the name of that remote.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, when a configured
remote has remote.&lt;name&gt;.vcs set to &lt;transport&gt;,
Git explicitly invokes git remote-&lt;transport&gt; with
&lt;name&gt; as the first argument. If set, the <br>
second argument is remote.&lt;name&gt;.url; otherwise, the
second argument is omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FORMAT <br>
Git sends the remote helper a list of commands on standard
input, one per line. The first command is always the
capabilities command, in response to which the remote helper
must <br>
print a list of the capabilities it supports (see below)
followed by a blank line. The response to the capabilities
command determines what commands Git uses in the remainder
of <br>
the command stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command stream is terminated
by a blank line. In some cases (indicated in the
documentation of the relevant commands), this blank line is
followed by a payload in some other <br>
protocol (e.g., the pack protocol), while in others it
indicates the end of input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Capabilities <br>
Each remote helper is expected to support only a subset of
commands. The operations a helper supports are declared to
Git in the response to the capabilities command (see <br>
COMMANDS, below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following, we list all
defined capabilities and for each we list which commands a
helper with that capability must provide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Capabilities for Pushing <br>
connect <br>
Can attempt to connect to git receive-pack (for pushing),
git upload-pack, etc for communication using git&acirc;s
native packfile protocol. This requires a bidirectional,
<br>
full-duplex connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported commands: connect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">push <br>
Can discover remote refs and push local commits and the
history leading up to them to new or existing remote
refs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported commands: list
for-push, push.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export <br>
Can discover remote refs and push specified objects from a
fast-import stream to remote refs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported commands: list
for-push, export.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a helper advertises connect,
Git will use it if possible and fall back to another
capability if the helper requests so when connecting (see
the connect command under <br>
COMMANDS). When choosing between push and export, Git
prefers push. Other frontends may have some other order of
preference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Capabilities for Fetching <br>
connect <br>
Can try to connect to git upload-pack (for fetching), git
receive-pack, etc for communication using the Git&acirc;s
native packfile protocol. This requires a bidirectional,
<br>
full-duplex connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported commands: connect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fetch <br>
Can discover remote refs and transfer objects reachable from
them to the local object store.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported commands: list,
fetch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">import <br>
Can discover remote refs and output objects reachable from
them as a stream in fast-import format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported commands: list,
import.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a helper advertises connect,
Git will use it if possible and fall back to another
capability if the helper requests so when connecting (see
the connect command under <br>
COMMANDS). When choosing between fetch and import, Git
prefers fetch. Other frontends may have some other order of
preference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous capabilities <br>
option <br>
For specifying settings like verbosity (how much output to
write to stderr) and depth (how much history is wanted in
the case of a shallow clone) that affect how other <br>
commands are carried out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">refspec &lt;refspec&gt; <br>
This modifies the import capability, allowing the produced
fast-import stream to modify refs in a private namespace
instead of writing to refs/heads or refs/remotes <br>
directly. It is recommended that all importers providing the
import capability use this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A helper advertising the
capability refspec refs/heads/*:refs/svn/origin/branches/*
is saying that, when it is asked to import refs/heads/topic,
the stream it outputs <br>
will update the refs/svn/origin/branches/topic ref.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This capability can be
advertised multiple times. The first applicable refspec
takes precedence. The left-hand of refspecs advertised with
this capability must cover all <br>
refs reported by the list command. If a helper does not need
a specific refspec capability then it should advertise
refspec *:*.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bidi-import <br>
This modifies the import capability. The fast-import
commands cat-blob and ls can be used by remote-helpers to
retrieve information about blobs and trees that already <br>
exist in fast-import&acirc;s memory. This requires a channel
from fast-import to the remote-helper. If it is advertised
in addition to &quot;import&quot;, Git establishes a pipe
from <br>
fast-import to the remote-helper&acirc;s stdin. It follows
that Git and fast-import are both connected to the
remote-helper&acirc;s stdin. Because Git can send multiple
commands to <br>
the remote-helper it is required that helpers that use
bidi-import buffer all import commands of a batch before
sending data to fast-import. This is to prevent mixing <br>
commands and fast-import responses on the helper&acirc;s
stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export-marks &lt;file&gt; <br>
This modifies the export capability, instructing Git to dump
the internal marks table to &lt;file&gt; when complete. For
details, read up on --export-marks=&lt;file&gt; in git-fast-
<br>
export(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">import-marks &lt;file&gt; <br>
This modifies the export capability, instructing Git to load
the marks specified in &lt;file&gt; before processing any
input. For details, read up on --import-marks=&lt;file&gt;
in <br>
git-fast-export(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">signed-tags <br>
This modifies the export capability, instructing Git to pass
--signed-tags=verbatim to git-fast-export(1). In the absence
of this capability, Git will use <br>
--signed-tags=warn-strip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
Commands are given by the caller on the helper&acirc;s
standard input, one per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">capabilities <br>
Lists the capabilities of the helper, one per line, ending
with a blank line. Each capability may be preceded with *,
which marks them mandatory for Git versions using the <br>
remote helper to understand. Any unknown mandatory
capability is a fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for this command is
mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list <br>
Lists the refs, one per line, in the format
&quot;&lt;value&gt; &lt;name&gt; [&lt;attr&gt; ...]&quot;.
The value may be a hex sha1 hash, &quot;@&lt;dest&gt;&quot;
for a symref, or &quot;?&quot; to indicate that the helper
could <br>
not get the value of the ref. A space-separated list of
attributes follows the name; unrecognized attributes are
ignored. The list ends with a blank line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See REF LIST ATTRIBUTES for a
list of currently defined attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported if the helper has the
&quot;fetch&quot; or &quot;import&quot; capability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list for-push <br>
Similar to list, except that it is used if and only if the
caller wants to the resulting ref list to prepare push
commands. A helper supporting both push and fetch can use
<br>
this to distinguish for which operation the output of list
is going to be used, possibly reducing the amount of work
that needs to be performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported if the helper has the
&quot;push&quot; or &quot;export&quot; capability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">option &lt;name&gt;
&lt;value&gt; <br>
Sets the transport helper option &lt;name&gt; to
&lt;value&gt;. Outputs a single line containing one of ok
(option successfully set), unsupported (option not
recognized) or error &lt;msg&gt; <br>
(option &lt;name&gt; is supported but &lt;value&gt; is not
valid for it). Options should be set before other commands,
and may influence the behavior of those commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See OPTIONS for a list of
currently defined options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported if the helper has the
&quot;option&quot; capability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fetch &lt;sha1&gt; &lt;name&gt;
<br>
Fetches the given object, writing the necessary objects to
the database. Fetch commands are sent in a batch, one per
line, terminated with a blank line. Outputs a single <br>
blank line when all fetch commands in the same batch are
complete. Only objects which were reported in the output of
list with a sha1 may be fetched this way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optionally may output a lock
&lt;file&gt; line indicating a file under
GIT_DIR/objects/pack which is keeping a pack until refs can
be suitably updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported if the helper has the
&quot;fetch&quot; capability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">push +&lt;src&gt;:&lt;dst&gt;
<br>
Pushes the given local &lt;src&gt; commit or branch to the
remote branch described by &lt;dst&gt;. A batch sequence of
one or more push commands is terminated with a blank line
(if there <br>
is only one reference to push, a single push command is
followed by a blank line). For example, the following would
be two batches of push, the first asking the remote-helper
<br>
to push the local ref master to the remote ref master and
the local HEAD to the remote branch, and the second asking
to push ref foo to ref bar (forced update requested by <br>
the +).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">push
refs/heads/master:refs/heads/master <br>
push HEAD:refs/heads/branch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">push
+refs/heads/foo:refs/heads/bar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zero or more protocol options
may be entered after the last push command, before the
batch&acirc;s terminating blank line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the push is complete,
outputs one or more ok &lt;dst&gt; or error &lt;dst&gt;
&lt;why&gt;? lines to indicate success or failure of each
pushed ref. The status report output is terminated <br>
by a blank line. The option field &lt;why&gt; may be quoted
in a C style string if it contains an LF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported if the helper has the
&quot;push&quot; capability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">import &lt;name&gt; <br>
Produces a fast-import stream which imports the current
value of the named ref. It may additionally import other
refs as needed to construct the history efficiently. The
<br>
script writes to a helper-specific private namespace. The
value of the named ref should be written to a location in
this namespace derived by applying the refspecs from the
<br>
&quot;refspec&quot; capability to the name of the ref.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Especially useful for
interoperability with a foreign versioning system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Just like push, a batch sequence
of one or more import is terminated with a blank line. For
each batch of import, the remote helper should produce a
fast-import stream <br>
terminated by a done command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if the bidi-import
capability is used the complete batch sequence has to be
buffered before starting to send data to fast-import to
prevent mixing of commands and <br>
fast-import responses on the helper&acirc;s stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported if the helper has the
&quot;import&quot; capability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export <br>
Instructs the remote helper that any subsequent input is
part of a fast-import stream (generated by git fast-export)
containing objects which should be pushed to the remote.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Especially useful for
interoperability with a foreign versioning system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The export-marks and
import-marks capabilities, if specified, affect this command
in so far as they are passed on to git fast-export, which
then will load/store a table of <br>
marks for local objects. This can be used to implement for
incremental operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported if the helper has the
&quot;export&quot; capability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">connect &lt;service&gt; <br>
Connects to given service. Standard input and standard
output of helper are connected to specified service (git
prefix is included in service name so e.g. fetching uses
<br>
git-upload-pack as service) on remote side. Valid replies to
this command are empty line (connection established),
fallback (no smart transport support, fall back to dumb <br>
transports) and just exiting with error message printed
(can&acirc;t connect, don&acirc;t bother trying to fall
back). After line feed terminating the positive (empty)
response, the <br>
output of service starts. After the connection ends, the
remote helper exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported if the helper has the
&quot;connect&quot; capability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a fatal error occurs, the
program writes the error message to stderr and exits. The
caller should expect that a suitable error message has been
printed if the child closes the <br>
connection without completing a valid response for the
current command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional commands may be
supported, as may be determined from capabilities reported
by the helper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REF LIST ATTRIBUTES <br>
The list command produces a list of refs in which each ref
may be followed by a list of attributes. The following ref
list attributes are defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unchanged <br>
This ref is unchanged since the last import or fetch,
although the helper cannot necessarily determine what value
that produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are defined and (under suitable
circumstances) set by Git if the remote helper has the
option capability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">option verbosity &lt;n&gt; <br>
Changes the verbosity of messages displayed by the helper. A
value of 0 for &lt;n&gt; means that processes operate
quietly, and the helper produces only error output. 1 is the
<br>
default level of verbosity, and higher values of &lt;n&gt;
correspond to the number of -v flags passed on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">option progress {true|false}
<br>
Enables (or disables) progress messages displayed by the
transport helper during a command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">option depth &lt;depth&gt; <br>
Deepens the history of a shallow repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">option followtags {true|false}
<br>
If enabled the helper should automatically fetch annotated
tag objects if the object the tag points at was transferred
during the fetch command. If the tag is not fetched by <br>
the helper a second fetch command will usually be sent to
ask for the tag specifically. Some helpers may be able to
use this option to avoid a second network connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">option dry-run {true|false}: If
true, pretend the operation completed successfully, but
don&acirc;t actually change any repository data. For most
helpers this only applies to the push, <br>
if supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">option servpath
&lt;c-style-quoted-path&gt; <br>
Sets service path (--upload-pack, --receive-pack etc.) for
next connect. Remote helper may support this option, but
must not rely on this option being set before connect <br>
request occurs.</p>
