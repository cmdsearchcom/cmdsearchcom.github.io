<p>SUMMER(1) Chiark-utils-bin SUMMER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
summer - print checksum and system metainformation for
files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
summer -ACDbfqtx [startpoint...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
summer prints the MD5 checksum of the contents, and the
system metainformation (ownership, permissions, timestamps,
etc.), for a file, or recursively for a whole directory
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each command line argument
should be a file or directory to be processed; if it is a
directory then it will be processed and then its contents
will also be processed, recur&acirc; <br>
sively. If no startpoints are specified on the command line
then summer will read a list of newline-separated
startpoints from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since summer correctly handles
devices, FIFOs and other non-regular files it is useful for
generating and comparing summaries of arbitrary directory
trees where md5sum alone <br>
would not be.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FORMAT <br>
summer prints one line of information for each filesystem
object it processes. Each line has the following
columns:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MD5 checksum (in hex) or file
type information <br>
Size of file in bytes <br>
File access rights (in octal) <br>
User ID of owner (in decimal) <br>
Group ID of owner (in decimal) <br>
atime (time of last access, decimal time_t) <br>
mtime (time of last modification) <br>
ctime (time of last status change) <br>
Filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For regular files, the first
column is the md5sum. For directories, pipes, symlinks and
sockets it is the literal string dir, mountpoint, pipe,
symlink or socket as appropriate. <br>
For devices it begins with c for character or b for block
devices, followed by the device number as a single 32 bit
hex number and as four separate 8 bit decimal numbers (most
<br>
significant first).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that any bytes in the
filename other than printing 7-bit ASCII are escaped using
syntax, where NN are two hex digits; backslashes are also
escaped in this way. This <br>
makes the output unambiguous. Filenames will be relative if
the relevant startpoint was relative, and absolute if it was
absolute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For symlinks the filename column
is followed by &lsquo; -&gt; &rsquo; (note the spaces) and
the target of the link, again escaped, as above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-A Do not print the atime (time of last access). The atime
column will be omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Do not print the ctime (time
of last status change). The ctime column will be
omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Do not print the mtime (time
of last modification). The mtime column will be omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Do not print directory sizes.
The size column for directories will read dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Do not print mtime (time of
last modification) for symbolic links. The mtime field for
symbolic links will read link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Do not print any times for
special files, symlinks, sockets, or fifos. The atime, mtime
and ctime fields for these objects will read char, block,
link, sock or pipe <br>
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Include information about
errors encountered (for example, unreadable files) in the
output, and continue processing. The default is to print
error information to standard <br>
error and stop immediately an error is encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Do not cross mountpoints
while recursing into subdirectories. Startpoints which are
mountpoints are descended into.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Suppress the progress
information which summer normally prints to standard
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Set the field separator
between the information and the filename to a tab character
(default is space).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Normally any errors (problems
accessing files including nonexistent startpoings, and the
like) are fatal; an error message is reported to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -f errors are nonfatal and
the problems are reported inline. The filesystem object with
the problem is reported in the normal way except that
instead of the check&acirc; <br>
sum, the string ] appears. Fields whose value could not be
determined are printed as ?.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print a brief usage message
to stderr (and do nothing else, exiting nonzero).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARSING THE OUTPUT <br>
If the first character in the line is ; this may be of
variable length and will be followed <br>
by one or more spaces. Otherwise the first field has a fixed
width: 64 characters, the size of an MD5 checksum
represented in hex, and is followed by a single space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The metadata fields are
space-separated but are also space-padded to a minimum
width: 10 characters for sizes and times and ids; 4
characters for the mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filename field, and optional
link target information, are of variable length, but they
are escaped so that they do not contain spaces.</p>
