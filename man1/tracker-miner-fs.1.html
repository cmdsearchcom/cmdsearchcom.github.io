<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tracker-miner-fs - Used to crawl the file system to mine
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tracker-miner-fs [OPTION...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tracker-miner-fs is not supposed to be run by the user since
it is started by its .desktop file when the user logs in. It
can also be started manually of course for debugging <br>
purposes. You can not run more than one instance of this at
the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tracker-miner-fs mines
information about applications and files only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-?, --help <br>
Show summary of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Returns the version of this binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbosity={0|1|2|3} <br>
Sets the logging level, 0=errors, 1=minimal, 2=detailed,
3=debug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --initial-sleep=SECONDS <br>
Sets the initial sleep time before crawling the file system
is started. If the --no-daemon option is used, this option
is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-daemon <br>
Tells the miner to exit once all indexing has finished and
the database is up to date. This is not the default mode of
operation for the miner, usually it stays around <br>
acting like a daemon to monitor file updates which may occur
over time. This option renders the --initial-sleep option
moot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --eligible=FILE <br>
Checks if FILE is eligible for being mined based on the
current configuration rules. In addition to this, it will
check if FILE would be monitored for changes. This works
<br>
with non-existing FILE arguments as well as existing FILE
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --disable-miner=MINER <br>
Tells the daemon to disable the in-house miners it supports.
Depending on build options, this can be &rsquo;Files&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Applications&rsquo; and &rsquo;Userguides&rsquo;.
This option can be provided <br>
more than once to diasable multiple miners. Disable in this
case means the miner is not started, though all miners still
register themselves on D-Bus and appear there, no <br>
actual action is performed otherwise (such as crawling,
setting up monitors, or checking mtimes against the file
system).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
TRACKER_USE_LOG_FILES <br>
Don&rsquo;t just log to stdout and stderr, but to log files
too which are kept in $HOME/.local/share/tracker/. This came
into effect in 0.15.3 and 0.16.0. After this version of <br>
Tracker, logging to file (usually useful for debugging) can
only be done by declaring this environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRACKER_USE_CONFIG_FILES <br>
Don&rsquo;t use GSettings, instead use a config file similar
to how settings were saved in 0.10.x. That is, a file which
is much like an .ini file. These are saved to <br>
$HOME/.config/tracker/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
tracker-store(1), tracker-info(1).</p>
