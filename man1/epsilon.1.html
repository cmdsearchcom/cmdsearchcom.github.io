<p>EPSILON(1) User Commands EPSILON(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
EPSILON - powerful Open Source wavelet image compressor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
epsilon COMMAND [OPTIONS] FILES...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
EPSILON is a powerful Open Source wavelet image compressor.
The project is aimed on parallel and robust image
processing. EPSILON source package consists of two core
parts: <br>
portable, well-designed, thread-safe library and codec,
build on the top of the library. The library API is very
clean, simple and carefully documented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EPSILON&rsquo;s compression
algorithm is based on wavelet transform and so called
embedded coding. The former is a well-known mathematical
theory and the latter is a very effective, <br>
yet simple method of progressive image coding. The actual
algorithm employed in EPSILON is called SPECK - Set
Partitioned Embedded bloCK coder introduced by Asad Islam
and <br>
William Pearlman.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the moment, EPSILON supports
more than 30 wavelet filters and have automated interface
for adding new ones. The script called make_filterbank.pl
translates XML-files with fil&acirc; <br>
ter descriptions to the C source code suitable for EPSILON.
So, the only manual operation is to copy-and-paste
program&rsquo;s output into the EPSILON&rsquo;s source code.
After recompila&acirc; <br>
tion new filters will be ready to use. Special note: if you
succeed in adding new filters, please send them to me. They
will be included into the main source tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EPSILON project follows an old
and fruitful UNIX tradition to Keep It Simple. For example,
EPSILON works with PPM (Portable PixelMap) and PGM (Portable
GrayMap) images only. They <br>
provide basic functionality and serve as a
least-common-denominator for interchanging truecolor and
grayscale images between different platforms and operating
systems. Looking <br>
for a converter? Try Netpbm (http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/)
- perfect Open Source tool-kit with more than 220 handy
utilities!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For storing and interchanging
compressed images EPSILON defines it&rsquo;s own PSI
(ePSIlon) file format. The PSI format is designed with
simplicity and fault-tolerance in mind. A typ&acirc; <br>
ical PSI file consists of several independent blocks. Each
block represents a tile from the original image and have
completely self-contained header. Each block is protected
with <br>
CRC and (actually with two CRCs: one for the header and
another for the data) separated from other blocks with a
special unique marker. This simple yet effective technique
makes <br>
stream synchronization and error localization almost
trivial. Moreover, block headers are saved as a plain text:
you can edit them by-hand with your favorite text editor.
Check <br>
it out!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EPSILON have a lot of
interesting features. For example, you can finely control
compression ratio (thank&lsquo;s to embedded coding),
manually distribute bit-budget among image chan&acirc; <br>
nels, switch to different encoding and filtering modes and
so on. EPSILON also supports HUGE files with constant memory
and linear time complexity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another nice feature is
multi-threading support. Try to (re)compile EPSILON with
Pthreads enabled (see INSTALL for more info) and you will
surely notice significant coding speed- <br>
up (assuming you have multicore CPU or several CPUs on you
computer).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of release 0.6.1 EPSILON also
supports clustering mode. This is a very powerful feature if
you have several machines linked with a high-capacity
network, say gigabit ethernet <br>
or even faster. To build cluster-aware EPSILON version
please read INSTALL file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although EPSILON have a rich set
of special ad-hoc options you are not obliged to use them.
Defaults are usually just fine. EPSILON&rsquo;s command line
interface is very friendly and <br>
designed to be similar to GZIP or BZIP. So, &lsquo;epsilon
foo.ppm&rsquo; and &lsquo;epsilon -d bar.psi&rsquo; is
usually enough.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Commands: <br>
-e, --encode-file <br>
Encode specified file(s). This is a default action if no
command is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --decode-file <br>
Decode specified file(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --truncate-file <br>
Truncate specified file(s). Due to embedded coding, block
truncation is equivalent to block re-compression. In other
words, truncation further compresses PSI-files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --start-node <br>
Start cluster node. Note: this option is available in
cluster-aware EPSILON version only and is intended for SLAVE
nodes. In other words, you should invoke epsilon -s on <br>
each SLAVE node in your cluster. Stopping cluster node is
even simpler: killall epsilon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command runs a daemon
program that accepts TCP connections at certain port (2718
by default). For each connection a new child process is
forked and the main program <br>
waits for a next connecton. Encoding and decoding statistics
is SYSLOG-ed using LOG_DAEMON facility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have DSH (Distributed
SHell) installed on MASTER node, you can also use two handy
scripts, namely start_epsilon_nodes.pl and
stop_epsilon_nodes.pl, for starting and <br>
stopping all cluster nodes respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Host configuration is taken from
so called .epsilon.nodes file. By default, program checks
.epsilon.nodes in the current directory. If there is no such
file, program <br>
tries .epsilon.nodes in user&lsquo;s home directory. You can
also explicitly specify file location as an argument to the
script. File format is described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --list-all-fb <br>
List all available filterbanks. This command shows ID, NAME
and orthogonality TYPE for each available filterbank. As of
release 0.8.1 EPSILON also supports lifting imple&acirc;
<br>
mentation of a famous Daubechies 9/7 biorthogonal wavelet
transform. It works faster than generic filter-based
counterpart. Default ID is daub97lift</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print program version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options to use with
&lsquo;--encode-file&rsquo; command: <br>
-f, --filter-id=ID <br>
Wavelet filterbank ID. See also --list-all-fb command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --block-size=VALUE <br>
Block size to use: 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 or 1024. The
default value is 256. Using very small blocks as well as
using very large blocks is not recommended: the former adds
<br>
substantial header overhead and the latter slows down
encoding/decoding without any profit in image quality.
Nevertheless, in some rare circumstances this rule is quite
<br>
opposite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --mode-normal <br>
Use so called normal processing mode. This mode can be used
with the both orthogonal and biorthogonal filters. In
practice you should avoid this parameter unless you are <br>
making some research in wavelets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --mode-otlpf <br>
Use so called OTLPF processing mode. In a few words, OTLPF
is some kind of hack to reduce boundary artefacts when image
is broken into several tiles (as usually happens). <br>
Due to mathematical constrains this method can be applied to
biorthogonal filters only. This option is turned on by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --ratio=VALUE <br>
With this parameter you can finely control desired
compression ratio. This value is not obliged to be integral:
for example, the value of 34.102 is just fine. For obvious
<br>
reasons compression ratio should be grater than 1. Although
EPSILON&rsquo;s bit-allocation algorithm is pretty precise,
too high compression ratios will be clipped due to block
<br>
headers overhead. On the other hand, blank image (e.g.
entirely black) surely will be encoded just in a couple of
hundreds of bytes regardless of compression ratio you <br>
desire. Nevertheless, for a most real-life images and
compression ratios (let us say 10..200) actual compression
ratio will be very close to the value you desire. Default
<br>
compression ratio is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2, --two-pass <br>
By default EPSILON uses constant bit-rate (CBR)
bit-allocation algorithm. CBR is pretty fast and usually
gives acceptable image quality. If image quality is a
concern, try <br>
two-pass variable bit-rate (VBR) bit-allocation algorithm
instead. VBR gives better results than CBR, but runs about
twice slower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --node-list <br>
File with cluster configuration. Note: this option is
available in cluster-aware EPSILON version only and is
intended for MASTER node. Each line in this file should
comply <br>
with the following format:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">user@host:port^number_of_CPUs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All fields are mandatory. No
comments, spaces or blank lines are allowed here. The second
field can be either IP address or host name. The last field
is actually the num&acirc; <br>
ber of simultaneous TCP connections with a corresponding
SLAVE node. Usually it is set to the number of CPUs or
somewhat larger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you omit this option, EPSILON
will try .epsilon.nodes in the current and home directory
(in that order).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note 1:
&Acirc;&acute;user&Acirc;&acute; field is used by
start_epsilon_nodes.pl and stop_epsilon_nodes.pl to SSH into
the target box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note 2:
&Acirc;&acute;port&Acirc;&acute; is EPSILON node&rsquo;s
port not SSH&rsquo;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --threads <br>
Number of encoding threads. Note: this option is available
in thread-aware EPSILON version only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--Y-ratio=VALUE,
--Cb-ratio=VALUE, --Cr-ratio=VALUE <br>
Bit-budget percent for the Y, Cb and Cr channels
respectively. The values should give 100% altogether. Note
that these options have sense for truecolor (i.e. PPM)
images <br>
only. The default values are 90-5-5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-resampling <br>
By default EPSILON resamples truecolor images using so
called 4:2:0 resampling scheme. This trick essentially
speed-ups encoding/decoding without sacrificing image
qual&acirc; <br>
ity. Usually there is no reason to disable resampling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options to use with
&lsquo;--decode-file&rsquo; command: <br>
-T, --threads <br>
Number of decoding threads. Note: this option is available
in thread-aware EPSILON version only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --node-list <br>
File with cluster configuration. Note: this option is
available in cluster-aware EPSILON version only and is
intended for MASTER node. Each line in this file should
comply <br>
with the following format:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">user@host:port^number_of_CPUs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All fields are mandatory. No
comments, spaces or blank lines are allowed here. The second
field can be either IP address or host name. The last field
is actually the num&acirc; <br>
ber of simultaneous TCP connections with a corresponding
SLAVE node. Usually it is set to the number of CPUs or
somewhat larger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you omit this option, EPSILON
will try .epsilon.nodes in the current and home directory
(in that order).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-hdr-crc <br>
Ignore header CRC errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-data-crc <br>
Ignore data CRC errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-format-err <br>
Skip over malformed blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options to use with
&lsquo;--truncate-file&rsquo; command: <br>
-r, --ratio=VALUE <br>
Desired truncation ratio. See also --truncate-file
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options to use with
&lsquo;--start-node&rsquo; command: <br>
-P, --port=VALUE <br>
By default cluster node listens port number 2718. With this
option you can set another port number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Common options: <br>
-H, --halt-on-errors <br>
By default if something fails EPSILON proceeds to the next
input file. With this option you can change default
behaviour: EPSILON will halt on first error. Note that in
<br>
MPI mode this option is not available and EPSILON always
halts on errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
By default EPSILON shows pretty statistics during its
operation. With this option you can ask EPSILON to be
quiet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --output-dir=DIR <br>
Output directory for encoded, decoded and truncated files.
If not set, output files will be saved in the same directory
as input ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help options: <br>
