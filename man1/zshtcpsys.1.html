zshtcpsys - zsh tcp system
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
A module <b>zsh/net/tcp</b> is provided to provide network I/O over TCP/IP from
  within the shell; see its description in <i>zshmodules</i>(1) . This manual
  page describes a function suite based on the module. If the module is
  installed, the functions are usually installed at the same time, in which case
  they will be available for autoloading in the default function search path. In
  addition to the <b>zsh/net/tcp</b> module, the <b>zsh/zselect</b> module is
  used to implement timeouts on read operations. For troubleshooting tips,
  consult the corresponding advice for the <b>zftp</b> functions described in
  <i>zshzftpsys</i>(1) .
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are functions corresponding to the basic I/O operations open, close, read
  and send, named <b>tcp_open</b> etc., as well as a function <b>tcp_expect</b>
  for pattern match analysis of data read as input. The system makes it easy to
  receive data from and send data to multiple named sessions at once. In
  addition, it can be linked with the shell's line editor in such a way that
  input data is automatically shown at the terminal. Other facilities available
  including logging, filtering and configurable output prompts.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To use the system where it is available, it should be enough to ` <b>autoload -U
  tcp_open</b>' and run <b>tcp_open</b> as documented below to start a session.
  The <b>tcp_open</b> function will autoload the remaining functions.

    <b>] [</b> <i>sess</i> <b>]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Open a new session. In the first and simplest form, open a
      TCP connection to host <i>host</i> at port <i>port</i>; numeric and
      symbolic forms are understood for both.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>sess</i> is given, this becomes the name of the session which can be used
  to refer to multiple different TCP connections. If <i>sess</i> is not given,
  the function will invent a numeric name value (note this is <i>not</i> the
  same as the file descriptor to which the session is attached). It is
  recommended that session names not include `funny' characters, where funny
  characters are not well-defined but certainly do not include alphanumerics or
  underscores, and certainly do include whitespace.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the second case, one or more sessions to be opened are given by name. A
  single session name is given after <b>-s</b> and a comma-separated list after
  <b>-l</b>; both options may be repeated as many times as necessary. A failure
  to open any session causes <b>tcp_open</b> to abort. The host and port are
  read from the file <b>.ztcp_sessions</b> in the same directory as the user's
  zsh initialisation files, i.e. usually the home directory, but <b>$ZDOTDIR</b>
  if that is set. The file consists of lines each giving a session name and the
  corresponding host and port, in that order (note the session name comes first,
  not last), separated by whitespace.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The third form allows passive and fake TCP connections. If the option <b>-a</b>
  is used, its argument is a file descriptor open for listening for connections.
  No function front-end is provided to open such a file descriptor, but a call
  to ` <b>ztcp -l</b> <i>port</i>' will create one with the file descriptor
  stored in the parameter <b>$REPLY</b>. The listening port can be closed with `
  <b>ztcp -c</b> <i>fd</i>'. A call to `<b>tcp_open -a</b> <i>fd</i>' will block
  until a remote TCP connection is made to <i>port</i> on the local machine. At
  this point, a session is created in the usual way and is largely
  indistinguishable from an active connection created with one of the first two
  forms.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the option <b>-f</b> is used, its argument is a file descriptor which is used
  directly as if it were a TCP session. How well the remainder of the TCP
  function system copes with this depends on what actually underlies this file
  descriptor. A regular file is likely to be unusable; a FIFO (pipe) of some
  sort will work better, but note that it is not a good idea for two different
  sessions to attempt to read from the same FIFO at once.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the option <b>-q</b> is given with any of the three forms, <b>tcp_open</b>
  will not print informational messages, although it will in any case exit with
  an appropriate status.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the line editor (zle) is in use, which is typically the case if the shell is
  interactive, <b>tcp_open</b> installs a handler inside <b>zle</b> which will
  check for new data at the same time as it checks for keyboard input. This is
  convenient as the shell consumes no CPU time while waiting; the test is
  performed by the operating system. Giving the option <b>-z</b> to any of the
  forms of <b>tcp_open</b> prevents the handler from being installed, so data
  must be read explicitly. Note, however, this is not necessary for executing
  complete sets of send and read commands from a function, as zle is not active
  at this point. Generally speaking, the handler is only active when the shell
  is waiting for input at a command prompt or in the <b>vared</b> builtin. The
  option has no effect if zle is not active; ` <b>[[ -o zle]]</b>' will test for
  this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first session to be opened becomes the current session and subsequent calls
  to <b>tcp_open</b> do not change it. The current session is stored in the
  parameter <b>$TCP_SESS</b>; see below for more detail about the parameters
  used by the system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The function <b>tcp_on_open</b>, if defined, is called when a session is opened.
  See the description below.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>tcp_close [-qn] [ -a | -l</b> <i>sess</i><b>,... |</b>
    <i>sess</i> <b>... ]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Close the named sessions, or the current session if none is
      given, or all open sessions if <b>-a</b> is given. The options <b>-l</b>
      and <b>-s</b> are both handled for consistency with <b>tcp_open</b>,
      although the latter is redundant.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the session being closed is the current one, <b>$TCP_SESS</b> is unset,
  leaving no current session, even if there are other sessions still open.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the session was opened with <b>tcp_open -f</b>, the file descriptor is closed
  so long as it is in the range 0 to 9 accessible directly from the command
  line. If the option <b>-n</b> is given, no attempt will be made to close file
  descriptors in this case. The <b>-n</b> option is not used for genuine
  <b>ztcp</b> session; the file descriptors are always closed with the session.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the option <b>-q</b> is given, no informational messages will be
  printed.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>tcp_read [-bdq] [ -t</b> <i>TO</i> <b>] [ -T</b>
    <i>TO</i> <b>]</b></dt>

  <br/>
   <b>[ -a | -u</b> <i>fd</i> <b>... | -l</b> <i>sess</i><b>,... | -s</b>
    <i>sess</i> <b>...]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Perform a read operation on the current session, or on a
      list of sessions if any are given with <b>-u</b>, <b>-l</b> or <b>-s</b>,
      or all open sessions if the option <b>-a</b> is given. Any of the
      <b>-u</b>, <b>-l</b> or <b>-s</b> options may be repeated or mixed
      together. The <b>-u</b> option specifies a file descriptor directly (only
      those managed by this system are useful), the other two specify sessions
      as described for <b>tcp_open</b> above.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
The function checks for new data available on all the sessions listed. Unless
  the <b>-b</b> option is given, it will not block waiting for new data. Any one
  line of data from any of the available sessions will be read, stored in the
  parameter <b>$TCP_LINE</b>, and displayed to standard output unless
  <b>$TCP_SILENT</b> contains a non-empty string. When printed to standard
  output the string <b>$TCP_PROMPT</b> will be shown at the start of the line;
  the default form for this includes the name of the session being read. See
  below for more information on these parameters. In this mode, <b>tcp_read</b>
  can be called repeatedly until it returns status 2 which indicates all pending
  input from all specified sessions has been handled.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With the option <b>-b</b>, equivalent to an infinite timeout, the function will
  block until a line is available to read from one of the specified sessions.
  However, only a single line is returned.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The option <b>-d</b> indicates that all pending input should be drained. In this
  case <b>tcp_read</b> may process multiple lines in the manner given above;
  only the last is stored in <b>$TCP_LINE</b>, but the complete set is stored in
  the array <b>$tcp_lines</b>. This is cleared at the start of each call to
  <b>tcp_read</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The options <b>-t</b> and <b>-T</b> specify a timeout in seconds, which may be a
  floating point number for increased accuracy. With <b>-t</b> the timeout is
  applied before each line read. With <b>-T</b>, the timeout applies to the
  overall operation, possibly including multiple read operations if the option
  <b>-d</b> is present; without this option, there is no distinction between
  <b>-t</b> and <b>-T</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The function does not print informational messages, but if the option <b>-q</b>
  is given, no error message is printed for a non-existent session.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A return status of 2 indicates a timeout or no data to read. Any other non-zero
  return status indicates some error condition.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See <b>tcp_log</b> for how to control where data is sent by
  <b>tcp_read</b>.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>tcp_send [-cnq] [ -s</b> <i>sess</i> <b>| -l</b>

  <dd class="It-tag">Send the supplied data strings to all the specified

      <b>print -r</b>' to the session's file descriptor, although it attempts to
      prevent the shell from dying owing to a <b>SIGPIPE</b> caused by an
      attempt to write to a defunct session.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
The option <b>-c</b> causes <b>tcp_send</b> to behave like <b>cat</b>. It reads
  lines from standard input until end of input and sends them in turn to the
  specified session(s) exactly as if they were given as <i>data</i> arguments to
  individual <b>tcp_send</b> commands.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The option <b>-n</b> prevents <b>tcp_send</b> from putting a newline at the end
  of the data strings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The remaining options all behave as for <b>tcp_read</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The data arguments are not further processed once they have been passed to
  <b>tcp_send</b>; they are simply passed down to <b>print -r</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the parameter <b>$TCP_OUTPUT</b> is a non-empty string and logging is enabled
  then the data sent to each session will be echoed to the log file(s) with
  <b>$TCP_OUTPUT</b> in front where appropriate, much in the manner of
  <b>$TCP_PROMPT</b>.</div>

The first form creates an alias for a session name; <i>alias</i> can then be
  used to refer to the existing session <i>sess</i>. As many aliases may be
  listed as required.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second form lists any aliases specified, or all aliases if none.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The third form deletes all the aliases listed. The underlying sessions are not
  affected.

The option <b>-q</b> suppresses an inconsistently chosen subset of error

      With no arguments, show the current status of logging.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
With the option <b>-s</b>, per-session logging is enabled. Input from
  <b>tcp_read</b> is output to the file <i>logfile</i>.<i>sess</i>. As the
  session is automatically discriminated by the filename, the contents are raw
  (no <b>$TCP_PROMPT</b>). The option <b>-a</b> applies as above. Per-session
  logging and logging of all data in one file are not mutually exclusive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The option <b>-c</b> closes all logging, both complete and per-session logs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The options <b>-n</b> and <b>-N</b> respectively turn off or restore output of
  data read by <b>tcp_read</b> to standard output; hence `<b>tcp_log -cn</b>'
  turns off all output by <b>tcp_read</b>.

With additional arguments, temporarily set the current session while executing

      the matching line is stored in <b>$TCP_LINE</b>, and the full set of lines
      read during the call to <b>tcp_expect</b> is stored in the array

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sessions are specified in the same way as <b>tcp_read</b>: the default is to use
  the current session, otherwise the sessions specified by <b>-a</b>, <b>-s</b>,
  or <b>-l</b> are used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each <i>pattern</i> is a standard zsh extended-globbing pattern; note that it
  needs to be quoted to avoid it being expanded immediately by filename
  generation. It must match the full line, so to match a substring there must be
  a ` <b>*</b>' at the start and end. The line matched against includes the
  <b>$TCP_PROMPT</b> added by <b>tcp_read</b>. It is possible to include the
  globbing flags ` <b>#b</b>' or `<b>#m</b>' in the patterns to make
  backreferences available in the parameters <b>$MATCH</b>, <b>$match</b>, etc.,
  as described in the base zsh documentation on pattern matching.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Unlike <b>tcp_read</b>, the default behaviour of <b>tcp_expect</b> is to block
  indefinitely until the required input is found. This can be modified by
  specifying a timeout with <b>-t</b> or <b>-T</b>; these function as in
  <b>tcp_read</b>, specifying a per-read or overall timeout, respectively, in
  seconds, as an integer or floating-point number. As <b>tcp_read</b>, the
  function returns status 2 if a timeout occurs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The function returns as soon as any one of the patterns given match. If the
  caller needs to know which of the patterns matched, the option <b>-p</b>
  <i>var</i> can be used; on return, <b>$var</b> is set to the number of the
  pattern using ordinary zsh indexing, i.e. the first is 1, and so on. Note the
  absence of a ` <b>$</b>' in front of <i>var</i>. To avoid clashes, the
  parameter cannot begin with ` <b>_expect</b>'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The option <b>-q</b> is passed directly down to <b>tcp_read</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As all input is done via <b>tcp_read</b>, all the usual rules about output of
  lines read apply. One exception is that the parameter <b>$tcp_lines</b> will
  only reflect the line actually matched by <b>tcp_expect</b>; use
  <b>$tcp_expect_lines</b> for the full set of lines read during the function
  call.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>tcp_proxy</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is a simple-minded function to accept a TCP connection
      and execute a command with I/O redirected to the connection. Extreme
      caution should be taken as there is no security whatsoever and this can
      leave your computer open to the world. Ideally, it should only be used
      behind a firewall.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first argument is a TCP port on which the function will listen.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The remaining arguments give a command and its arguments to execute with
  standard input, standard output and standard error redirected to the file

  a new zsh is started. This gives everyone on your network direct access to
  your account, which in many cases will be a bad thing.

<div class="Pp"></div>
The sessions may be selected explicitly with the standard <b>-a</b>, <b>-s</b>
  or <b>-l</b> options, or may be chosen implicitly. If none of the three
  options is given the rules are: first, if the array <b>$tcp_spam_list</b> is
  set, this is taken as the list of sessions, otherwise all sessions are taken.
  Second, any sessions given in the array <b>$tcp_no_spam_list</b> are removed
  from the list of sessions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally, any sessions added by the ` <b>-a</b>' flag or when all sessions are
  chosen implicitly are spammed in alphabetic order; sessions given by the
  <b>$tcp_spam_list</b> array or on the command line are spammed in the order
  given. The <b>-r</b> flag reverses the order however it was arrived it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-v</b> flag specifies that a <b>$TCP_PROMPT</b> will be output before
  each session. This is output after any modification to TCP_SESS by the
  user-defined <b>tcp_on_spam</b> function described below. (Obviously that
  function is able to generate its own output.)

An escape string, <b>$TCP_TALK_ESCAPE</b>, default `:', is used to allow access

  remainder of the line executed as shell input without any change of the line
  editor's operating mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The current implementation is somewhat deficient in terms of use of the command
  history. For this reason, many users will prefer to use some form of
  alternative approach for sending data easily to the current session. One

Certain functions, if defined by the user, will be called by the function system
  in certain contexts. This facility depends on the module <b>zsh/parameter</b>,
  which is usually available in interactive shells as the completion system
  depends on it. None of the functions need be defined; they simply provide
  convenient hooks when necessary.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Typically, these are called after the requested action has been taken, so that
  the various parameters will reflect the new state.

      <b>tcp_on_awol</b> is defined it is called immediately before this point.
      It may return status 100, which indicates that the normal handling should
      still be performed; any other return status indicates that no further
      action should be taken and the <b>tcp_fd_handler</b> should return

Parameters follow the usual convention that uppercase is used for scalars and

  always safe for user code to read these parameters. Some parameters may also

  are set by the function system for the user's benefit, i.e. setting them is
  typically not useful but is benign.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is often also useful to make settable parameters local to a function. For
  example, ` <b>local TCP_SILENT=1</b>' specifies that data read during the
  function call will not be printed to standard output, regardless of the
  setting outside the function. Likewise, ` <b>local TCP_SESS=</b><i>sess</i>'

The functions <b>tcp_read</b> and <b>tcp_expect</b> use the shell's

  <b>TCP_SECONDS_START</b> to the previous value of <b>$SECONDS</b>. If the
  parameter is already floating point, it is used without a local copy being
  created and <b>TCP_SECONDS_START</b> is not set. As the global value is zero,
  the shell elapsed time is guaranteed to be the sum of <b>$SECONDS</b> and
  <b>$TCP_SECONDS_START</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This can be avoided by setting <b>SECONDS</b> globally to a floating point value

Here is a trivial example using a remote calculator.
<div class="Pp"></div>
TO create a calculator server on port 7337 (see the <b>dc</b> manual page for
  quite how infuriating the underlying command is):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<b>tcp_proxy 7337 dc</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To connect to this from the same host with a session also named ` <b>dc</b>':

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<b>tcp_open localhost 7337 dc</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To send a command to the remote session and wait a short while for output
  (assuming <b>dc</b> is the current session):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<b>tcp_command 2 4 + p</b>

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<b>tcp_close</b>

<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>tcp_proxy</b> needs to be killed to be stopped. Note this will not
  usually kill any connections which have already been accepted, and also that

The function <b>tcp_read</b> uses the shell's normal <b>read</b> builtin. As
  this reads a complete line at once, data arriving without a terminating
  newline can cause the function to block indefinitely.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Though the function suite works well for interactive use and for data arriving
