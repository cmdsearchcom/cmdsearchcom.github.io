<p>ZSHTCPSYS(1) General Commands Manual ZSHTCPSYS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
zshtcpsys - zsh tcp system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
A module zsh/net/tcp is provided to provide network I/O over
TCP/IP from within the shell; see its description in
zshmodules(1) . This manual page describes a function suite
<br>
based on the module. If the module is installed, the
functions are usually installed at the same time, in which
case they will be available for autoloading in the default
func&acirc; <br>
tion search path. In addition to the zsh/net/tcp module, the
zsh/zselect module is used to implement timeouts on read
operations. For troubleshooting tips, consult the
corre&acirc; <br>
sponding advice for the zftp functions described in
zshzftpsys(1) .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are functions
corresponding to the basic I/O operations open, close, read
and send, named tcp_open etc., as well as a function
tcp_expect for pattern match analysis of data <br>
read as input. The system makes it easy to receive data from
and send data to multiple named sessions at once. In
addition, it can be linked with the shell&rsquo;s line
editor in <br>
such a way that input data is automatically shown at the
terminal. Other facilities available including logging,
filtering and configurable output prompts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use the system where it is
available, it should be enough to &lsquo;autoload -U
tcp_open&rsquo; and run tcp_open as documented below to
start a session. The tcp_open function will <br>
autoload the remaining functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP USER FUNCTIONS <br>
Basic I/O <br>
tcp_open [-qz] host port [ sess ] <br>
tcp_open [-qz] [ -s sess | -l sess,... ] ... <br>
tcp_open [-qz] [-a fd | -f fd ] [ sess ] <br>
Open a new session. In the first and simplest form, open a
TCP connection to host host at port port; numeric and
symbolic forms are understood for both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If sess is given, this becomes
the name of the session which can be used to refer to
multiple different TCP connections. If sess is not given,
the function will invent a <br>
numeric name value (note this is not the same as the file
descriptor to which the session is attached). It is
recommended that session names not include
&lsquo;funny&rsquo; charac&acirc; <br>
ters, where funny characters are not well-defined but
certainly do not include alphanumerics or underscores, and
certainly do include whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the second case, one or more
sessions to be opened are given by name. A single session
name is given after -s and a comma-separated list after -l;
both options may be <br>
repeated as many times as necessary. A failure to open any
session causes tcp_open to abort. The host and port are read
from the file .ztcp_sessions in the same direc&acirc; <br>
tory as the user&rsquo;s zsh initialisation files, i.e.
usually the home directory, but $ZDOTDIR if that is set. The
file consists of lines each giving a session name and the
<br>
corresponding host and port, in that order (note the session
name comes first, not last), separated by whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third form allows passive
and fake TCP connections. If the option -a is used, its
argument is a file descriptor open for listening for
connections. No function <br>
front-end is provided to open such a file descriptor, but a
call to &lsquo;ztcp -l port&rsquo; will create one with the
file descriptor stored in the parameter $REPLY. The
listening <br>
port can be closed with &lsquo;ztcp -c fd&rsquo;. A call to
&lsquo;tcp_open -a fd&rsquo; will block until a remote TCP
connection is made to port on the local machine. At this
point, a session <br>
is created in the usual way and is largely indistinguishable
from an active connection created with one of the first two
forms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the option -f is used, its
argument is a file descriptor which is used directly as if
it were a TCP session. How well the remainder of the TCP
function system copes <br>
with this depends on what actually underlies this file
descriptor. A regular file is likely to be unusable; a FIFO
(pipe) of some sort will work better, but note that it <br>
is not a good idea for two different sessions to attempt to
read from the same FIFO at once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the option -q is given with
any of the three forms, tcp_open will not print
informational messages, although it will in any case exit
with an appropriate status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the line editor (zle) is in
use, which is typically the case if the shell is
interactive, tcp_open installs a handler inside zle which
will check for new data at the <br>
same time as it checks for keyboard input. This is
convenient as the shell consumes no CPU time while waiting;
the test is performed by the operating system. Giving the
<br>
option -z to any of the forms of tcp_open prevents the
handler from being installed, so data must be read
explicitly. Note, however, this is not necessary for
executing <br>
complete sets of send and read commands from a function, as
zle is not active at this point. Generally speaking, the
handler is only active when the shell is waiting for <br>
input at a command prompt or in the vared builtin. The
option has no effect if zle is not active; &lsquo;[[ -o
zle]]&rsquo; will test for this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first session to be opened
becomes the current session and subsequent calls to tcp_open
do not change it. The current session is stored in the
parameter $TCP_SESS; <br>
see below for more detail about the parameters used by the
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The function tcp_on_open, if
defined, is called when a session is opened. See the
description below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_close [-qn] [ -a | -l
sess,... | sess ... ] <br>
Close the named sessions, or the current session if none is
given, or all open sessions if -a is given. The options -l
and -s are both handled for consistency with <br>
tcp_open, although the latter is redundant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the session being closed is
the current one, $TCP_SESS is unset, leaving no current
session, even if there are other sessions still open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the session was opened with
tcp_open -f, the file descriptor is closed so long as it is
in the range 0 to 9 accessible directly from the command
line. If the option -n <br>
is given, no attempt will be made to close file descriptors
in this case. The -n option is not used for genuine ztcp
session; the file descriptors are always closed with <br>
the session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the option -q is given, no
informational messages will be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_read [-bdq] [ -t TO ] [ -T
TO ] <br>
[ -a | -u fd ... | -l sess,... | -s sess ...] <br>
Perform a read operation on the current session, or on a
list of sessions if any are given with -u, -l or -s, or all
open sessions if the option -a is given. Any of the <br>
-u, -l or -s options may be repeated or mixed together. The
-u option specifies a file descriptor directly (only those
managed by this system are useful), the other two <br>
specify sessions as described for tcp_open above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The function checks for new data
available on all the sessions listed. Unless the -b option
is given, it will not block waiting for new data. Any one
line of data from <br>
any of the available sessions will be read, stored in the
parameter $TCP_LINE, and displayed to standard output unless
$TCP_SILENT contains a non-empty string. When <br>
printed to standard output the string $TCP_PROMPT will be
shown at the start of the line; the default form for this
includes the name of the session being read. See below <br>
for more information on these parameters. In this mode,
tcp_read can be called repeatedly until it returns status 2
which indicates all pending input from all specified <br>
sessions has been handled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the option -b, equivalent
to an infinite timeout, the function will block until a line
is available to read from one of the specified sessions.
However, only a sin&acirc; <br>
gle line is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -d indicates that all
pending input should be drained. In this case tcp_read may
process multiple lines in the manner given above; only the
last is stored in <br>
$TCP_LINE, but the complete set is stored in the array
$tcp_lines. This is cleared at the start of each call to
tcp_read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options -t and -T specify a
timeout in seconds, which may be a floating point number for
increased accuracy. With -t the timeout is applied before
each line read. <br>
With -T, the timeout applies to the overall operation,
possibly including multiple read operations if the option -d
is present; without this option, there is no distinc&acirc;
<br>
tion between -t and -T.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The function does not print
informational messages, but if the option -q is given, no
error message is printed for a non-existent session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A return status of 2 indicates a
timeout or no data to read. Any other non-zero return status
indicates some error condition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See tcp_log for how to control
where data is sent by tcp_read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_send [-cnq] [ -s sess | -l
sess,... ] data ... <br>
tcp_send [-cnq] -a data ... <br>
Send the supplied data strings to all the specified sessions
in turn. The underlying operation differs little from a
&lsquo;print -r&rsquo; to the session&rsquo;s file
descriptor, although <br>
it attempts to prevent the shell from dying owing to a
SIGPIPE caused by an attempt to write to a defunct
session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -c causes tcp_send to
behave like cat. It reads lines from standard input until
end of input and sends them in turn to the specified
session(s) exactly as if <br>
they were given as data arguments to individual tcp_send
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -n prevents tcp_send
from putting a newline at the end of the data strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remaining options all behave
as for tcp_read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The data arguments are not
further processed once they have been passed to tcp_send;
they are simply passed down to print -r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the parameter $TCP_OUTPUT is
a non-empty string and logging is enabled then the data sent
to each session will be echoed to the log file(s) with
$TCP_OUTPUT in front <br>
where appropriate, much in the manner of $TCP_PROMPT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Session Management <br>
tcp_alias [-q] alias=sess ... <br>
tcp_alias [-q] [ alias ] ... <br>
tcp_alias -d [-q] alias ... <br>
This function is not particularly well tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first form creates an alias
for a session name; alias can then be used to refer to the
existing session sess. As many aliases may be listed as
required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second form lists any
aliases specified, or all aliases if none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third form deletes all the
aliases listed. The underlying sessions are not
affected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -q suppresses an
inconsistently chosen subset of error messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_log [-asc] [ -n | -N ] [
logfile ] <br>
With an argument logfile, all future input from tcp_read
will be logged to the named file. Unless -a (append) is
given, this file will first be truncated or created <br>
empty. With no arguments, show the current status of
logging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the option -s, per-session
logging is enabled. Input from tcp_read is output to the
file logfile.sess. As the session is automatically
discriminated by the file&acirc; <br>
name, the contents are raw (no $TCP_PROMPT). The option -a
applies as above. Per-session logging and logging of all
data in one file are not mutually exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -c closes all
logging, both complete and per-session logs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options -n and -N
respectively turn off or restore output of data read by
tcp_read to standard output; hence &lsquo;tcp_log -cn&rsquo;
turns off all output by tcp_read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The function is purely a
convenient front end to setting the parameters $TCP_LOG,
$TCP_LOG_SESS, $TCP_SILENT, which are described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_rename old new <br>
Rename session old to session new. The old name becomes
invalid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_sess [ sess [ command ... ]
] <br>
With no arguments, list all the open sessions and associated
file descriptors. The current session is marked with a star.
For use in functions, direct access to the <br>
parameters $tcp_by_name, $tcp_by_fd and $TCP_SESS is
probably more convenient; see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With a sess argument, set the
current session to sess. This is equivalent to changing
$TCP_SESS directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With additional arguments,
temporarily set the current session while executing the
string command .... The first argument is re-evaluated so as
to expand aliases etc., <br>
but the remaining arguments are passed through as the appear
to tcp_sess. The original session is restored when tcp_sess
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Advanced I/O <br>
tcp_command send-options ... send-arguments ... <br>
This is a convenient front-end to tcp_send. All arguments
are passed to tcp_send, then the function pauses waiting for
data. While data is arriving at least every <br>
$TCP_TIMEOUT (default 0.3) seconds, data is handled and
printed out according to the current settings. Status 0 is
always returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is generally only useful
for interactive use, to prevent the display becoming
fragmented by output returned from the connection. Within a
programme or function it is <br>
generally better to handle reading data by a more explicit
method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_expect [ -q ] [ -p var ] [
-t to | -T TO] <br>
[ -a | -s sess ... | -l sess,... ] pattern ... <br>
Wait for input matching any of the given patterns from any
of the specified sessions. Input is ignored until an input
line matches one of the given patterns; at this <br>
point status zero is returned, the matching line is stored
in $TCP_LINE, and the full set of lines read during the call
to tcp_expect is stored in the array <br>
$tcp_expect_lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sessions are specified in the
same way as tcp_read: the default is to use the current
session, otherwise the sessions specified by -a, -s, or -l
are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each pattern is a standard zsh
extended-globbing pattern; note that it needs to be quoted
to avoid it being expanded immediately by filename
generation. It must match the <br>
full line, so to match a substring there must be a
&lsquo;*&rsquo; at the start and end. The line matched
against includes the $TCP_PROMPT added by tcp_read. It is
possible to <br>
include the globbing flags &lsquo;#b&rsquo; or
&lsquo;#m&rsquo; in the patterns to make backreferences
available in the parameters $MATCH, $match, etc., as
described in the base zsh documentation <br>
on pattern matching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike tcp_read, the default
behaviour of tcp_expect is to block indefinitely until the
required input is found. This can be modified by specifying
a timeout with -t or <br>
-T; these function as in tcp_read, specifying a per-read or
overall timeout, respectively, in seconds, as an integer or
floating-point number. As tcp_read, the function <br>
returns status 2 if a timeout occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The function returns as soon as
any one of the patterns given match. If the caller needs to
know which of the patterns matched, the option -p var can be
used; on return, <br>
$var is set to the number of the pattern using ordinary zsh
indexing, i.e. the first is 1, and so on. Note the absence
of a &lsquo;$&rsquo; in front of var. To avoid clashes, the
<br>
parameter cannot begin with &lsquo;_expect&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -q is passed directly
down to tcp_read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As all input is done via
tcp_read, all the usual rules about output of lines read
apply. One exception is that the parameter $tcp_lines will
only reflect the line actu&acirc; <br>
ally matched by tcp_expect; use $tcp_expect_lines for the
full set of lines read during the function call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_proxy <br>
This is a simple-minded function to accept a TCP connection
and execute a command with I/O redirected to the connection.
Extreme caution should be taken as there is no <br>
security whatsoever and this can leave your computer open to
the world. Ideally, it should only be used behind a
firewall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first argument is a TCP port
on which the function will listen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remaining arguments give a
command and its arguments to execute with standard input,
standard output and standard error redirected to the file
descriptor on which the <br>
TCP session has been accepted. If no command is given, a new
zsh is started. This gives everyone on your network direct
access to your account, which in many cases will <br>
be a bad thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command is run in the
background, so tcp_proxy can then accept new connections. It
continues to accept new connections until interrupted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_spam [-ertv] [ -a | -s sess
| -l sess,... ] cmd ... <br>
Execute &lsquo;cmd ...&rsquo; for each session in turn. Note
this executes the command and arguments; it does not send
the command line as data unless the -t (transmit) option is
<br>
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sessions may be selected
explicitly with the standard -a, -s or -l options, or may be
chosen implicitly. If none of the three options is given the
rules are: first, <br>
if the array $tcp_spam_list is set, this is taken as the
list of sessions, otherwise all sessions are taken. Second,
any sessions given in the array $tcp_no_spam_list are <br>
removed from the list of sessions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, any sessions added by
the &lsquo;-a&rsquo; flag or when all sessions are chosen
implicitly are spammed in alphabetic order; sessions given
by the $tcp_spam_list array or on <br>
the command line are spammed in the order given. The -r flag
reverses the order however it was arrived it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -v flag specifies that a
$TCP_PROMPT will be output before each session. This is
output after any modification to TCP_SESS by the
user-defined tcp_on_spam function <br>
described below. (Obviously that function is able to
generate its own output.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the option -e is present, the
line given as cmd ... is executed using eval, otherwise it
is executed without any further processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_talk <br>
This is a fairly simple-minded attempt to force input to the
line editor to go straight to the default TCP_SESSION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An escape string,
$TCP_TALK_ESCAPE, default &lsquo;:&rsquo;, is used to allow
access to normal shell operation. If it is on its own at the
start of the line, or followed only by <br>
whitespace, the line editor returns to normal operation.
Otherwise, the string and any following whitespace are
skipped and the remainder of the line executed as shell <br>
input without any change of the line editor&rsquo;s
operating mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current implementation is
somewhat deficient in terms of use of the command history.
For this reason, many users will prefer to use some form of
alternative approach <br>
for sending data easily to the current session. One simple
approach is to alias some special character (such as
&lsquo;%&rsquo;) to &lsquo;tcp_command --&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_wait <br>
The sole argument is an integer or floating point number
which gives the seconds to delay. The shell will do nothing
for that period except wait for input on all TCP ses&acirc;
<br>
sions by calling tcp_read -a. This is similar to the
interactive behaviour at the command prompt when zle
handlers are installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;One-shot&rsquo; file
transfer <br>
tcp_point port <br>
tcp_shoot host port <br>
This pair of functions provide a simple way to transfer a
file between two hosts within the shell. Note, however, that
bulk data transfer is currently done using cat. <br>
tcp_point reads any data arriving at port and sends it to
standard output; tcp_shoot connects to port on host and
sends its standard input. Any unused port may be used; <br>
the standard mechanism for picking a port is to think of a
random four-digit number above 1024 until one works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To transfer a file from host
woodcock to host springes, on springes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_point 8091
&gt;output_file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and on woodcock:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_shoot springes 8091
&lt;input_file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As these two functions do not
require tcp_open to set up a TCP connection first, they may
need to be autoloaded separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP USER-DEFINED FUNCTIONS <br>
Certain functions, if defined by the user, will be called by
the function system in certain contexts. This facility
depends on the module zsh/parameter, which is usually
avail&acirc; <br>
able in interactive shells as the completion system depends
on it. None of the functions need be defined; they simply
provide convenient hooks when necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typically, these are called
after the requested action has been taken, so that the
various parameters will reflect the new state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_on_alias alias fd <br>
When an alias is defined, this function will be called with
two arguments: the name of the alias, and the file
descriptor of the corresponding session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_on_awol sess fd <br>
If the function tcp_fd_handler is handling input from the
line editor and detects that the file descriptor is no
longer reusable, by default it removes it from the list of
<br>
file descriptors handled by this method and prints a
message. If the function tcp_on_awol is defined it is called
immediately before this point. It may return status <br>
100, which indicates that the normal handling should still
be performed; any other return status indicates that no
further action should be taken and the tcp_fd_handler <br>
should return immediately with the given status. Typically
the action of tcp_on_awol will be to close the session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The variable TCP_INVALIDATE_ZLE
will be a non-empty string if it is necessary to invalidate
the line editor display using &lsquo;zle -I&rsquo; before
printing output from the func&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(&lsquo;AWOL&rsquo; is military
jargon for &lsquo;absent without leave&rsquo; or some
variation. It has no pre-existing technical meaning known to
the author.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_on_close sess fd <br>
This is called with the name of a session being closed and
the file descriptor which corresponded to that session. Both
will be invalid by the time the function is <br>
called.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_on_open sess fd <br>
This is called after a new session has been defined with the
session name and file descriptor as arguments. If it returns
a non-zero status, opening the session is <br>
assumed to fail and the session is closed again; however,
tcp_open will continue to attempt to open any remaining
sessions given on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_on_rename oldsess fd newsess
<br>
This is called after a session has been renamed with the
three arguments old session name, file descriptor, new
session name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_on_spam sess command ...
<br>
This is called once for each session spammed, just before a
command is executed for a session by tcp_spam. The arguments
are the session name followed by the command list <br>
to be executed. If tcp_spam was called with the option -t,
the first command will be tcp_send.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This function is called after
$TCP_SESS is set to reflect the session to be spammed, but
before any use of it is made. Hence it is possible to alter
the value of <br>
$TCP_SESS within this function. For example, the session
arguments to tcp_spam could include extra information to be
stripped off and processed in tcp_on_spam.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the function sets the
parameter $REPLY to &lsquo;done&rsquo;, the command line is
not executed; in addition, no prompt is printed for the -v
option to tcp_spam.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_on_unalias alias fd <br>
This is called with the name of an alias and the
corresponding session&rsquo;s file descriptor after an alias
has been deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP UTILITY FUNCTIONS <br>
The following functions are used by the TCP function system
but will rarely if ever need to be called directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_fd_handler <br>
This is the function installed by tcp_open for handling
input from within the line editor, if that is required. It
is in the format documented for the builtin &lsquo;zle
-F&rsquo; in <br>
zshzle(1) .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While active, the function sets
the parameter TCP_HANDLER_ACTIVE to 1. This allows shell
code called internally (for example, by setting tcp_on_read)
to tell if is being <br>
called when the shell is otherwise idle at the editor
prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_output [ -q ] -P prompt -F
fd -S sess <br>
This function is used for both logging and handling output
to standard output, from within tcp_read and (if $TCP_OUTPUT
is set) tcp_send.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The prompt to use is specified
by -P; the default is the empty string. It can contain: <br>
%c Expands to 1 if the session is the current session,
otherwise 0. Used with ternary expressions such as
&lsquo;%(c.-.+)&rsquo; to output &lsquo;+&rsquo; for the
current session and &lsquo;-&rsquo; <br>
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%f Replaced by the
session&rsquo;s file descriptor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s Replaced by the session
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%% Replaced by a single
&lsquo;%&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -q suppresses output
to standard output, but not to any log files which are
configured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -S and -F options are used
to pass in the session name and file descriptor for possible
replacement in the prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP USER PARAMETERS <br>
Parameters follow the usual convention that uppercase is
used for scalars and integers, while lowercase is used for
normal and associative array. It is always safe for user
code <br>
to read these parameters. Some parameters may also be set;
these are noted explicitly. Others are included in this
group as they are set by the function system for the
user&rsquo;s <br>
benefit, i.e. setting them is typically not useful but is
benign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is often also useful to make
settable parameters local to a function. For example,
&lsquo;local TCP_SILENT=1&rsquo; specifies that data read
during the function call will not be printed <br>
to standard output, regardless of the setting outside the
function. Likewise, &lsquo;local TCP_SESS=sess&rsquo; sets a
session for the duration of a function, and &lsquo;local
TCP_PROMPT=&rsquo; speci&acirc; <br>
fies that no prompt is used for input during the
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_expect_lines <br>
Array. The set of lines read during the last call to
tcp_expect, including the last ($TCP_LINE).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_filter <br>
Array. May be set directly. A set of extended globbing
patterns which, if matched in tcp_output, will cause the
line not to be printed to standard output. The patterns <br>
should be defined as described for the arguments to
tcp_expect. Output of line to log files is not affected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP_HANDLER_ACTIVE <br>
Scalar. Set to 1 within tcp_fd_handler to indicate to
functions called recursively that they have been called
during an editor session. Otherwise unset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP_LINE <br>
The last line read by tcp_read, and hence also
tcp_expect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP_LINE_FD <br>
The file descriptor from which $TCP_LINE was read.
${tcp_by_fd[$TCP_LINE_FD]} will give the corresponding
session name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_lines <br>
Array. The set of lines read during the last call to
tcp_read, including the last ($TCP_LINE).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP_LOG <br>
May be set directly, although it is also controlled by
tcp_log. The name of a file to which output from all
sessions will be sent. The output is proceeded by the usual
<br>
$TCP_PROMPT. If it is not an absolute path name, it will
follow the user&rsquo;s current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP_LOG_SESS <br>
May be set directly, although it is also controlled by
tcp_log. The prefix for a set of files to which output from
each session separately will be sent; the full filename <br>
is ${TCP_LOG_SESS}.sess. Output to each file is raw; no
prompt is added. If it is not an absolute path name, it will
follow the user&rsquo;s current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_no_spam_list <br>
Array. May be set directly. See tcp_spam for how this is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP_OUTPUT <br>
May be set directly. If a non-empty string, any data sent to
a session by tcp_send will be logged. This parameter gives
the prompt to be used in a file specified by <br>
$TCP_LOG but not in a file generated from $TCP_LOG_SESS. The
prompt string has the same format as TCP_PROMPT and the same
rules for its use apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP_PROMPT <br>
May be set directly. Used as the prefix for data read by
tcp_read which is printed to standard output or to the log
file given by $TCP_LOG, if any. Any &lsquo;%s&rsquo;,
&lsquo;%f&rsquo; or <br>
&lsquo;%%&rsquo; occurring in the string will be replaced by
the name of the session, the session&rsquo;s underlying file
descriptor, or a single &lsquo;%&rsquo;, respectively. The
expression &lsquo;%c&rsquo; <br>
expands to 1 if the session being read is the current
session, else 0; this is most useful in ternary expressions
such as &lsquo;%(c.-.+)&rsquo; which outputs &lsquo;+&rsquo;
if the session is <br>
the current one, else &lsquo;-&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP_READ_DEBUG <br>
May be set directly. If this has non-zero length, tcp_read
will give some limited diagnostics about data being
read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP_SECONDS_START <br>
This value is created and initialised to zero by
tcp_open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The functions tcp_read and
tcp_expect use the shell&rsquo;s SECONDS parameter for their
own timing purposes. If that parameter is not of floating
point type on entry to one of <br>
the functions, it will create a local parameter SECONDS
which is floating point and set the parameter
TCP_SECONDS_START to the previous value of $SECONDS. If the
parame&acirc; <br>
ter is already floating point, it is used without a local
copy being created and TCP_SECONDS_START is not set. As the
global value is zero, the shell elapsed time is <br>
guaranteed to be the sum of $SECONDS and
$TCP_SECONDS_START.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be avoided by setting
SECONDS globally to a floating point value using
&lsquo;typeset -F SECONDS&rsquo;; then the TCP functions
will never make a local copy and never set <br>
TCP_SECONDS_START to a non-zero value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP_SESS <br>
May be set directly. The current session; must refer to one
of the sessions established by tcp_open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP_SILENT <br>
May be set directly, although it is also controlled by
tcp_log. If of non-zero length, data read by tcp_read will
not be written to standard output, though may still be <br>
written to a log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_spam_list <br>
Array. May be set directly. See the description of the
function tcp_spam for how this is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP_TALK_ESCAPE <br>
May be set directly. See the description of the function
tcp_talk for how this is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP_TIMEOUT <br>
May be set directly. Currently this is only used by the
function tcp_command, see above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP USER-DEFINED PARAMETERS <br>
The following parameters are not set by the function system,
but have a special effect if set by the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_on_read <br>
This should be an associative array; if it is not, the
behaviour is undefined. Each key is the name of a shell
function or other command, and the corresponding value is a
<br>
shell pattern (using EXTENDED_GLOB). Every line read from a
TCP session directly or indirectly using tcp_read (which
includes lines read by tcp_expect) is compared <br>
against the pattern. If the line matches, the command given
in the key is called with two arguments: the name of the
session from which the line was read, and the line <br>
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any function called to handle
a line returns a non-zero status, the line is not output.
Thus a tcp_on_read handler containing only the instruction
&lsquo;return 1&rsquo; can be <br>
used to suppress output of particular lines (see, however,
tcp_filter above). However, the line is still stored in
TCP_LINE and tcp_lines; this occurs after all <br>
tcp_on_read processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP UTILITY PARAMETERS <br>
These parameters are controlled by the function system; they
may be read directly, but should not usually be set by user
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_aliases <br>
Associative array. The keys are the names of sessions
established with tcp_open; each value is a space-separated
list of aliases which refer to that session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_by_fd <br>
Associative array. The keys are session file descriptors;
each value is the name of that session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_by_name <br>
Associative array. The keys are the names of sessions; each
value is the file descriptor associated with that
session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP EXAMPLES <br>
Here is a trivial example using a remote calculator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TO create a calculator server on
port 7337 (see the dc manual page for quite how infuriating
the underlying command is):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_proxy 7337 dc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To connect to this from the same
host with a session also named &lsquo;dc&rsquo;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_open localhost 7337 dc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To send a command to the remote
session and wait a short while for output (assuming dc is
the current session):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_command 2 4 + p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To close the session:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_close</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tcp_proxy needs to be killed
to be stopped. Note this will not usually kill any
connections which have already been accepted, and also that
the port is not immediately <br>
available for reuse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following chunk of code puts
a list of sessions into an xterm header, with the current
session followed by a star.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print -n &quot; 33]2;TCP:&quot;
${(k)tcp_by_name:/$TCP_SESS/$TCP_SESS &quot;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP BUGS <br>
The function tcp_read uses the shell&rsquo;s normal read
builtin. As this reads a complete line at once, data
arriving without a terminating newline can cause the
function to block <br>
indefinitely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Though the function suite works
well for interactive use and for data arriving in small
amounts, the performance when large amounts of data are
being exchanged is likely to be <br>
extremely poor.</p>
