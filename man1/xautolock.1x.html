<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xautolock - fire up programs in case of user inactivity
under X</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION <br>
This man page applies to xautolock version 2.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xautolock [-help] [-version] [-time mins] [-locker locker]

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Xautolock monitors the user activity on an X Window display.
If none is detected within mins minutes, a program is
started as specified by the -locker option. Xautolock will
typ&acirc; <br>
ically be used to lock the screen (hence its primary name)
but it really doesn&rsquo;t care what program you make it
start. For this reason, xautolock does not interfere with
the <br>
default X screen saver, unless the -resetsaver option is
used. This implies that it is the job of the locker or the
user to take the appropriate actions if the default screen
<br>
saver is to be disabled. The only real assumption made by
xautolock is that a new countdown starts as soon as the
locker exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the presence of the -notify
option, a warning signal will be issued margin seconds
before starting the locker. Warning signals come in two
kinds:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You can use the
-notifier option to specify the command to be issued to
perform notification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Alternatively,
you can let xautolock ring the bell. In this case, the -bell
option specifies the loudness of the signal in percent, as
described in the XBell man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can tell xautolock to take
special actions when you move the mouse into one of the
corners of the display and leave it there, by using the
-corners, -cornerdelay, -cornerre&acirc; <br>
delay and -cornersize options. This works as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The xxxx argument to the
-corners option must consist of exactly 4 characters from
the following set: &rsquo;0&rsquo;, &rsquo;+&rsquo;,
&rsquo;-&rsquo;. Each one of these specifies what xautolock
should do when the <br>
mouse enters a small square area located in each of the
corners of the screen. The corners are considered in the
following order: top left, top right, bottom left, bottom
right. <br>
A &rsquo;0&rsquo; indicates that xautolock should ignore the
corner. A &rsquo;+&rsquo; indicates that xautolock should
start the locker after secs or altsecs seconds (see below
for the difference <br>
between both), unless the mouse is moved or keyboard input
is received. A &rsquo;-&rsquo; indicates that xautolock
should not start the locker at all. The pixels argument
specifies the size <br>
in pixels of the corner areas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most users of the -corners
option want the locker to activate within a very short time
interval after they move the mouse into a &rsquo;+&rsquo;
corner. This can be achieved by specifying a <br>
small value for the -cornerdelay option. However, if the
mouse is subsequently left where it is, xautolock will
almost immediately start a new locker right after the user
quits <br>
the current one. To prevent this from happening, the
-cornerredelay option can be used to specify the time-out
interval to be used if and only if the mouse is sitting in a
&lsquo;+&rsquo; <br>
corner and has not been moved since the previous locker
exited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A running xautolock process can
be disabled (unless if the -secure option has been
specified), in which case it will not attempt to start the
locker. To disable an already run&acirc; <br>
ning xautolock process, use the -disable option. To
re-enable it, use -enable. To toggle it between both states,
use -toggle. Using this method is preferable to using
sending it <br>
SIGSTOP and SIGCONT signals, because while disabled
xautolock will still be emptying its event queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A running xautolock process can
also be told to exit (unless if the -secure option has been
specified). To do this, use the -exit option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -killtime and -killer
options allow, amongst other things, to implement an
additional automatic logout, on top of the automatic screen
locking. In the presence of one or both <br>
of these options, a secondary timeout will be triggered
killmins after starting the locker (unless user activity is
detected in the mean time). Upon expiration of this
secondary <br>
timer, the killer program is run. Note that, despite the
name of the options, xautolock really doesn&rsquo;t care
what the killer does in reality. If it doesn&rsquo;t
(indirectly) cause xau&acirc; <br>
tolock to get killed, and assuming that no user activity is
detected, the secondary trigger will periodically expire
every killmins minutes for as long as the locker runs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In combination with -killtime
and -killer, the -secure option allows system administrators
to enforce xautolock as a part of their security procedures,
and to prevent people from <br>
locking shared displays for an excessive amount of time. One
way to achieve this is to start xautolock (using -secure and
optionally -killtime and -killer) from within XDM&rsquo;s
<br>
Xsession file in such a way that the session automatically
ends if xautolock itself is killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default xautolock closes
stdout and stderr. This prevents the locker from writing
error messages to these files in case you manually lock your
display. The -nocloseout, <br>
-nocloseerr and -noclose options cause xautolock to not
close stdout and/or stderr. On some platforms users of
xnlock will need to use -nocloseout, in order to make
xnlock&rsquo;s <br>
witty sayings show up. These options can also be used for
debugging cases in which locker invocation is not
successful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xautolock is capable of managing
multi-headed displays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-help Print a help message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version Print the version
number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-time Specifies the primary
timeout interval. The default is 10 minutes, the minimum is
1 minute, and the maximum is 1 hour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-locker Specifies the locker to
be used. The default is xlock. Notice that if locker
contains multiple words, it must be specified between
quotes. In order to use your <br>
PATH to locate the program, xautolock feeds the locker
command to /bin/sh, so it should be understandable for
whatever shell your /bin/sh is. Because this typi&acirc;
<br>
cally is a Bourne shell, ~ expansion most likely will not
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-killtime Specifies the
secondary timeout in minutes after starting the locker. This
timer is only active as long as the locker is running, and
is reset each time user <br>
activity is detected. If it expires before the locker exits,
the killer command is run. The default is 20 minutes, the
minimum is 10 minutes, and the maximum is 2 <br>
hours. This option is only useful in conjunction with
-killer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-killer Specifies the killer to
be used. The default is none. Notice that if killer contains
multiple words, it must be specified between quotes. In
order to use your <br>
PATH to locate the program, xautolock feeds the killr
command to /bin/sh, so it should be understandable for
whatever shell your /bin/sh is. Because this typi&acirc;
<br>
cally is a Bourne shell, ~ expansion most likely will not
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-notify Warn the user margin
seconds before locking. The default is to not warn the user.
If used in conjunction with -cornerdelay or -cornerredelay,
the notification <br>
margin iused is the minimum of margin, secs and/or
altsecs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-notifier Specifies the notifier
to be used. The default is none. This option is only useful
in conjunction with -notify. Notice that if notifier
contains multiple words, <br>
it must be specified between quotes. In order to use your
PATH to locate the program, xautolock feeds the notifier
command to /bin/sh, so it should be under&acirc; <br>
standable for whatever shell your /bin/sh is. Because this
typically is a Bourne shell, ~ expansion most likely will
not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bell Specifies the loudness of
the notification signal in the absence of the -notifier
option. The default is 40 percent. This option is only
useful in conjunction <br>
with -notify.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-corners Define special actions
to be taken when the mouse enters one of the corners of the
display. The default is 0000, which means that no special
action is taken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cornerdelay Specifies the
number of seconds to wait before reacting to the mouse
entering a &rsquo;+&rsquo; corner. The default is 5
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cornerredelay Specifies the
number of seconds to wait before reacting again if the
current locker exits while the mouse is sitting in a
&rsquo;+&rsquo; corner. The default is for altsecs <br>
to equal secs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cornersize Specifies the size
in pixels of the corner areas. The default is 10 pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-resetsaver Causes xautolock to
reset the X screen saver after successfully starting the
locker. This is typically used in case the locker is not
really intended to lock the <br>
screen, but to replace the default X screen saver. Note that
the default screen saver is not disabled, only reset. Also
note that using -resetsaver will infer&acirc; <br>
fere with the DPMS monitors, as the power down time out will
also be also reset. The default is not to reset the screen
saver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the xset man page for more
information about managing the X screen saver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-detectsleep Instructs xautolock
to detect that computer has been put to sleep. This is done
by detecting that time has jumped by more than 3 seconds.
When this occurs, the <br>
lock timer is reset and locker program is not launched even
if primary timeout has been reached. This option is
typically used to avoid locker program to be <br>
launched when awaking a laptop computer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-secure Instructs xautolock to
run in secure mode. In this mode, xautolock becomes imune to
the effects of -enable, -disable, -toggle, and -exit. The
default is to honour <br>
these actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nocloseout Don&rsquo;t close
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nocloseerr Don&rsquo;t close
stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noclose Close neither stdout
nor stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-disable Disables an already
running xautolock process (if there is one, and it does not
have -secure switched on). In any case, the current
invocation of xautolock exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-enable Enables an already
running xautolock process (if there is one, and it does not
have -secure switched on). In any case, the current
invocation of xautolock exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-toggle Toggles an already
running xautolock process (if there is one, and it does not
have -secure switched on) between its disabled and enabled
modes of operation. In <br>
any case, the current invocation of xautolock exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-exit Causes an already running
xautolock process (if there is one, and it does not have
-secure switched on) to exit. In any case, the current
invocation of xautolock <br>
also exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-locknow Causes an already
running xautolock process (if there is one, if it does not
have -secure switched on, and is not currently disabled) to
lock the display immedi&acirc; <br>
ately. In any case, the current invocation of xautolock
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-unlocknow Causes an already
running xautolock process (if there is one, if it does not
have -secure switched on, and is not currently disabled) to
unlock the display imme&acirc; <br>
diately (if it&rsquo;s locked) by sending the locker a
SIGTERM signal. In any case, the current invocation of
xautolock exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nowlocker Specifies the locker
to be used if the lock is initiated with -locknow option.
The default is to use the locker program given with -locker
option, which defaults <br>
to xlock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-restart Causes an already
running xautolock process (if there is one and it does not
have -secure switched on) to restart. In any case, the
current invocation of xau&acirc; <br>
tolock exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESOURCES <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noclose Close neither stdout nor
stderr. Boolean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resources can be specified in
your ~/.Xresources or ~/.Xdefaults file (whichever your
system uses) and merged via the xrdb(1) command. They can be
specified either for class Xau&acirc; <br>
tolock, or for whatever name your xautolock program has been
given. This can be useful in case xautolock is to be used
for other purposes than simply locking the screen. For <br>
example: if you have two copies of xautolock, one called
&quot;xmonitor&quot;, and one called &quot;xlogout&quot;,
then both will honour the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xautolock.corners: ++++</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition,
&quot;xmonitor&quot; will honour:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xmonitor.cornersize: 10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while &quot;xlogout&quot; will
honour:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xlogout.cornersize: 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each command line option takes
precedence over the corresponding (default) resource
specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN BUGS <br>
The -disable, -enable, -toggle, -exit, -locknow, -unlocknow,
and -restart options depend on access to the X server to do
their work. This implies that they will be suspended in <br>
case some other application has grabbed the server all for
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If, when creating a window, an
application waits for more than 30 seconds before selecting
KeyPress events on non-leaf windows, xautolock may interfere
with the event propagation <br>
mechanism. This effect is theoretical and has never been
observed in real life. It can only occur in case xautolock
has been compiled without support for both the Xidle and the
<br>
MIT ScreenSaver extensions, or in case the X server does not
support these extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xautolock does not always
properly handle the secure keyboard mode of terminal
emulators like xterm, since that mode will prevent xautolock
from noticing the keyboard events <br>
occurring on the terminal. Therefore, xautolock sometimes
thinks that there is no keyboard activity while in reality
there is. This can only occur in case xautolock has been
com&acirc; <br>
piled without support for both the Xidle and the MIT
ScreenSaver extensions, or in case the X server does not
support these extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xautolock does not check whether
notifier and/or locker are available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The xautolock resources have
dummy resource classes.</p>
