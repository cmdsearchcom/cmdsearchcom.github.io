Mup is a program for producing printed music. There is an optional companion
  program called Mupmate that provides a more graphical user interface on top of
  Mup, but this manual page describes the command line interface. The Mup User's
  Guide should be consulted for details of the format of the input file. Options
  include:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-c</b> <i>N</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Combine consecutive measures of all rests or spaces into
      multirests (multiple measures of rest printed as a single measure, with
      the number of measures of rest printed above the staff). Any time there
      are <i>N</i> or more measures in a row that consist entirely of rests or
      spaces, they will be replaced by a multirest. The combining of measures
      stops when there is a visible staff that contains notes, lyrics, or other
      musical symbols, when there are parameter changes on a visible staff or in
      score context, or when there is a bar line other than an ordinary or
      invisible bar. This option is most likely to be useful when printing a
      subset of staffs, where the particular staff(s) you are printing have long
      periods of rests. (See the -s option.)</dd>

      name. If multiple input files are listed, the last is used. If none are

<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">This is like the <b>-m</b> option, except the name of the

      file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-o</b> <i>pagelist</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Print only the pages given in <i>pagelist</i>. The
      <i>pagelist</i> can be a comma&#x2010;separated list of numbers or ranges,
      where a range is two numbers separated by a dash. For example,
      -o1,7-9,12-14 would print pages 1, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, and 14. Pages will be
      printed in the order given. They need not be in order, and a page number
      may be included more than once. Alternately, the <i>pagelist</i> can be
      the special keyword &quot;odd&quot; or &quot;even&quot; which will cause
      all odd or even numbered pages to be printed. This may be useful if you
      have a printer that only makes single&#x2010;sided copies, but you wish to
      print Mup output double&#x2010;sided. You could print odd&#x2010;numbered
      pages, then turn the paper over and feed the pages through again for the
      even&#x2010;numbered pages.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-p</b><i>N</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Start numbering pages at <i>N</i> instead of at 1. If
      <b>-o</b> and <b>-p</b> are used together, the page numbers given in the
      <b>-o</b><i>pagelist</i> must be the printed page numbers. For example, if
      you use -p10 and want to print just the second page, you would need to
      specify -o11.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-s</b><i>stafflist</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Only print the staffs that are included in
      <i>stafflist</i>. This can be a comma&#x2010;separated list of staff
      numbers or ranges, such as &quot;1,5&quot; or &quot;1-3,7-8&quot; To
      further restrict to a single voice on a staff, add <b>v</b><i>N</i> where
      <i>N</i> is the voice number (1, 2, or 3), after the staff, as in
      &quot;2v1,5v2&quot; You can't specify a list or range for voices; if you
      only want to make two out of three voices visible, you have to specify
      them separately, like &quot;1v2,1v3&quot;. No spaces are allowed in the
      list.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-v</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Print the Mup version number and exit. This manual page is
      for version 6.5.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-x</b><i>M,N</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Extract measures <i>M</i> through <i>N</i> of the song.
      This allows you to print or play a part of a song. The comma and second
      value are optional; if not specified, the default is to go to the end of
      the piece. Positive values specify the number of measures from the
      beginning of the piece, while negative values are relative to the end,
      with -1 referring to the last measure of the song. So -x1,-1 means the
      entire song, if the song doesn't have a pickup measure. If the song has a
      pickup measure, that is specified by 0. So for a song with a pickup,
      -x0,-1 would mean the entire song, and -x0,0 would mean just the pickup
      measure. As other examples, -x-1,-1 means just the final measure of the
      song, -x2 means starting after the first full measure, -x3,4 means only
      measures 3 and 4, and -x6,6 means just measure 6. The starting measure is
      not allowed to be inside an ending. A common use for this option might be
      to generate a MIDI file for just a few measures. For example, if you were
      trying to tweak tempo values for a ritard in the last 2 measures of a
      song, you could use -x-2 to listen to just those measures.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The options, if any, can be followed by one or more <i>files</i> in Mup format.
  If no <i>files</i> are specified, standard input is read. If several
  <i>files</i> are listed, they are effectively concatenated together and
  treated as one big file. Since there are some things (such as header and
  footer) that are only allowed to occur once, if you have several independent
  pieces, mup should be called on each individually rather than trying to print
  them all with one command. If a specified file does not exist, and its name
  does not already end with .mup or .MUP, then Mup will append .mup to the
  specified name and attempt to open that.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On most systems, the environment variable MUPPATH can be set to a list of paths
  in which to look for 'include' files. The components are separated by a colon
  on Unix or Linux systems, and by a semicolon on systems with DOS&#x2010;like
  file naming conventions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For more debugging, in addition to the -d option, if the environment variable
  MUP_BB is set to &quot;bcfghnsu&quot; or any subset of those letters, the
  generated output will include &quot;bounding boxes&quot; for the things Mup
  internally calls bars (b), chords (c), feeds (f), grpsyls (g), header/footer
  and top/bottom (h), notes (n), staffs (s), and stuff (u). While this is
  intended for use in debugging Mup itself, it may also help you understand why
  Mup places things the way it does, since in general, Mup only allows bounding
  boxes to overlap according to specific rules. If viewed with a color
  PostScript viewer (not mupdisp), these boxes will be in color.
