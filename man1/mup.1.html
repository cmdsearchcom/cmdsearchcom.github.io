<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mup - music publisher</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mup [-cN] [-C] [-dN] [-D MACRO[=macro_def]] [-e errfile]
[-E] [-f outfile] [-F] [-l] [-m midifile] [-M] [-o pagelist]
[-pN] [-v] [-x N[,M] [file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Mup is a program for producing printed music. There is an
optional companion program called Mupmate that provides a
more graphical user interface on top of Mup, but this manual
<br>
page describes the command line interface. The Mup
User&rsquo;s Guide should be consulted for details of the
format of the input file. Options include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c N Combine consecutive
measures of all rests or spaces into multirests (multiple
measures of rest printed as a single measure, with the
number of measures of rest printed <br>
above the staff). Any time there are N or more measures in a
row that consist entirely of rests or spaces, they will be
replaced by a multirest. The combining of measures <br>
stops when there is a visible staff that contains notes,
lyrics, or other musical symbols, when there are parameter
changes on a visible staff or in score context, or when <br>
there is a bar line other than an ordinary or invisible bar.
This option is most likely to be useful when printing a
subset of staffs, where the particular staff(s) you <br>
are printing have long periods of rests. (See the -s
option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C This option is only used in
connection with the -E option. It specifies that comments
are to be passed through rather than deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d N Print debugging
information. N is a bitmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 parse phase information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 high level parse phase
tracing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 low level parse phase
tracing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8 reserved</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">16 high level placement phase
tracing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">32 low level placement phase
tracing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">64 reserved</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">128 contents of the main
internal list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">256 high level print phase
tracing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">512 low level print phase
tracing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N can be specified in decimal,
octal (by using a leading zero), or hex (by using a leading
0x). This information is intended for debugging of Mup
itself and thus is not <br>
likely to be of use to the average user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D MACRO[=macro_def] <br>
Define the macro MACRO. The macro name must consist of upper
case letters, digits, and underscores, beginning with an
upper case letter. The macro_def is optional, and <br>
gives the text of the macro. If it contains any white space
or other special characters, it must be quoted (if quoting
is supported by your operating system or shell).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e errfile <br>
Place error messages into errfile instead of writing them to
the standard error output stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Rather than produce
PostScript or MIDI output, just expand macros and includes,
and write the result to the standard output stream. Comments
in the input are deleted, <br>
unless the -C option is also specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f outfile <br>
Place the output into outfile instead of writing it to the
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F This is like the -f option,
except the name of the output file is derived from the name
of the Mup input file. If the name of the Mup input file
ends with a &quot;.mup&quot; suffix, <br>
the generated PostScript output file will end with a
&quot;.ps&quot; suffix instead. If the name of the Mup input
file ends with a &quot;.MUP&quot; suffix, the PostScript
file will end with <br>
a &quot;.PS&quot; suffix. Otherwise, a &quot;.ps&quot;
suffix will be appended to the end of the Mup input file
name. If multiple input files are listed, the last is used.
If none are spec&acirc; <br>
ified (input is read from standard input), the name
&quot;stdin.ps&quot; will be used for the output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Print the Mup license and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m midifile <br>
Instead of generating PostScript output, generate standard
MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) output, and put
it in midifile. This option also causes the macro <br>
&quot;MIDI&quot; to become defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M This is like the -m option,
except the name of the MIDI file is derived from the name of
the Mup input file. If the name of the Mup input file ends
with a &quot;.mup&quot; suffix, <br>
the generated MIDI file will end with a &quot;.mid&quot;
suffix instead. If the name of the Mup input file ends with
a &quot;.MUP&quot; suffix, the MIDI file will end with a
&quot;.MID&quot; suffix. <br>
Otherwise, a &quot;.mid&quot; suffix will be appended to the
end of the Mup input file name. If multiple input files are
listed, the last is used. If none are specified (input is
<br>
read from standard input), the name &quot;stdin.mid&quot;
will be used for the MIDI file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o pagelist <br>
Print only the pages given in pagelist. The pagelist can be
a comma&acirc;separated list of numbers or ranges, where a
range is two numbers separated by a dash. For example, <br>
-o1,7-9,12-14 would print pages 1, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, and 14.
Pages will be printed in the order given. They need not be
in order, and a page number may be included more <br>
than once. Alternately, the pagelist can be the special
keyword &quot;odd&quot; or &quot;even&quot; which will cause
all odd or even numbered pages to be printed. This may be
useful if you <br>
have a printer that only makes single&acirc;sided copies,
but you wish to print Mup output double&acirc;sided. You
could print odd&acirc;numbered pages, then turn the paper
over and feed <br>
the pages through again for the even&acirc;numbered
pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pN Start numbering pages at N
instead of at 1. If -o and -p are used together, the page
numbers given in the -opagelist must be the printed page
numbers. For example, if you <br>
use -p10 and want to print just the second page, you would
need to specify -o11.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sstafflist <br>
Only print the staffs that are included in stafflist. This
can be a comma&acirc;separated list of staff numbers or
ranges, such as &quot;1,5&quot; or &quot;1-3,7-8&quot; To
further restrict to a <br>
single voice on a staff, add vN where N is the voice number
(1, 2, or 3), after the staff, as in &quot;2v1,5v2&quot; You
can&rsquo;t specify a list or range for voices; if you only
want <br>
to make two out of three voices visible, you have to specify
them separately, like &quot;1v2,1v3&quot;. No spaces are
allowed in the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print the Mup version number
and exit. This manual page is for version 6.5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xM,N Extract measures M through
N of the song. This allows you to print or play a part of a
song. The comma and second value are optional; if not
specified, the default is to <br>
go to the end of the piece. Positive values specify the
number of measures from the beginning of the piece, while
negative values are relative to the end, with -1
refer&acirc; <br>
ring to the last measure of the song. So -x1,-1 means the
entire song, if the song doesn&rsquo;t have a pickup
measure. If the song has a pickup measure, that is specified
by <br>
0. So for a song with a pickup, -x0,-1 would mean the entire
song, and -x0,0 would mean just the pickup measure. As other
examples, -x-1,-1 means just the final measure <br>
of the song, -x2 means starting after the first full
measure, -x3,4 means only measures 3 and 4, and -x6,6 means
just measure 6. The starting measure is not allowed to be
<br>
inside an ending. A common use for this option might be to
generate a MIDI file for just a few measures. For example,
if you were trying to tweak tempo values for a <br>
ritard in the last 2 measures of a song, you could use -x-2
to listen to just those measures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options, if any, can be
followed by one or more files in Mup format. If no files are
specified, standard input is read. If several files are
listed, they are effectively <br>
concatenated together and treated as one big file. Since
there are some things (such as header and footer) that are
only allowed to occur once, if you have several independent
<br>
pieces, mup should be called on each individually rather
than trying to print them all with one command. If a
specified file does not exist, and its name does not already
end <br>
with .mup or .MUP, then Mup will append .mup to the
specified name and attempt to open that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On most systems, the environment
variable MUPPATH can be set to a list of paths in which to
look for &rsquo;include&rsquo; files. The components are
separated by a colon on Unix or Linux <br>
systems, and by a semicolon on systems with DOS&acirc;like
file naming conventions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more debugging, in addition
to the -d option, if the environment variable MUP_BB is set
to &quot;bcfghnsu&quot; or any subset of those letters, the
generated output will include <br>
&quot;bounding boxes&quot; for the things Mup internally
calls bars (b), chords (c), feeds (f), grpsyls (g),
header/footer and top/bottom (h), notes (n), staffs (s), and
stuff (u). While <br>
this is intended for use in debugging Mup itself, it may
also help you understand why Mup places things the way it
does, since in general, Mup only allows bounding boxes to
over&acirc; <br>
lap according to specific rules. If viewed with a color
PostScript viewer (not mupdisp), these boxes will be in
color.</p>
