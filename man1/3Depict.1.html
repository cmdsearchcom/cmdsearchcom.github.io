<p>3DEPICT(1) General Commands Manual 3DEPICT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
3Depict - 3D scalar point cloud visualization and
analysis</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
3depict &lt;file1&gt;&lt;file2&gt;...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents briefly the 3Depict command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3depict is a program that allows
for visualisation and analysis of point datasets with
associated spectral data. Specifically, the program was
written to handle the data associ&acirc; <br>
ated with atom probe tomography, but is applicable to other
areas, such as astronomy, laser scanning and any point-based
data source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the program is a
best-effort system. It is by no means guaranteed that the
algorithms in this program are free from errors in
implementation, or follow conventions for <br>
any specific user-application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
This program has no command line options, other than a
sequence of data or XML files to open, the XML files being
containing a previous program state (this may be generated
from <br>
within the program&rsquo;s graphical interface). Currently
the program can read &quot;POS&quot; (position) formatted
files, which are simply uncompressed sequences of 4-byte
floats (IEEE 597) in <br>
(x,y,z,value) form. All other work is done through the
graphical interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a further note, the XML file
format has not been stabilised for the 0.0.x series; and may
change between revisions.</p>
