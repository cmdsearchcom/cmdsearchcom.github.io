This manual page documents briefly the <b>3Depict command</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>3depict</b> is a program that allows for visualisation and analysis of point
  datasets with associated spectral data. Specifically, the program was written
  to handle the data associated with atom probe tomography, but is applicable to
  other areas, such as astronomy, laser scanning and any point-based data
  source.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the program is a best-effort system. It is by no means guaranteed that
  the algorithms in this program are free from errors in implementation, or
  follow conventions for any specific user-application.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
This program has no command line options, other than a sequence of data or XML
  files to open, the XML files being containing a previous program state (this
  may be generated from within the program's graphical interface). Currently the
  program can read &quot;POS&quot; (position) formatted files, which are simply
  uncompressed sequences of 4-byte floats (IEEE 597) in (x,y,z,value) form. All
  other work is done through the graphical interface.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a further note, the XML file format has not been stabilised for the 0.0.x
  series; and may change between revisions.
