<p>SCCS(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
SCCS(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sccs &acirc; front end for the SCCS subsystem
(DEVELOPMENT)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sccs [&acirc;r] [&acirc;d path] [&acirc;p path] command
[options...] [operands...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The sccs utility is a front end to the SCCS programs. It
also includes the capability to run set-user-id to another
user to provide additional protection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sccs utility shall invoke
the specified command with the specified options and
operands. By default, each of the operands shall be modified
by prefixing it with the string <br>
&quot;SCCS/s.&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command can be the name of
one of the SCCS utilities in this volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 (admin, delta, get, prs, rmdel, sact,
unget, val, or what) or one of the pseudo-utilities <br>
listed in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The sccs utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines, except that options operands are actually
options to be <br>
passed to the utility named by command. When the portion of
the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command [options ... ] [operands
... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is considered, all of the
pseudo-utilities used as command shall support the Utility
Syntax Guidelines. Any of the other SCCS utilities that can
be invoked in this manner support <br>
the Guidelines to the extent indicated by their individual
OPTIONS sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported preceding the command operand:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;d path A pathname of a
directory to be used as a root directory for the SCCS files.
The default shall be the current directory. The &acirc;d
option shall take precedence over the <br>
PROJECTDIR variable. See &acirc;p.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;p path A pathname of a
directory in which the SCCS files are located. The default
shall be the SCCS directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;p option differs from
the &acirc;d option in that the &acirc;d option-argument
shall be prefixed to the entire pathname and the &acirc;p
option-argument shall be inserted before the <br>
final component of the pathname. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sccs &acirc;d /x &acirc;p y get
a/b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">converts to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get /x/a/y/s.b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This allows the creation of
aliases such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias syssccs=&quot;sccs
&acirc;d /usr/src&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which is used as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syssccs get cmd/who.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;r Invoke command with the
real user ID of the process, not any effective user ID that
the sccs utility is set to. Certain commands (admin, check,
clean, diffs, info, <br>
rmdel, and tell) cannot be run set-user-ID by all users,
since this would allow anyone to change the authorizations.
These commands are always run as the real user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command An SCCS utility name or
the name of one of the pseudo-utilities listed in the
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">options An option or
option-argument to be passed to command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">operands An operand to be passed
to command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
See the utility description for the specified command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
See the utility description for the specified command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of sccs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments <br>
and input files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROJECTDIR <br>
Provide a default value for the &acirc;d path option. If the
value of PROJECTDIR begins with a &lt;slash&gt;, it shall be
considered an absolute pathname; otherwise, the value of
<br>
PROJECTDIR is treated as a user name and that user&rsquo;s
initial working directory shall be examined for a
subdirectory src or source. If such a directory is found, it
<br>
shall be used. Otherwise, the value shall be used as a
relative pathname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional environment variable
effects may be found in the utility description for the
specified command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
See the utility description for the specified command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
See the utility description for the specified command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
See the utility description for the specified command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
The following pseudo-utilities shall be supported as command
operands. All options referred to in the following list are
values given in the options operands following command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check Equivalent to info, except
that nothing shall be printed if nothing is being edited,
and a non-zero exit status shall be returned if anything is
being edited. The intent <br>
is to have this included in an
&lsquo;&lsquo;install&rsquo;&rsquo; entry in a makefile to
ensure that everything is included into the SCCS file before
a version is installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clean Remove everything from the
current directory that can be recreated from SCCS files, but
do not remove any files being edited. If the &acirc;b option
is given, branches shall be <br>
ignored in the determination of whether they are being
edited; this is dangerous if branches are kept in the same
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">create Create an SCCS file,
taking the initial contents from the file of the same name.
Any options to admin are accepted. If the creation is
successful, the original files <br>
shall be renamed by prefixing the basenames with a comma.
These renamed files should be removed after it has been
verified that the SCCS files have been created
success&acirc; <br>
fully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delget Perform a delta on the
named files and then get new versions. The new versions
shall have ID keywords expanded and shall not be editable.
Any &acirc;m, &acirc;p, &acirc;r, &acirc;s, and &acirc;y
<br>
options shall be passed to delta, and any &acirc;b,
&acirc;c, &acirc;e, &acirc;i, &acirc;k, &acirc;l, &acirc;s,
and &acirc;x options shall be passed to get.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deledit Equivalent to delget,
except that the get phase shall include the &acirc;e option.
This option is useful for making a checkpoint of the current
editing phase. The same options <br>
shall be passed to delta as described above, and all the
options listed for get above except &acirc;e shall be passed
to edit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diffs Write a difference listing
between the current version of the files checked out for
editing and the versions in SCCS format. Any &acirc;r,
&acirc;c, &acirc;i, &acirc;x, and &acirc;t options shall be
<br>
passed to get; any &acirc;l, &acirc;s, &acirc;e, &acirc;f,
&acirc;h, and &acirc;b options shall be passed to diff. A
&acirc;C option shall be passed to diff as &acirc;c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">edit Equivalent to get
&acirc;e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fix Remove the named delta, but
leave a copy of the delta with the changes that were in it.
It is useful for fixing small compiler bugs, and so on. The
application shall <br>
ensure that it is followed by a &acirc;r SID option. Since
fix does not leave audit trails, it should be used
carefully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info Write a listing of all
files being edited. If the &acirc;b option is given,
branches (that is, SIDs with two or fewer components) shall
be ignored. If a &acirc;u user option is <br>
given, then only files being edited by the named user shall
be listed. A &acirc;U option shall be equivalent to
&acirc;u&lt;current user&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print Write out verbose
information about the named files, equivalent to sccs
prs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tell Write a
&lt;newline&gt;-separated list of the files being edited to
standard output. Takes the &acirc;b, &acirc;u, and &acirc;U
options like info and check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unedit This is the opposite of
an edit or a get &acirc;e. It should be used with caution,
since any changes made since the get are lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
Many of the SCCS utilities take directory names as operands
as well as specific filenames. The pseudo-utilities
supported by sccs are not described as having this
capability, but <br>
are not prohibited from doing so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. To get a file for editing, edit it and produce a new
delta:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sccs get &acirc;e file.c <br>
ex file.c <br>
sccs delta file.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. To get a file from another
directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sccs &acirc;p /usr/src/sccs/s.
get cc.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sccs get
/usr/src/sccs/s.cc.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. To make a delta of a large
number of files in the current directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sccs delta *.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. To get a list of files being
edited that are not on branches:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sccs info &acirc;b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. To delta everything being
edited by the current user:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sccs delta $(sccs tell
&acirc;U)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. In a makefile, to get source
files from an SCCS file if it does not already exist:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SRCS = &lt;list of source
files&gt; <br>
$(SRCS): <br>
sccs get $(REL) $@</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
sccs and its associated utilities are part of the XSI
Development Utilities option within the XSI option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCCS is an abbreviation for
Source Code Control System. It is a maintenance and
enhancement tracking tool. When a file is put under SCCS,
the source code control system maintains <br>
the file and, when changes are made, identifies and stores
them in the file with the original source code and/or
documentation. As other changes are made, they too are
identified <br>
and retained in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Retrieval of the original and
any set of changes is possible. Any version of the file as
it develops can be reconstructed for inspection or
additional modification. History data <br>
can be stored with each version, documenting why the changes
were made, who made them, and when they were made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
