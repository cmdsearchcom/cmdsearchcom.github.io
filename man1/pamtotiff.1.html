<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamtotiff reads a PNM or PAM
image as input and produces a TIFF file as output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Actually, it handles multi-image
Netpbm streams, producing multi-image TIFF streams (i.e. a
TIFF stream with multiple &rsquo;directories&rsquo;). But
before Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005), it <br>
ignored all but the first Netpbm image in the input
stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Output File <br>
The output goes to Standard Output. pamtotiff approaches
this output file differently from Unix and Netpbm
convention. This is entirely due to pamtotiff&rsquo;s use of
the TIFF <br>
library to do all TIFF output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The output file
must be seekable. pamtotiff does not write it sequentially.
Therefore, you can&rsquo;t use a pipe; you can&rsquo;t pipe
the output of pamtotiff to some other pro&acirc; <br>
gram. But any regular file should work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the output
file descriptor is readable, you must either specify -append
so as to add to the existing file, or make sure the file is
empty. Otherwise, pamtotiff will <br>
fail with an unhelpful message telling you that a TIFF
library function failed to open the TIFF output stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you are
converting multiple images (your input stream contains
multiple images), the output file must be both readable and
writable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re using a Unix
command shell to run pamtotiff, you use facilities of your
shell to set up Standard Output. In Bash, for example, you
would set up a write-only Standard <br>
Output to the file /tmp/myimage.tiff like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pamtotiff myimage.pnm
&gt;/tmp/myimage.tiff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Bash, you would set up a
read/write Standard Output to the file /tmp/myimage.tiff
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pamtotiff myimage.pnm
1&lt;&gt;/tmp/myimage.tiff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIFF Capability <br>
pamtotiff uses the Libtiff.org TIFF library (or whatever
equivalent you provide) to generate the TIFF output. Details
of the format it produces are therefore controlled by that
<br>
library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Compression <br>
By default, pamtotiff creates a TIFF file with no
compression. This is your best bet most of the time. If you
want to try another compression scheme or tweak some of the
other <br>
even more obscure output options, there are a number of
options which to play.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 8.4 (April 2000),
the default was to use LZW compression. But then new
releases of the TIFF library started omitting the LZW
compression capability due to concern <br>
about patents on LZW. So since then, the default has been no
compression. The LZW patents have now expired and new TIFF
libraries do LZW, but the pamtotiff behavior remains the
<br>
same for compatibility with older TIFF libraries and
applications of pamtotiff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -none, -packbits, -lzw, -g3,
-g4, -flate, and -adobeflate options are used to override
the default and set the compression scheme used in creating
the output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -predictor option is
meaningful only with LZW compression: a predictor value of 2
causes each scanline of the output image to undergo
horizontal differencing before it is <br>
encoded; a value of 1 forces each scanline to be encoded
without differencing. By default, pamtotiff creates a TIFF
file with msb-to-lsb fill order. The -msb2lsb and -lsb2msb
<br>
options are used to override the default and set the fill
order used in creating the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With some older TIFF libraries,
-lzw doesn&rsquo;t work because the TIFF library
doesn&rsquo;t do LZW compression. This is because of
concerns about Unisys&rsquo;s patent on LZW which was then
in <br>
force. Actually, with very old TIFF libraries, -lzw works
because no distributors of the TIFF library were sensitive
yet to the patent issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flate chooses
&rsquo;flate&rsquo; compression, which is the patent-free
compression common in the Unix world implemented by the
&rsquo;Z&rsquo; library. It is what the PNG format uses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fax Compression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have bilevel data (e.g.
PBM), you can generate a TIFF that uses the same compression
scheme specified for use by fax machines. See the
FaxFormat(1) <br>
page for more information on these compression schemes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These formats all relate to ITU
Group 3 and Group 4 fax machine standards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -g3 option chooses MH or MR
compression: MR with the additional option -2d; MH without
it. -g4 selects MMR. The option names are a little
unfortunate and historical, but <br>
are consistent with the TIFF specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MMR has a better compression
ratio than the other two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fill specifies that for MH or
MR compression, each encoded scanline shall be zero-filled
to a byte boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2d and -fill are meaningful
only with -g3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fill Order <br>
The -msb2lsb and lsb2msb options control the fill order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fill order is the order in
which pixels are packed into a byte in the Tiff raster, in
the case that there are multiple pixels per byte. msb-to-lsb
means that the leftmost <br>
columns go into the most significant bits of the byte in the
Tiff image. However, there is considerable confusion about
the meaning of fill order. Some believe it means whether
<br>
16 bit sample values in the Tiff image are little-endian or
big-endian. This is totally erroneous (The endianness of
integers in a Tiff image is designated by the image&rsquo;s
magic <br>
number). However, ImageMagick and older Netpbm both have
been known to implement that interpretation. 2001.09.06.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the image does not have
sub-byte pixels, these options have no effect other than to
set the value of the FILLORDER tag in the Tiff image (which
may be useful for those pro&acirc; <br>
grams that misinterpret the tag with reference to 16 bit
samples).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Color Space <br>
-color tells pamtotiff to produce a color, as opposed to
grayscale, TIFF image if the input is PPM, even if it
contains only shades of gray. Without this option, pamtotiff
pro&acirc; <br>
duces a grayscale TIFF image if the input is PPM and
contains only shades of gray, and at most 256 shades.
Otherwise, it produces a color TIFF output. For PBM and PGM
input, <br>
pamtotiff always produces grayscale TIFF output and this
option has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -color option can prevent
pamtotiff from making two passes through the input file,
thus improving speed and memory usage. See Multiple Passes
&acirc;&uml;#multipass&acirc;&copy; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-truecolor tells pamtotiff to
produce the 24-bit RGB form of TIFF output if it is
producing a color TIFF image. Without this option, pamtotiff
produces a colormapped (paletted) <br>
TIFF image unless there are more than 256 colors (and in the
latter case, issues a warning).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -truecolor option can
prevent pamtotiff from making two passes through the input
file, thus improving speed and memory usage. See Multiple
Passes &acirc;&uml;#multipass&acirc;&copy; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -color and -truecolor
options did not exist before Netpbm 9.21 (December
2001).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If pamtotiff produces a
grayscale TIFF image, this option has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -minisblack and -miniswhite
options force the output image to have a &rsquo;minimum is
black&rsquo; or &rsquo;minimum is white&rsquo; photometric,
respectively. If you don&rsquo;t specify either,
pamto&acirc; <br>
tiff uses minimum is black except when using Group 3 or
Group 4 compression, in which case pamtotiff follows CCITT
fax standards and uses &rsquo;minimum is white.&rsquo; This
usually results <br>
in better compression and is generally preferred for bilevel
coding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before February 2001, pamtotiff
always produced &rsquo;minimum is black,&rsquo; due to a
bug. In either case, pamtotiff sets the photometric
interpretation tag in the TIFF output according <br>
to which photometric is actually used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -indexbits option is
meaningful only for a colormapped (paletted) image. In this
kind of image, the raster contains values which are indexes
into a table of colors, with the <br>
indexes normally taking less space that the color
description in the table. pamtotiff can generate indexes of
1, 2, 4, or 8 bits. By default, it will use 8, because many
pro&acirc; <br>
grams that interpret TIFF images can&rsquo;t handle any
other width.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But if you have a small number
of colors, you can make your image considerably smaller by
allowing fewer than 8 bits per index, using the -indexbits
option. The value is a <br>
comma-separated list of the bit widths you allow. pamtotiff
chooses the smallest width you allow that allows it to index
the entire color table. If you don&rsquo;t allow any such
<br>
width, pamtotiff fails. Normally, the only useful value for
this option is 1,2,4,8, because a program either understands
the 8 bit width (default) or understands them all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a Baseline TIFF image,
according to the 1992 TIFF 6.0 specification, 4 and 8 are
the only valid widths. There are no formal standards that
allow any other values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was added in June
2002. Before that, only 8 bit indices were possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extra Tags <br>
There are lots of tag types in the TIFF format that
don&rsquo;t correspond to any information in the PNM format
or to anything in the conversion process. For example, a
TIFF_ARTIST <br>
tag names the artist who created the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can tell pamtotiff
explicitly to include tags such as this in its output with
the -tag option. You identify a list of tag types and values
and pamtotiff includes a tag in <br>
the output for each item in your list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of -tag is the list of
tags, like this example:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tag=subfiletype=reducedimage,documentname=Fred,xposition=25</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As you see, it is a list of tag
specifications separated by commas. Each tag specification
is a name and a value separated by an equal sign. The name
is the name of the tag <br>
type, except in arbitrary upper/lower case. One place to see
the names of TIFF tag types is in the TIFF library&rsquo;s
tiff.h file, where there is a macro defined for each
consisting <br>
of &rsquo;TIFF_&rsquo; plus the name. E.g. for the
SUBFILETYPE tag type, there is a macro TIFF_SUBFILETYPE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the value
specification for a tag (stuff after the equal sign) depends
upon what kind of value the tag type has:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Integer: a
decimal number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Floating point
number: a decimal number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; String: a
string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Enumerated (For
example, a &rsquo;subfiletype&rsquo; tag takes an enumerated
value. Its possible values are REDUCEDIMAGE, PAGE, and
MASK.): The name of the value. You can see the <br>
possible value names in the TIFF library&rsquo;s tiff.h
file, where there is a macro defined for each consisting of
a qualifier plus the value name. E.g. for the REDUCEDIMAGE
<br>
value of a SUBFILETYPE tag, you see the macro
FILETYPE_REDUCEDIMAGE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The TIFF format assigns a unique
number to each enumerated value and you can specify that
number, in decimal, as an alternative. This is useful if you
are using an exten&acirc; <br>
sion of TIFF that pamtotiff doesn&rsquo;t know about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify a tag type with
-tag that is not independent of the content of your PNM
source image and pamtotiff&rsquo;s conversion process (i.e.
a tag type in which pamtotiff is <br>
interested), pamtotiff fails. For example, you cannot
specify an IMAGEWIDTH tag with -tag, because pamtotiff
generates an IMAGEWIDTH tag that gives the actual width of
the <br>
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tag was new in Netpbm 10.31
(December 2005).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other <br>
You can use the -rowsperstrip option to set the number of
rows (scanlines) in each strip of data in the output file.
By default, the output file has the number of rows per strip
<br>
set to a value that will ensure each strip is no more than 8
kilobytes long.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -append option tells
pamtotiff to add images to the existing output file (a TIFF
file may contain multiple images) instead of the default,
which is to replace the output <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-append was new in Netpbm 10.27
(March 2005).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
There are myriad variations of the TIFF format, and this
program generates only a few of them. pamtotiff creates a
grayscale TIFF file if its input is a PBM (monochrome) or
PGM <br>
(grayscale) or equivalent PAM file. pamtotiff also creates a
grayscale file if it input is PPM (color) or equivalent PAM,
but there is only one color in the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the input is a PPM (color)
file and there are 256 colors or fewer, but more than 1,
pamtotiff generates a color palette TIFF file. If there are
more colors than that, pamto&acirc; <br>
tiff generates an RGB (not RGBA) single plane TIFF file. Use
pnmtotiffcmyk to generate the cyan-magenta-yellow-black ink
color separation TIFF format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of bits per sample in
the TIFF output is determined by the maxval of the Netpbm
input. If the maxval is less than 256, the bits per sample
in the output is the small&acirc; <br>
est number that can encode the maxval. If the maxval is
greater than or equal to 256, there are 16 bits per sample
in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extra Channels <br>
Like most Netpbm programs, pamtotiff&rsquo;s function is
mostly undefined if the input is PAM image with tuple type
other than BLACKANDWHITE, GRAYSCALE, or RGB. Most of the
statements <br>
in this manual assume the input is not such an exotic PAM.
But there is a little defined processing of other PAM
subformats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamtotiff assumes any 1 plane
PAM image is BLACKANDWHITE or GRAYSCALE (and doesn&rsquo;t
distinguish between those two).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamtotiff assumes a PAM with
more than 1 plane is of tuple type RGB except with that
number of planes instead of 3. pamtotiff doesn&rsquo;t
really understand red, green, and blue, so <br>
it has no trouble with a 2-component or 5-component color
space. The TIFF format allows an arbitrary number of color
components, so pamtotiff simply maps the PAM planes directly
<br>
to TIFF color components. I don&rsquo;t know if the meanings
of 5 components in a TIFF image are standard at all, but the
function is there if you want to use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that pamtotiff may generate
either a truecolor or colormapped image with an arbitrary
number of color components. In the truecolor case, the
raster has that number of <br>
planes. In the colormapped case, the raster has of course 1
plane, but the color map has all the color components in
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The most common reason for a PAM
to have extra planes is when the tuple type is xxx_ALPHA,
which means the highest numbered plane is a transparency
plane (alpha channel). At <br>
least one user found that a TIFF with an extra plane for
transparency was useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the grayscale
detection works on N-component colors, so if your planes
aren&rsquo;t really color components, you&rsquo;ll want to
disable this via the -color option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple Passes <br>
pamtotiff reads the input image once if it can, and
otherwise twice. It needs that second pass (which happens
before the main pass, of course) to analyze the colors in
the image <br>
and generate a color map (palette) and determine if the
image is grayscale. So the second pass happens only when the
input is PPM. And you can avoid it then by specifying both
<br>
the -truecolor and -color options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the input image is small
enough to fit in your system&rsquo;s file cache, the second
pass is very fast. If not, it requires reading from disk
twice, which can be slow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the input is from a file
that cannot be rewound and reread, pamtotiff reads the
entire input image into a temporary file which can, and
works from that. Even if it needs <br>
only one pass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 9.21 (December
2001), pamtotiff always read the entire image into virtual
memory and then did one, two, or three passes through the
memory copy. The -truecolor and <br>
-color options did not exist. The passes through memory
would involve page faults if the entire image did not fit
into real memory. The image in memory required considerably
<br>
more memory (12 bytes per pixel) than the cached file
version of the image would.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resolution <br>
A Tiff image may contain information about the resolution of
the image, which means how big in real dimensions
(centimeters, etc.) each pixel in the raster is. That
information <br>
is in the TIFF XRESOLUTION, YRESOLUTION, and RESOLUTIONUNIT
tags. By default, pamtotiff does not include any tags of
these types, but you can specify them with the -tags
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are also options
-xresolution, -yresolution, and -resolutionunit, but those
are obsolete. Before -tags existed (before Netpbm 10.31
(December 2005), they were the only <br>
way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the number of pixels
in the image and how much information each contains is
determined independently from the setting of the resolution
tags. The number of pixels in <br>
the output is the same as in the input, and each pixel
contains the same information. For your resolution tags to
be meaningful, they have to consistent with whatever created
<br>
the PNM input. E.g. if a scanner turned a 10 centimeter wide
image into a 1000 pixel wide PNM image, then your horizontal
resolution is 100 pixels per centimeter, and if your <br>
XRESOLUTION tag says anything else, something that prints
your TIFF image won&rsquo;t print the proper 10 centimeter
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of the XRESOLUTION tag
is a floating point decimal number that tells how many
pixels there are per unit of distance in the horizontal
direction. -yresolution is analo&acirc; <br>
gous for the vertical direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The unit of distance is given by
the value of the RESOLUTIONUNIT option. That value is either
INCH, CENTIMETER, or NONE. NONE means the unit is arbitrary
or unspecified. This <br>
could mean that the creator and user of the image have a
separate agreement as to what the unit is. But usually, it
just means that the horizontal and vertical resolution
values <br>
cannot be used for anything except to determine aspect ratio
(because even though the unit is arbitrary or unspecified,
it has to be the same for both resolution numbers).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t use a -tag
option to specify the resolution tag and use the obsolete
options instead, note the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you
don&rsquo;t include an specify -xresolution, the Tiff image
does not contain horizontal resolution information. Likewise
for -yresolution. If you don&rsquo;t specify -resolu&acirc;
<br>
tionunit, the default is inches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Before Netpbm
10.16 (June 2003), -resolutionunit did not exist and the
resolution unit was always inches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
pamtotiff was originally pnmtotiff and did not handle PAM
input. It was extended and renamed in Netpbm 10.30 (October
2005).</p>
