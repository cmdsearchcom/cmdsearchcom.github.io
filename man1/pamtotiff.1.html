<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This program is part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pamtotiff</b> reads a PNM or PAM image as input and produces a TIFF file as
  output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Actually, it handles multi-image Netpbm streams, producing multi-image TIFF
  streams (i.e. a TIFF stream with multiple 'directories'). But before Netpbm
  10.27 (March 2005), it ignored all but the first Netpbm image in the input
  stream.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_Output_File"><a class="selflink" href="#The_Output_File">The
  Output File</a></h2>
The output goes to Standard Output. <b>pamtotiff</b> approaches this output file
  differently from Unix and Netpbm convention. This is entirely due to
  <b>pamtotiff</b>'s use of the TIFF library to do all TIFF output.

If you're using a Unix command shell to run <b>pamtotiff</b>, you use facilities
  of your shell to set up Standard Output. In Bash, for example, you would set
  up a write-only Standard Output to the file /tmp/myimage.tiff like this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
    $ pamtotiff myimage.pnm &gt;/tmp/myimage.tiff
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In Bash, you would set up a read/write Standard Output to the file
  /tmp/myimage.tiff like this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
    $ pamtotiff myimage.pnm 1&lt;&gt;/tmp/myimage.tiff

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="TIFF_Capability"><a class="selflink" href="#TIFF_Capability">TIFF
  Capability</a></h2>
<b>pamtotiff</b> uses the Libtiff.org TIFF library (or whatever equivalent you
  provide) to generate the TIFF output. Details of the format it produces are
  therefore controlled by that library.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Compression"><a class="selflink" href="#Compression">Compression</a></h2>
By default, <b>pamtotiff</b> creates a TIFF file with no compression. This is
  your best bet most of the time. If you want to try another compression scheme
  or tweak some of the other even more obscure output options, there are a
  number of options which to play.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before Netpbm 8.4 (April 2000), the default was to use LZW compression. But then
  new releases of the TIFF library started omitting the LZW compression
  capability due to concern about patents on LZW. So since then, the default has
  been no compression. The LZW patents have now expired and new TIFF libraries
  do LZW, but the <b>pamtotiff</b> behavior remains the same for compatibility
  with older TIFF libraries and applications of <b>pamtotiff</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-none</b>, <b>-packbits</b>, <b>-lzw</b>, <b>-g3</b>, <b>-g4</b>,
  <b>-flate</b>, and <b>-adobeflate</b> options are used to override the default
  and set the compression scheme used in creating the output file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>-predictor</b> option is meaningful only with LZW compression: a
  predictor value of 2 causes each scanline of the output image to undergo
  horizontal differencing before it is encoded; a value of 1 forces each
  scanline to be encoded without differencing. By default, <b>pamtotiff</b>
  creates a TIFF file with msb-to-lsb fill order. The <b>-msb2lsb</b> and
  <b>-lsb2msb</b> options are used to override the default and set the fill
  order used in creating the file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With some older TIFF libraries, <b>-lzw</b> doesn't work because the TIFF
  library doesn't do LZW compression. This is because of concerns about Unisys's
  patent on LZW which was then in force. Actually, with very old TIFF libraries,
  <b>-lzw</b> works because no distributors of the TIFF library were sensitive
  yet to the patent issue.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-flate</b> chooses 'flate' compression, which is the patent-free compression
  common in the Unix world implemented by the 'Z' library. It is what the PNG
  format uses.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Fax Compression</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have bilevel data (e.g. PBM), you can generate a TIFF that uses the same
  compression scheme specified for use by fax machines. See the
  <b>Fax</b>Format<b>(1)</b>
<br/>
 page for more information on these compression schemes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
These formats all relate to ITU Group 3 and Group 4 fax machine standards.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-g3</b> option chooses MH or MR compression: MR with the additional
  option <b>-2d</b>; MH without it. <b>-g4</b> selects MMR. The option names are
  a little unfortunate and historical, but are consistent with the TIFF
  specification.
<div class="Pp"></div>
MMR has a better compression ratio than the other two.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-fill</b> specifies that for MH or MR compression, each encoded scanline
  shall be zero-filled to a byte boundary.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-2d</b> and <b>-fill</b> are meaningful only with <b>-g3</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Fill_Order"><a class="selflink" href="#Fill_Order">Fill
  Order</a></h2>
The <b>-msb2lsb</b> and <b>lsb2msb</b> options control the fill order.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The fill order is the order in which pixels are packed into a byte in the Tiff
  raster, in the case that there are multiple pixels per byte. msb-to-lsb means
  that the leftmost columns go into the most significant bits of the byte in the
  Tiff image. However, there is considerable confusion about the meaning of fill
  order. Some believe it means whether 16 bit sample values in the Tiff image
  are little-endian or big-endian. This is totally erroneous (The endianness of
  integers in a Tiff image is designated by the image's magic number). However,
  ImageMagick and older Netpbm both have been known to implement that
  interpretation. 2001.09.06.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the image does not have sub-byte pixels, these options have no effect other
  than to set the value of the FILLORDER tag in the Tiff image (which may be
  useful for those programs that misinterpret the tag with reference to 16 bit
  samples).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Color_Space"><a class="selflink" href="#Color_Space">Color
  Space</a></h2>
<b>-color</b> tells <b>pamtotiff</b> to produce a color, as opposed to
  grayscale, TIFF image if the input is PPM, even if it contains only shades of
  gray. Without this option, <b>pamtotiff</b> produces a grayscale TIFF image if
  the input is PPM and contains only shades of gray, and at most 256 shades.
  Otherwise, it produces a color TIFF output. For PBM and PGM input,
  <b>pamtotiff</b> always produces grayscale TIFF output and this option has no
  effect.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-color</b> option can prevent <b>pamtotiff</b> from making two passes
  through the input file, thus improving speed and memory usage. See
  <a class="Lk" title="Lk" href="#multipass">Multiple Passes</a> .
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-truecolor</b> tells <b>pamtotiff</b> to produce the 24-bit RGB form of TIFF
  output if it is producing a color TIFF image. Without this option,
  <b>pamtotiff</b> produces a colormapped (paletted) TIFF image unless there are
  more than 256 colors (and in the latter case, issues a warning).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-truecolor</b> option can prevent <b>pamtotiff</b> from making two passes
  through the input file, thus improving speed and memory usage. See
  <a class="Lk" title="Lk" href="#multipass">Multiple Passes</a> .
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-color</b> and <b>-truecolor</b> options did not exist before Netpbm 9.21
  (December 2001).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>pamtotiff</b> produces a grayscale TIFF image, this option has no effect.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-minisblack</b> and <b>-miniswhite</b> options force the output image to
  have a 'minimum is black' or 'minimum is white' photometric, respectively. If
  you don't specify either, <b>pamtotiff</b> uses minimum is black except when
  using Group 3 or Group 4 compression, in which case <b>pamtotiff</b> follows
  CCITT fax standards and uses 'minimum is white.' This usually results in
  better compression and is generally preferred for bilevel coding.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before February 2001, <b>pamtotiff</b> always produced 'minimum is black,' due
  to a bug. In either case, <b>pamtotiff</b> sets the photometric interpretation
  tag in the TIFF output according to which photometric is actually used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-indexbits</b> option is meaningful only for a colormapped (paletted)
  image. In this kind of image, the raster contains values which are indexes
  into a table of colors, with the indexes normally taking less space that the
  color description in the table. <b>pamtotiff</b> can generate indexes of 1, 2,
  4, or 8 bits. By default, it will use 8, because many programs that interpret
  TIFF images can't handle any other width.
<div class="Pp"></div>
But if you have a small number of colors, you can make your image considerably
  smaller by allowing fewer than 8 bits per index, using the <b>-indexbits</b>
  option. The value is a comma-separated list of the bit widths you allow.
  <b>pamtotiff</b> chooses the smallest width you allow that allows it to index
  the entire color table. If you don't allow any such width, <b>pamtotiff</b>
  fails. Normally, the only useful value for this option is <b>1,2,4,8</b>,
  because a program either understands the 8 bit width (default) or understands
  them all.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In a Baseline TIFF image, according to the 1992 TIFF 6.0 specification, 4 and 8
  are the only valid widths. There are no formal standards that allow any other
  values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This option was added in June 2002. Before that, only 8 bit indices were
  possible.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Extra_Tags"><a class="selflink" href="#Extra_Tags">Extra
  Tags</a></h2>
There are lots of tag types in the TIFF format that don't correspond to any
  information in the PNM format or to anything in the conversion process. For
  example, a TIFF_ARTIST tag names the artist who created the image.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can tell <b>pamtotiff</b> explicitly to include tags such as this in its
  output with the <b>-tag</b> option. You identify a list of tag types and
  values and <b>pamtotiff</b> includes a tag in the output for each item in your
  list.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The value of <b>-tag</b> is the list of tags, like this example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
    -tag=subfiletype=reducedimage,documentname=Fred,xposition=25
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As you see, it is a list of tag specifications separated by commas. Each tag
  specification is a name and a value separated by an equal sign. The name is
  the name of the tag type, except in arbitrary upper/lower case. One place to
  see the names of TIFF tag types is in the TIFF library's <b>tiff.h</b> file,
  where there is a macro defined for each consisting of 'TIFF_' plus the name.
  E.g. for the SUBFILETYPE tag type, there is a macro TIFF_SUBFILETYPE.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The format of the value specification for a tag (stuff after the equal sign)
  depends upon what kind of value the tag type has:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Enumerated (For example, a 'subfiletype' tag takes an
      enumerated value. Its possible values are REDUCEDIMAGE, PAGE, and MASK.):
      The name of the value. You can see the possible value names in the TIFF
      library's <b>tiff.h</b> file, where there is a macro defined for each
      consisting of a qualifier plus the value name. E.g. for the REDUCEDIMAGE
      value of a SUBFILETYPE tag, you see the macro FILETYPE_REDUCEDIMAGE.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The TIFF format assigns a unique number to each enumerated value and you can
      specify that number, in decimal, as an alternative. This is useful if you
      are using an extension of TIFF that <b>pamtotiff</b> doesn't know about.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you specify a tag type with <b>-tag</b> that is not independent of the
  content of your PNM source image and <b>pamtotiff</b>'s conversion process
  (i.e. a tag type in which <b>pamtotiff</b> is interested), <b>pamtotiff</b>
  fails. For example, you cannot specify an IMAGEWIDTH tag with <b>-tag</b>,
  because <b>pamtotiff</b> generates an IMAGEWIDTH tag that gives the actual
  width of the image.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-tag</b> was new in Netpbm 10.31 (December 2005).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Other"><a class="selflink" href="#Other">Other</a></h2>
You can use the <b>-rowsperstrip</b> option to set the number of rows
  (scanlines) in each strip of data in the output file. By default, the output
  file has the number of rows per strip set to a value that will ensure each
  strip is no more than 8 kilobytes long.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-append</b> option tells <b>pamtotiff</b> to add images to the existing
  output file (a TIFF file may contain multiple images) instead of the default,
  which is to replace the output file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-append</b> was new in Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
There are myriad variations of the TIFF format, and this program generates only
  a few of them. <b>pamtotiff</b> creates a grayscale TIFF file if its input is
  a PBM (monochrome) or PGM (grayscale) or equivalent PAM file. <b>pamtotiff</b>
  also creates a grayscale file if it input is PPM (color) or equivalent PAM,
  but there is only one color in the image.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the input is a PPM (color) file and there are 256 colors or fewer, but more
  than 1, <b>pamtotiff</b> generates a color palette TIFF file. If there are
  more colors than that, <b>pamtotiff</b> generates an RGB (not RGBA) single
  plane TIFF file. Use <b>pnmtotiffcmyk</b> to generate the
  cyan-magenta-yellow-black ink color separation TIFF format.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The number of bits per sample in the TIFF output is determined by the maxval of
  the Netpbm input. If the maxval is less than 256, the bits per sample in the
  output is the smallest number that can encode the maxval. If the maxval is
  greater than or equal to 256, there are 16 bits per sample in the output.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Extra_Channels"><a class="selflink" href="#Extra_Channels">Extra
  Channels</a></h2>
Like most Netpbm programs, <b>pamtotiff</b>'s function is mostly undefined if
  the input is PAM image with tuple type other than BLACKANDWHITE, GRAYSCALE, or
  RGB. Most of the statements in this manual assume the input is not such an
  exotic PAM. But there is a little defined processing of other PAM subformats.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pamtotiff</b> assumes any 1 plane PAM image is BLACKANDWHITE or GRAYSCALE
  (and doesn't distinguish between those two).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pamtotiff</b> assumes a PAM with more than 1 plane is of tuple type RGB
  except with that number of planes instead of 3. <b>pamtotiff</b> doesn't
  really understand red, green, and blue, so it has no trouble with a
  2-component or 5-component color space. The TIFF format allows an arbitrary
  number of color components, so <b>pamtotiff</b> simply maps the PAM planes
  directly to TIFF color components. I don't know if the meanings of 5
  components in a TIFF image are standard at all, but the function is there if
  you want to use it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that <b>pamtotiff</b> may generate either a truecolor or colormapped image
  with an arbitrary number of color components. In the truecolor case, the
  raster has that number of planes. In the colormapped case, the raster has of
  course 1 plane, but the color map has all the color components in it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The most common reason for a PAM to have extra planes is when the tuple type is
  xxx_ALPHA, which means the highest numbered plane is a transparency plane
  (alpha channel). At least one user found that a TIFF with an extra plane for
  transparency was useful.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the grayscale detection works on N-component colors, so if your planes
  aren't really color components, you'll want to disable this via the
  <b>-color</b> option.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Multiple_Passes"><a class="selflink" href="#Multiple_Passes">Multiple
  Passes</a></h2>
<b>pamtotiff</b> reads the input image once if it can, and otherwise twice. It
  needs that second pass (which happens before the main pass, of course) to
  analyze the colors in the image and generate a color map (palette) and
  determine if the image is grayscale. So the second pass happens only when the
  input is PPM. And you can avoid it then by specifying both the
  <b>-truecolor</b> and <b>-color</b> options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 If the input image is small enough to fit in your system's file cache, the
  second pass is very fast. If not, it requires reading from disk twice, which
  can be slow.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the input is from a file that cannot be rewound and reread,
  <b>pamtotiff</b> reads the entire input image into a temporary file which can,
  and works from that. Even if it needs only one pass.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before Netpbm 9.21 (December 2001), <b>pamtotiff</b> always read the entire
  image into virtual memory and then did one, two, or three passes through the
  memory copy. The <b>-truecolor</b> and <b>-color</b> options did not exist.
  The passes through memory would involve page faults if the entire image did
  not fit into real memory. The image in memory required considerably more
  memory (12 bytes per pixel) than the cached file version of the image would.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Resolution"><a class="selflink" href="#Resolution">Resolution</a></h2>
A Tiff image may contain information about the resolution of the image, which
  means how big in real dimensions (centimeters, etc.) each pixel in the raster
  is. That information is in the TIFF XRESOLUTION, YRESOLUTION, and
  RESOLUTIONUNIT tags. By default, <b>pamtotiff</b> does not include any tags of
  these types, but you can specify them with the <b>-tags</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are also options <b>-xresolution</b>, <b>-yresolution</b>, and
  <b>-resolutionunit</b>, but those are obsolete. Before <b>-tags</b> existed
  (before Netpbm 10.31 (December 2005), they were the only way.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the number of pixels in the image and how much information each
  contains is determined independently from the setting of the resolution tags.
  The number of pixels in the output is the same as in the input, and each pixel
  contains the same information. For your resolution tags to be meaningful, they
  have to consistent with whatever created the PNM input. E.g. if a scanner
  turned a 10 centimeter wide image into a 1000 pixel wide PNM image, then your
  horizontal resolution is 100 pixels per centimeter, and if your XRESOLUTION
  tag says anything else, something that prints your TIFF image won't print the
  proper 10 centimeter image.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The value of the XRESOLUTION tag is a floating point decimal number that tells
  how many pixels there are per unit of distance in the horizontal direction.
  <b>-yresolution</b> is analogous for the vertical direction.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The unit of distance is given by the value of the RESOLUTIONUNIT option. That
  value is either INCH, CENTIMETER, or NONE. NONE means the unit is arbitrary or
  unspecified. This could mean that the creator and user of the image have a
  separate agreement as to what the unit is. But usually, it just means that the
  horizontal and vertical resolution values cannot be used for anything except
  to determine aspect ratio (because even though the unit is arbitrary or
  unspecified, it has to be the same for both resolution numbers).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you <i>don't</i> use a <b>-tag</b> option to specify the resolution tag and
  use the obsolete options instead, note the following:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If you don't include an specify <b>-xresolution</b>, the
      Tiff image does not contain horizontal resolution information. Likewise
      for <b>-yresolution</b>. If you don't specify <b>-resolutionunit</b>, the
      default is inches.
