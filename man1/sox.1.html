SoX reads and writes audio files in most popular formats and can optionally
  apply effects to them. It can combine multiple input sources, synthesise
  audio, and, on many systems, act as a general purpose audio player or a
  multi-track audio recorder. It also has limited ability to split the input
  into multiple output files.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
All SoX functionality is available using just the <b>sox</b> command. To
  simplify playing and recording audio, if SoX is invoked as <b>play</b>, the
  output file is automatically set to be the default sound device, and if
  invoked as <b>rec</b>, the default sound device is used as an input source.
  Additionally, the <b>soxi</b>(1) command provides a convenient way to just
  query audio file header information.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The heart of SoX is a library called libSoX. Those interested in extending SoX
  or using it in other programs should refer to the libSoX manual page:
  <b>libsox</b>(3).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
SoX is a command-line audio processing tool, particularly suited to making
  quick, simple edits and to batch processing. If you need an interactive,
  graphical audio editor, use <b>audacity</b>(1).

The overall SoX processing chain can be summarised as follows:

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note however, that on the SoX command line, the positions of the Output(s) and
  the Effects are swapped w.r.t. the logical flow just shown. Note also that
  whilst options pertaining to files are placed before their respective file
  name, the opposite is true for effects. To show how this works in practice,
  here is a selection of examples of how SoX might be used. The simple
<pre>
   sox recital.au recital.wav
</pre>
translates an audio file in Sun AU format to a Microsoft WAV file, whilst
<pre>
   sox recital.au -b 16 recital.wav channels 1 rate 16k fade 3 norm
</pre>
performs the same format translation, but also applies four effects (down-mix to
  one channel, sample rate change, fade-in, nomalize), and stores the result at
  a bit-depth of 16.
<pre>
   sox -r 16k -e signed -b 8 -c 1 voice-memo.raw voice-memo.wav
</pre>
converts `raw' (a.k.a. `headerless') audio to a self-describing file format,
<pre>
   sox slow.aiff fixed.aiff speed 1.027
</pre>
adjusts audio speed,
<pre>
   sox short.wav long.wav longer.wav
</pre>
concatenates two audio files, and
<pre>
   sox -m music.mp3 voice.wav mixed.flac
</pre>
mixes together two audio files.
<pre>
   play &quot;The Moonbeams/Greatest/*.ogg&quot; bass +3
</pre>
plays a collection of audio files whilst applying a bass boosting effect,
<pre>
   play -n -c1 synth sin %-12 sin %-9 sin %-5 sin %-2 fade h 0.1 1 0.1
</pre>
plays a synthesised `A minor seventh' chord with a pipe-organ sound,
<pre>
   rec -c 2 radio.aiff trim 0 30:00
</pre>
records half an hour of stereo audio, and
<pre>
   play -q take1.aiff &amp; rec -M take1.aiff take1-dub.aiff
</pre>
(with POSIX shell and where supported by hardware) records a new track in a
  multi-track recording. Finally,
<pre>
   rec -r 44100 -b 16 -s -p silence 1 0.50 0.1% 1 10:00 0.1% | \
	sox -p song.ogg silence 1 0.50 0.1% 1 2.0 0.1% : \
	newfile : restart
</pre>
records a stream of audio such as LP/cassette and splits in to multiple audio
  files at points with 2 seconds of silence. Also, it does not start recording
  until it detects audio is playing and stops after it sees 10 minutes of
  silence.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
N.B. The above is just an overview of SoX's capabilities; detailed explanations
  of how to use <i>all</i> SoX parameters, file formats, and effects can be
  found below in this manual, in <b>soxformat</b>(7), and in <b>soxi</b>(1).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="File_Format_Types"><a class="selflink" href="#File_Format_Types">File
  Format Types</a></h2>
SoX can work with `self-describing' and `raw' audio files. `self-describing'
  formats (e.g. WAV, FLAC, MP3) have a header that completely describes the
  signal and encoding attributes of the audio data that follows. `raw' or
  `headerless' formats do not contain this information, so the audio
  characteristics of these must be described on the SoX command line or inferred
  from those of the input file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The following four characteristics are used to describe the format of audio data
  such that it can be processed with SoX:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">sample rate</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The sample rate in samples per second (`Hertz' or `Hz').
      Digital telephony traditionally uses a sample rate of 8000&#x00A0;Hz
      (8&#x00A0;kHz), though these days, 16 and even 32&#x00A0;kHz are becoming
      more common. Audio Compact Discs use 44100&#x00A0;Hz (44.1&#x00A0;kHz).
      Digital Audio Tape and many computer systems use 48&#x00A0;kHz.
      Professional audio systems often use 96 kHz.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">sample size</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The number of bits used to store each sample. Today, 16-bit
      is commonly used. 8-bit was popular in the early days of computer audio.
      24-bit is used in the professional audio arena. Other sizes are also
    used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">data encoding</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The way in which each audio sample is represented (or
      `encoded'). Some encodings have variants with different byte-orderings or
      bit-orderings. Some compress the audio data so that the stored audio data
      takes up less space (i.e. disk space or transmission bandwidth) than the
      other format parameters and the number of samples would imply.
      Commonly-used encoding types include floating-point, &#x03BC;-law, ADPCM,
      signed-integer PCM, MP3, and FLAC.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">channels</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The number of audio channels contained in the file. One
      (`mono') and two (`stereo') are widely used. `Surround sound' audio
      typically contains six or more channels.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The term `bit-rate' is a measure of the amount of storage occupied by an encoded
  audio signal over a unit of time. It can depend on all of the above and is
  typically denoted as a number of kilo-bits per second (kbps). An A-law
  telephony signal has a bit-rate of 64 kbps. MP3-encoded stereo music typically
  has a bit-rate of 128-196 kbps. FLAC-encoded stereo music typically has a
  bit-rate of 550-760 kbps.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Most self-describing formats also allow textual `comments' to be embedded in the
  file that can be used to describe the audio in some way, e.g. for music, the
  title, the author, etc.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
One important use of audio file comments is to convey `Replay Gain' information.
  SoX supports applying Replay Gain information, but not generating it. Note
  that by default, SoX copies input file comments to output files that support
  comments, so output files may contain Replay Gain information if some was
  present in the input file. In this case, if anything other than a simple
  format conversion was performed then the output file Replay Gain information
  is likely to be incorrect and so should be recalculated using a tool that
  supports this (not SoX).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>soxi</b>(1) command can be used to display information from audio file
  headers.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Determining_&amp;_Setting_The_File_Format"><a class="selflink" href="#Determining_&amp;_Setting_The_File_Format">Determining
  &amp; Setting The File Format</a></h2>
There are several mechanisms available for SoX to use to determine or set the
  format characteristics of an audio file. Depending on the circumstances,
  individual characteristics may be determined or set using different
  mechanisms.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To determine the format of an input file, SoX will use, in order of precedence
  and as given or available:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Command-line format options.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The contents of the file header.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The filename extension.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To set the output file format, SoX will use, in order of precedence and as given
  or available:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Command-line format options.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The filename extension.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The input file format characteristics, or the closest that
      is supported by the output file type.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For all files, SoX will exit with an error if the file type cannot be
  determined. Command-line format options may need to be added or changed to
  resolve the problem.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Playing_&amp;_Recording_Audio"><a class="selflink" href="#Playing_&amp;_Recording_Audio">Playing
  &amp; Recording Audio</a></h2>
The <b>play</b> and <b>rec</b> commands are provided so that basic playing and
  recording is as simple as
<pre>
   play existing-file.wav
</pre>
and
<pre>
   rec new-file.wav
</pre>
These two commands are functionally equivalent to
<pre>
   sox existing-file.wav -d
</pre>
and
<pre>
   sox -d new-file.wav
</pre>
Of course, further options and effects (as described below) can be added to the
  commands in either form.

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Some systems provide more than one type of (SoX-compatible) audio driver, e.g.
  ALSA &amp; OSS, or SUNAU &amp; AO. Systems can also have more than one audio
  device (a.k.a. `sound card'). If more than one audio driver has been built-in
  to SoX, and the default selected by SoX when recording or playing is not the
  one that is wanted, then the <b>AUDIODRIVER</b> environment variable can be
  used to override the default. For example (on many systems):
<pre>
   set AUDIODRIVER=oss
   play ...
</pre>
The <b>AUDIODEV</b> environment variable can be used to override the default
  audio device, e.g.
<pre>
   set AUDIODEV=/dev/dsp2
   play ...
   sox ... -t oss
</pre>
or
<pre>
   set AUDIODEV=hw:soundwave,1,2
   play ...
   sox ... -t alsa
</pre>
Note that the way of setting environment variables varies from system to system
  - for some specific examples, see `SOX_OPTS' below.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When playing a file with a sample rate that is not supported by the audio output
  device, SoX will automatically invoke the <b>rate</b> effect to perform the
  necessary sample rate conversion. For compatibility with old hardware, the
  default <b>rate</b> quality level is set to `low'. This can be changed by
  explicitly specifying the <b>rate</b> effect with a different quality level,
  e.g.
<pre>
   play ... rate -m
</pre>
or by using the <b>--play-rate-arg</b> option (see below).
<table class="tbl">
  <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 1.00ex;"/>
    <col style="width: 1.00ex;"/>
    <col style="width: 1.00ex;"/>

  </tr>

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
On some systems, SoX allows audio playback volume to be adjusted whilst using
  <b>play</b>. Where supported, this is achieved by tapping the `v' &amp; `V'
  keys during playback.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To help with setting a suitable recording level, SoX includes a peak-level meter
  which can be invoked (before making the actual recording) as follows:
<pre>
   rec -n
</pre>
The recording level should be adjusted (using the system-provided mixer program,
  not SoX) so that the meter is <i>at most occasionally</i> full scale, and
  never `in the red' (an exclamation mark is shown). See also <b>-S</b> below.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Accuracy"><a class="selflink" href="#Accuracy">Accuracy</a></h2>
Many file formats that compress audio discard some of the audio signal
  information whilst doing so. Converting to such a format and then converting
  back again will not produce an exact copy of the original audio. This is the
  case for many formats used in telephony (e.g. A-law, GSM) where low signal
  bandwidth is more important than high audio fidelity, and for many formats
  used in portable music players (e.g. MP3, Vorbis) where adequate fidelity can
  be retained even with the large compression ratios that are needed to make
  portable players practical.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Formats that discard audio signal information are called `lossy'. Formats that
  do not are called `lossless'. The term `quality' is used as a measure of how
  closely the original audio signal can be reproduced when using a lossy format.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Audio file conversion with SoX is lossless when it can be, i.e. when not using
  lossy compression, when not reducing the sampling rate or number of channels,
  and when the number of bits used in the destination format is not less than in
  the source format. E.g. converting from an 8-bit PCM format to a 16-bit PCM
  format is lossless but converting from an 8-bit PCM format to (8-bit) A-law
  isn't.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>N.B.</b> SoX converts all audio files to an internal uncompressed format
  before performing any audio processing. This means that manipulating a file
  that is stored in a lossy format can cause further losses in audio fidelity.
  E.g. with
<pre>
   sox long.mp3 short.mp3 trim 10
</pre>
SoX first decompresses the input MP3 file, then applies the <b>trim</b> effect,
  and finally creates the output MP3 file by re-compressing the audio - with a
  possible reduction in fidelity above that which occurred when the input file
  was created. Hence, if what is ultimately desired is lossily compressed audio,
  it is highly recommended to perform all audio processing using lossless file
  formats and then convert to the lossy format only at the final stage.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>N.B.</b> Applying multiple effects with a single SoX invocation will, in
  general, produce more accurate results than those produced using multiple SoX
  invocations.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Dithering"><a class="selflink" href="#Dithering">Dithering</a></h2>
Dithering is a technique used to maximise the dynamic range of audio stored at a
  particular bit-depth. Any distortion introduced by quantisation is
  decorrelated by adding a small amount of white noise to the signal. In most
  cases, SoX can determine whether the selected processing requires dither and
  will add it during output formatting if appropriate.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Specifically, by default, SoX automatically adds TPDF dither when the output
  bit-depth is less than 24 and any of the following are true:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">bit-depth reduction has been specified explicitly using a
      command-line option</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">the output file format supports only bit-depths lower than
      that of the input file format</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">an effect has increased effective bit-depth within the
      internal processing chain</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, adjusting volume with <b>vol 0.25</b> requires two additional bits
  in which to losslessly store its results (since 0.25 decimal equals 0.01
  binary). So if the input file bit-depth is 16, then SoX's internal
  representation will utilise 18 bits after processing this volume change. In
  order to store the output at the same depth as the input, dithering is used to
  remove the additional bits.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Use the <b>-V</b> option to see what processing SoX has automatically added. The
  <b>-D</b> option may be given to override automatic dithering. To invoke
  dithering manually (e.g. to select a noise-shaping curve), see the
  <b>dither</b> effect.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Clipping"><a class="selflink" href="#Clipping">Clipping</a></h2>
Clipping is distortion that occurs when an audio signal level (or `volume')
  exceeds the range of the chosen representation. In most cases, clipping is
  undesirable and so should be corrected by adjusting the level prior to the
  point (in the processing chain) at which it occurs.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In SoX, clipping could occur, as you might expect, when using the <b>vol</b> or
  <b>gain</b> effects to increase the audio volume. Clipping could also occur
  with many other effects, when converting one format to another, and even when
  simply playing the audio.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Playing an audio file often involves resampling, and processing by analogue
  components can introduce a small DC offset and/or amplification, all of which
  can produce distortion if the audio signal level was initially too close to
  the clipping point.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For these reasons, it is usual to make sure that an audio file's signal level
  has some `headroom', i.e. it does not exceed a particular level below the
  maximum possible level for the given representation. Some standards bodies
  recommend as much as 9dB headroom, but in most cases, 3dB (&#x2248; 70%
  linear) is enough. Note that this wisdom seems to have been lost in modern
  music production; in fact, many CDs, MP3s, etc. are now mastered at levels
  <i>above</i> 0dBFS i.e. the audio is clipped as delivered.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
SoX's <b>stat</b> and <b>stats</b> effects can assist in determining the signal
  level in an audio file. The <b>gain</b> or <b>vol</b> effect can be used to
  prevent clipping, e.g.
<pre>
   sox dull.wav bright.wav gain -6 treble +6
</pre>
guarantees that the treble boost will not clip.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If clipping occurs at any point during processing, SoX will display a warning
  message to that effect.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
See also <b>-G</b> and the <b>gain</b> and <b>norm</b> effects.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Input_File_Combining"><a class="selflink" href="#Input_File_Combining">Input
  File Combining</a></h2>
SoX's input combiner can be configured (see OPTIONS below) to combine multiple
  files using any of the following methods: `concatenate', `sequence', `mix',
  `mix-power', `merge', or `multiply'. The default method is `sequence' for
  <b>play</b>, and `concatenate' for <b>rec</b> and <b>sox</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For all methods other than `sequence', multiple input files must have the same
  sampling rate. If necessary, separate SoX invocations can be used to make
  sampling rate adjustments prior to combining.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the `concatenate' combining method is selected (usually, this will be by
  default) then the input files must also have the same number of channels. The
  audio from each input will be concatenated in the order given to form the
  output file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The `sequence' combining method is selected automatically for <b>play</b>. It is
  similar to `concatenate' in that the audio from each input file is sent
  serially to the output file. However, here the output file may be closed and
  reopened at the corresponding transition between input files. This may be just
  what is needed when sending different types of audio to an output device, but
  is not generally useful when the output is a normal file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If either the `mix' or `mix-power' combining method is selected then two or more
  input files must be given and will be mixed together to form the output file.
  The number of channels in each input file need not be the same, but SoX will
  issue a warning if they are not and some channels in the output file will not
  contain audio from every input file. A mixed audio file cannot be un-mixed
  without reference to the original input files.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the `merge' combining method is selected then two or more input files must be
  given and will be merged together to form the output file. The number of
  channels in each input file need not be the same. A merged audio file
  comprises all of the channels from all of the input files. Un-merging is
  possible using multiple invocations of SoX with the <b>remix</b> effect. For
  example, two mono files could be merged to form one stereo file. The first and
  second mono files would become the left and right channels of the stereo file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The `multiply' combining method multiplies the sample values of corresponding
  channels (treated as numbers in the interval -1 to +1). If the number of
  channels in the input files is not the same, the missing channels are
  considered to contain all zero.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When combining input files, SoX applies any specified effects (including, for
  example, the <b>vol</b> volume adjustment effect) after the audio has been
  combined. However, it is often useful to be able to set the volume of (i.e.
  `balance') the inputs individually, before combining takes place.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For all combining methods, input file volume adjustments can be made manually
  using the <b>-v</b> option (below) which can be given for one or more input
  files. If it is given for only some of the input files then the others receive
  no volume adjustment. In some circumstances, automatic volume adjustments may
  be applied (see below).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>-V</b> option (below) can be used to show the input file volume
  adjustments that have been selected (either manually or automatically).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There are some special considerations that need to made when mixing input files:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Unlike the other methods, `mix' combining has the potential to cause clipping in
  the combiner if no balancing is performed. In this case, if manual volume
  adjustments are not given, SoX will try to ensure that clipping does not occur
  by automatically adjusting the volume (amplitude) of each input signal by a
  factor of &#x00B9;/n, where n is the number of input files. If this results in
  audio that is too quiet or otherwise unbalanced then the input file volumes
  can be set manually as described above. Using the <b>norm</b> effect on the
  mix is another alternative.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If mixed audio seems loud enough at some points but too quiet in others then
  dynamic range compression should be applied to correct this - see the
  <b>compand</b> effect.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
With the `mix-power' combine method, the mixed volume is approximately equal to
  that of one of the input signals. This is achieved by balancing using a factor
  of &#x00B9;/&#x221A;n instead of &#x00B9;/n. Note that this balancing factor
  does not guarantee that clipping will not occur, but the number of clips will
  usually be low and the resultant distortion is generally imperceptible.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Output_Files"><a class="selflink" href="#Output_Files">Output
  Files</a></h2>
SoX's default behaviour is to take one or more input files and write them to a
  single output file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This behaviour can be changed by specifying the pseudo-effect `newfile' within
  the effects list. SoX will then enter multiple output mode.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In multiple output mode, a new file is created when the effects prior to the
  `newfile' indicate they are done. The effects chain listed after `newfile' is
  then started up and its output is saved to the new file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In multiple output mode, a unique number will automatically be appended to the
  end of all filenames. If the filename has an extension then the number is
  inserted before the extension. This behaviour can be customized by placing a
  %n anywhere in the filename where the number should be substituted. An
  optional number can be placed after the % to indicate a minimum fixed width
  for the number.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Multiple output mode is not very useful unless an effect that will stop the
  effects chain early is specified before the `newfile'. If end of file is
  reached before the effects chain stops itself then no new file will be created
  as it would be empty.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The following is an example of splitting the first 60 seconds of an input file
  into two 30 second files and ignoring the rest.
<pre>
   sox song.wav ringtone%1n.wav trim 0 30 : newfile : trim 0 30
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Stopping_SoX"><a class="selflink" href="#Stopping_SoX">Stopping
  SoX</a></h2>
Usually SoX will complete its processing and exit automatically once it has read
  all available audio data from the input files.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If desired, it can be terminated earlier by sending an interrupt signal to the
  process (usually by pressing the keyboard interrupt key which is normally
  Ctrl-C). This is a natural requirement in some circumstances, e.g. when using
  SoX to make a recording. Note that when using SoX to play multiple files,
  Ctrl-C behaves slightly differently: pressing it once causes SoX to skip to
  the next file; pressing it twice in quick succession causes SoX to exit.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Another option to stop processing early is to use an effect that has a time
  period or sample count to determine the stopping point. The trim effect is an
  example of this. Once all effects chains have stopped then SoX will also stop.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILENAMES"><a class="selflink" href="#FILENAMES">FILENAMES</a></h1>
Filenames can be simple file names, absolute or relative path names, or URLs
  (input files only). Note that URL support requires that <b>wget</b>(1) is
  available.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note: Giving SoX an input or output filename that is the same as a SoX
  effect-name will not work since SoX will treat it as an effect specification.
  The only work-around to this is to avoid such filenames. This is generally not
  difficult since most audio filenames have a filename `extension', whilst
  effect-names do not.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Special_Filenames"><a class="selflink" href="#Special_Filenames">Special
  Filenames</a></h2>
The following special filenames may be used in certain circumstances in place of
  a normal filename on the command line:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">SoX can be used in simple pipeline operations by using the
      special filename `-' which, if used as an input filename, will cause SoX
      will read audio data from `standard input' (stdin), and which, if used as
      the output filename, will cause SoX will send audio data to `standard
      output' (stdout). Note that when using this option for the output file,
      and sometimes when using it for an input file, the file-type (see
      <b>-t</b> below) must also be given.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>&quot;|</b><i>program </i>[<i>options</i>]
    ...<b>&quot;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This can be used in place of an input filename to specify
      the the given program's standard output (stdout) be used as an input file.
      Unlike <b>-</b> (above), this can be used for several inputs to one SoX
      command. For example, if `genw' generates mono WAV formatted signals to
      its standard output, then the following command makes a stereo file from
      two generated signals:
    <pre>
   sox -M &quot;|genw --imd -&quot; &quot;|genw --thd -&quot; out.wav
    </pre>
    For headerless (raw) audio, <b>-t</b> (and perhaps other format options)
      will need to be given, preceding the input command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>&quot;</b><i>wildcard-filename</i><b>&quot;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies that filename `globbing' (wild-card matching)
      should be performed by SoX instead of by the shell. This allows a single
      set of file options to be applied to a group of files. For example, if the
      current directory contains three `vox' files, file1.vox, file2.vox, and
      file3.vox, then
    <pre>
   play --rate 6k *.vox
    </pre>
    will be expanded by the `shell' (in most environments) to
    <pre>
   play --rate 6k file1.vox file2.vox file3.vox
    </pre>
    which will treat only the first vox file as having a sample rate of 6k. With
    <pre>
   play --rate 6k &quot;*.vox&quot;
    </pre>
    the given sample rate option will be applied to all three vox files.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-p</b>, <b>--sox-pipe</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This can be used in place of an output filename to specify
      that the SoX command should be used as in input pipe to another SoX
      command. For example, the command:
    <pre>
   play &quot;|sox -n -p synth 2&quot; &quot;|sox -n -p synth 2 tremolo 10&quot; stat
    </pre>
    plays two `files' in succession, each with different effects.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>-p</b> is in fact an alias for ` <b>-t sox -</b>'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d</b>, <b>--default-device</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This can be used in place of an input or output filename to
      specify that the default audio device (if one has been built into SoX) is
      to be used. This is akin to invoking <b>rec</b> or <b>play</b> (as
      described above).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-n</b>, <b>--null</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This can be used in place of an input or output filename to
      specify that a `null file' is to be used. Note that here, `null file'
      refers to a SoX-specific mechanism and is not related to any
      operating-system mechanism with a similar name.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Using a null file to input audio is equivalent to using a normal audio file
      that contains an infinite amount of silence, and as such is not generally
      useful unless used with an effect that specifies a finite time length
      (such as <b>trim</b> or <b>synth</b>).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Using a null file to output audio amounts to discarding the audio and is
      useful mainly with effects that produce information about the audio
      instead of affecting it (such as <b>noiseprof</b> or <b>stat</b>).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The sampling rate associated with a null file is by default 48&#x00A0;kHz,
      but, as with a normal file, this can be overridden if desired using
      command-line format options (see below).</dd>

  Options</a></h2>
These options can be specified on the command line at any point before the first
  effect name.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>SOX_OPTS</b> environment variable can be used to provide alternative
  default values for SoX's global options. For example:
<pre>
   SOX_OPTS=&quot;--buffer 20000 --play-rate-arg -hs --temp /mnt/temp&quot;
</pre>
Note that setting SOX_OPTS can potentially create unwanted changes in the
  behaviour of scripts or other programs that invoke SoX. SOX_OPTS might best be
  used for things (such as in the given example) that reflect the environment in
  which SoX is being run. Enabling options such as <b>--no-clobber</b> as
  default might be handled better using a shell alias since a shell alias will
  not affect operation in scripts etc.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
One way to ensure that a script cannot be affected by SOX_OPTS is to clear
  SOX_OPTS at the start of the script, but this of course loses the benefit of
  SOX_OPTS carrying some system-wide default options. An alternative approach is
  to explicitly invoke SoX with default option values, e.g.
<pre>
   SOX_OPTS=&quot;-V --no-clobber&quot;
   ...
   sox -V2 --clobber $input $output ...
</pre>
Note that the way to set environment variables varies from system to system.
  Here are some examples:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Unix bash:
<pre>
   export SOX_OPTS=&quot;-V --no-clobber&quot;
</pre>
Unix csh:
<pre>
   setenv SOX_OPTS &quot;-V --no-clobber&quot;
</pre>
MS-DOS/MS-Windows:
<pre>
   set SOX_OPTS=-V --no-clobber

      is only supported with certain file types. Examples:
    <pre>
   sox -r 48k -e float -b 32 -c 2 input.raw output.wav
    </pre>
    converts a particular `raw' file to a self-describing `WAV' file.
    <pre>

    </pre>
    interprets the file data as belonging to a single channel regardless of what

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EFFECTS"><a class="selflink" href="#EFFECTS">EFFECTS</a></h1>
In addition to converting, playing and recording audio files, SoX can be used to
  invoke a number of audio `effects'. Multiple effects may be applied by
  specifying them one after another at the end of the SoX command line, forming
  an `effects chain'. Note that applying multiple effects in real-time (i.e.
  when playing audio) is likely to require a high performance computer. Stopping
  other applications may alleviate performance issues should they occur.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Some of the SoX effects are primarily intended to be applied to a single
  instrument or `voice'. To facilitate this, the <b>remix</b> effect and the
  global SoX option <b>-M</b> can be used to isolate then recombine tracks from
  a multi-track recording.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Multiple_Effects_Chains"><a class="selflink" href="#Multiple_Effects_Chains">Multiple
  Effects Chains</a></h2>
A single effects chain is made up of one or more effects. Audio from the input
  runs through the chain until either the end of the input file is reached or an
  effect in the chain requests to terminate the chain.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
SoX supports running multiple effects chains over the input audio. In this case,
  when one chain indicates it is done processing audio, the audio data is then
  sent through the next effects chain. This continues until either no more
  effects chains exist or the input has reached the end of the file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
An effects chain is terminated by placing a <b>:</b> (colon) after an effect.
  Any following effects are a part of a new effects chain.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
It is important to place the effect that will stop the chain as the first effect
  in the chain. This is because any samples that are buffered by effects to the
  left of the terminating effect will be discarded. The amount of samples
  discarded is related to the <b>--buffer</b> option and it should be kept
  small, relative to the sample rate, if the terminating effect cannot be first.
  Further information on stopping effects can be found in the <b>Stopping
  SoX</b> section.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There are a few pseudo-effects that aid using multiple effects chains. These
  include <b>newfile</b> which will start writing to a new output file before
  moving to the next effects chain and <b>restart</b> which will move back to
  the first effects chain. Pseudo-effects must be specified as the first effect
  in a chain and as the only effect in a chain (they must have a <b>:</b> before
  and after they are specified).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The following is an example of multiple effects chains. It will split the input
  file into multiple files of 30 seconds in length. Each output filename will
  have unique number in its name as documented in the <b>Output Files</b>
  section.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <i>frequency</i> sets the filter's central frequency and so can be used to

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The pitch-bending algorithm utilises the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) at

  <dd class="It-tag">Add a chorus effect to the audio. This can make a single
      vocal sound like a chorus, but can also be applied to instrumentation.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Chorus resembles an echo effect with a short delay, but whereas with echo
      the delay is constant, with chorus, it is varied using sinusoidal or
      triangular modulation. The modulation depth defines the range the
      modulated delay is played before or after the delay. Hence the delayed
      sound will sound slower or faster, that is the delayed sound tuned around
      the original one, like in a chorus where some vocals are slightly off key.
      See [3] for more discussion of the chorus effect.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Each four-tuple parameter delay/decay/speed/depth gives the delay in
      milliseconds and the decay (relative to gain-in) with a modulation speed
      in Hz using depth in milliseconds. The modulation is either sinusoidal (
      <b>-s</b>) or triangular ( <b>-t</b>). Gain-out is the volume of the
      output.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A typical delay is around 40ms to 60ms; the modulation speed is best near
      0.25Hz and the modulation depth around 2ms. For example, a single delay:
    <pre>
   play guitar1.wav chorus 0.7 0.9 55 0.4 0.25 2 -t
    </pre>
    Two delays of the original samples:

    Compand (compress or expand) the dynamic range of the audio.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <i>attack</i> and <i>decay</i> parameters (in seconds) determine the
      time over which the instantaneous level of the input signal is averaged to
      determine its volume; attacks refer to increases in volume and decays
      refer to decreases. For most situations, the attack time (response to the
      music getting louder) should be shorter than the decay time because the
      human ear is more sensitive to sudden loud music than sudden soft music.
      Where more than one pair of attack/decay parameters are specified, each
      input channel is companded separately and the number of pairs must agree
      with the number of input channels. Typical values are <b>0.3,0.8</b>
      seconds.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The second parameter is a list of points on the compander's transfer
      function specified in dB relative to the maximum possible signal
      amplitude. The input values must be in a strictly increasing order but the
      transfer function does not have to be monotonically rising. If omitted,
      the value of <i>out-dB1</i> defaults to the same value as <i>in-dB1</i>;
      levels below <i>in-dB1</i> are not companded (but may have gain applied to
      them). The point <b>0,0</b> is assumed but may be overridden (by
      <b>0,</b><i>out-dBn</i>). If the list is preceded by a <i>soft-knee-dB</i>
      value, then the points at where adjacent line segments on the transfer
      function meet will be rounded by the amount given. Typical values for the
      transfer function are <b>6:-70,-60,-20</b>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The third (optional) parameter is an additional gain in dB to be applied at
      all points on the transfer function and allows easy adjustment of the
      overall gain.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The fourth (optional) parameter is an initial level to be assumed for each
      channel when companding starts. This permits the user to supply a nominal
      level initially, so that, for example, a very large gain is not applied to
      initial signal levels before the companding action has begun to operate:
      it is quite probable that in such an event, the output would be severely
      clipped while the compander gain properly adjusts itself. A typical value
      (for audio which is initially quiet) is <b>-90</b> dB.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The fifth (optional) parameter is a delay in seconds. The input signal is
      analysed immediately to control the compander, but it is delayed before
      being fed to the volume adjuster. Specifying a delay approximately equal
      to the attack/decay times allows the compander to effectively operate in a
      `predictive' rather than a reactive mode. A typical value is <b>0.2</b>
      seconds.

    The following example might be used to make a piece of music with both quiet
      and loud passages suitable for listening to in a noisy environment such as
      a moving vehicle:
    <pre>
   sox asz.wav asz-car.wav compand 0.3,1 6:-70,-60,-20 -5 -90 0.2
    </pre>
    The transfer function (`6:-70,...') says that very soft sounds (below -70dB)
      will remain unchanged. This will stop the compander from boosting the
      volume on `silent' passages such as between movements. However, sounds in
      the range -60dB to 0dB (maximum volume) will be boosted so that the 60dB
      dynamic range of the original music will be compressed 3-to-1 into a 20dB
      range, which is wide enough to enjoy the music but narrow enough to get
      around the road noise. The `6:' selects 6dB soft-knee companding. The -5
      (dB) output gain is needed to avoid clipping (the number is inexact, and
      was derived by experimentation). The -90 (dB) for the initial volume will
      work fine for a clip that starts with near silence, and the delay of 0.2
      (seconds) has the effect of causing the compander to react a bit more
      quickly to sudden volume changes.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In the next example, compand is being used as a noise-gate for when the
      noise is at a lower level than the signal:
    <pre>
   play infile compand .1,.2 -inf,-50.1,-inf,-50,-50 0 -90 .1
    </pre>
    Here is another noise-gate, this time for when the noise is at a higher
      level than the signal (making it, in some ways, similar to squelch):
    <pre>
   play infile compand .1,.1 -45.1,-45,-inf,0,-inf 45 -90 .1
    </pre>
    This effect supports the <b>--plot</b> global option (for the transfer

    An alternative approach to removing a DC offset (albeit with a short delay)

  <dd class="It-tag">Apply Compact Disc (IEC 60908) de-emphasis (a treble
      attenuation shelving filter).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Pre-emphasis was applied in the mastering of some CDs issued in the early
      1980s. These included many classical music albums, as well as now
      sought-after issues of albums by The Beatles, Pink Floyd and others.
      Pre-emphasis should be removed at playback time by a de-emphasis filter in
      the playback device. However, not all modern CD players have this filter,
      and very few PC CD drives have it; playing pre-emphasised audio without
      the correct de-emphasis filter results in audio that sounds harsh and is
      far from what its creators intended.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    With the <b>deemph</b> effect, it is possible to apply the necessary
      de-emphasis to audio that has been extracted from a pre-emphasised CD, and
      then either burn the de-emphasised audio to a new CD (which will then play
      correctly on any CD player), or simply play the correctly de-emphasised
      audio files on the PC. For example:
    <pre>
   sox track1.wav track1-deemph.wav deemph
    </pre>
    and then burn track1-deemph.wav to CD, or
    <pre>
   play track1-deemph.wav
    </pre>
    or simply
    <pre>
   play track1.wav deemph
    </pre>
    The de-emphasis filter is implemented as a biquad; its maximum deviation
      from the ideal response is only 0.06dB (up to 20kHz).

  <dd class="It-tag">Apply dithering to the audio. Dithering deliberately adds a
      small amount of noise to the signal in order to mask audible quantization
      effects that can occur if the output sample size is less than 24 bits.
      With no options, this effect will add triangular (TPDF) white noise.
      Noise-shaping (only for certain sample rates) can be selected with
      <b>-s</b>. With the <b>-f</b> option, it is possible to select a
      particular noise-shaping filter from the following list: lipshitz,
      f-weighted, modified-e-weighted, improved-e-weighted, gesemann, shibata,
      low-shibata, high-shibata. Note that most filter types are available only
      with 44100Hz sample rate. The filter types are distinguished by the
      following properties: audibility of noise, level of (inaudible, but in
      some circumstances, otherwise problematic) shaped high frequency noise,
      and processing speed.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    See http://sox.sourceforge.net/SoX/NoiseShaping for graphs of the different
      noise-shaping curves.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>-S</b> option selects a slightly `sloped' TPDF, biased towards higher
      frequencies. It can be used at any sampling rate but below &#x2248;22k,
      plain TPDF is probably better, and above &#x2248; 37k, noise-shaped is
      probably better.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>-a</b> option enables a mode where dithering (and noise-shaping if
      applicable) are automatically enabled only when needed. The most likely
      use for this is when applying fade in or out to an already dithered file,
      so that the redithering applies only to the faded portions. However, auto
      dithering is not fool-proof, so the fades should be carefully checked for
      any noise modulation; if this occurs, then either re-dither the whole
      file, or use <b>trim</b>, <b>fade</b>, and concatencate.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>-p</b> option allows overriding the target precision.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the SoX global option <b>-R</b> option is not given, then the

  <dd class="It-tag">Add echoing to the audio. Echoes are reflected sound and
      can occur naturally amongst mountains (and sometimes large buildings) when
      talking or shouting; digital echo effects emulate this behaviour and are
      often used to help fill out the sound of a single instrument or vocal. The
      time difference between the original signal and the reflection is the
      `delay' (time), and the loudness of the reflected signal is the `decay'.
      Multiple echoes can have different delays and decays.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Each given <i>delay decay</i> pair gives the delay in milliseconds and the
      decay (relative to gain-in) of that echo. Gain-out is the volume of the

    [<b>-n</b>] [ <b>-l</b>|<b>-h</b>] [<i>gain-dB</i>]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Apply amplification or attenuation to the audio signal, or,
      in some cases, to some of its channels. Note that use of any of <b>-e</b>,
      <b>-B</b>, <b>-b</b>, <b>-r</b>, or <b>-n</b> requires temporary file
      space to store the audio to be processed, so may be unsuitable for use
      with `streamed' audio.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Without other options, <i>gain-dB</i> is used to adjust the signal power
      level by the given number of dB: positive amplifies (beware of Clipping),
      negative attenuates. With other options, the <i>gain-dB</i> amplification
      or attenuation is (logically) applied after the processing due to those
      options.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Given the <b>-e</b> option, the levels of the audio channels of a
      multi-channel file are `equalised', i.e. gain is applied to all channels
      other than that with the highest peak level, such that all channels attain
      the same peak level (but, without also giving <b>-n</b>, the audio is not
      `normalised').
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>-B</b> (balance) option is similar to <b>-e</b>, but with <b>-B,</b>
      the RMS level is used instead of the peak level. <b>-B</b> might be used
      to correct stereo imbalance caused by an imperfect record turntable
      cartridge. Note that unlike <b>-e</b>, <b>-B</b> might cause some
      clipping.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>-b</b> is similar to <b>-B</b> but has clipping protection, i.e. if
      necessary to prevent clipping whilst balancing, attenuation is applied to
      all channels. Note, however, that in conjunction with <b>-n</b>, <b>-B</b>
      and <b>-b</b> are synonymous.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>-r</b> option is used in conjunction with a prior invocation of
      <b>gain</b> with the <b>-h</b> option - see below for details.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>-n</b> option normalises the audio to 0dB FSD; it is often used in
      conjunction with a negative <i>gain-dB</i> to the effect that the audio is
      normalised to a given level below 0dB. For example,
    <pre>
   sox infile outfile gain -n
    </pre>
    normalises to 0dB, and
    <pre>
   sox infile outfile gain -n -3
    </pre>
    normalises to -3dB.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>-l</b> option invokes a simple limiter, e.g.
    <pre>
   sox infile outfile gain -l 6
    </pre>
    will apply 6dB of gain but never clip. Note that limiting more than a few
      dBs more than occasionally (in a piece of audio) is not recommended as it
      can cause audible distortion. See the <b>compand</b> effect for a more
      capable limiter.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>-h</b> option is used to apply gain to provide head-room for
      subsequent processing. For example, with
    <pre>
   sox infile outfile gain -h bass +6
    </pre>
    6dB of attenuation will be applied prior to the bass boosting effect thus
      ensuring that it will not clip. Of course, with bass, it is obvious how
      much headroom will be needed, but with other effects (e.g. rate, dither)
      it is not always as clear. Another advantage of using <b>gain -h</b>
      rather than an explicit attenuation, is that if the headroom is not used
      by subsequent effects, it can be reclaimed with <b>gain -r</b>, for
      example:
    <pre>
   sox infile outfile gain -h bass +6 rate 44100 gain -r
    </pre>
    The above effects chain guarantees never to clip nor amplify; it attenuates
      if necessary to prevent clipping, but by only as much as is needed to do
      so.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Output formatting (dithering and bit-depth reduction) also requires headroom
      (which cannot be `reclaimed'), e.g.
    <pre>
   sox infile outfile gain -h bass +6 rate 44100 gain -rh dither
    </pre>
    Here, the second <b>gain</b> invocation, reclaims as much of the headroom as
      it can from the preceding effects, but retains as much headroom as is
      needed for subsequent processing. The SoX global option <b>-G</b> can be
      given to automatically invoke <b>gain -h</b> and <b>gain -r</b>.

      loudness. The gain is adjusted by the given <i>gain</i> parameter (usually
      negative) and the signal equalised according to ISO 226 w.r.t. a reference
      level of 65dB, though an alternative <i>reference</i> level may be given
      if the original audio has been equalised for some other optimal level. A
      default gain of -10dB is used if a <i>gain</i> value is not given.

    The multi-band compander is similar to the single-band compander but the
      audio is first divided into bands using Linkwitz-Riley cross-over filters
      and a separately specifiable compander run on each band. See the
      <b>compand</b> effect for the definition of its parameters. Compand
      parameters are specified between double quotes and the crossover frequency
      for that band is given by <i>crossover-freq</i>; these can be repeated to
      create multiple bands.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example, the following (one long) command shows how multi-band
      companding is typically used in FM radio:
    <pre>
   play track1.wav gain -3 sinc 8000- 29 100 mcompand \

	gain 15 highpass 22 highpass 22 sinc -n 255 -b 16 -17500 \
	gain 9 lowpass -1 17801
    </pre>
    The audio file is played with a simulated FM radio sound (or broadcast
      signal condition if the lowpass filter at the end is skipped). Note that
      the pipeline is set up with US-style 75us pre-emphasis.

      silence but in fact contains noise - such sections are typically found at

    How much noise should be removed is specified by <i>amount</i>-<i>a</i>
      number between 0 and 1 with a default of 0.5. Higher numbers will remove
      more noise but present a greater likelihood of removing wanted components
      of the audio signal. Before replacing an original recording with a

    </table>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    N.B. Override options cannot be used with the `quick' or `low' quality
      algorithms.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    All resamplers use filters that can sometimes create `echo' (a.k.a.
      `ringing') artefacts with transient signals such as those that occur with
      `finger snaps' or other highly percussive sounds. Such artefacts are much
      more noticeable to the human ear if they occur before the transient
      (`pre-echo') than if they occur after it (`post-echo'). Note that
      frequency of any such artefacts is related to the smaller of the original
      and new sampling rates but that if this is at least 44.1kHz, then the
      artefacts will lie outside the range of human hearing.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A phase response setting may be used to control the distribution of any
      transient echo between `pre' and `post': with minimum phase, there is no
      pre-echo but the longest post-echo; with linear phase, pre and post echo
      are in equal amounts (in signal terms, but not audibility terms); the
      intermediate phase setting attempts to find the best compromise by
      selecting a small length (and level) of pre-echo and a medium lengthed
      post-echo.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Minimum, intermediate, or linear phase response is selected using the
      <b>-M</b>, <b>-I</b>, or <b>-L</b> option; a custom phase response can be
      created with the <b>-p</b> option. Note that phase responses between
      `linear' and `maximum' (greater than 50) are rarely useful.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A resampler's band-width setting determines how much of the frequency
      content of the original signal (w.r.t. the original sample rate when
      up-sampling, or the new sample rate when down-sampling) is preserved
      during conversion. The term `pass-band' is used to refer to all
      frequencies up to the band-width point (e.g. for 44.1kHz sampling rate,
      and a resampling band-width of 95%, the pass-band represents frequencies
      from 0Hz (D.C.) to circa 21kHz). Increasing the resampler's band-width
      results in a slower conversion and can increase transient echo artefacts
      (and vice versa).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>-s</b> `steep filter' option changes resampling band-width from the
      default 95% (based on the 3dB point), to 99%. The <b>-b</b> option allows
      the band-width to be set to any value in the range 74-99.7 %, but note
      that band-width values greater than 99% are not recommended for normal use
      as they can cause excessive transient echo.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the <b>-a</b> option is given, then aliasing/imaging above the pass-band
      is allowed. For example, with 44.1kHz sampling rate, and a resampling
      band-width of 95%, this means that frequency content above 21kHz can be
      distorted; however, since this is above the pass-band (i.e. above the
      highest frequency of interest/audibility), this may not be a problem. The
      benefits of allowing aliasing/imaging are reduced processing time, and
      reduced (by almost half) transient echo artefacts. Note that if this
      option is given, then the minimum band-width allowable with <b>-b</b>
      increases to 85%.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Examples:
    <pre>
   sox input.wav -b 16 output.wav rate -s -a 44100 dither -s
    </pre>
    default (high) quality resampling; overrides: steep filter, allow aliasing;
      to 44.1kHz sample rate; noise-shaped dither to 16-bit WAV file.

    Where a range of channels is specified, the channel numbers to the left and

      Custom mixing volumes can be set by following a given input channel or
      range of input channels with a <i>vol-spec</i> (volume specification).
      This is one of the letters <b>p</b>, <b>i</b>, or <b>v</b>, followed by a
      volume number, the meaning of which depends on the given letter and is
      defined as follows:
    <table class="tbl">
      <colgroup>
        <col style="width: 6.00ex;"/>

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If an <i>out-spec</i> includes at least one <i>vol-spec</i> then, by
      default, &#x00B9;/n scaling is not applied to any other channels in the
      same out-spec (though may be in other out-specs). The -a (automatic)
      option however, can be given to retain the automatic scaling in this case.
      For example,
    <pre>
   sox input.wav output.wav remix 1,2 3,4v0.8
    </pre>
    results in channel level multipliers of 0.5,0.5 1,0.8, whereas
    <pre>
   sox input.wav output.wav remix -a 1,2 3,4v0.8
    </pre>
    results in channel level multipliers of 0.5,0.5 0.5,0.8.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The -m (manual) option disables all automatic volume adjustments, so
    <pre>
   sox input.wav output.wav remix -m 1,2 3,4v0.8
    </pre>
    results in channel level multipliers of 1,1 1,0.8.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The volume number is optional and omitting it corresponds to no volume
      change; however, the only case in which this is useful is in conjunction
      with <b>i</b>. For example, if <i>input.wav</i> is stereo, then
    <pre>
   sox input.wav output.wav remix 1,2i
    </pre>
    is a mono equivalent of the <b>oops</b> effect.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the <b>-p</b> option is given, then any automatic &#x00B9;/n scaling is
      replaced by &#x00B9;/&#x221A;n (`power') scaling; this gives a louder mix
      but one that might occasionally clip.

    One use of the <b>remix</b> effect is to split an audio file into a set of
      files, each containing one of the constituent channels (in order to
      perform subsequent processing on individual audio channels). Where more
      than a few channels are involved, a script such as the following (Bourne
      shell script) is useful:
    <pre>
#!/bin/sh
chans=`soxi -c &quot;$1&quot;`
while [ $chans -ge 1 ]; do
   chans0=`printf %02i $chans`   # 2 digits hence up to 99 chans
   out=`echo &quot;$1&quot;|sed &quot;s/\(.*\)\.\(.*\)/\1-$chans0.\2/&quot;`
   sox &quot;$1&quot; &quot;$out&quot; remix $chans
   chans=`expr $chans - 1`
done
    </pre>
    If a file <i>input.wav</i> containing six audio channels were given, the
      script would produce six output files: <i>input-01.wav</i>,
      <i>input-02.wav</i>, ..., <i>input-06.wav</i>.

    Add reverberation to the audio using the `freeverb' algorithm. A
      reverberation effect is sometimes desirable for concert halls that are too
      small or contain so many people that the hall's natural reverberance is
      diminished. Applying a small amount of stereo reverb to a (dry) mono
      signal will usually make it sound more natural. See [3] for a detailed
      description of reverberation.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that this effect increases both the volume and the length of the audio,
      so to prevent clipping in these domains, a typical invocation might be:
    <pre>
   play dry.wav gain -3 pad 0 3 reverb
    </pre>
    The <b>-w</b> option can be given to select only the `wet' signal, thus
      allowing it to be processed further, independently of the `dry' signal.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Removes silence from the beginning, middle, or end of the audio. `Silence'
      is determined by a specified threshold.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <i>above-periods</i> value is used to indicate if audio should be
      trimmed at the beginning of the audio. A value of zero indicates no
      silence should be trimmed from the beginning. When specifying an non-zero
      <i>above-periods</i>, it trims audio up until it finds non-silence.
      Normally, when trimming silence from beginning of audio the
      <i>above-periods</i> will be 1 but it can be increased to higher values to
      trim all audio up to a specific count of non-silence periods. For example,
      if you had an audio file with two songs that each contained 2 seconds of
      silence before the song, you could specify an <i>above-period</i> of 2 to
      strip out both silence periods and the first song.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When <i>above-periods</i> is non-zero, you must also specify a
      <i>duration</i> and <i>threshold</i>. <i>Duration</i> indications the
      amount of time that non-silence must be detected before it stops trimming
      audio. By increasing the duration, burst of noise can be treated as
      silence and trimmed off.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <i>Threshold</i> is used to indicate what sample value you should treat as
      silence. For digital audio, a value of 0 may be fine but for audio
      recorded from analog, you may wish to increase the value to account for
      background noise.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When optionally trimming silence from the end of the audio, you specify a
      <i>below-periods</i> count. In this case, <i>below-period</i> means to
      remove all audio after silence is detected. Normally, this will be a value
      1 of but it can be increased to skip over periods of silence that are
      wanted. For example, if you have a song with 2 seconds of silence in the
      middle and 2 second at the end, you could set below-period to a value of 2
      to skip over the silence in the middle of the audio.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For <i>below-periods</i>, <i>duration</i> specifies a period of silence that
      must exist before audio is not copied any more. By specifying a higher
      duration, silence that is wanted can be left in the audio. For example, if
      you have a song with an expected 1 second of silence in the middle and 2
      seconds of silence at the end, a duration of 2 seconds could be used to
      skip over the middle silence.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Unfortunately, you must know the length of the silence at the end of your
      audio file to trim off silence reliably. A work around is to use the
      <b>silence</b> effect in combination with the <b>reverse</b> effect. By
      first reversing the audio, you can use the <i>above-periods</i> to
      reliably trim all audio from what looks like the front of the file. Then
      reverse the file again to get back to normal.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    To remove silence from the middle of a file, specify a <i>below-periods</i>
      that is negative. This value is then treated as a positive value and is
      also used to indicate the effect should restart processing as specified by
      the <i>above-periods</i>, making it suitable for removing periods of
      silence in the middle of the audio.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The option <b>-l</b> indicates that <i>below-periods</i> <i>duration</i>
      length of audio should be left intact at the beginning of each period of
      silence. For example, if you want to remove long pauses between words but
      do not want to remove the pauses completely.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <i>period</i> counts are in units of samples. <i>Duration</i> counts may
      be in the format of hh:mm:ss.frac, or the exact count of samples.
      <i>Threshold</i> numbers may be suffixed with <b>d</b> to indicate the
      value is in decibels, or <b>%</b> to indicate a percentage of maximum
      value of the sample value ( <b>0%</b> specifies pure digital silence).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The following example shows how this effect can be used to start a recording

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The spectrogram is rendered in a Portable Network Graphic (PNG) file, and
      shows time in the X-axis, frequency in the Y-axis, and audio signal
      magnitude in the Z-axis. Z-axis values are represented by the colour (or
      optionally the intensity) of the pixels in the X-Y plane. If the audio
      signal contains multiple channels then these are shown from top to bottom
      starting from channel 1 (which is the left channel for stereo audio).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example, if `my.wav' is a stereo file, then with
    <pre>
   sox my.wav -n spectrogram
    </pre>
    a spectrogram of the entire file will be created in the file
      `spectrogram.png'. More often though, analysis of a smaller portion of the
      audio is required; e.g. with
    <pre>
   sox my.wav -n remix 2 trim 20 30 spectrogram
    </pre>
    the spectrogram shows information only from the second (right) channel, and
      of thirty seconds of audio starting from twenty seconds in. To analyse a
      small portion of the frequency domain, the <b>rate</b> effect may be used,
      e.g.
    <pre>
   sox my.wav -n rate 6k spectrogram
    </pre>
    allows detailed analysis of frequencies up to 3kHz (half the sampling rate)
      i.e. where the human auditory system is most sensitive. With
    <pre>
   sox my.wav -n trim 0 10 spectrogram -x 600 -y 200 -z 100
    </pre>
    the given options control the size of the spectrogram's X, Y &amp; Z axes
      (in this case, the spectrogram area of the produced image will be 600 by
      200 pixels in size and the Z-axis range will be 100 dB). Note that the
      produced image includes axes legends etc. and so will be a little larger
      than the specified spectrogram size. In this example:
    <pre>
   sox -n -n synth 6 tri 10k:14k spectrogram -z 100 -w kaiser
    </pre>
    an analysis `window' with high dynamic range is selected to best display the
      spectrogram of a swept triangular wave. For a smilar example, append the
      following to the `chime' command in the description of the <b>delay</b>
      effect (above):
    <pre>
   rate 2k spectrogram -X 200 -Z -10 -w kaiser
    </pre>
    Options are also avaliable to control the appearance (colour-set,

    <pre>
   sox my.wav -n spectrogram -m -l -o print.png

    To perform a splice, first use the <b>trim</b> effect to select the audio
      sections to be joined together. As when performing a tape splice, the end
      of the section to be spliced onto should be trimmed with a small
      <i>excess</i> (default 0.005 seconds) of audio after the ideal joining
      point. The beginning of the audio section to splice on should be trimmed
      with the same <i>excess</i> (before the ideal joining point), plus an
      additional <i>leeway</i> (default 0.005 seconds). SoX should then be
      invoked with the two audio sections as input files and the <b>splice</b>
      effect given with the position at which to perform the splice - this is
      length of the first audio section (including the excess).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The following diagram uses the tape analogy to illustrate the splice
      operation. The effect simulates the diagonal cuts and joins the two
      pieces:
    <pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example, a long song begins with two verses which start (as determined
      e.g. by using the <b>play</b> command with the <b>trim</b> ( <i>start</i>)
      effect) at times 0:30.125 and 1:03.432. The following commands cut out the
      first verse:
    <pre>
   sox too-long.wav part1.wav trim 0 30.130
    </pre>
    (5 ms excess, after the first verse starts)
    <pre>
   sox too-long.wav part2.wav trim 1:03.422
    </pre>
    (5 ms excess plus 5 ms leeway, before the second verse starts)
    <pre>
   sox part1.wav part2.wav just-right.wav splice 30.130
    </pre>
    For another example, the SoX command
    <pre>
   play &quot;|sox -n -p synth 1 sin %1&quot; &quot;|sox -n -p synth 1 sin %3&quot;
    </pre>
    generates and plays two notes, but there is a nasty click at the transition;
      the click can be removed by splicing instead of concatenating the audio,
      i.e. by appending <b>splice 1</b> to the command. (Clicks at the beginning
      and end of the audio can be removed by <i>preceding</i> the splice effect
      with <b>fade q .01 2 .01</b>).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Provided your arithmetic is good enough, multiple splices can be performed
      with a single <b>splice</b> invocation. For example:
    <pre>
#!/bin/sh
# Audio Copy and Paste Over
# acpo infile copy-start copy-stop paste-over-start outfile
# All times measured in samples.
rate=`soxi -r &quot;$1&quot;`
e=`expr $rate '*' 5 / 1000`  # Using default excess
l=$e                         # and leeway.
sox &quot;$1&quot; piece.wav trim `expr $2 - $e - $l`s \
   `expr $3 - $2 + $e + $l + $e`s
sox &quot;$1&quot; part1.wav trim 0 `expr $4 + $e`s
sox &quot;$1&quot; part2.wav trim `expr $4 + $3 - $2 - $e - $l`s
sox part1.wav piece.wav part2.wav &quot;$5&quot; splice \
   `expr $4 + $e`s \
   `expr $4 + $e + $3 - $2 + $e + $l + $e`s
    </pre>
    In the above Bourne shell script, two splices are used to `copy and paste'
      audio.

    It is also possible to use this effect to perform general cross-fades, e.g.
      to join two songs. In this case, <i>excess</i> would typically be an
      number of seconds, the <b>-q</b> option would typically be given (to
      select an `equal power' cross-fade), and <i>leeway</i> should be zero
      (which is the default if <b>-q</b> is given). For example, if f1.wav and
      f2.wav are audio files to be cross-faded, then
    <pre>
   sox f1.wav f2.wav out.wav splice -q $(soxi -D f1.wav),3
    </pre>
    cross-fades the files where the point of equal loudness is 3 seconds before
      the end of f1.wav, i.e. the total length of the cross-fade is 2 &#x00D7; 3
      = 6 seconds (Note: the $(...) notation is POSIX shell).</dd>

      The default value of <i>scale</i> is 2147483647 (i.e. the maximum value of

    <i>Flat&#x00A0;factor</i> is a measure of the flatness (i.e. consecutive
      samples with the same value) of the signal at its peak levels (i.e. either
      <i>Min&#x00A0;level</i>, or <i>Max&#x00A0;level</i>).
      <i>Pk&#x00A0;count</i> is the number of occasions (not the number of
      samples) that the signal attained either <i>Min&#x00A0;level</i>, or
      <i>Max&#x00A0;level</i>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The right-hand <i>Bit-depth</i> figure is the standard definition of
      bit-depth i.e. bits less significant than the given number are fixed at
      zero. The left-hand figure is the number of most significant bits that are
      fixed at zero (or one for negative numbers) subtracted from the right-hand
      figure (the number subtracted is directly related to
      <i>Pk&#x00A0;lev&#x00A0;dB</i>).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For multi-channel audio, an overall figure for each of the above
      measurements is given and derived from the channel figures as follows:
      <i>DC&#x00A0;offset</i>: maximum magnitude; <i>Max&#x00A0;level</i>,
      <i>Pk&#x00A0;lev&#x00A0;dB</i>, <i>RMS&#x00A0;Pk&#x00A0;dB</i>,
      <i>Bit-depth</i>: maximum; <i>Min&#x00A0;level</i>,
      <i>RMS&#x00A0;Tr&#x00A0;dB</i>: minimum; <i>RMS&#x00A0;lev&#x00A0;dB</i>,
      <i>Flat&#x00A0;factor</i>, <i>Pk&#x00A0;count</i>: average;
      <i>Crest&#x00A0;factor</i>: not applicable.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>Length&#x00A0;s</i> is the duration in seconds of the audio, and
      <i>Num&#x00A0;samples</i> is equal to the sample-rate multiplied by
      <i>Length</i>. <i>Scale&#x00A0;Max</i> is the scaling applied to the first
      three measurements; specifically, it is the maximum value that could apply
      to <i>Max&#x00A0;level</i>. <i>Window&#x00A0;s</i> is the length of the
      window used for the peak and trough RMS measurements.

  <dd class="It-tag">This effect can be used to generate fixed or swept
      frequency audio tones with various wave shapes, or to generate wide-band
      noise of various `colours'. Multiple synth effects can be cascaded to
      produce more complex waveforms; at each stage it is possible to choose
      whether the generated waveform will be mixed with, or modulated onto the
      output from the previous stage. Audio for each channel in a multi-channel
      audio file can be synthesised independently.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Though this effect is used to generate audio, an input file must still be
      given, the characteristics of which will be used to set the synthesised
      audio length, the number of channels, and the sampling rate; however,
      since the input file's audio is not normally needed, a `null file' (with
      the special name <b>-n</b>) is often given instead (and the length
      specified as a parameter to <b>synth</b> or by another given effect that
      can has an associated length).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example, the following produces a 3 second, 48kHz, audio file containing
      a sine-wave swept from 300 to 3300&#x00A0;Hz:
    <pre>
   sox -n output.wav synth 3 sine 300-3300
    </pre>
    and this produces an 8&#x00A0;kHz version:
    <pre>
   sox -r 8000 -n output.wav synth 3 sine 300-3300
    </pre>
    Multiple channels can be synthesised by specifying the set of parameters
      shown between braces multiple times; the following puts the swept tone in
      the left channel and adds `brown' noise in the right:
    <pre>
   sox -n output.wav synth 3 sine 300-3300 brownnoise
    </pre>
    The following example shows how two synth effects can be cascaded to create
      a more complex waveform:
    <pre>
   play -n synth 0.5 sine 200-500 synth 0.5 sine fmod 700-100
    </pre>
    Frequencies can also be given in `scientific' note notation, or, by
      prefixing a `%' character, as a number of semitones relative to `middle A'
      (440&#x00A0;Hz). For example, the following could be used to help tune a
      guitar's low `E' string:
    <pre>
   play -n synth 4 pluck %-29
    </pre>
    or with a (Bourne shell) loop, the whole guitar:
    <pre>
   for n in E2 A2 D3 G3 B3 E4; do
	play -n synth 4 pluck $n repeat 2; done
    </pre>
    See the <b>delay</b> effect (above) and the reference to `SoX scripting
      examples' (below) for more <b>synth</b> examples.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>N.B.</b> This effect generates audio at maximum volume (0dBFS), which
      means that there is a high chance of clipping when using the audio
      subsequently, so in many cases, you will want to follow this effect with
      the <b>gain</b> effect to prevent this from happening. (See also
      <b>Clipping</b> above.) Note that, by default, the <b>synth</b> effect
      incorporates the functionality of <b>gain -h</b> (see the <b>gain</b>
      effect for details); <b>synth</b>'s <b>-n</b> option may be given to
      disable this behaviour.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A detailed description of each <b>synth</b> parameter follows:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <i>len</i> is the length of audio to synthesise expressed as a time or as a
      number of samples; 0=inputlength, default=0.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The format for specifying lengths in time is hh:mm:ss.frac. The format for
      specifying sample counts is the number of samples with the letter `s'
      appended to it.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <i>type</i> is one of sine, square, triangle, sawtooth, trapezium, exp,
      [white]noise, tpdfnoise pinknoise, brownnoise, pluck; default=sine.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <i>combine</i> is one of create, mix, amod (amplitude modulation), fmod
      (frequency modulation); default=create.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <i>freq</i>/<i>freq2</i> are the frequencies at the beginning/end of
      synthesis in Hz or, if preceded with `%', semitones relative to A
      (440&#x00A0;Hz); alternatively, `scientific' note notation (e.g. E2) may
      be used. The default frequency is 440Hz. By default, the tuning used with
      the note notations is `equal temperament'; the <b>-j</b> <i>KEY</i> option
      selects `just intonation', where <i>KEY</i> is an integer number of
      semitones relative to A (so for example, -9 or 3 selects the key of C), or
      a note in scientific notation.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If <i>freq2</i> is given, then <i>len</i> must also have been given and the
      generated tone will be swept between the given frequencies. The two given
      frequencies must be separated by one of the characters `:', `+', `/', or
      `-'. This character is used to specify the sweep function as follows:</dd>

    <i>factor</i> [<i>segment</i> [<i>search</i> [<i>overlap</i>]]]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Change the audio playback speed but not its pitch. This
      effect uses the WSOLA algorithm. The audio is chopped up into segments
      which are then shifted in the time domain and overlapped (cross-faded) at
      points where their waveforms are most similar as determined by measurement
      of `least squares'.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    By default, linear searches are used to find the best overlapping points. If
      the optional <b>-q</b> parameter is given, tree searches are used instead.
      This makes the effect work more quickly, but the result may not sound as
      good. However, if you must improve the processing speed, this generally
      reduces the sound quality less than reducing the search or overlap values.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>-m</b> option is used to optimize default values of segment, search
      and overlap for music processing.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>-s</b> option is used to optimize default values of segment, search
      and overlap for speech processing.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>-l</b> option is used to optimize default values of segment, search
      and overlap for `linear' processing that tends to cause more noticeable
      distortion but may be useful when factor is close to 1.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If -m, -s, or -l is specified, the default value of segment will be
      calculated based on factor, while default search and overlap values are
      based on segment. Any values you provide still override these default
      values.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <i>factor</i> gives the ratio of new tempo to the old tempo, so e.g. 1.1
      speeds up the tempo by 10%, and 0.9 slows it down by 10%.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The optional <i>segment</i> parameter selects the algorithm's segment size
      in milliseconds. If no other flags are specified, the default value is 82
      and is typically suited to making small changes to the tempo of music. For
      larger changes (e.g. a factor of 2), 41&#x00A0;ms may give a better
      result. The -m, -s, and -l flags will cause the segment default to be
      automatically adjusted based on factor. For example using -s (for speech)
      with a tempo of 1.25 will calculate a default segment value of 32.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The optional <i>search</i> parameter gives the audio length in milliseconds
      over which the algorithm will search for overlapping points. If no other
      flags are specified, the default value is 14.68. Larger values use more
      processing time and may or may not produce better results. A practical
      maximum is half the value of segment. Search can be reduced to cut
      processing time at the risk of degrading output quality. The -m, -s, and
      -l flags will cause the search default to be automatically adjusted based
      on segment.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The optional <i>overlap</i> parameter gives the segment overlap length in
      milliseconds. Default value is 12, but -m, -s, or -l flags automatically
      adjust overlap based on segment size. Increasing overlap increases
      processing time and may increase quality. A practical maximum for overlap
      is the value of search, with overlap typically being (at least) a little
      smaller then search.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If a <i>position</i> is preceded by an equals or minus sign, it is
      interpreted relative to the beginning or the end of the audio,
      respectively. (The audio length must be known for end-relative locations
      to work.) Otherwise, it is considered an offset from the last
      <i>position</i>, or from the start of audio for the first parameter. Using
      a value of 0 for the first <i>position</i> parameter allows copying from
      the beginning of the audio.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    All parameters can be specified using either an amount of time or an exact

  <dd class="It-tag">Apply an amplification or an attenuation to the audio
      signal. Unlike the <b>-v</b> option (which is used for balancing multiple
      input files as they enter the SoX effects processing chain), <b>vol</b> is
      an effect like any other so can be applied anywhere, and several times if
      necessary, during the processing chain.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The amount to change the volume is given by <i>gain</i> which is
      interpreted, according to the given <i>type</i>, as follows: if
      <i>type</i> is <b>amplitude</b> (or is omitted), then <i>gain</i> is an
      amplitude (i.e. voltage or linear) ratio, if <b>power</b>, then a power
      (i.e. wattage or voltage-squared) ratio, and if <b>dB</b>, then a power
      change in dB.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When <i>type</i> is <b>amplitude</b> or <b>power</b>, a <i>gain</i> of 1
      leaves the volume unchanged, less than 1 decreases it, and greater than 1
      increases it; a negative <i>gain</i> inverts the audio signal in addition
      to adjusting its volume.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When <i>type</i> is <b>dB</b>, a <i>gain</i> of 0 leaves the volume
      unchanged, less than 0 decreases it, and greater than 0 increases it.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    See [4] for a detailed discussion on electrical (and hence audio signal)
      voltage and power ratios.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Beware of <b>Clipping</b> when the increasing the volume.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <i>gain</i> and the <i>type</i> parameters can be concatenated if
      desired, e.g. <b>vol 10dB</b>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    An optional <i>limitergain</i> value can be specified and should be a value
      much less than 1 (e.g. 0.05 or 0.02) and is used only on peaks to prevent
      clipping. Not specifying this parameter will cause no limiter to be used.
      In verbose mode, this effect will display the percentage of the audio that
      needed to be limited.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    See also <b>gain</b> for a volume-changing effect with different
      capabilities, and <b>compand</b> for a dynamic-range
      compression/expansion/limiting effect.</dd>

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Deprecated_Effects"><a class="selflink" href="#Deprecated_Effects">Deprecated
  Effects</a></h2>
The following effects have been renamed or have their functionality included in
  another effect; they continue to work in this version of SoX but may be
  removed in future.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>mixer</b> [
    <b>-l</b>|<b>-r</b>|<b>-f</b>|<b>-b</b>|<b>-1</b>|
    <b>-2</b>|<b>-3</b>|<b>-4</b>| <i>n</i>{<b>,</b><i>n</i>} ]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Reduce the number of audio channels by mixing or selecting
      channels, or increase the number of channels by duplicating channels.
      Note: this effect operates on the audio <i>channels</i> within the SoX
      effects processing chain; it should not be confused with the <b>-m</b>
      global option (where multiple <i>files</i> are mix-combined before
      entering the effects chain).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When reducing the number of channels it is possible to use the <b>-l</b>,
      <b>-r</b>, <b>-f</b>, <b>-b</b>, <b>-1</b>, <b>-2</b>, <b>-3</b>,
      <b>-4</b>, options to select only the left, right, front, back channel(s)
      or specific channel for the output instead of averaging the channels. The
      <b>-l</b>, and <b>-r</b> options will do averaging in quad-channel files
      so select the exact channel to prevent this.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>mixer</b> effect can also be invoked with up to 16 numbers, separated
      by commas, which specify the proportion (0 = 0% and 1 = 100%) of each
      input channel that is to be mixed into each output channel. In two-channel
      mode, 4 numbers are given: l &#x2192; l, l &#x2192; r, r &#x2192; l, and r
      &#x2192; r, respectively. In four-channel mode, the first 4 numbers give
      the proportions for the left-front output channel, as follows: lf &#x2192;
      lf, rf &#x2192; lf, lb &#x2192; lf, and rb &#x2192; rf. The next 4 give
      the right-front output in the same order, then left-back and right-back.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    It is also possible to use the 16 numbers to expand or reduce the channel
      count; just specify 0 for unused channels.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Finally, certain reduced combination of numbers can be specified for certain
      input/output channel combinations.
