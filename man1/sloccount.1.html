<p>SLOCCOUNT(1) SLOCCount SLOCCOUNT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sloccount - count source lines of code (SLOC)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sloccount [--version] [--cached] [--append] [ --datadir
directory ] [--follow] [--duplicates] [--crossdups]
[--autogen] [--multiproject] [--filecount] [--wide]
[--details] [ <br>
--effort F E ] [ --schedule F E ] [ --personcost cost ] [
--overhead overhead ] [ --addlang language ] [ --addlangall
] [--] directories</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
sloccount counts the physical source lines of code (SLOC)
contained in descendants of the specified set of
directories. It automatically determines which files are
source code <br>
files, and it automatically determines the computer language
used in each file. By default it summarizes the SLOC results
and presents various estimates (such as effort and cost <br>
to develop), but its output can be controlled by various
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you give sloccount a list of
two or more directories, the counts will be broken up
according to that list. There is one important limitation:
the basenames of the directories <br>
given as parameters must be different, because those names
are used to group summary information. Thus, you can&rsquo;t
run &quot;sloccount /usr/src/hello
/usr/local/src/hello&quot;. This lim&acirc; <br>
itation only applies to parameters of sloccount -
subdirectories descended from the top directories can have
the same basename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you give sloccount only a
single directory, sloccount tries to automatically find a
reasonable breakdown for purposes of reporting (so
it&rsquo;ll produce a useful report). In this <br>
case, if the directory has at least two subdirectories, then
those subdirectories will be used as the breakdown. If the
single directory contains files as well as directories <br>
(or if you give sloccount some files as parameters), those
files will be assigned to the directory &quot;top_dir&quot;
so you can tell them apart from other contents. Finally, if
there&rsquo;s <br>
a subdirectory named &quot;src&quot;, then that subdirectory
is again broken down, with all the further subdirectories
prefixed with &quot;src_&quot;. Thus, if directory
&quot;X&quot; has a subdirectory <br>
&quot;src&quot;, which contains subdirectory
&quot;modules&quot;, sloccount will report a separate count
for &quot;src_modules&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sloccount normally considers all
descendants of these directories, though unless told
otherwise it ignores symbolic links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sloccount is the usual front-end
of the package of tools named &quot;SLOCCount&quot;. Note
that the name of the entire package has capital letters,
while the name of this front-end pro&acirc; <br>
gram does not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sloccount will normally report
estimates of schedule time, effort, and cost, and for single
projects it also estimates the average number of active
developers. These are merely <br>
estimates, not etched in stone; you can modify the
parameters used to improve the estimates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--version Report the version number of SLOCCount and
immediately exit. This option can&rsquo;t be usefully
combined with any other option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cached Do not recalculate;
instead, use cached results from a previous execution.
Without the --cached or --append option, sloccount
automatically removes the data direc&acirc; <br>
tory and recreates it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--append Do not remove previous
calculations from the data directory; instead, add the
analysis to the current contents of the data directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--datadir directory <br>
Store or use cached data in the given data directory;
default value is &quot;~/.slocdata&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--follow Follow symbolic
links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--duplicates <br>
Count all duplicates. Normally, if files have equal content
(as determined using MD5 hash values), only one is
counted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--crossdups Count duplicates if
they occur in different portions of the breakdown. Thus, if
the top directory contains many different projects, and you
want the duplicates in <br>
different projects to count in each project, choose this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--autogen Count source code
files that appear to be automatically generated. Normally
these are excluded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--multiproject <br>
The different directories represent different projects;
otherwise, it&rsquo;s assumed that all of the source code
belongs to a single project. This doesn&rsquo;t change the
<br>
total number of files or SLOC values, but it does affect the
effort and schedule estimates. Given this option, effort is
computed separately for each project (and <br>
then summed), and the schedule is the estimated schedule of
the largest project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--filecount Display counts of
files instead of SLOC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--wide Display in the
&quot;wide&quot; (tab-separated) format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--details Display details, that
is, results for every source code file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--effort F E <br>
Change the factor and exponent for the effort model. Effort
(in person-months) is computed as F*(SLOC/1000)^E.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--schedule F E <br>
Change the factor and exponent for the schedule model.
Schedule (in months) is computed as F*(effort)^E.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--personcost cost <br>
Change the average annual salary to cost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--overhead overhead <br>
Change the overhead value to overhead. Estimated cost is
computed as effort * personcost * overhead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--addlang language <br>
Add a language not considered by default to be a
&lsquo;&lsquo;language&rsquo;&rsquo; to be reported.
Currently the only legal values for language are
&quot;makefile&quot;, &quot;sql&quot;, and &quot;html&quot;.
These <br>
files are not normally included in the SLOC counts, although
their SLOCs are internally calculated and they are shown in
the file counts. If you want to include more <br>
than one such language, do it by passing --addlang more than
once, e.g., --addlang makefile --addlang sql.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--addlangall <br>
Add all languages not normally included in final
reports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
As with many other programs using Unix-like options,
directories whose names begin with a dash
(&lsquo;&lsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo;) can be misinterpreted as
options. If the directories to be analyzed might <br>
begin with a dash, use the double-dash (&lsquo;&lsquo;-
-&rsquo;&rsquo;) to indicate the end of the option list
before listing the directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Filenames with embedded newlines (in the directories or
their descendants) won&rsquo;t be handled correctly; they
will be interpreted as separate filenames where the newlines
are <br>
inserted. An attacker could prevent sloccount from working
by creating filenames of the form /normal/directory ...
NEWLINE/dev/zero. Such filenames are exceedingly rare in
<br>
source code because they&rsquo;re a pain to work with using
other tools, too. Future versions of sloccount may
internally use NUL-separated filenames (like GNU
find&rsquo;s -print0 command) <br>
to fix this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are many more languages
not yet handled by SLOCCount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SLOCCount only reports physical
source lines of code. It would be very useful if it could
also report logical lines of code, and perhaps other common
metrics such as McCabe&rsquo;s <br>
complexity measures and complexity density (complexity/SLOC
for each function or procedure).</p>

documentation is available both on the website and with the
SLOCCount package.</p>
