<p>LUAC(1) General Commands Manual LUAC(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
luac - Lua compiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
luac [ options ] [ filenames ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
luac is the Lua compiler. It translates programs written in
the Lua programming language into binary files that can be
latter loaded and executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main advantages of
precompiling chunks are: faster loading, protecting source
code from user changes, and off-line syntax checking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pre-compiling does not imply
faster execution because in Lua chunks are always compiled
into bytecodes before being executed. luac simply allows
those bytecodes to be saved in a <br>
file for later execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">luac produces a single output
file containing the bytecodes for all source files given. By
default, the output file is named luac.out, but you can
change this with the -o <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The binary files created by luac
are portable to all architectures with the same word size.
This means that binary files created on a 32-bit platform
(such as Intel) can be read <br>
without change in another 32-bit platform (such as Sparc),
even if the byte order
(&lsquo;&lsquo;endianness&rsquo;&rsquo;) is different. On
the other hand, binary files created on a 16-bit platform
<br>
cannot be read in a 32-bit platform, nor vice-versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the command line, you can mix
text files containing Lua source and binary files containing
precompiled chunks. This is useful to combine several
precompiled chunks, even from <br>
different (but compatible) platforms, into a single
precompiled chunk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use - to indicate the
standard input as a source file and -- to signal the end of
options (that is, all remaining arguments will be treated as
files even if they start <br>
with -).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The internal format of the
binary files produced by luac is likely to change when a new
version of Lua is released. So, save the source files of all
Lua programs that you pre&acirc; <br>
compile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Options must be separate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l produce a listing of the
compiled bytecode for Lua&rsquo;s virtual machine. Listing
bytecodes is useful to learn about Lua&rsquo;s virtual
machine. If no files are given, then luac <br>
loads luac.out and lists its contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o file <br>
output to file, instead of the default luac.out. The output
file may be a source file because all files are loaded
before the output file is written. Be careful not to <br>
overwrite precious files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p load files but do not
generate any output file. Used mainly for syntax checking
and for testing precompiled chunks: corrupted files will
probably generate errors when <br>
loaded. Lua always performs a thorough integrity test on
precompiled chunks. Bytecode that passes this test is
completely safe, in the sense that it will not break the
<br>
interpreter. However, there is no guarantee that such code
does anything sensible. (None can be given, because the
halting problem is unsolvable.) If no files are <br>
given, then luac loads luac.out and tests its contents. No
messages are displayed if the file passes the integrity
test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s strip debug information
before writing the output file. This saves some space in
very large chunks, but if errors occur when running these
chunks, then the error messages <br>
may not contain the full information they usually do (line
numbers and names of locals are lost).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v show version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
luac.out default output file</p>
