<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The normal way to run a Perl program is by making it
directly executable, or else by passing the name of the
source file as an argument on the command line. (An
interactive Perl <br>
environment is also possible--see perldebug for details on
how to do that.) Upon startup, Perl looks for your program
in one of the following places:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Specified line by line via -e
or -E switches on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Contained in the file
specified by the first filename on the command line. (Note
that systems supporting the &quot;#!&quot; notation invoke
interpreters this way. See &quot;Location of <br>
Perl&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Passed in implicitly via
standard input. This works only if there are no filename
arguments--to pass arguments to a STDIN-read program you
must explicitly specify a &quot;-&quot; for <br>
the program name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With methods 2 and 3, Perl
starts parsing the input file from the beginning, unless
you&rsquo;ve specified a -x switch, in which case it scans
for the first line starting with &quot;#!&quot; and <br>
containing the word &quot;perl&quot;, and starts there
instead. This is useful for running a program embedded in a
larger message. (In this case you would indicate the end of
the program <br>
using the &quot;__END__&quot; token.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;#!&quot; line is
always examined for switches as the line is being parsed.
Thus, if you&rsquo;re on a machine that allows only one
argument with the &quot;#!&quot; line, or worse,
doesn&rsquo;t even <br>
recognize the &quot;#!&quot; line, you still can get
consistent switch behaviour regardless of how Perl was
invoked, even if -x was used to find the beginning of the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because historically some
operating systems silently chopped off kernel interpretation
of the &quot;#!&quot; line after 32 characters, some
switches may be passed in on the command line, <br>
and some may not; you could even get a &quot;-&quot; without
its letter, if you&rsquo;re not careful. You probably want
to make sure that all your switches fall either before or
after that <br>
32-character boundary. Most switches don&rsquo;t actually
care if they&rsquo;re processed redundantly, but getting a
&quot;-&quot; instead of a complete switch could cause Perl
to try to execute <br>
standard input instead of your program. And a partial -I
switch could also cause odd results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some switches do care if they
are processed twice, for instance combinations of -l and -0.
Either put all the switches after the 32-character boundary
(if applicable), or <br>
replace the use of -0digits by &quot;BEGIN{ $/ = &quot;
digits&quot;; }&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parsing of the &quot;#!&quot;
switches starts wherever &quot;perl&quot; is mentioned in
the line. The sequences &quot;-*&quot; and &quot;- &quot;
are specifically ignored so that you could, if you were so
inclined, <br>
say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh <br>
#! -*-perl-*- <br>
eval &rsquo;exec perl -x -wS $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}&rsquo;
<br>
if 0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to let Perl see the -p
switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A similar trick involves the env
program, if you have it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/env perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The examples above use a
relative path to the perl interpreter, getting whatever
version is first in the user&rsquo;s path. If you want a
specific version of Perl, say, perl5.005_57, <br>
you should place that directly in the &quot;#!&quot;
line&rsquo;s path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &quot;#!&quot; line does
not contain the word &quot;perl&quot; nor the word
&quot;indir&quot; the program named after the &quot;#!&quot;
is executed instead of the Perl interpreter. This is
slightly bizarre, <br>
but it helps people on machines that don&rsquo;t do
&quot;#!&quot;, because they can tell a program that their
SHELL is /usr/bin/perl, and Perl will then dispatch the
program to the correct <br>
interpreter for them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After locating your program,
Perl compiles the entire program to an internal form. If
there are any compilation errors, execution of the program
is not attempted. (This is <br>
unlike the typical shell script, which might run part-way
through before finding a syntax error.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the program is syntactically
correct, it is executed. If the program runs off the end
without hitting an exit() or die() operator, an implicit
exit(0) is provided to indicate <br>
successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#! and quoting on non-Unix
systems <br>
Unix&rsquo;s &quot;#!&quot; technique can be simulated on
other systems:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OS/2 <br>
Put</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extproc perl -S
-your_switches</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">as the first line in
&quot;*.cmd&quot; file (-S due to a bug in cmd.exe&rsquo;s
&lsquo;extproc&rsquo; handling).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MS-DOS <br>
Create a batch file to run your program, and codify it in
&quot;ALTERNATE_SHEBANG&quot; (see the dosish.h file in the
source distribution for more information).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Win95/NT <br>
The Win95/NT installation, when using the ActiveState
installer for Perl, will modify the Registry to associate
the .pl extension with the perl interpreter. If you install
<br>
Perl by other means (including building from the sources),
you may have to modify the Registry yourself. Note that this
means you can no longer tell the difference between <br>
an executable Perl program and a Perl library file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VMS Put</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ perl -mysw
&rsquo;f$env(&quot;procedure&quot;)&rsquo; &rsquo;p1&rsquo;
&rsquo;p2&rsquo; &rsquo;p3&rsquo; &rsquo;p4&rsquo;
&rsquo;p5&rsquo; &rsquo;p6&rsquo; &rsquo;p7&rsquo;
&rsquo;p8&rsquo; ! <br>
$ exit++ + ++$status != 0 and $exit = $status = undef;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">at the top of your program,
where -mysw are any command line switches you want to pass
to Perl. You can now invoke the program directly, by saying
&quot;perl program&quot;, or as a <br>
DCL procedure, by saying @program (or implicitly via
DCL$PATH by just using the name of the program).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This incantation is a bit much
to remember, but Perl will display it for you if you say
&quot;perl &quot;-V:startperl&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command-interpreters on non-Unix
systems have rather different ideas on quoting than Unix
shells. You&rsquo;ll need to learn the special characters in
your command-interpreter (&quot;*&quot;, <br>
&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some systems, you may have to
change single-quotes to double ones, which you must not do
on Unix or Plan 9 systems. You might also have to change a
single % to a %%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Unix <br>
perl -e &rsquo;print &quot;Hello world0&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># MS-DOS, etc. <br>
perl -e &quot;print</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># VMS <br>
perl -e &quot;print &quot;&quot;Hello world0&quot;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The problem is that none of this
is reliable: it depends on the command and it is entirely
possible neither works. If 4DOS were the command shell, this
would probably work <br>
better:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -e &quot;print
&lt;Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;Hello world0Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMD.EXE in Windows NT slipped a
lot of standard Unix functionality in when nobody was
looking, but just try to find documentation for its quoting
rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no general solution to
all of this. It&rsquo;s just a mess.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Location of Perl <br>
It may seem obvious to say, but Perl is useful only when
users can easily find it. When possible, it&rsquo;s good for
both /usr/bin/perl and /usr/local/bin/perl to be symlinks to
the <br>
actual binary. If that can&rsquo;t be done, system
administrators are strongly encouraged to put (symlinks to)
perl and its accompanying utilities into a directory
typically found <br>
along a user&rsquo;s PATH, or in some other obvious and
convenient place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this documentation,
&quot;#!/usr/bin/perl&quot; on the first line of the program
will stand in for whatever method works on your system. You
are advised to use a specific path if you <br>
care about a specific version.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/local/bin/perl5.00554</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or if you just want to be
running at least version, place a statement like this at the
top of your program:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use 5.005_54;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command Switches <br>
As with all standard commands, a single-character switch may
be clustered with the following switch, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/perl -spi.orig # same
as -s -p -i.orig</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switches include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-0[octal/hexadecimal] <br>
specifies the input record separator ($/) as an octal or
hexadecimal number. If there are no digits, the null
character is the separator. Other switches may precede or
<br>
follow the digits. For example, if you have a version of
find which can print filenames terminated by the null
character, you can say this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find . -name
&rsquo;*.orig&rsquo; -print0 | perl -n0e unlink</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special value 00 will cause
Perl to slurp files in paragraph mode. Any value 0400 or
above will cause Perl to slurp files whole, but by
convention the value 0777 is the <br>
one normally used for this purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also specify the
separator character using hexadecimal notation: -0xHHH...,
where the &quot;H&quot; are valid hexadecimal digits. Unlike
the octal form, this one may be used <br>
to specify any Unicode character, even those beyond 0xFF. So
if you really want a record separator of 0777, specify it as
-0x1FF. (This means that you cannot use the -x <br>
option with a directory name that consists of hexadecimal
digits, or else Perl will think you have specified a hex
number to -0.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a turns on autosplit mode when
used with a -n or -p. An implicit split command to the @F
array is done as the first thing inside the implicit while
loop produced by the -n or <br>
-p.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -ane &rsquo;print pop(@F),
&quot;0;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is equivalent to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while (&lt;&gt;) { <br>
@F = split(&rsquo; &rsquo;); <br>
print pop(@F), &quot;0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alternate delimiter may be
specified using -F.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C [number/list] <br>
The -C flag controls some of the Perl Unicode features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of 5.8.1, the -C can be
followed either by a number or a list of option letters. The
letters, their numeric values, and effects are as follows;
listing the letters is <br>
equal to summing the numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I 1 STDIN is assumed to be in
UTF-8 <br>
O 2 STDOUT will be in UTF-8 <br>
E 4 STDERR will be in UTF-8 <br>
S 7 I + O + E <br>
i 8 UTF-8 is the default PerlIO layer for input streams <br>
o 16 UTF-8 is the default PerlIO layer for output streams
<br>
D 24 i + o <br>
A 32 the @ARGV elements are expected to be strings encoded
<br>
in UTF-8 <br>
L 64 normally the &quot;IOEioA&quot; are unconditional, the
L makes <br>
them conditional on the locale environment variables <br>
(the LC_ALL, LC_TYPE, and LANG, in the order of <br>
decreasing precedence) -- if the variables indicate <br>
UTF-8, then the selected &quot;IOEioA&quot; are in effect
<br>
a 256 Set ${^UTF8CACHE} to -1, to run the UTF-8 caching <br>
code in debugging mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, -COE and -C6 will
both turn on UTF-8-ness on both STDOUT and STDERR. Repeating
letters is just redundant, not cumulative nor toggling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;io&quot; options mean
that any subsequent open() (or similar I/O operations) in
the current file scope will have the &quot;:utf8&quot;
PerlIO layer implicitly applied to them, in <br>
other words, UTF-8 is expected from any input stream, and
UTF-8 is produced to any output stream. This is just the
default, with explicit layers in open() and with <br>
binmode() one can manipulate streams as usual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C on its own (not followed by
any number or option list), or the empty string &quot;&quot;
for the &quot;PERL_UNICODE&quot; environment variable, has
the same effect as -CSDL. In other words, <br>
the standard I/O handles and the default &quot;open()&quot;
layer are UTF-8-fied but only if the locale environment
variables indicate a UTF-8 locale. This behaviour follows
the <br>
implicit (and problematic) UTF-8 behaviour of Perl 5.8.0.
(See &quot;UTF-8 no longer default under UTF-8 locales&quot;
in perl581delta.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use -C0 (or
&quot;0&quot; for &quot;PERL_UNICODE&quot;) to explicitly
disable all the above Unicode features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The read-only magic variable
&quot;${^UNICODE}&quot; reflects the numeric value of this
setting. This variable is set during Perl startup and is
thereafter read-only. If you want <br>
runtime effects, use the three-arg open() (see
&quot;open&quot; in perlfunc), the two-arg binmode() (see
&quot;binmode&quot; in perlfunc), and the &quot;open&quot;
pragma (see open).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(In Perls earlier than 5.8.1 the
-C switch was a Win32-only switch that enabled the use of
Unicode-aware &quot;wide system call&quot; Win32 APIs. This
feature was practically unused, <br>
however, and the command line switch was therefore
&quot;recycled&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Since perl 5.10.1, if the
-C option is used on the &quot;#!&quot; line, it must be
specified on the command line as well, since the standard
streams are already set up at this <br>
point in the execution of the perl interpreter. You can also
use binmode() to set the encoding of an I/O stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c causes Perl to check the
syntax of the program and then exit without executing it.
Actually, it will execute and &quot;BEGIN&quot;,
&quot;UNITCHECK&quot;, or &quot;CHECK&quot; blocks and any
&quot;use&quot; <br>
statements: these are considered as occurring outside the
execution of your program. &quot;INIT&quot; and
&quot;END&quot; blocks, however, will be skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d <br>
-dt runs the program under the Perl debugger. See perldebug.
If t is specified, it indicates to the debugger that threads
will be used in the code being debugged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d:MOD[=bar,baz] <br>
-dt:MOD[=bar,baz] <br>
runs the program under the control of a debugging,
profiling, or tracing module installed as
&quot;Devel::MOD&quot;. E.g., -d:DProf executes the program
using the &quot;Devel::DProf&quot; <br>
profiler. As with the -M flag, options may be passed to the
&quot;Devel::MOD&quot; package where they will be received
and interpreted by the &quot;Devel::MOD::import&quot;
routine. Again, <br>
like -M, use --d:-MOD to call
&quot;Devel::MOD::unimport&quot; instead of import. The
comma-separated list of options must follow a &quot;=&quot;
character. If t is specified, it indicates to <br>
the debugger that threads will be used in the code being
debugged. See perldebug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dletters <br>
-Dnumber <br>
sets debugging flags. To watch how it executes your program,
use -Dtls. (This works only if debugging is compiled into
your Perl.) Another nice value is -Dx, which lists <br>
your compiled syntax tree. And -Dr displays compiled regular
expressions; the format of the output is explained in
perldebguts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an alternative, specify a
number instead of list of letters (e.g., -D14 is equivalent
to -Dtls):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All these flags require
-DDEBUGGING when you compile the Perl executable (but see
&quot;:opd&quot; in Devel::Peek or &quot;&rsquo;debug&rsquo;
mode&quot; in re which may change this). See the INSTALL
file <br>
in the Perl source distribution for how to do this. This
flag is automatically set if you include -g option when
&quot;Configure&quot; asks you about optimizer/debugger
flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re just trying to
get a print out of each line of Perl code as it executes,
the way that &quot;sh -x&quot; provides for shell scripts,
you can&rsquo;t use Perl&rsquo;s -D switch. Instead <br>
do this</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See perldebug for details and
variations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e commandline <br>
may be used to enter one line of program. If -e is given,
Perl will not look for a filename in the argument list.
Multiple -e commands may be given to build up a multi- <br>
line script. Make sure to use semicolons where you would in
a normal program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E commandline <br>
behaves just like -e, except that it implicitly enables all
optional features (in the main compilation unit). See
feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Disable executing
$Config{sitelib}/sitecustomize.pl at startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl can be built so that it by
default will try to execute
$Config{sitelib}/sitecustomize.pl at startup (in a BEGIN
block). This is a hook that allows the sysadmin to <br>
customize how Perl behaves. It can for instance be used to
add entries to the @INC array to make Perl find modules in
non-standard locations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl actually inserts the
following code:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEGIN { <br>
do { local $!; -f
&quot;$Config{sitelib}/sitecustomize.pl&quot;; } <br>
&amp;&amp; do &quot;$Config{sitelib}/sitecustomize.pl&quot;;
<br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since it is an actual
&quot;do&quot; (not a &quot;require&quot;), sitecustomize.pl
doesn&rsquo;t need to return a true value. The code is run
in package &quot;main&quot;, in its own lexical scope.
However, if <br>
the script dies, $@ will not be set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of $Config{sitelib} is
also determined in C code and not read from
&quot;Config.pm&quot;, which is not loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The code is executed very early.
For example, any changes made to @INC will show up in the
output of &lsquo;perl -V&lsquo;. Of course, &quot;END&quot;
blocks will be likewise executed very late.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To determine at runtime if this
capability has been compiled in your perl, you can check the
value of $Config{usesitecustomize}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Fpattern <br>
specifies the pattern to split on if -a is also in effect.
The pattern may be surrounded by &quot;//&quot;,
&quot;&quot;, or &rsquo;&rsquo;, otherwise it will be put in
single quotes. You can&rsquo;t use <br>
literal whitespace in the pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h prints a summary of the
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i[extension] <br>
specifies that files processed by the &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;
construct are to be edited in-place. It does this by
renaming the input file, opening the output file by the
original name, and <br>
selecting that output file as the default for print()
statements. The extension, if supplied, is used to modify
the name of the old file to make a backup copy, following
<br>
these rules:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no extension is supplied, no
backup is made and the current file is overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the extension doesn&rsquo;t
contain a &quot;*&quot;, then it is appended to the end of
the current filename as a suffix. If the extension does
contain one or more &quot;*&quot; characters, then <br>
each &quot;*&quot; is replaced with the current filename. In
Perl terms, you could think of this as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">($backup = $extension) =~
s/$file_name/g;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This allows you to add a prefix
to the backup file, instead of (or in addition to) a
suffix:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ perl -pi&rsquo;orig_*&rsquo;
-e &rsquo;s/bar/baz/&rsquo; fileA # backup to <br>
# &rsquo;orig_fileA&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or even to place backup copies
of the original files into another directory (provided the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ perl -p -i.orig -e

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is the same as using the
program:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/perl -pi.orig <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">except that the -i form
doesn&rsquo;t need to compare $ARGV to $oldargv to know when
the filename has changed. It does, however, use ARGVOUT for
the selected filehandle. Note <br>
that STDOUT is restored as the default output filehandle
after the loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As shown above, Perl creates the
backup file whether or not any output is actually changed.
So this is just a fancy way to copy files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ perl -p
-i&rsquo;/some/file/path/*&rsquo; -e 1 file1 file2 file3...
<br>
or <br>
$ perl -p -i&rsquo;.orig&rsquo; -e 1 file1 file2
file3...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use &quot;eof&quot;
without parentheses to locate the end of each input file, in
case you want to append to each file, or reset line
numbering (see example in &quot;eof&quot; in <br>
perlfunc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If, for a given file, Perl is
unable to create the backup file as specified in the
extension then it will skip that file and continue on with
the next one (if it exists).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a discussion of issues
surrounding file permissions and -i, see &quot;Why does Perl
let me delete read-only files? Why does -i clobber protected
files? Isn&rsquo;t this a bug in <br>
Perl?&quot; in perlfaq5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You cannot use -i to create
directories or to strip extensions from files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl does not expand
&quot;~&quot; in filenames, which is good, since some folks
use it for their backup files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ perl -pi~ -e
&rsquo;s/foo/bar/&rsquo; file1 file2 file3...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that because -i renames or
deletes the original file before creating a new file of the
same name, Unix-style soft and hard links will not be
preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, the -i switch does not
impede execution when no files are given on the command
line. In this case, no backup is made (the original file
cannot, of course, be <br>
determined) and processing proceeds from STDIN to STDOUT as
might be expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Idirectory <br>
Directories specified by -I are prepended to the search path

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l[octnum] <br>
enables automatic line-ending processing. It has two
separate effects. First, it automatically chomps $/ (the
input record separator) when used with -n or -p. Second, it
<br>
assigns &quot;$ <br>
to the current value of $/. For instance, to trim lines to
80 columns:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -lpe &rsquo;substr($_, 80)
= &quot;&quot;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the assignment
&quot;$&nbsp;= $/&quot; is done when the switch is
processed, so the input record separator can be different
than the output record separator if the -l switch is <br>
followed by a -0 switch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gnufind / -print0 | perl -ln0e

-M[-]&rsquo;module ...&rsquo; <br>
-[mM][-]module=arg[,arg]... <br>
-mmodule executes &quot;use&quot; module &quot;();&quot;
before executing your program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Mmodule executes
&quot;use&quot; module &quot;;&quot; before executing your
program. You can use quotes to add extra code after the
module name, e.g., &rsquo;-MMODULE qw(foo bar)&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the first character after the
-M or -m is a dash (-) then the &rsquo;use&rsquo; is
replaced with &rsquo;no&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A little builtin syntactic sugar
means you can also say -mMODULE=foo,bar or -MMODULE=foo,bar
as a shortcut for &rsquo;-MMODULE qw(foo bar)&rsquo;. This
avoids the need to use quotes <br>
when importing symbols. The actual code generated by
-MMODULE=foo,bar is &quot;use module
split(/,/,q{foo,bar})&quot;. Note that the &quot;=&quot;
form removes the distinction between -m and <br>
-M.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A consequence of this is that
-MMODULE=number never does a version check, unless
&quot;MODULE::import()&quot; itself is set up to do a
version check, which could happen for example if <br>
MODULE inherits from Exporter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n causes Perl to assume the
following loop around your program, which makes it iterate
over filename arguments somewhat like sed -n or awk:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LINE: <br>
while (&lt;&gt;) { <br>
... # your program goes here <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the lines are not
printed by default. See &quot;-p&quot; to have lines
printed. If a file named by an argument cannot be opened for
some reason, Perl warns you about it <br>
and moves on to the next file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also note that
&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; passes command line arguments to
&quot;open&quot; in perlfunc, which doesn&rsquo;t
necessarily interpret them as file names. See perlop for
possible security <br>
implications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an efficient way to
delete all files that haven&rsquo;t been modified for at
least a week:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find . -mtime +7 -print | perl
-nle unlink</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is faster than using the
-exec switch of find because you don&rsquo;t have to start a
process on every filename found. It does suffer from the bug
of mishandling newlines in <br>
pathnames, which you can fix if you follow the example under
-0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;BEGIN&quot; and
&quot;END&quot; blocks may be used to capture control before

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a file named by an argument
cannot be opened for some reason, Perl warns you about it,
and moves on to the next file. Note that the lines are
printed automatically. An <br>
error occurring during printing is treated as fatal. To
suppress printing use the -n switch. A -p overrides a -n
switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;BEGIN&quot; and
&quot;END&quot; blocks may be used to capture control before
or after the implicit loop, just as in awk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s enables rudimentary switch
parsing for switches on the command line after the program
name but before any filename arguments (or before an
argument of --). Any switch found <br>
there is removed from @ARGV and sets the corresponding
variable in the Perl program. The following program prints
&quot;1&quot; if the program is invoked with a -xyz switch,
and <br>
&quot;abc&quot; if it is invoked with -xyz=abc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/perl -s <br>
if ($xyz) { print &quot;$xyz0 }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do note that a switch like
--help creates the variable &quot;${-help}&quot;, which is
not compliant with &quot;use strict &quot;refs&quot;&quot;.
Also, when using this option on a script with warnings <br>
enabled you may get a lot of spurious &quot;used only
once&quot; warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S makes Perl use the PATH
environment variable to search for the program unless the
name of the program contains path separators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some platforms, this also
makes Perl append suffixes to the filename while searching
for it. For example, on Win32 platforms, the
&quot;.bat&quot; and &quot;.cmd&quot; suffixes are appended
<br>
if a lookup for the original name fails, and if the name
does not already end in one of those suffixes. If your Perl
was compiled with &quot;DEBUGGING&quot; turned on, using the
-Dp <br>
switch to Perl shows how the search progresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typically this is used to
emulate &quot;#!&quot; startup on platforms that don&rsquo;t
support &quot;#!&quot;. It&rsquo;s also convenient when
debugging a script that uses &quot;#!&quot;, and is thus
normally found <br>
by the shell&rsquo;s $PATH search mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example works on many
platforms that have a shell compatible with Bourne
shell:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/perl <br>
eval &rsquo;exec /usr/bin/perl -wS $0
${1+&quot;$@&quot;}&rsquo; <br>
if $running_under_some_shell;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The system ignores the first
line and feeds the program to /bin/sh, which proceeds to try
to execute the Perl program as a shell script. The shell
executes the second line <br>
as a normal shell command, and thus starts up the Perl
interpreter. On some systems $0 doesn&rsquo;t always contain
the full pathname, so the -S tells Perl to search for the
<br>
program if necessary. After Perl locates the program, it
parses the lines and ignores them because the variable
$running_under_some_shell is never true. If the program <br>
will be interpreted by csh, you will need to replace
&quot;${1+&quot;$@&quot;}&quot; with $*, even though that
doesn&rsquo;t understand embedded spaces (and such) in the
argument list. To start up <br>
sh rather than csh, some systems may have to replace the
&quot;#!&quot; line with a line containing just a colon,
which will be politely ignored by Perl. Other systems
can&rsquo;t control <br>
that, and need a totally devious construct that will work
under any of csh, sh, or Perl, such as the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval &rsquo;(exit $?0)&rsquo;
&amp;&amp; eval &rsquo;exec perl -wS $0
${1+&quot;$@&quot;}&rsquo; <br>
&amp; eval &rsquo;exec /usr/bin/perl -wS $0 $argv:q&rsquo;
<br>
if $running_under_some_shell;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the filename supplied
contains directory separators (and so is an absolute or
relative pathname), and if that file is not found, platforms
that append file extensions <br>
will do so and try to look for the file with those
extensions added, one by one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On DOS-like platforms, if the
program does not contain directory separators, it will first
be searched for in the current directory before being
searched for on the PATH. <br>
On Unix platforms, the program will be searched for strictly
on the PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Like -T, but taint checks
will issue warnings rather than fatal errors. These warnings
can now be controlled normally with &quot;no warnings
qw(taint)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: This is not a substitute
for &quot;-T&quot;! This is meant to be used only as a
temporary development aid while securing legacy code: for
real production code and for new secure <br>
code written from scratch, always use the real -T.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T turns on &quot;taint&quot; so
you can test them. Ordinarily these checks are done only
when running setuid or setgid. It&rsquo;s a good idea to
turn them on explicitly for programs that <br>
run on behalf of someone else whom you might not necessarily
trust, such as CGI programs or any internet servers you
might write in Perl. See perlsec for details. For <br>
security reasons, this option must be seen by Perl quite
early; usually this means it must appear early on the
command line or in the &quot;#!&quot; line for systems which
support <br>
that construct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u This switch causes Perl to
dump core after compiling your program. You can then in
theory take this core dump and turn it into an executable
file by using the undump <br>
program (not supplied). This speeds startup at the expense
of some disk space (which you can minimize by stripping the
executable). (Still, a &quot;hello world&quot; executable
<br>
comes out to about 200K on my machine.) If you want to
execute a portion of your program before dumping, use the
dump() operator instead. Note: availability of undump is
<br>
platform specific and may not be available for a specific
port of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U allows Perl to do unsafe
operations. Currently the only &quot;unsafe&quot; operations
are attempting to unlink directories while running as
superuser and running setuid programs with <br>
fatal taint checks turned into warnings. Note that warnings
must be enabled along with this option to actually generate
the taint-check warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v prints the version and
patchlevel of your perl executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V prints summary of the major
perl configuration values and the current values of
@INC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V:configvar <br>
Prints to STDOUT the value of the named configuration
variable(s), with multiples when your &quot;configvar&quot;
argument looks like a regex (has non-letters). For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ perl -V:libc <br>
libc=&rsquo;/lib/libc-2.2.4.so&rsquo;; <br>
$ perl -V:lib. <br>
libs=&rsquo;-lnsl -lgdbm -ldb -ldl -lm -lcrypt -lutil

lib_ext=&rsquo;.a&rsquo;; <br>
libc=&rsquo;/lib/libc-2.2.4.so&rsquo;; <br>
libperl=&rsquo;libperl.a&rsquo;; <br>
....</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, extra colons can
be used to control formatting. A trailing colon suppresses
the linefeed and terminator &quot;;&quot;, allowing you to
embed queries into shell <br>
commands. (mnemonic: PATH separator &quot;:&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ echo &quot;compression-vars:
&quot; &lsquo;perl -V:z.*: &lsquo; &quot; are here !&quot;
<br>
compression-vars: zcat=&rsquo;&rsquo; zip=&rsquo;zip&rsquo;
are here !</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A leading colon removes the
&quot;name=&quot; part of the response, this allows you to
map to the name you need. (mnemonic: empty label)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ echo
&quot;goodvfork=&quot;&lsquo;./perl -Ilib
-V::usevfork&lsquo; <br>
goodvfork=false;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Leading and trailing colons can
be used together if you need positional parameter values
without the names. Note that in the case below, the
&quot;PERL_API&quot; params are returned <br>
in alphabetical order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ echo building_on &lsquo;perl
-V::osname: -V::PERL_API_.*:&lsquo; now <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w prints warnings about dubious
constructs, such as variable names mentioned only once and
scalar variables used before being set; redefined
subroutines; references to <br>
undefined filehandles; filehandles opened read-only that you
are attempting to write on; values used as a number that
don&rsquo;t look like numbers; using an array as though it
<br>
were a scalar; if your subroutines recurse more than 100
deep; and innumerable other things.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This switch really just enables
the global $^W variable; normally, the lexically scoped
&quot;use warnings&quot; pragma is preferred. You can
disable or promote into fatal errors <br>
specific warnings using &quot;__WARN__&quot; hooks, as
described in perlvar and &quot;warn&quot; in perlfunc. See
also perldiag and perltrap. A fine-grained warning facility
is also available <br>
if you want to manipulate entire classes of warnings; see
warnings or perllexwarn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W Enables all warnings
regardless of &quot;no warnings&quot; or $^W. See
perllexwarn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X Disables all warnings
regardless of &quot;use warnings&quot; or $^W. See
perllexwarn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x <br>
-xdirectory <br>
tells Perl that the program is embedded in a larger chunk of
unrelated text, such as in a mail message. Leading garbage
will be discarded until the first line that starts <br>
with &quot;#!&quot; and contains the string
&quot;perl&quot;. Any meaningful switches on that line will
be applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All references to line numbers
by the program (warnings, errors, ...) will treat the
&quot;#!&quot; line as the first line. Thus a warning on the
2nd line of the program, which is <br>
on the 100th line in the file will be reported as line 2,
not as line 100. This can be overridden by using the
&quot;#line&quot; directive. (See &quot;Plain Old Comments
(Not!)&quot; in <br>
perlsyn)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a directory name is
specified, Perl will switch to that directory before running
the program. The -x switch controls only the disposal of
leading garbage. The program <br>
must be terminated with &quot;__END__&quot; if there is
trailing garbage to be ignored; the program can process any
or all of the trailing garbage via the &quot;DATA&quot;
filehandle if <br>
desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directory, if specified,
must appear immediately following the -x with no intervening
whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
HOME Used if &quot;chdir&quot; has no argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGDIR Used if &quot;chdir&quot;
has no argument and HOME is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH Used in executing
subprocesses, and in finding the program if -S is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL5LIB A list of directories
in which to look for Perl library files before looking in
the standard library and the current directory. Any
architecture-specific directories <br>
under the specified locations are automatically included if
they exist, with this lookup done at interpreter startup
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If PERL5LIB is not defined,
PERLLIB is used. Directories are separated (like in PATH) by
a colon on Unixish platforms and by a semicolon on Windows
(the proper path <br>
separator being given by the command &quot;perl
-V:path_sep&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running taint checks,
either because the program was running setuid or setgid, or
the -T or -t switch was specified, neither PERL5LIB nor
PERLLIB is consulted. <br>
The program should instead say:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use lib
&quot;/my/directory&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL5OPT Command-line options
(switches). Switches in this variable are treated as if they
were on every Perl command line. Only the -[CDIMUdmtwW]
switches are allowed. <br>
When running taint checks (either because the program was
running setuid or setgid, or because the -T or -t switch was
used), this variable is ignored. If PERL5OPT <br>
begins with - T, tainting will be enabled and subsequent
options ignored. If PERL5OPT begins with -t, tainting will
be enabled, a writable dot removed from @INC, and <br>
subsequent options honored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERLIO A space (or colon)
separated list of PerlIO layers. If perl is built to use
PerlIO system for IO (the default) these layers affect
Perl&rsquo;s IO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is conventional to start
layer names with a colon (for example, &quot;:perlio&quot;)
to emphasize their similarity to variable
&quot;attributes&quot;. But the code that parses layer <br>
specification strings, which is also used to decode the
PERLIO environment variable, treats the colon as a
separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An unset or empty PERLIO is
equivalent to the default set of layers for your platform;
for example, &quot;:unix:perlio&quot; on Unix-like systems
and &quot;:unix:crlf&quot; on Windows <br>
and other DOS-like systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list becomes the default for
all Perl&rsquo;s IO. Consequently only built-in layers can
appear in this list, as external layers (such as
&quot;:encoding()&quot;) need IO in <br>
order to load them!. See &quot;open pragma&quot; for how to
add external encodings as defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Layers it makes sense to include
in the PERLIO environment variable are briefly summarized
below. For more details see PerlIO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:bytes A pseudolayer that turns
the &quot;:utf8&quot; flag off for the layer below; unlikely
to be useful on its own in the global PERLIO environment
variable. You perhaps <br>
were thinking of &quot;:crlf:bytes&quot; or
&quot;:perlio:bytes&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:crlf A layer which does CRLF to
&quot;0 translation distinguishing &quot;text&quot; and
&quot;binary&quot; files in the manner of MS-DOS and similar
operating systems. (It currently <br>
does not mimic MS-DOS as far as treating of Control-Z as
being an end-of-file marker.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:mmap A layer that implements
&quot;reading&quot; of files by using mmap(2) to make an
entire file appear in the process&rsquo;s address space, and
then using that as PerlIO&rsquo;s <br>
&quot;buffer&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:perlio This is a
re-implementation of stdio-like buffering written as a
PerlIO layer. As such it will call whatever layer is below
it for its operations, typically <br>
&quot;:unix&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:pop An experimental pseudolayer
that removes the topmost layer. Use with the same care as is
reserved for nitroglycerine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:raw A pseudolayer that
manipulates other layers. Applying the &quot;:raw&quot;
layer is equivalent to calling &quot;binmode($fh)&quot;. It
makes the stream pass each byte as-is <br>
without translation. In particular, both CRLF translation
and intuiting &quot;:utf8&quot; from the locale are
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike in earlier versions of
Perl, &quot;:raw&quot; is not just the inverse of
&quot;:crlf&quot;: other layers which would affect the
binary nature of the stream are also <br>
removed or disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:stdio This layer provides a
PerlIO interface by wrapping system&rsquo;s ANSI C
&quot;stdio&quot; library calls. The layer provides both
buffering and IO. Note that the &quot;:stdio&quot; <br>
layer does not do CRLF translation even if that is the
platform&rsquo;s normal behaviour. You will need a
&quot;:crlf&quot; layer above it to do that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:unix Low-level layer that calls
&quot;read&quot;, &quot;write&quot;, &quot;lseek&quot;,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:utf8 A pseudolayer that enables
a flag in the layer below to tell Perl that output should be
in utf8 and that input should be regarded as already in
valid utf8 <br>
form. WARNING: It does not check for validity and as such
should be handled with extreme caution for input, because
security violations can occur with non- <br>
shortest UTF-8 encodings, etc. Generally
&quot;:encoding(utf8)&quot; is the best option when reading
UTF-8 encoded data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:win32 On Win32 platforms this
experimental layer uses native &quot;handle&quot; IO rather
than a Unix-like numeric file descriptor layer. Known to be
buggy in this release <br>
(5.14).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default set of layers should
give acceptable results on all platforms</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For Unix platforms that will be
the equivalent of &quot;unix perlio&quot; or
&quot;stdio&quot;. Configure is set up to prefer the
&quot;stdio&quot; implementation if the system&rsquo;s
library provides <br>
for fast access to the buffer; otherwise, it uses the
&quot;unix perlio&quot; implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Win32 the default in this
release (5.14) is &quot;unix crlf&quot;. Win32&rsquo;s
&quot;stdio&quot; has a number of bugs/mis-features for Perl
IO which are somewhat depending on the version <br>
and vendor of the C compiler. Using our own &quot;crlf&quot;
layer as the buffer avoids those issues and makes things
more uniform. The &quot;crlf&quot; layer provides CRLF
conversion <br>
as well as buffering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This release (5.14) uses
&quot;unix&quot; as the bottom layer on Win32, and so still
uses the C compiler&rsquo;s numeric file descriptor
routines. There is an experimental native <br>
&quot;win32&quot; layer, which is expected to be enhanced
and should eventually become the default under Win32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PERLIO environment variable
is completely ignored when Perl is run in taint mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERLIO_DEBUG <br>
If set to the name of a file or device, certain operations
of PerlIO subsystem will be logged to that file, which is
opened in append mode Typical uses are in Unix:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% env PERLIO_DEBUG=/dev/tty perl
script ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and under Win32, the
approximately equivalent:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; set PERLIO_DEBUG=CON <br>
perl script ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This functionality is disabled
for setuid scripts and for scripts run with -T.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERLLIB A list of directories in
which to look for Perl library files before looking in the
standard library and the current directory. If PERL5LIB is
defined, PERLLIB is <br>
not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PERLLIB environment variable
is completely ignored when Perl is run in taint mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL5DB The command used to load
the debugger code. The default is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEGIN { require
&quot;perl5db.pl&quot; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PERL5DB environment variable
is only used when Perl is started with a bare -d switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL5DB_THREADED <br>
If set to a true value, indicates to the debugger that the
code being debugged uses threads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL5SHELL (specific to the
Win32 port) <br>
On Win32 ports only, may be set to an alternative shell that
Perl must use internally for executing &quot;backtick&quot;
commands or system(). Default is &quot;cmd.exe /x/d/c&quot;
on <br>
WindowsNT and &quot;command.com /c&quot; on Windows95. The
value is considered space-separated. Precede any character
that needs to be protected, like a space or backslash, <br>
with another backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that Perl doesn&rsquo;t use
COMSPEC for this purpose because COMSPEC has a high degree
of variability among users, leading to portability concerns.
Besides, Perl can <br>
use a shell that may not be fit for interactive use, and
setting COMSPEC to such a shell may interfere with the
proper functioning of other programs (which usually <br>
look in COMSPEC to find a shell fit for interactive
use).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Perl 5.10.0 and 5.8.8,
PERL5SHELL was not taint checked when running external
commands. It is recommended that you explicitly set (or
delete) $ENV{PERL5SHELL} <br>
when running in taint mode under Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL_ALLOW_NON_IFS_LSP (specific
to the Win32 port) <br>
Set to 1 to allow the use of non-IFS compatible LSPs
(Layered Service Providers). Perl normally searches for an
IFS-compatible LSP because this is required for its <br>
emulation of Windows sockets as real filehandles. However,
this may cause problems if you have a firewall such as
McAfee Guardian, which requires that all <br>
applications use its LSP but which is not IFS-compatible,
because clearly Perl will normally avoid using such an
LSP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting this environment
variable to 1 means that Perl will simply use the first
suitable LSP enumerated in the catalog, which keeps McAfee
Guardian happy--and in <br>
that particular case Perl still works too because McAfee
Guardian&rsquo;s LSP actually plays other games which allow
applications requiring IFS compatibility to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS <br>
Relevant only if Perl is compiled with the
&quot;malloc&quot; included with the Perl distribution; that
is, if &quot;perl -V:d_mymalloc&quot; is
&quot;define&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If set, this dumps out memory
statistics after execution. If set to an integer greater
than one, also dumps out memory statistics after
compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL <br>
Relevant only if your Perl executable was built with
-DDEBUGGING, this controls the behaviour of global
destruction of objects and other references. See <br>
&quot;PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL&quot; in perlhacktips for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL_DL_NONLAZY <br>
Set to &quot;1&quot; to have Perl resolve all undefined
symbols when it loads a dynamic library. The default
behaviour is to resolve symbols when they are used. Setting
this <br>
variable is useful during testing of extensions, as it
ensures that you get an error on misspelled function names
even if the test suite doesn&rsquo;t call them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL_ENCODING <br>
If using the &quot;use encoding&quot; pragma without an
explicit encoding name, the PERL_ENCODING environment
variable is consulted for an encoding name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL_HASH_SEED <br>
(Since Perl 5.8.1.) Used to randomize Perl&rsquo;s internal
hash function. To emulate the pre-5.8.1 behaviour, set to an
integer; &quot;0&quot; means exactly the same order as in
<br>
5.8.0. &quot;Pre-5.8.1&quot; means, among other things, that
hash keys will always have the same ordering between
different runs of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most hashes by default return
elements in the same order as in Perl 5.8.0. On a hash by
hash basis, if pathological data is detected during a hash
key insertion, <br>
then that hash will switch to an alternative random hash
seed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default behaviour is to
randomize unless the PERL_HASH_SEED is set. If Perl has been
compiled with -DUSE_HASH_SEED_EXPLICIT, the default
behaviour is not to <br>
randomize unless the PERL_HASH_SEED is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If PERL_HASH_SEED is unset or
set to a non-numeric string, Perl uses the pseudorandom seed
supplied by the operating system and libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLEASE NOTE: The hash seed is
sensitive information. Hashes are randomized to protect
against local and remote attacks against Perl code. By
manually setting a seed, <br>
this protection may be partially or completely lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Algorithmic Complexity
Attacks&quot; in perlsec and
&quot;PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG&quot; for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG <br>
(Since Perl 5.8.1.) Set to &quot;1&quot; to display (to
STDERR) the value of the hash seed at the beginning of
execution. This, combined with &quot;PERL_HASH_SEED&quot; is
intended to <br>
aid in debugging nondeterministic behaviour caused by hash
randomization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the hash seed is
sensitive information: by knowing it, one can craft a
denial-of-service attack against Perl code, even remotely;
see &quot;Algorithmic <br>
Complexity Attacks&quot; in perlsec for more information. Do
not disclose the hash seed to people who don&rsquo;t need to
know it. See also hash_seed() in Hash::Util.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL_MEM_LOG <br>
If your Perl was configured with -Accflags=-DPERL_MEM_LOG,
setting the environment variable &quot;PERL_MEM_LOG&quot;
enables logging debug messages. The value has the form <br>
&quot;&lt;number&gt;[m][s][t]&quot;, where
&quot;number&quot; is the file descriptor number you want to
write to (2 is default), and the combination of letters
specifies that you want <br>
information about (m)emory and/or (s)v, optionally with
(t)imestamps. For example, &quot;PERL_MEM_LOG=1mst&quot;
logs all information to stdout. You can write to other
opened <br>
file descriptors in a variety of ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ 3&gt;foo3 PERL_MEM_LOG=3m perl
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL_ROOT (specific to the VMS
port) <br>
A translation-concealed rooted logical name that contains
Perl and the logical device for the @INC path on VMS only.
Other logical names that affect Perl on VMS <br>
include PERLSHR, PERL_ENV_TABLES, and
SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL, but are optional and discussed
further in perlvms and in README.vms in the Perl source
distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL_SIGNALS <br>
Available in Perls 5.8.1 and later. If set to
&quot;unsafe&quot;, the pre-Perl-5.8.0 signal behaviour
(which is immediate but unsafe) is restored. If set to
&quot;safe&quot;, then safe <br>
(but deferred) signals are used. See &quot;Deferred Signals
(Safe Signals)&quot; in perlipc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL_UNICODE <br>
Equivalent to the -C command-line switch. Note that this is
not a boolean variable. Setting this to &quot;1&quot; is not
the right way to &quot;enable Unicode&quot; (whatever that
would <br>
mean). You can use &quot;0&quot; to &quot;disable
Unicode&quot;, though (or alternatively unset PERL_UNICODE
in your shell before starting Perl). See the description of
the -C switch <br>
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYS$LOGIN (specific to the VMS
port) <br>
Used if chdir has no argument and HOME and LOGDIR are not
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl also has environment
variables that control how Perl handles data specific to
particular natural languages; see perllocale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl and its various modules and
components, including its test frameworks, may sometimes
make use of certain other environment variables. Some of
these are specific to a <br>
particular platform. Please consult the appropriate module
documentation and any documentation for your platform (like
perlsolaris, perllinux, perlmacosx, perlwin32, etc) for <br>
variables peculiar to those specific situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl makes all environment
variables available to the program being executed, and
passes these along to any child processes it starts.
However, programs running setuid would do <br>
well to execute the following lines before doing anything
else, just to keep people honest:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ENV{PATH} =
&quot;/bin:/usr/bin&quot;; # or whatever you need <br>
$ENV{SHELL} = &quot;/bin/sh&quot; if exists $ENV{SHELL};
<br>
delete @ENV{qw(IFS CDPATH ENV BASH_ENV)};</p>
