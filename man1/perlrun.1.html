The normal way to run a Perl program is by making it directly executable, or
  else by passing the name of the source file as an argument on the command
  line. (An interactive Perl environment is also possible--see perldebug for
  details on how to do that.) Upon startup, Perl looks for your program in one
  of the following places:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specified line by line via <b>-e</b> or <b>-E</b> switches
      on the command line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Contained in the file specified by the first filename on
      the command line. (Note that systems supporting the &quot;#!&quot;
      notation invoke interpreters this way. See &quot;Location of
    Perl&quot;.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Passed in implicitly via standard input. This works only if
      there are no filename arguments--to pass arguments to a STDIN-read program
      you must explicitly specify a &quot;-&quot; for the program name.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
With methods 2 and 3, Perl starts parsing the input file from the beginning,
  unless you've specified a <b>-x</b> switch, in which case it scans for the
  first line starting with &quot;#!&quot; and containing the word
  &quot;perl&quot;, and starts there instead. This is useful for running a
  program embedded in a larger message. (In this case you would indicate the end
  of the program using the &quot;__END__&quot; token.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;#!&quot; line is always examined for switches as the line is being
  parsed. Thus, if you're on a machine that allows only one argument with the
  &quot;#!&quot; line, or worse, doesn't even recognize the &quot;#!&quot; line,
  you still can get consistent switch behaviour regardless of how Perl was
  invoked, even if <b>-x</b> was used to find the beginning of the program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Because historically some operating systems silently chopped off kernel
  interpretation of the &quot;#!&quot; line after 32 characters, some switches
  may be passed in on the command line, and some may not; you could even get a
  &quot;-&quot; without its letter, if you're not careful. You probably want to
  make sure that all your switches fall either before or after that 32-character
  boundary. Most switches don't actually care if they're processed redundantly,
  but getting a &quot;-&quot; instead of a complete switch could cause Perl to
  try to execute standard input instead of your program. And a partial <b>-I</b>
  switch could also cause odd results.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some switches do care if they are processed twice, for instance combinations of
  <b>-l</b> and <b>-0</b>. Either put all the switches after the 32-character
  boundary (if applicable), or replace the use of <b>-0</b><i>digits</i> by
  &quot;BEGIN{ $/ = &quot;\0digits&quot;; }&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Parsing of the &quot;#!&quot; switches starts wherever &quot;perl&quot; is
  mentioned in the line. The sequences &quot;-*&quot; and &quot;- &quot; are
  specifically ignored so that you could, if you were so inclined, say
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    #!/bin/sh
    #! -*-perl-*-
    eval 'exec perl -x -wS $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}'
        if 0;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
to let Perl see the <b>-p</b> switch.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A similar trick involves the <i>env</i> program, if you have it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/env perl
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The examples above use a relative path to the perl interpreter, getting whatever
  version is first in the user's path. If you want a specific version of Perl,
  say, perl5.005_57, you should place that directly in the &quot;#!&quot; line's
  path.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the &quot;#!&quot; line does not contain the word &quot;perl&quot; nor the
  word &quot;indir&quot; the program named after the &quot;#!&quot; is executed
  instead of the Perl interpreter. This is slightly bizarre, but it helps people
  on machines that don't do &quot;#!&quot;, because they can tell a program that
  their SHELL is <i>/usr/bin/perl</i>, and Perl will then dispatch the program
  to the correct interpreter for them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After locating your program, Perl compiles the entire program to an internal
  form. If there are any compilation errors, execution of the program is not
  attempted. (This is unlike the typical shell script, which might run part-way
  through before finding a syntax error.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the program is syntactically correct, it is executed. If the program runs off
  the end without hitting an <i>exit()</i> or <i>die()</i> operator, an implicit
  exit(0) is provided to indicate successful completion.

Unix's &quot;#!&quot; technique can be simulated on other systems:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">OS/2</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Put
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">Put

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    at the top of your program, where <b>-mysw</b> are any command line switches
      you want to pass to Perl. You can now invoke the program directly, by
      saying &quot;perl program&quot;, or as a DCL procedure, by saying @program
      (or implicitly via <i>DCL$PATH</i> by just using the name of the program).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This incantation is a bit much to remember, but Perl will display it for you
      if you say &quot;perl &quot;-V:startperl&quot;&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Command-interpreters on non-Unix systems have rather different ideas on quoting
  than Unix shells. You'll need to learn the special characters in your
  command-interpreter (&quot;*&quot;, &quot;\&quot; and &quot;&quot;&quot; are
  common) and how to protect whitespace and these characters to run one-liners
  (see -e below).
<div class="Pp"></div>
On some systems, you may have to change single-quotes to double ones, which you
  must <i>not</i> do on Unix or Plan 9 systems. You might also have to change a
  single % to a %%.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Unix
    perl -e 'print &quot;Hello world\n&quot;'
    # MS-DOS, etc.
    perl -e &quot;print \&quot;Hello world\n\&quot;&quot;
    # VMS
    perl -e &quot;print &quot;&quot;Hello world\n&quot;&quot;&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The problem is that none of this is reliable: it depends on the command and it
  is entirely possible neither works. If <i>4DOS</i> were the command shell,
  this would probably work better:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    perl -e &quot;print &lt;Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;Hello world\n&lt;Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>CMD.EXE</b> in Windows NT slipped a lot of standard Unix functionality in
  when nobody was looking, but just try to find documentation for its quoting
  rules.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is no general solution to all of this. It's just a mess.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Location_of_Perl"><a class="selflink" href="#Location_of_Perl">Location

It may seem obvious to say, but Perl is useful only when users can easily find
  it. When possible, it's good for both <i>/usr/bin/perl</i> and
  <i>/usr/local/bin/perl</i> to be symlinks to the actual binary. If that can't
  be done, system administrators are strongly encouraged to put (symlinks to)
  perl and its accompanying utilities into a directory typically found along a
  user's PATH, or in some other obvious and convenient place.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In this documentation, &quot;#!/usr/bin/perl&quot; on the first line of the
  program will stand in for whatever method works on your system. You are
  advised to use a specific path if you care about a specific version.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    #!/usr/local/bin/perl5.00554
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or if you just want to be running at least version, place a statement like this
  at the top of your program:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use 5.005_54;
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Command_Switches"><a class="selflink" href="#Command_Switches">Command
  Switches</a></h2>
As with all standard commands, a single-character switch may be clustered with
  the following switch, if any.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -spi.orig   # same as -s -p -i.orig
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Switches include:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-0</b>[<i>octal/hexadecimal</i>]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">specifies the input record separator ($/) as an octal or
      hexadecimal number. If there are no digits, the null character is the
      separator. Other switches may precede or follow the digits. For example,
      if you have a version of <i>find</i> which can print filenames terminated
      by the null character, you can say this:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    find . -name '*.orig' -print0 | perl -n0e unlink
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The special value 00 will cause Perl to slurp files in paragraph mode. Any
      value 0400 or above will cause Perl to slurp files whole, but by
      convention the value 0777 is the one normally used for this purpose.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You can also specify the separator character using hexadecimal notation:
      <b>-0x</b> <b><i>HHH...</i></b><b></b>, where the &quot;<i>H</i>&quot; are
      valid hexadecimal digits. Unlike the octal form, this one may be used to
      specify any Unicode character, even those beyond 0xFF. So if you
      <i>really</i> want a record separator of 0777, specify it as
      <b>-0x1FF</b>. (This means that you cannot use the <b>-x</b> option with a
      directory name that consists of hexadecimal digits, or else Perl will
      think you have specified a hex number to <b>-0</b>.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-a</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">turns on autosplit mode when used with a <b>-n</b> or

    As of 5.8.1, the <b>-C</b> can be followed either by a number or a list of
      option letters. The letters, their numeric values, and effects are as
      follows; listing the letters is equal to summing the numbers.

    O     2   STDOUT will be in UTF-8
    E     4   STDERR will be in UTF-8
    S     7   I + O + E
    i     8   UTF-8 is the default PerlIO layer for input streams
    o    16   UTF-8 is the default PerlIO layer for output streams
    D    24   i + o
    A    32   the @ARGV elements are expected to be strings encoded
              in UTF-8
    L    64   normally the &quot;IOEioA&quot; are unconditional, the L makes
              them conditional on the locale environment variables
              (the LC_ALL, LC_TYPE, and LANG, in the order of
              decreasing precedence) -- if the variables indicate
              UTF-8, then the selected &quot;IOEioA&quot; are in effect
    a   256   Set ${^UTF8CACHE} to -1, to run the UTF-8 caching
              code in debugging mode.
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example, <b>-COE</b> and <b>-C6</b> will both turn on UTF-8-ness on both
      STDOUT and STDERR. Repeating letters is just redundant, not cumulative nor
      toggling.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The &quot;io&quot; options mean that any subsequent <i>open()</i> (or
      similar I/O operations) in the current file scope will have the
      &quot;:utf8&quot; PerlIO layer implicitly applied to them, in other words,
      UTF-8 is expected from any input stream, and UTF-8 is produced to any
      output stream. This is just the default, with explicit layers in
      <i>open()</i> and with <i>binmode()</i> one can manipulate streams as
      usual.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>-C</b> on its own (not followed by any number or option list), or the
      empty string &quot;&quot; for the &quot;PERL_UNICODE&quot; environment
      variable, has the same effect as <b>-CSDL</b>. In other words, the
      standard I/O handles and the default &quot;open()&quot; layer are
      UTF-8-fied <i>but</i> only if the locale environment variables indicate a
      UTF-8 locale. This behaviour follows the <i>implicit</i> (and problematic)
      UTF-8 behaviour of Perl 5.8.0. (See &quot;UTF-8 no longer default under
      UTF-8 locales&quot; in perl581delta.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You can use <b>-C0</b> (or &quot;0&quot; for &quot;PERL_UNICODE&quot;) to
      explicitly disable all the above Unicode features.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The read-only magic variable &quot;${^UNICODE}&quot; reflects the numeric
      value of this setting. This variable is set during Perl startup and is
      thereafter read-only. If you want runtime effects, use the three-arg
      <i>open()</i> (see &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc), the two-arg
      <i>binmode()</i> (see &quot;binmode&quot; in perlfunc), and the
      &quot;open&quot; pragma (see open).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    (In Perls earlier than 5.8.1 the <b>-C</b> switch was a Win32-only switch
      that enabled the use of Unicode-aware &quot;wide system call&quot; Win32
      APIs. This feature was practically unused, however, and the command line
      switch was therefore &quot;recycled&quot;.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>Note:</b> Since perl 5.10.1, if the <b>-C</b> option is used on the
      &quot;#!&quot; line, it must be specified on the command line as well,
      since the standard streams are already set up at this point in the
      execution of the perl interpreter. You can also use <i>binmode()</i> to
      set the encoding of an I/O stream.</dd>

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Perl can be built so that it by default will try to execute
      <i></i><i>$Config</i> <i>{sitelib}/sitecustomize.pl</i> at startup (in a
      BEGIN block). This is a hook that allows the sysadmin to customize how
      Perl behaves. It can for instance be used to add entries to the @INC array
      to make Perl find modules in non-standard locations.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Perl actually inserts the following code:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    BEGIN {
        do { local $!; -f &quot;$Config{sitelib}/sitecustomize.pl&quot;; }
            &amp;&amp; do &quot;$Config{sitelib}/sitecustomize.pl&quot;;
    }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Since it is an actual &quot;do&quot; (not a &quot;require&quot;),
      <i>sitecustomize.pl</i> doesn't need to return a true value. The code is
      run in package &quot;main&quot;, in its own lexical scope. However, if the
      script dies, $@ will not be set.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The value of $Config{sitelib} is also determined in C code and not read from
      &quot;Config.pm&quot;, which is not loaded.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The code is executed <i>very</i> early. For example, any changes made to
      @INC will show up in the output of `perl -V`. Of course, &quot;END&quot;
      blocks will be likewise executed very late.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    To determine at runtime if this capability has been compiled in your perl,
      you can check the value of $Config{usesitecustomize}.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">specifies that files processed by the &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;
      construct are to be edited in-place. It does this by renaming the input
      file, opening the output file by the original name, and selecting that
      output file as the default for <i>print()</i> statements. The extension,
      if supplied, is used to modify the name of the old file to make a backup
      copy, following these rules:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If no extension is supplied, no backup is made and the current file is
      overwritten.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the extension doesn't contain a &quot;*&quot;, then it is appended to the
      end of the current filename as a suffix. If the extension does contain one
      or more &quot;*&quot; characters, then each &quot;*&quot; is replaced with
      the current filename. In Perl terms, you could think of this as:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    ($backup = $extension) =~ s/\*/$file_name/g;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This allows you to add a prefix to the backup file, instead of (or in
      addition to) a suffix:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
 $ perl -pi'orig_*' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA  # backup to
                                           # 'orig_fileA'
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Or even to place backup copies of the original files into another directory
      (provided the directory already exists):
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
 $ perl -pi'old/*.orig' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA  # backup to
                                               # 'old/fileA.orig'
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    These sets of one-liners are equivalent:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
 $ perl -pi -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA          # overwrite current file
 $ perl -pi'*' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA       # overwrite current file
 $ perl -pi'.orig' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA   # backup to 'fileA.orig'
 $ perl -pi'*.orig' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA  # backup to 'fileA.orig'
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    From the shell, saying
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $ perl -p -i.orig -e &quot;s/foo/bar/; ... &quot;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    is the same as using the program:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -pi.orig
    s/foo/bar/;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    which is equivalent to
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    $extension = '.orig';
    LINE: while (&lt;&gt;) {
        if ($ARGV ne $oldargv) {
            if ($extension !~ /\*/) {
                $backup = $ARGV . $extension;
            }
            else {
                ($backup = $extension) =~ s/\*/$ARGV/g;
            }
            rename($ARGV, $backup);
            open(ARGVOUT, &quot;&gt;$ARGV&quot;);
            select(ARGVOUT);
            $oldargv = $ARGV;
        }
        s/foo/bar/;
    }
    continue {
        print;  # this prints to original filename
    }
    select(STDOUT);
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    except that the <b>-i</b> form doesn't need to compare $ARGV to $oldargv to
      know when the filename has changed. It does, however, use ARGVOUT for the
      selected filehandle. Note that STDOUT is restored as the default output
      filehandle after the loop.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    As shown above, Perl creates the backup file whether or not any output is
      actually changed. So this is just a fancy way to copy files:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $ perl -p -i'/some/file/path/*' -e 1 file1 file2 file3...
or
    $ perl -p -i'.orig' -e 1 file1 file2 file3...
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You can use &quot;eof&quot; without parentheses to locate the end of each
      input file, in case you want to append to each file, or reset line
      numbering (see example in &quot;eof&quot; in perlfunc).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If, for a given file, Perl is unable to create the backup file as specified
      in the extension then it will skip that file and continue on with the next
      one (if it exists).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For a discussion of issues surrounding file permissions and <b>-i</b>, see
      &quot;Why does Perl let me delete read-only files? Why does -i clobber
      protected files? Isn't this a bug in Perl?&quot; in perlfaq5.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You cannot use <b>-i</b> to create directories or to strip extensions from
      files.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Perl does not expand &quot;~&quot; in filenames, which is good, since some
      folks use it for their backup files:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $ perl -pi~ -e 's/foo/bar/' file1 file2 file3...
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that because <b>-i</b> renames or deletes the original file before
      creating a new file of the same name, Unix-style soft and hard links will
      not be preserved.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Finally, the <b>-i</b> switch does not impede execution when no files are
      given on the command line. In this case, no backup is made (the original
      file cannot, of course, be determined) and processing proceeds from STDIN
      to STDOUT as might be expected.</dd>

      <i>octnum</i> so that any print statements will have that separator added
      back on. If <i>octnum</i> is omitted, sets &quot;$\&quot; to the current
      value of $/. For instance, to trim lines to 80 columns:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    perl -lpe 'substr($_, 80) = &quot;&quot;'
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that the assignment &quot;$\ = $/&quot; is done when the switch is
      processed, so the input record separator can be different than the output
      record separator if the <b>-l</b> switch is followed by a <b>-0</b>
      switch:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    gnufind / -print0 | perl -ln0e 'print &quot;found $_&quot; if -p'
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

    If the first character after the <b>-M</b> or <b>-m</b> is a dash (<b>-</b>)
      then the 'use' is replaced with 'no'.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A little builtin syntactic sugar means you can also say
      <b>-m</b><b><i>MODULE</i></b> <b>=foo,bar</b> or
      <b>-M</b><b><i>MODULE</i></b> <b>=foo,bar</b> as a shortcut for
      <b>'-M</b><b><i>MODULE</i></b><b> qw(foo bar)'</b>. This avoids the need

      split(/,/,q{foo,bar})&quot;. Note that the &quot;=&quot; form removes the

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A consequence of this is that <b>-M</b><b><i>MODULE</i></b><b>=number</b>

    Also note that &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; passes command line arguments to

    On some platforms, this also makes Perl append suffixes to the filename
      while searching for it. For example, on Win32 platforms, the
      &quot;.bat&quot; and &quot;.cmd&quot; suffixes are appended if a lookup
      for the original name fails, and if the name does not already end in one
      of those suffixes. If your Perl was compiled with &quot;DEBUGGING&quot;

    Typically this is used to emulate &quot;#!&quot; startup on platforms that

      search mechanism.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This example works on many platforms that have a shell compatible with

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The system ignores the first line and feeds the program to <i>/bin/sh</i>,
      which proceeds to try to execute the Perl program as a shell script. The
      shell executes the second line as a normal shell command, and thus starts
      up the Perl interpreter. On some systems $0 doesn't always contain the
      full pathname, so the <b>-S</b> tells Perl to search for the program if
      necessary. After Perl locates the program, it parses the lines and ignores
      them because the variable $running_under_some_shell is never true. If the
      program will be interpreted by csh, you will need to replace
      &quot;${1+&quot;$@&quot;}&quot; with $*, even though that doesn't
      understand embedded spaces (and such) in the argument list. To start up
      <i>sh</i> rather than <i>csh</i>, some systems may have to replace the
      &quot;#!&quot; line with a line containing just a colon, which will be
      politely ignored by Perl. Other systems can't control that, and need a
      totally devious construct that will work under any of <i>csh</i>,
      <i>sh</i>, or Perl, such as the following:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
        eval '(exit $?0)' &amp;&amp; eval 'exec perl -wS $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}'
        &amp; eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -wS $0 $argv:q'
                if $running_under_some_shell;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the filename supplied contains directory separators (and so is an
      absolute or relative pathname), and if that file is not found, platforms
      that append file extensions will do so and try to look for the file with
      those extensions added, one by one.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    On DOS-like platforms, if the program does not contain directory separators,
      it will first be searched for in the current directory before being
      searched for on the PATH. On Unix platforms, the program will be searched
      for strictly on the PATH.</dd>

    It is conventional to start layer names with a colon (for example,
      &quot;:perlio&quot;) to emphasize their similarity to variable

    An unset or empty PERLIO is equivalent to the default set of layers for your

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The list becomes the default for <i>all</i> Perl's IO. Consequently only

On Win32 the default in this release (5.14) is &quot;unix crlf&quot;. Win32's
  &quot;stdio&quot; has a number of bugs/mis-features for Perl IO which are
  somewhat depending on the version and vendor of the C compiler. Using our own
  &quot;crlf&quot; layer as the buffer avoids those issues and makes things more
  uniform. The &quot;crlf&quot; layer provides CRLF conversion as well as
  buffering.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This release (5.14) uses &quot;unix&quot; as the bottom layer on Win32, and so
  still uses the C compiler's numeric file descriptor routines. There is an
  experimental native &quot;win32&quot; layer, which is expected to be enhanced

    Setting this environment variable to 1 means that Perl will simply use the

      Guardian</i> happy--and in that particular case Perl still works too
      because <i>McAfee</i> <i>Guardian</i>'s LSP actually plays other games

  <dd class="It-tag">(Since Perl 5.8.1.) Used to randomize Perl's internal hash
      function. To emulate the pre-5.8.1 behaviour, set to an integer;
      &quot;0&quot; means exactly the same order as in 5.8.0.
      &quot;Pre-5.8.1&quot; means, among other things, that hash keys will
      always have the same ordering between different runs of Perl.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Most hashes by default return elements in the same order as in Perl 5.8.0.
      On a hash by hash basis, if pathological data is detected during a hash
      key insertion, then that hash will switch to an alternative random hash
      seed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The default behaviour is to randomize unless the PERL_HASH_SEED is set. If
      Perl has been compiled with <b>-DUSE_HASH_SEED_EXPLICIT</b>, the default
      behaviour is <i>not</i> to randomize unless the PERL_HASH_SEED is set.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If PERL_HASH_SEED is unset or set to a non-numeric string, Perl uses the
      pseudorandom seed supplied by the operating system and libraries.

     <b>PLEASE NOTE: The hash seed is sensitive information</b>. Hashes are

      lost.

<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl also has environment variables that control how Perl handles data specific
  to particular natural languages; see perllocale.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl and its various modules and components, including its test frameworks, may
  sometimes make use of certain other environment variables. Some of these are
  specific to a particular platform. Please consult the appropriate module
  documentation and any documentation for your platform (like perlsolaris,
  perllinux, perlmacosx, perlwin32, etc) for variables peculiar to those
  specific situations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl makes all environment variables available to the program being executed,
  and passes these along to any child processes it starts. However, programs
  running setuid would do well to execute the following lines before doing
  anything else, just to keep people honest:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $ENV{PATH}  = &quot;/bin:/usr/bin&quot;;    # or whatever you need
    $ENV{SHELL} = &quot;/bin/sh&quot; if exists $ENV{SHELL};
    delete @ENV{qw(IFS CDPATH ENV BASH_ENV)};
</pre>
