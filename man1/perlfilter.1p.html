<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlfilter - Source Filters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This article is about a little-known feature of Perl called
source filters. Source filters alter the program text of a
module before Perl sees it, much as a C preprocessor alters
<br>
the source text of a C program before the compiler sees it.
This article tells you more about what source filters are,
how they work, and how to write your own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The original purpose of source
filters was to let you encrypt your program source to
prevent casual piracy. This isn&rsquo;t all they can do, as
you&rsquo;ll soon learn. But first, the <br>
basics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONCEPTS <br>
Before the Perl interpreter can execute a Perl script, it
must first read it from a file into memory for parsing and
compilation. If that script itself includes other scripts
<br>
with a &quot;use&quot; or &quot;require&quot; statement,
then each of those scripts will have to be read from their
respective files as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now think of each logical
connection between the Perl parser and an individual file as
a source stream. A source stream is created when the Perl
parser opens a file, it continues <br>
to exist as the source code is read into memory, and it is
destroyed when Perl is finished parsing the file. If the
parser encounters a &quot;require&quot; or &quot;use&quot;
statement in a source <br>
stream, a new and distinct stream is created just for that
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The diagram below represents a
single source stream, with the flow of source from a Perl
script file on the left into the Perl parser on the right.
This is how Perl normally <br>
operates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file -------&gt; parser</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two important points
to remember:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Although there can be any
number of source streams in existence at any given time,
only one will be active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Every source stream is
associated with only one file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A source filter is a special
kind of Perl module that intercepts and modifies a source
stream before it reaches the parser. A source filter changes
our diagram like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file ----&gt; filter ----&gt;
parser</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If that doesn&rsquo;t make much
sense, consider the analogy of a command pipeline. Say you
have a shell script stored in the compressed file trial.gz.
The simple pipeline command below <br>
runs the script without needing to create a temporary file
to hold the uncompressed file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gunzip -c trial.gz | sh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case, the data flow from
the pipeline can be represented as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trial.gz ----&gt; gunzip
----&gt; sh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With source filters, you can
store the text of your script compressed and use a source
filter to uncompress it for Perl&rsquo;s parser:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compressed gunzip <br>
Perl program ---&gt; source filter ---&gt; parser</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING FILTERS <br>
So how do you use a source filter in a Perl script? Above, I
said that a source filter is just a special kind of module.
Like all Perl modules, a source filter is invoked with a
<br>
use statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Say you want to pass your Perl
source through the C preprocessor before execution. As it
happens, the source filters distribution comes with a C
preprocessor filter module called <br>
Filter::cpp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Below is an example program,
&quot;cpp_test&quot;, which makes use of this filter. Line
numbers have been added to allow specific lines to be
referenced easily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1: use Filter::cpp; <br>
2: #define TRUE 1 <br>
3: $a = TRUE; <br>
4: print &quot;a = $a0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you execute this script,
Perl creates a source stream for the file. Before the parser
processes any of the lines from the file, the source stream
looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpp_test ---------&gt;
parser</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Line 1, &quot;use
Filter::cpp&quot;, includes and installs the &quot;cpp&quot;
filter module. All source filters work this way. The use
statement is compiled and executed at compile time, before
any <br>
more of the file is read, and it attaches the cpp filter to
the source stream behind the scenes. Now the data flow looks
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpp_test ----&gt; cpp filter
----&gt; parser</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As the parser reads the second
and subsequent lines from the source stream, it feeds those
lines through the &quot;cpp&quot; source filter before
processing them. The &quot;cpp&quot; filter simply <br>
passes each line through the real C preprocessor. The output
from the C preprocessor is then inserted back into the
source stream by the filter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.-&gt; cpp --. <br>
| | <br>
| | <br>
| &lt;-&rsquo; <br>
cpp_test ----&gt; cpp filter ----&gt; parser</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parser then sees the
following code:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Filter::cpp; <br>
$a = 1; <br>
print &quot;a = $a0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Let&rsquo;s consider what
happens when the filtered code includes another module with
use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1: use Filter::cpp; <br>
2: #define TRUE 1 <br>
3: use Fred; <br>
4: $a = TRUE; <br>
5: print &quot;a = $a0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;cpp&quot; filter does
not apply to the text of the Fred module, only to the text
of the file that used it (&quot;cpp_test&quot;). Although
the use statement on line 3 will pass through the <br>
cpp filter, the module that gets included (&quot;Fred&quot;)
will not. The source streams look like this after line 3 has
been parsed and before line 4 is parsed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpp_test ---&gt; cpp filter
---&gt; parser (INACTIVE)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fred.pm ----&gt; parser</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As you can see, a new stream has
been created for reading the source from
&quot;Fred.pm&quot;. This stream will remain active until
all of &quot;Fred.pm&quot; has been parsed. The source
stream for <br>
&quot;cpp_test&quot; will still exist, but is inactive. Once
the parser has finished reading Fred.pm, the source stream
associated with it will be destroyed. The source stream for
<br>
&quot;cpp_test&quot; then becomes active again and the
parser reads line 4 and subsequent lines from
&quot;cpp_test&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use more than one source
filter on a single file. Similarly, you can reuse the same
filter in as many files as you like.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if you have a
uuencoded and compressed source file, it is possible to
stack a uudecode filter and an uncompression filter like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Filter::uudecode; use
Filter::uncompress; <br>

M&rsquo;XL(&quot;.H&lt;US4&rsquo;&rsquo;V9I;F%L&rsquo;)Q;&gt;7/;1I;_&gt;_I3=&amp;E=%:F*I&quot;T?22Q/
<br>

M6]9*&lt;IQCO*XFT&quot;0[PL%%&rsquo;Y+IG?WN^ZYN-$&rsquo;J.[.JE$,20/?K=_[&gt;
<br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once the first line has been
processed, the flow will look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file ---&gt; uudecode ---&gt;
uncompress ---&gt; parser <br>
filter filter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data flows through filters in
the same order they appear in the source file. The uudecode
filter appeared before the uncompress filter, so the source
file will be uudecoded <br>
before it&rsquo;s uncompressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WRITING A SOURCE FILTER <br>
There are three ways to write your own source filter. You
can write it in C, use an external program as a filter, or
write the filter in Perl. I won&rsquo;t cover the first two
in any <br>
great detail, so I&rsquo;ll get them out of the way first.
Writing the filter in Perl is most convenient, so I&rsquo;ll
devote the most space to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WRITING A SOURCE FILTER IN C
<br>
The first of the three available techniques is to write the
filter completely in C. The external module you create
interfaces directly with the source filter hooks provided by
<br>
Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The advantage of this technique
is that you have complete control over the implementation of
your filter. The big disadvantage is the increased
complexity required to write the <br>
filter - not only do you need to understand the source
filter hooks, but you also need a reasonable knowledge of
Perl guts. One of the few times it is worth going to this
trouble <br>
is when writing a source scrambler. The &quot;decrypt&quot;
filter (which unscrambles the source before Perl parses it)
included with the source filter distribution is an example
of a C <br>
source filter (see Decryption Filters, below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Decryption Filters <br>
All decryption filters work on the principle of
&quot;security through obscurity.&quot; Regardless of how
well you write a decryption filter and how strong your
encryption algorithm <br>
is, anyone determined enough can retrieve the original
source code. The reason is quite simple - once the
decryption filter has decrypted the source back to its
original <br>
form, fragments of it will be stored in the computer&rsquo;s
memory as Perl parses it. The source might only be in memory
for a short period of time, but anyone possessing a <br>
debugger, skill, and lots of patience can eventually
reconstruct your program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That said, there are a number of
steps that can be taken to make life difficult for the
potential cracker. The most important: Write your decryption
filter in C and <br>
statically link the decryption module into the Perl binary.
For further tips to make life difficult for the potential
cracker, see the file decrypt.pm in the source filters <br>
distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CREATING A SOURCE FILTER AS A
SEPARATE EXECUTABLE <br>
An alternative to writing the filter in C is to create a
separate executable in the language of your choice. The
separate executable reads from standard input, does whatever
<br>
processing is necessary, and writes the filtered data to
standard output. &quot;Filter::cpp&quot; is an example of a
source filter implemented as a separate executable - the
executable is <br>
the C preprocessor bundled with your C compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The source filter distribution
includes two modules that simplify this task:
&quot;Filter::exec&quot; and &quot;Filter::sh&quot;. Both
allow you to run any external executable. Both use a
coprocess <br>
to control the flow of data into and out of the external
executable. (For details on coprocesses, see Stephens, W.R.,
&quot;Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment.&quot;
Addison- <br>
Wesley, ISBN 0-210-56317-7, pages 441-445.) The difference
between them is that &quot;Filter::exec&quot; spawns the
external command directly, while &quot;Filter::sh&quot;
spawns a shell to execute <br>
the external command. (Unix uses the Bourne shell; NT uses
the cmd shell.) Spawning a shell allows you to make use of
the shell metacharacters and redirection facilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an example script that
uses &quot;Filter::sh&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Filter::sh &rsquo;tr XYZ
PQR&rsquo;; <br>
$a = 1; <br>
print &quot;XYZ a = $a0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output you&rsquo;ll get when
the script is executed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PQR a = 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Writing a source filter as a
separate executable works fine, but a small performance
penalty is incurred. For example, if you execute the small
example above, a separate <br>
subprocess will be created to run the Unix &quot;tr&quot;
command. Each use of the filter requires its own subprocess.
If creating subprocesses is expensive on your system, you
might want <br>
to consider one of the other options for creating source
filters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WRITING A SOURCE FILTER IN PERL
<br>
The easiest and most portable option available for creating
your own source filter is to write it completely in Perl. To
distinguish this from the previous two techniques,
I&rsquo;ll <br>
call it a Perl source filter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To help understand how to write
a Perl source filter we need an example to study. Here is a
complete source filter that performs rot13 decoding. (Rot13
is a very simple <br>
encryption scheme used in Usenet postings to hide the
contents of offensive posts. It moves every letter forward
thirteen places, so that A becomes N, B becomes O, and Z
becomes <br>
M.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package Rot13;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Filter::Util::Call;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub import { <br>
my ($type) = @_; <br>
my ($ref) = []; <br>
filter_add(bless $ref); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub filter { <br>
my ($self) = @_; <br>
my ($status);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tr/n-za-mN-ZA-M/a-zA-Z/ <br>
if ($status = filter_read()) &gt; 0; <br>
$status; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All Perl source filters are
implemented as Perl classes and have the same basic
structure as the example above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, we include the
&quot;Filter::Util::Call&quot; module, which exports a
number of functions into your filter&rsquo;s namespace. The
filter shown above uses two of these functions, <br>
&quot;filter_add()&quot; and &quot;filter_read()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next, we create the filter
object and associate it with the source stream by defining
the &quot;import&quot; function. If you know Perl well
enough, you know that &quot;import&quot; is called <br>
automatically every time a module is included with a use
statement. This makes &quot;import&quot; the ideal place to
both create and install a filter object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the example filter, the
object ($ref) is blessed just like any other Perl object.
Our example uses an anonymous array, but this isn&rsquo;t a
requirement. Because this example <br>
doesn&rsquo;t need to store any context information, we
could have used a scalar or hash reference just as well. The
next section demonstrates context data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The association between the
filter object and the source stream is made with the
&quot;filter_add()&quot; function. This takes a filter
object as a parameter ($ref in this case) and <br>
installs it in the source stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, there is the code that
actually does the filtering. For this type of Perl source
filter, all the filtering is done in a method called
&quot;filter()&quot;. (It is also possible to <br>
write a Perl source filter using a closure. See the
&quot;Filter::Util::Call&quot; manual page for more
details.) It&rsquo;s called every time the Perl parser needs
another line of source to <br>
process. The &quot;filter()&quot; method, in turn, reads
lines from the source stream using the
&quot;filter_read()&quot; function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a line was available from the
source stream, &quot;filter_read()&quot; returns a status
value greater than zero and appends the line to $_. A status
value of zero indicates end-of- <br>
file, less than zero means an error. The filter function
itself is expected to return its status in the same way, and
put the filtered line it wants written to the source stream
<br>
in $_. The use of $_ accounts for the brevity of most Perl
source filters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to make use of the
rot13 filter we need some way of encoding the source file in
rot13 format. The script below, &quot;mkrot13&quot;, does
just that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">die &quot;usage mkrot13
filename0 unless @ARGV; <br>
my $in = $ARGV[0]; <br>
my $out = &quot;$in.tmp&quot;; <br>
open(IN, &quot;&lt;$in&quot;) or die &quot;Cannot open file
$in: $!0; <br>
open(OUT, &quot;&gt;$out&quot;) or die &quot;Cannot open
file $out: $!0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print OUT &quot;use Rot13;0;
<br>
while (&lt;IN&gt;) { <br>
tr/a-zA-Z/n-za-mN-ZA-M/; <br>
print OUT; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close IN; <br>
close OUT; <br>
unlink $in; <br>
rename $out, $in;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If we encrypt this with
&quot;mkrot13&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot; hello fred 0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the result will be this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Rot13; <br>
cevag &quot;uryyb serq&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running it produces this
output:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hello fred</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING CONTEXT: THE DEBUG FILTER
<br>
The rot13 example was a trivial example. Here&rsquo;s
another demonstration that shows off a few more
features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Say you wanted to include a lot
of debugging code in your Perl script during development,
but you didn&rsquo;t want it available in the released
product. Source filters offer a <br>
solution. In order to keep the example simple, let&rsquo;s
say you wanted the debugging output to be controlled by an
environment variable, &quot;DEBUG&quot;. Debugging code is
enabled if the <br>
variable exists, otherwise it is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two special marker lines will
bracket debugging code, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">## DEBUG_BEGIN <br>
if ($year &gt; 1999) { <br>
warn &quot;Debug: millennium bug in year $year0; <br>
} <br>
## DEBUG_END</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filter ensures that Perl
parses the code between the &lt;DEBUG_BEGIN&gt; and
&quot;DEBUG_END&quot; markers only when the
&quot;DEBUG&quot; environment variable exists. That means
that when &quot;DEBUG&quot; <br>
does exist, the code above should be passed through the
filter unchanged. The marker lines can also be passed
through as-is, because the Perl parser will see them as
comment <br>
lines. When &quot;DEBUG&quot; isn&rsquo;t set, we need a way
to disable the debug code. A simple way to achieve that is
to convert the lines between the two markers into
comments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">## DEBUG_BEGIN <br>
#if ($year &gt; 1999) { <br>
# warn &quot;Debug: millennium bug in year $year0; <br>
#} <br>
## DEBUG_END</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is the complete Debug
filter:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package Debug;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use strict; <br>
use warnings; <br>
use Filter::Util::Call;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use constant TRUE =&gt; 1; <br>
use constant FALSE =&gt; 0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub import { <br>
my ($type) = @_; <br>
my (%context) = ( <br>
Enabled =&gt; defined $ENV{DEBUG}, <br>
InTraceBlock =&gt; FALSE, <br>
Filename =&gt; (caller)[1], <br>
LineNo =&gt; 0, <br>
LastBegin =&gt; 0, <br>
); <br>
filter_add(bless context); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub Die { <br>
my ($self) = shift; <br>
my ($message) = shift; <br>
my ($line_no) = shift || $self-&gt;{LastBegin}; <br>
die &quot;$message at $self-&gt;{Filename} line $line_no.0
<br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub filter { <br>
my ($self) = @_; <br>
my ($status); <br>
$status = filter_read(); <br>
++ $self-&gt;{LineNo};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># deal with EOF/error first <br>
if ($status &lt;= 0) { <br>
$self-&gt;Die(&quot;DEBUG_BEGIN has no DEBUG_END&quot;) <br>
if $self-&gt;{InTraceBlock}; <br>
return $status; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ($self-&gt;{InTraceBlock}) {
<br>
if (/^##DEBUG_BEGIN/ ) { <br>
$self-&gt;Die(&quot;Nested DEBUG_BEGIN&quot;,
$self-&gt;{LineNo}) <br>
} elsif (/^##DEBUG_END/) { <br>
$self-&gt;{InTraceBlock} = FALSE; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># comment out the debug lines
when the filter is disabled <br>
s/^/#/ if ! $self-&gt;{Enabled}; <br>
} elsif ( /^##DEBUG_BEGIN/ ) { <br>
$self-&gt;{InTraceBlock} = TRUE; <br>
$self-&gt;{LastBegin} = $self-&gt;{LineNo}; <br>
} elsif ( /^##DEBUG_END/ ) { <br>
$self-&gt;Die(&quot;DEBUG_END has no DEBUG_BEGIN&quot;,
$self-&gt;{LineNo}); <br>
} <br>
return $status; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The big difference between this
filter and the previous example is the use of context data
in the filter object. The filter object is based on a hash
reference, and is used to <br>
keep various pieces of context information between calls to
the filter function. All but two of the hash fields are used
for error reporting. The first of those two, Enabled, is
<br>
used by the filter to determine whether the debugging code
should be given to the Perl parser. The second,
InTraceBlock, is true when the filter has encountered a
&quot;DEBUG_BEGIN&quot; <br>
line, but has not yet encountered the following
&quot;DEBUG_END&quot; line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you ignore all the error
checking that most of the code does, the essence of the
filter is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub filter { <br>
my ($self) = @_; <br>
my ($status); <br>
$status = filter_read();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># deal with EOF/error first <br>
return $status if $status &lt;= 0; <br>
if ($self-&gt;{InTraceBlock}) { <br>
if (/^##DEBUG_END/) { <br>
$self-&gt;{InTraceBlock} = FALSE <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># comment out debug lines when
the filter is disabled <br>
s/^/#/ if ! $self-&gt;{Enabled}; <br>
} elsif ( /^##DEBUG_BEGIN/ ) { <br>
$self-&gt;{InTraceBlock} = TRUE; <br>
} <br>
return $status; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be warned: just as the
C-preprocessor doesn&rsquo;t know C, the Debug filter
doesn&rsquo;t know Perl. It can be fooled quite easily:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &lt;&lt;EOM; <br>
##DEBUG_BEGIN <br>
EOM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Such things aside, you can see
that a lot can be achieved with a modest amount of code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONCLUSION <br>
You now have better understanding of what a source filter
is, and you might even have a possible use for them. If you
feel like playing with source filters but need a bit of <br>
inspiration, here are some extra features you could add to
the Debug filter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, an easy one. Rather than
having debugging code that is all-or-nothing, it would be
much more useful to be able to control which specific blocks
of debugging code get <br>
included. Try extending the syntax for debug blocks to allow
each to be identified. The contents of the &quot;DEBUG&quot;
environment variable can then be used to control which
blocks get <br>
included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you can identify individual
blocks, try allowing them to be nested. That isn&rsquo;t
difficult either.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an interesting idea that
doesn&rsquo;t involve the Debug filter. Currently Perl
subroutines have fairly limited support for formal parameter
lists. You can specify the number <br>
of parameters and their type, but you still have to manually
take them out of the @_ array yourself. Write a source
filter that allows you to have a named parameter list. Such
a <br>
filter would turn this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub MySub ($first, $second,
@rest) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">into this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub MySub($$@) { <br>
my ($first) = shift; <br>
my ($second) = shift; <br>
my (@rest) = @_; <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, if you feel like a real
challenge, have a go at writing a full-blown Perl macro
preprocessor as a source filter. Borrow the useful features
from the C preprocessor and <br>
any other macro processors you know. The tricky bit will be
choosing how much knowledge of Perl&rsquo;s syntax you want
your filter to have.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
Source filters only work on the string level, thus are
highly limited in its ability to change source code on the
fly. It cannot detect comments, quoted strings, heredocs, it
is <br>
no replacement for a real parser. The only stable usage for
source filters are encryption, compression, or the
byteloader, to translate binary code back to source
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See for example the limitations
in Switch, which uses source filters, and thus is does not
work inside a string eval, the presence of regexes with
embedded newlines that are <br>
specified with raw &quot;/.../&quot; delimiters and
don&rsquo;t have a modifier &quot;//x&quot; are
indistinguishable from code chunks beginning with the
division operator &quot;/&quot;. As a workaround you must
<br>
use &quot;m/.../&quot; or &quot;m?...?&quot; for such
patterns. Also, the presence of regexes specified with raw
&quot;?...?&quot; delimiters may cause mysterious errors.
The workaround is to use &quot;m?...?&quot; <br>
instead. See
&lt;http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Switch#LIMITATIONS&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently the content of the
&quot;__DATA__&quot; block is not filtered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently internal buffer
lengths are limited to 32-bit only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR <br>
Some Filters Clobber the &quot;DATA&quot; Handle <br>
Some source filters use the &quot;DATA&quot; handle to read
the calling program. When using these source filters you
cannot rely on this handle, nor expect any particular kind
of <br>
behavior when operating on it. Filters based on
Filter::Util::Call (and therefore Filter::Simple) do not
alter the &quot;DATA&quot; filehandle, but on the other hand
totally ignore <br>
the text after &quot;__DATA__&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIREMENTS <br>
The Source Filters distribution is available on CPAN, in</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPAN/modules/by-module/Filter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting from Perl 5.8
Filter::Util::Call (the core part of the Source Filters
distribution) is part of the standard Perl distribution.
Also included is a friendlier interface <br>
called Filter::Simple, by Damian Conway.</p>
