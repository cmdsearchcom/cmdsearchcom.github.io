nfc-emulate-uid - NFC target emulation command line tool based on libnfc

<b>nfc-emulate-uid</b> is a tag emulation tool that allows one to choose any tag
  UID. Tag emulation is one of the main added features in NFC. But to avoid
  abuse of existing systems, manufacturers of the NFC controller intentionally
  did not support emulation of fully customized UID but only of
  &quot;random&quot; UIDs, which always start with 0x08. The nfc-emulate-uid
  tool demonstrates that this can still be done using transmission of raw
  frames, and the desired UID can be optionally specified.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This makes it a serious thread for security systems that rely only on the
  uniqueness of the UID.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Unfortunately, this example can't directly start in fully customisable target
  mode. Just after launching this example, you will have to go through the
  hardcoded initial anti-collision with the 0x08-prefixed UID. To achieve it,
  you can e.g. send a RATS (Request for Answer To Select) command by using a
  second NFC device (placed in target's field) and launching nfc-list or
  nfc-anticol. After this first step, you now have a NFC device (configured as
  target) that really emulates a custom UID. You could view it using the second
  NFC device with nfc-list.

Timing control is very important for a successful anti-collision sequence:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
- The emulator must be very fast to react: Using the ACR122 device gives many
  timing issues, &quot;PN53x only&quot; USB devices also give some timing issues
  but an embedded microprocessor would probably improve greatly the situation.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
- The reader should not be too strict on timing (the standard is very strict).
  The OmniKey CardMan 5321 is known to be very large on timings and is a good
  choice if you want to experiment with this emulator with a tolerant reader.
  Nokia NFC 6212 and Pegoda readers are much too strict and won't be fooled.

ACR122 devices (like touchatag, etc.) can be used by this example (with timing
  issues), but if something goes wrong, you will have to unplug/replug your
  device. This is not a <b>libnfc's</b> bug, this problem is due to ACR122's
  internal MCU in front of NFC chip (PN532).
