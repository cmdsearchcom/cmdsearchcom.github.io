<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
nfc-emulate-uid - NFC target emulation command line tool
based on libnfc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
nfc-emulate-uid [OPTIONS] [UID]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
nfc-emulate-uid is a tag emulation tool that allows one to
choose any tag UID. Tag emulation is one of the main added
features in NFC. But to avoid abuse of existing systems,
<br>
manufacturers of the NFC controller intentionally did not
support emulation of fully customized UID but only of
&quot;random&quot; UIDs, which always start with 0x08. The
nfc-emulate-uid <br>
tool demonstrates that this can still be done using
transmission of raw frames, and the desired UID can be
optionally specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This makes it a serious thread
for security systems that rely only on the uniqueness of the
UID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately, this example
can&rsquo;t directly start in fully customisable target
mode. Just after launching this example, you will have to go
through the hardcoded initial anti-col&acirc; <br>
lision with the 0x08-prefixed UID. To achieve it, you can
e.g. send a RATS (Request for Answer To Select) command by
using a second NFC device (placed in target&rsquo;s field)
and <br>
launching nfc-list or nfc-anticol. After this first step,
you now have a NFC device (configured as target) that really
emulates a custom UID. You could view it using the second
<br>
NFC device with nfc-list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Timing control is very important
for a successful anti-collision sequence:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The emulator must be very fast
to react: Using the ACR122 device gives many timing issues,
&quot;PN53x only&quot; USB devices also give some timing
issues but an embedded microprocessor <br>
would probably improve greatly the situation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The reader should not be too
strict on timing (the standard is very strict). The OmniKey
CardMan 5321 is known to be very large on timings and is a
good choice if you want to <br>
experiment with this emulator with a tolerant reader. Nokia
NFC 6212 and Pegoda readers are much too strict and
won&rsquo;t be fooled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
UID 8 hex digits format that represents desired UID (default
is DEADBEEF).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPORTANT <br>
ACR122 devices (like touchatag, etc.) can be used by this
example (with timing issues), but if something goes wrong,
you will have to unplug/replug your device. This is not a
<br>
libnfc&rsquo;s bug, this problem is due to ACR122&rsquo;s
internal MCU in front of NFC chip (PN532).</p>
