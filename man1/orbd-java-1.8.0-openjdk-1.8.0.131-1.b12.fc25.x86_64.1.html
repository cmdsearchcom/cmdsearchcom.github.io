<p>orbd(1) Java IDL and RMI-IIOP Tools orbd(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
orbd - Enables clients to locate and call persistent objects
on servers in the CORBA environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
orbd [ options ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">options <br>
Command-line options. See Options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The orbd command enables clients to transparently locate and
call persistent objects on servers in the CORBA environment.
The Server Manager included with the orbd tool is used <br>
to enable clients to transparently locate and call
persistent objects on servers in the CORBA environment. The
persistent servers, while publishing the persistent object
<br>
references in the naming service, include the port number of
the ORBD in the object reference instead of the port number
of the server. The inclusion of an ORBD port number in <br>
the object reference for persistent object references has
the following advantages:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The object
reference in the naming service remains independent of the
server life cycle. For example, the object reference could
be published by the server in the Naming <br>
Service when it is first installed, and then, independent of
how many times the server is started or shut down, the ORBD
returns the correct object reference to the calling <br>
client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The client needs
to look up the object reference in the naming service only
once, and can keep reusing this reference independent of the
changes introduced due to server life <br>
cycle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To access the ORBD Server
Manager, the server must be started using servertool, which
is a command-line interface for application programmers to
register, unregister, start up, <br>
and shut down a persistent server. For more information on
the Server Manager, see Server Manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When orbd starts, it also starts
a naming service. For more information about the naming
service. See Start and Stop the Naming Service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-ORBInitialPort nameserverport <br>
Required. Specifies the port on which the name server should
be started. After it is started, orbd listens for incoming
requests on this port. On Oracle Solaris software, <br>
you must become the root user to start a process on a port
below 1024. For this reason, Oracle recommends that you use
a port number above or equal to 1024.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NONREQUIRED OPTIONS <br>
-port port <br>
Specifies the activation port where ORBD should be started,
and where ORBD will be accepting requests for persistent
objects. The default value for this port is 1049. This <br>
port number is added to the port field of the persistent
Interoperable Object References (IOR).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-defaultdb directory <br>
Specifies the base where the ORBD persistent storage
directory, orb.db, is created. If this option is not
specified, then the default value is ./orb.db.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-serverPollingTime milliseconds
<br>
Specifies how often ORBD checks for the health of persistent
servers registered through servertool. The default value is
1000 ms. The value specified for milliseconds must <br>
be a valid positive integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-serverStartupDelay milliseconds
<br>
Specifies how long ORBD waits before sending a location
forward exception after a persistent server that is
registered through servertool is restarted. The default
value <br>
is 1000 ms. The value specified for milliseconds must be a
valid positive integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Joption <br>
Passes option to the Java Virtual Machine, where option is
one of the options described on the reference page for the
Java application launcher. For example, -J-Xms48m <br>
sets the startup memory to 48 MB. See java(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">START AND STOP THE NAMING
SERVICE <br>
A naming service is a CORBA service that allows CORBA
objects to be named by means of binding a name to an object
reference. The name binding can be stored in the naming
service, <br>
and a client can supply the name to obtain the desired
object reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before running a client or a
server, you will start ORBD. ORBD includes a persistent
naming service and a transient naming service, both of which
are an implementation of the COS <br>
Naming Service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Persistent Naming Service
provides persistence for naming contexts. This means that
this information is persistent across service shutdowns and
startups, and is recoverable <br>
in the event of a service failure. If ORBD is restarted,
then the Persistent Naming Service restores the naming
context graph, so that the binding of all clients&rsquo; and
servers&rsquo; <br>
names remains intact (persistent).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For backward compatibility,
tnameserv, a Transient Naming Service that shipped with
earlier releases of the JDK, is also included in this
release of Java SE. A transient naming <br>
service retains naming contexts as long as it is running. If
there is a service interruption, then the naming context
graph is lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -ORBInitialPort argument is
a required command-line argument for orbd, and is used to
set the port number on which the naming service runs. The
following instructions assume <br>
you can use port 1050 for the Java IDL Object Request Broker
Daemon. When using Oracle Solaris software, you must become
a root user to start a process on a port lower than 1024.
<br>
For this reason, it is recommended that you use a port
number above or equal to 1024. You can substitute a
different port when necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start orbd from a UNIX
command shell, enter:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">orbd -ORBInitialPort
1050&amp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From an MS-DOS system prompt
(Windows), enter:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start orbd -ORBInitialPort
1050</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now that ORBD is running, you
can run your server and client applications. When running
the client and server applications, they must be made aware
of the port number (and <br>
machine name, when applicable) where the Naming Service is
running. One way to do this is to add the following code to
your application:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Properties props = new
Properties(); <br>
props.put(&quot;org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialPort&quot;,
&quot;1050&quot;); <br>
props.put(&quot;org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialHost&quot;,
&quot;MyHost&quot;); <br>
ORB orb = ORB.init(args, props);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, the naming
service is running on port 1050 on host MyHost. Another way
is to specify the port number and/or machine name when
running the server or client <br>
application from the command line. For example, you would
start your HelloApplication with the following command
line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">java HelloApplication
-ORBInitialPort 1050 -ORBInitialHost MyHost</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To stop the naming service, use
the relevant operating system command, such as pkillorbd on
Oracle Solaris, or Ctrl+C in the DOS window in which orbd is
running. Note that names <br>
registered with the naming service can disappear when the
service is terminated because of a transient naming service.
The Java IDL naming service will run until it is explicitly
<br>
stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information about the
naming service included with ORBD, see Naming Service at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/idl/jidlNaming.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SERVER MANAGER <br>
To access the ORBD Server Manager and run a persistent
server, the server must be started with servertool, which is
a command-line interface for application programmers to <br>
register, unregister, start up, and shut down a persistent
server. When a server is started using servertool, it must
be started on the same host and port on which orbd is <br>
executing. If the server is run on a different port, then
the information stored in the database for local contexts
will be invalid and the service will not work properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See Java IDL: The &quot;Hello
World&quot; Example at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/idl/jidlExample.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, you run the
idlj compiler and javac compiler as shown in the tutorial.
To run the ORBD Server Manager, follow these steps for
running the application:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Start orbd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNIX command shell, enter: orbd
-ORBInitialPort 1050.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MS-DOS system prompt (Windows),
enter: start orbd -ORBInitialPort 1050.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Port 1050 is the port on which
you want the name server to run. The -ORBInitialPort option
is a required command-line argument. When using Oracle
Solaris software, you must <br>
become a root user to start a process on a port below 1024.
For this reason, it is recommended that you use a port
number above or equal to 1024.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Start the servertool: servertool
-ORBInitialPort 1050.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make sure the name server (orbd)
port is the same as in the previous step, for example,
-ORBInitialPort 1050. The servertool must be started on the
same port as the name server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the servertool command line
interface, start the Hello server from the servertool
prompt:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">servertool &gt; register -server
HelloServer -classpath . -applicationName <br>
HelloServerApName</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The servertool registers the
server, assigns it the name HelloServerApName, and displays
its server ID with a listing of all registered servers.Run
the client application from <br>
another terminal window or prompt:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">java HelloClient -ORBInitialPort
1050 -ORBInitialHost localhost</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For this example, you can omit
-ORBInitialHost localhost because the name server is running
on the same host as the Hello client. If the name server is
running on a different <br>
host, then use the -ORBInitialHost nameserverhost option to
specify the host on which the IDL name server is
running.Specify the name server (orbd) port as done in the
previous <br>
step, for example, -ORBInitialPort 1050. When you finish
experimenting with the ORBD Server Manager, be sure to shut
down or terminate the name server (orbd) and servertool. To
<br>
shut down orbd from am MS-DOS prompt, select the window that
is running the server and enter Ctrl+C to shut it down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To shut down orbd from an Oracle
Solaris shell, find the process, and terminate with the kill
command. The server continues to wait for invocations until
it is explicitly <br>
stopped. To shut down the servertool, type quit and press
the Enter key.</p>
