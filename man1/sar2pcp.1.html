<p>SAR2PCP(1) General Commands Manual SAR2PCP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sar2pcp - import sar data and create a PCP archive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sar2pcp infile outfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
sar2pcp is intended to read a binary System Activity
Reporting (sar) data file as created by sadc(1) (infile) and
translate this into a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive
with <br>
the basename outfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if infile has the
suffix .xml, then it will be considered already in XML
format and sar2pcp will operate directly on it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The resultant PCP achive may be
used with all the PCP client tools to graph subsets of the
data using pmchart(1), perform data reduction and reporting,
filter with the PCP infer&acirc; <br>
ence engine pmie(1), etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A series of physical files will
be created with the prefix outfile. These are outfile.0 (the
performance data), outfile.meta (the metadata that describes
the performance data) <br>
and outfile.index (a temporal index to improve efficiency of
replay operations for the archive). If any of these files
exists already, then sar2pcp will not overwrite them and
<br>
will exit with an error message of the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">__pmLogNewFile: blah.0 already
exists, not over-written</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sar2pcp is a Perl script that
uses the PCP::LogImport Perl wrapper around the PCP
libpcp_import library, and as such could be used as an
example to develop new tools to import <br>
other types of performance data and create PCP archives. A
Python wrapper module is also available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
When not using the XML input option, sar2pcp requires infile
to have been created by a version of sadc(1) from
&lt;http://sebastien.godard.pagesperso-orange.fr/&gt; which
includes the <br>
sadf(1) utility to translate infile into an XML stream (any
since version 6); sar2pcp will automatically run sadf(1) and
translate the resultant XML into a PCP archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using binary sadc files it
is important to ensure the installed sadf is compatible with
the version of sadc that originally generated the binary
files. Simply assuming a <br>
newer installed version will work is unfortunately far too
optimistic, and nor should one assume that binary data from
different platforms (e.g. different endianness) will work -
<br>
these issues are due to limitations in sadc and sadf, and
not in sar2pcp itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fortunately, the sadf message
indicating that an incompatibility has been detected is
consistent across versions, and is always prefixed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid system activity file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using an XML infile has the
advantage that the installed version of sadf is completely
bypassed. sar2pcp undertakes to transform any valid XML
produced by any of the different <br>
variations of sadf into a valid PCP archive. Any version of
PCP will be able to interpret the archive files produced by
any version of sar2pcp, and you are also free to move the
<br>
binary PCP archive between different platforms, different
hardware, even different operating systems - it Just Works
(TM).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
