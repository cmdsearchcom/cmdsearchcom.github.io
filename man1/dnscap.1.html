<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dnscap &acirc; DNS network traffic capture utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dnscap [-pd1g?6fT] [-i if ...] [-r file ...] [-l vlan ...]
[-L vlan ...] [-x pat ...] [-X pat ...] [-m [qun]] [-s [ir]]
[-h [ir]] [-e [nytfsxir]] [-a host ...] [-z host ...] <br>
[-A host ...] [-Z host ...] [-Y host ...] [-u port] [-w base
[-k cmd]] [-t lim] [-c lim]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dnscap is a network capture utility designed specifically
for DNS traffic. It normally produces binary data in pcap(3)
format, either on standard output or in successive dump <br>
files (based on the -w command line option). This utility is
similar to tcpdump(1), but has finer grained packet
recognition tailored to DNS transactions and protocol
options. <br>
dnscap is expected to be used for gathering continuous
research or audit traces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Asks that the interface not
be put into promiscuous mode. Note that even without this
option, the interface could be in promiscuous mode for some
other reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Tells a verbose story of
options and patterns chosen, files opened, and so on.
(Multiple -d options can be given to increase verbosity and
frequency of trace mes&acirc; <br>
sages.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 Flush the pcap(3) packet dump
after every packet. Mostly this is useful when the packet
dump is standard output, and has been piped to
tcpdump(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Produce output on diagnostic
output, showing the presentation form of DNS messages which
passed through all of the filters. If -w is also used, then
every message will <br>
be dumped in both binary and presentation form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? Prints some text to stdout
describing the command line options, so that you won&rsquo;t
have to refer back to this man page as often. Probably you
will have to say &quot;- get this option past your
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Suppress the use of packet
filter patterns that are known (as of 2007) to cause
problems when processing IPv6 packets. Recommended when IPv6
traffic is expected to be <br>
present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Selects fragments (which
could include unrelated flows since fragments do not contain
port numbers), and includes fragments in the binary output.
Necessary if you <br>
intend to do IP Reassembly. Note that all fragments will be
collected, not just those using the DNS port number, since
fragments don&rsquo;t have port numbers. Beware this <br>
option if you also handle a lot of NFS traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Selects TCP packets. SYN,
FIN, and RST packets are collected if they pass the layer 2,
port, and host filters (although hosts need not be in the
correct direction); <br>
they are not tested against filter options that require a
DNS header such as -m, -s, and -e. The first DNS header in
the stream is captured if it passes all filter <br>
options. All subsequent non-empty packets in the stream,
regardless of DNS message boundaries, will be captured if
and only if the first DNS header passed all filter <br>
options. TCP packets will usually not be printable with
-g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i if Select an interface to be
monitored. On BSD systems, the default is the first
interface that was configured at system boot time. On Linux
systems, the default is to <br>
monitor all interfaces. More than one interface may be
selected which will cause output to be interleaved from all
selected interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r file Select an offline
pcap(3) file produced by this utility or by tcpdump(1) as
the input packet source. Can be given as &quot;-&quot; to
indicate standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l vlan Captures only 802.1Q
encapsulated packets, and selects specific vlans to be
monitored. Can be specified more than once to select
multiple vlans. -l 0 means &quot;all <br>
vlans&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L vlan Captures 802.1Q
encapsulated packets matching the specified vlans AND
packets without VLAN tags. Can be specified more than one to
select multiple vlans. -L 0 means <br>
&quot;all vlans&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u port Capture only packets on
this UDP port, and treat as DNS traffic. The default port is
53. Note that there is no way to select multiple UDP ports,
as would be necessary <br>
to capture both DNS (port 53) and mDNS (port 5353)
traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x pat If one or more -x options
are provided, then DNS messages will only be selected if the
printable representation of the QNAME or any RR matches at
least one of the pro&acirc; <br>
vided pat patterns. See regex(3) and re_format(7) for more
information about extended regular expression syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X pat If one or more -X options
are provided, then DNS messages matching these patterns will
not be selected. See the description of -x above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m [qun] Capture only messages
of designated types (query, update, and notify). Default is
query.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s [ir] Select messages which
are initiations and/or responses. Default is both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h [ir] Hide initiator or
responder of each captured transaction. Hiding an initiator
means wiping out the address and port number. Hiding a
responder means to wipe out the <br>
address only. This wiping occurs on the copy of the packet
sent to the pcap(3) dump output, and both the IP and UDP
checksums will be recomputed in that case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e [nytfsxir] <br>
Among responses, consider nonzero DNS TC or DNS RCODE to
indicate an error, and select only responses which do not
have (n), or which have (y), these conditions. The <br>
default is to only select nonerrors among responses. If both
nonerror and error responses are to be selected, specify
both the n and y options here. To be more spe&acirc; <br>
cific, use one or more condition-specific options, as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n no error <br>
y some error <br>
t truncated response (TC bit) <br>
f format error (rcode 1) <br>
s server failure (rcode 2) <br>
x no such name (rcode 3) <br>
i not implemented (rcode 4) <br>
r refusal (rcode 5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a host Capture only
transactions having these initiators. Can be specified more
than once to select multiple initiators. If a host name is
used, then all of that host&rsquo;s <br>
addresses whether IPv4 or IPv6 are added to the recognition
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z host Capture only
transactions having these responders. Can be specified more
than once to select multiple responders. If a host name is
used, then all of that host&rsquo;s <br>
addresses whether IPv4 or IPv6 are added to the recognition
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A host Capture only
transactions NOT having these initiators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z host Capture only
transactions NOT having these responders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y host Drop responses having
these responders. Similar to -Z in spirit. However, -Y
applies only to responses and does not cause any additions
to the BPF filter string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w base Dump the captured
packets to successive binary files in pcap(3) format with
DLT_RAW datalink type. Each file will have a name like
&quot;%s.%u.%06u&quot; where %s is base, %u is <br>
the time in seconds, and %06u is the time in microseconds.
The argument &quot;-&quot; may be given to send the binary
output to standard output. In that case, the -c and -t <br>
options affect the total duration of the capture, and not
merely the size and time limits of each individual dump
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k cmd After each dump file
specified by -w is closed, this command will be executed in
a nonblocking subprocess with the file name as its one
argument. It&rsquo;s expected that <br>
this command will be a shell script that submits the
finished file to a batch processing analytics system. Note
that without -k, the program will exit at the first <br>
output closure due to -c or -t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t lim By default, dnscap will
close its packet dump file only when interrupted. A time
limit can be specified with the -t option. When writing to a
file, the packet dump <br>
file will be closed when time() % lim is zero and the first
file will usually be shorter than lim seconds. If the packet
dump file is standard output, then after clos&acirc; <br>
ing this file, dnscap exits. This option is inclusive with
-c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c lim By default, dnscap will
close its packet dump file only when interrupted. A dump
file size, measured in packets, can be specified with the -c
option. If the packet <br>
dump file is standard output, then after closing this file,
dnscap exits. This option is inclusive with -t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B datetime <br>
When using -w, the -B option tells dnscap to start
collecting at a specific time. datetime should be specified
as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. The program will sleep(3) until <br>
the start time, and then begin capturing packets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E datetime <br>
When using -w and -t, the -E option tells dnscap to stop
collecting at a specific time. datetime should be specified
as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. The program will exit <br>
when it sees a packet with timestamp greater than
datetime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Causes dnscap to print
pcap_stats() counters on stderr when -t or -c limits are
reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If started with no options,
dnscap will exit with a complaint that without either the -w
or -g options, it&rsquo;s pointless to run the program at
all. In its simplest form, the output <br>
can be piped to tcpdump(1) as in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dnscap -w - | tcpdump -r -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can safely add the -d option
since the output resulting from -d goes to diagnostic output
rather than standard output. And since everybody who&rsquo;s
anybody always uses the -n <br>
option to tcpdump(1), the minimum useful incantation is
probably:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dnscap -w - | tcpdump -r -
-n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The more interesting use for
dnscap is long term or continuous data collection. Assuming
a shell script called dnscap-upload whose function is to
transfer a pcap(3) - format file <br>
to an analytics system and then remove the local copy of it,
then a name server operating system startup could invoke
dnscap for continuous DNS auditing using a command like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dnscap -m qun -h i -r
f.root-servers.net -b /var/local/dnscaps/f-root -t 1800 -k
/usr/local/sbin/dnscap-upload</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A bizarre but actual example
which combines almost all features of dnscap is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dnscap -d -w - -1 -i em0 -l 0 -x
^7 | dnscap -d -r - -X spamhaus -g -l 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here, we&rsquo;re looking for
all messages having a QNAME or RR beginning with the decimal
digit &quot;7&quot;, but we don&rsquo;t want to see anything
containing &quot;spamhaus&quot;. The interface is tagged,
<br>
and since only one interface is selected, the output stream
from the first dnscap will also be tagged, thus we need -l 0
on both dnscap commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY NOTES <br>
If dnscap produces no output, it&rsquo;s probably due to
some kind of bug in your kernel&rsquo;s bpf(4) module or in
your pcap(3) library. You may need the -6 or -l 0 options.
To diagnose <br>
your way out of &quot;no output&quot; hell, use the -d and
-g options to find out what BPF program is being internally
generated, and then cut/paste this BPF program onto a
tcpdump(1) com&acirc; <br>
mand line to see if it likewise produces no output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The dnscap utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error
occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
dnscap was written by Paul Vixie (ISC) with help from Duane
Wessels, Kevin Brintnall, and others too numerous to
mention.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Ought to handle fragmented UDP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ought to be re-implented as a
ncap client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Too many design botches within
bpf(4) and pcap(3) are made visible to the user of this
utility.</p>
