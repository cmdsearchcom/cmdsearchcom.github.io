<p>mlton(1) General Commands Manual mlton(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mlton - whole-program compiler for the Standard ML (SML)
programming language</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mlton [option ...] file.{c|mlb|o|sml} [file.{c|o|s|S}
...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
MLton is run from the command line with a collection of
options followed by a file name and a list of files with
which to compile, assemble, and link with. The simplest case
is <br>
to run mlton foo.sml, where foo.sml contains a valid SML
program, in which case MLton compiles the program to produce
an executable foo. Since MLton does not support separate
<br>
compilation, the program must be the entire program you wish
to compile. However, the program may refer to signatures and
structures defined in the Basis Library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Larger programs, spanning many
files, may be compiled with the ML Basis system. In this
case, mlton foo.mlb will compile the complete SML program
described by the basis foo.mlb, <br>
which may specify both SML files and additional bases. See
the MLton Guide for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MLton&rsquo;s compile-time
options control the name of the output file, the verbosity
of compile-time messages, and whether or not certain
optimizations are performed. They also can <br>
specify which intermediate files are saved and can stop the
compilation process early, at some intermediate pass, in
which case compilation can be resumed by passing the
gener&acirc; <br>
ated files to MLton. MLton uses the input file suffix to
determine the type of input program. The possibilities are
.c, .mlb, .o, .s, and .sml.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With no arguments, MLton prints
the version number and exits. For a usage message, run MLton
with an invalid switch, e.g. mlton -z. In the explanation
below and in the usage <br>
message, for flags that take a number of choices (e.g.
{true|false}), the first value listed is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compile-time options <br>
-align n <br>
Aligns objects in memory by the specified alignment (4 or
8). The default varies depending on architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-as-opt option <br>
Pass option to gcc when compiling assembler code. If you
wish to pass an option to the assembler, you must use
gcc&rsquo;s -Wa, syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cc-opt option <br>
Pass option to gcc when compiling C code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-codegen {native|x86|amd64|c}
<br>
Generate native code or C code. With -codegen native
(-codegen x86 or -codegen amd64), MLton typically compiles
more quickly and generates better code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-const &rsquo;name value&rsquo;
<br>
Set the value of a compile-time constant. Here is a list of
available constants, their default values, and what they
control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exn.keepHistory {false|true}
<br>
Enable MLton.Exn.history. There is a performance cost to
setting this to true, both in memory usage of exceptions and
in run time, because of additional work that <br>
must be performed at each exception construction, raise, and
handle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-default-ann ann <br>
Specify default ML Basis annotations. For example,
-default-ann &rsquo;warnUnused true&rsquo; causes unused
variable warnings to be enabled by default. Defaults may be
overridden by <br>
an annotation in an ML Basis file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-default-type type <br>
Specify the default binding for a primitive type. For
example, -default-type word64 causes the top-level type word
and the top-level structure Word in the Basis Library <br>
to be equal to Word64.word and Word64:WORD, respectively.
Similarly, -default-type intinf causes the top-level type
int and the top-level structure Int in the Basis <br>
Library to be equal to IntInf.int and IntInf:INTEGER,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-disable-ann ann <br>
Ignore the specified ML Basis annotation in every ML Basis
File. For example, to see all match and unused warnings,
compile with -default-ann &rsquo;warnUnused true&rsquo;,
-dis&acirc; <br>
able-ann forceUsed, -disable-ann nonexhaustiveMatch,
-disable-ann redundantMatch, and -disable-ann
warnUnused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-export-header file <br>
Write C prototypes to file for all of the functions in the
program exported from SML to C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ieee-fp {false|true} <br>
Cause the x86 native code generator to be pedantic about
following the IEEE floating point standard. By default, it
is not, because of the performance cost. This only <br>
has an effect with -codegen x86.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-inline n <br>
Set the inlining threshold used in the optimizer. The
threshold is an approximate measure of code size of a
procedure. The default is 320.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keep {g|o} <br>
Save intermediate files. If no -keep argument is given, then
only the output file is saved. <br>
g generated .c and .s files passed to gcc <br>
o object (.o) files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-link-opt option <br>
Pass option to gcc when linking. You can use this to specify
library search paths, e.g. -link-opt -Lpath, and libraries
to link with, e.g. -link-opt -lfoo, or even both <br>
at the same time, e.g. -link-opt &rsquo;-Lpath -lfoo&rsquo;.
If you wish to pass an option to the linker, you must use
gcc&rsquo;s -Wl, syntax, e.g., -link-opt
&rsquo;-Wl,--export-dynamic&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlb-path-map file <br>
Use file as an ML Basis path map to define additional MLB
path variables. Multiple uses of -mlb-path-map and
-mlb-path-var are allowed, with variable definitions in
later <br>
path maps taking precedence over earlier ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlb-path-var &rsquo;name
value&rsquo; <br>
Define an additional MLB path variable. Multiple uses of
-mlb-path-map and -mlb-path-var are allowed, with variable
definitions in later path maps taking precedence over <br>
earlier ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-output file <br>
Specify the name of the final output file. The default name
is the input file name with its suffix removed and an
appropriate, possibly empty, suffix added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-profile {no|alloc|count|time}
<br>
Produce an executable that gathers profiling data. When such
an executable is run, it will produce an mlmon.out file. The
man page on mlprof describes how to extract <br>
information from this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-profile-branch {false|true}
<br>
If true, the profiler will separately gather profiling data
for each branch of a function definition, case expression,
and if expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-profile-stack {false|true} <br>
If true, the profiler will gather profiling data for all
functions on the stack, not just the currently executing
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-profile-val {false|true} <br>
If true, the profiler will separately gather profiling data
for each (expansive) val declaration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-runtime arg <br>
Pass argument to the runtime system via @MLton. The argument
will be processed before other @MLton command line switches.
Multiple uses of -runtime are allowed, and will <br>
pass all the arguments in order. If the same runtime switch
occurs more than once, then the last setting will take
effect. There is no need to supply the leading @MLton <br>
or the trailing --; these will be supplied
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An argument to -runtime may
contain spaces, which will cause the argument to be treated
as a sequence of words by the runtime. For example, the
command line: <br>
mlton -runtime &rsquo;ram-slop 0.4&rsquo; foo.sml <br>
will cause foo to run as if it had been called like <br>
foo @MLton ram-slop 0.4 --</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An executable created with
-runtime stop doesn&rsquo;t process any @MLton arguments.
This is useful to create an executable, e.g. echo, that must
treat @MLton like any other <br>
command-line argument. <br>
% mlton -runtime stop echo.sml <br>
% echo @MLton -- <br>
@MLton --</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-show-basis file <br>
Pretty print to file the basis defined by the input
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-show-def-use file <br>
Output def-use information to file. Each identifier that is
defined appears on a line, followed on subsequent lines by
the position of each use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stop {f|g|o|tc} <br>
Specify when to stop. <br>
f list of files on stdout (only makes sense when input is
foo.mlb) <br>
g generated .c and .s files <br>
o object (.o) files <br>
tc after type checking <br>
If you compile -stop g or -stop o, you can resume
compilation by running MLton on the generated .c and .s or
.o files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-target {self|...} <br>
Generate an executable that runs on the specified platform.
The default is self, which means to compile for the machine
that MLton is running on. To use any other tar&acirc; <br>
get, you must first install a cross compiler. See the MLton
Guide for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-target-as-opt target option
<br>
Like -as-opt, this passes option to gcc when assembling,
except it only passes option when the target architecture or
operating system is target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-target-cc-opt target option
<br>
Like -cc-opt, this passes option to gcc when compiling C
code, except it only passes option when the target
architecture or operating system is target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-target-link-opt target option
<br>
Like -link-opt, this passes option to gcc when linking,
except it only passes option when the target architecture or
operating system is target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose {0|1|2|3} <br>
How verbose to be about what passes are running. The default
is 0. <br>
0 silent <br>
1 calls to compiler, assembler, and linker <br>
2 1, plus intermediate compiler passes <br>
3 2, plus some data structure sizes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Runtime system options <br>
Executables produced by MLton take command line arguments
that control the runtime system. These arguments are
optional, and occur before the executable&rsquo;s usual
arguments. To <br>
use these options, the first argument to the executable must
be @MLton. The optional arguments then follow, must be
terminated by --, and are followed by any arguments to the
<br>
program. The optional arguments are not made available to
the SML program via CommandLine.arguments. For example, a
valid call to hello-world is: <br>
hello-world @MLton gc-summary fixed-heap 10k -- a b c <br>
In the above example, CommandLine.arguments () =
[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is allowed to have a sequence
of @MLton arguments, as in: <br>
hello-world @MLton gc-summary -- @MLton fixed-heap 10k -- a
b c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run-time options can also
control MLton, as in <br>
mlton @MLton fixed-heap 0.5g -- foo.sml</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fixed-heap x{k|K|m|M|g|G} <br>
Use a fixed size heap of size x, where x is a real number
and the trailing letter indicates its units. <br>
k or K 1024 <br>
m or M 1,048,576 <br>
g or G 1,073,741,824 <br>
A value of 0 means to use almost all the RAM present on the
machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The heap size used by fixed-heap
includes all memory allocated by SML code, including memory
for the stack (or stacks, if there are multiple threads). It
does not, how&acirc; <br>
ever, include any memory used for code itself or memory used
by C globals, the C stack, or malloc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gc-messages <br>
Print a message at the start and end of every garbage
collection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gc-summary <br>
Print a summary of garbage collection statistics upon
program termination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load-world world <br>
Restart the computation with the file specified by world,
which must have been created by a call to MLton.World.save
by the same executable. See the MLton Guide for <br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-heap x{k|K|m|M|g|G} <br>
Run the computation with an automatically resized heap that
is never larger than x, where x is a real number and the
trailing letter indicates the units as with <br>
fixed-heap. The heap size for max-heap is accounted for as
with fixed-heap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">may-page-heap {false|true} <br>
Enable paging the heap to disk when unable to grow the heap
to a desired size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no-load-world <br>
Disable load-world. This can be used as an argument to the
compiler via -runtime no-load-world to create executables
that will not load a world. This may be useful to <br>
ensure that set-uid executables do not load some strange
world.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ram-slop x <br>
Multiply x by the amount of RAM on the machine to obtain
what the runtime views as the amount of RAM it can use.
Typically x is less than 1, and is used to account for <br>
space used by other programs running on the same
machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop Causes the runtime to stop
processing @MLton arguments once the next -- is reached.
This can be used as an argument to the compiler via -runtime
stop to create executa&acirc; <br>
bles that don&rsquo;t process any @MLton arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
MLton&rsquo;s type error messages are not in a form suitable
for processing by Emacs. For details on how to fix this, see
http://mlton.org/Emacs.</p>
