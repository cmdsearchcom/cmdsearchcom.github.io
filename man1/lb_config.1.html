<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
lb config is a high-level command (porcelain) of
live-build(7), the live systems tool suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lb config populates the
configuration directory for live-build. By default, this
directory is named &rsquo;config&rsquo; and is created in
the current directory where lb config was executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Currently lb config tries
to be smart and sets defaults for some options depending on
the setting of other options (e.g. which linux packages to
be used depending on if a <br>
wheezy system gets build or not). This means that when
generating a new configuration, you should call lb config
only once with all options specified. Calling it several
times <br>
with only a subset of the options each can result in non
working configurations. This is also caused by the fact that
lb config called with one option only changes that option,
<br>
and leaves everything else as is unless its not defined.
However, lb config does warn about know impossible or likely
impossible combinations that would lead to non working live
<br>
systems. If unsure, remove
config/{binary,bootstrap,chroot,common,source} and call lb
config again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
In addition to its specific options lb config understands
all generic live-build options. See live-build(7) for a
complete list of all generic live-build options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--apt-ftp-proxy URL <br>
sets the ftp proxy to be used by apt. By default, this is
empty. Note that this variable is only for the proxy that
gets used by apt internally within the chroot, it is not
<br>
used for anything else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--apt-http-proxy URL <br>
sets the http proxy to be used by apt. By default, this is
empty. Note that this variable is only for the proxy that
gets used by apt internally within the chroot, it is not
<br>
used for anything else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--apt-indices true|false|none
<br>
defines if the resulting images should have apt indices or
not and defaults to true. If set to none, no indices are
included at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--apt-options
OPTION|&quot;OPTIONS&quot; <br>
defines the default options that will be appended to every
apt call that is made inside chroot during the building of
the image. By default, this is set to --yes to allow <br>
non-interactive installation of packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--apt-pipeline DEPTH <br>
sets the depth of the apt pipeline. In cases where the
remote server is not RFC conforming or buggy (such as Squid
2.0.2) this option can be a value from 0 to 5 indicating
<br>
how many outstanding requests APT should send. A value of
zero MUST be specified if the remote host does not properly
linger on TCP connections - otherwise data corruption <br>
will occur. Hosts which require this are in violation of RFC
2068. By default, live-build does not set this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--apt-recommends true|false <br>
defines if apt should install recommended packages
automatically. By default, this is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--apt-secure true|false <br>
defines if apt should check repository signatures. This is
true by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--apt-source-archives true|false
<br>
defines if deb-src entries should be included in the
resulting live image or not, defaults to true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a|--architectures ARCHITECTURE
<br>
defines the architecture of the to be build image. By
default, this is set to the host architecture. Note that you
cannot crossbuild for another architecture if your host <br>
system is not able to execute binaries for the target
architecture natively. For example, building amd64 images on
i386 and vice versa is possible if you have a 64bit capable
<br>
i386 processor and the right kernel. But building powerpc
images on an i386 system is not possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b|--binary-images
iso|iso-hybrid|netboot|tar|hdd <br>
defines the image type to build. By default, for images
using syslinux this is set to iso-hybrid to build CD/DVD
images that may also be used like hdd images, for
non-sys&acirc; <br>
linux images, it defaults to iso.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--binary-filesystem
fat16|fat32|ext2|ext3|ext4 <br>
defines the filesystem to be used in the image type. This
only has an effect if the selected binary image type does
allow to choose a filesystem. For example, when selection
<br>
iso the resulting CD/DVD has always the filesystem ISO9660.
When building hdd images for usb sticks, this is active.
Note that it defaults to fat16 on all architectures <br>
except sparc where it defaults to ext4. Also note that if
you choose fat16 and your resulting binary image gets bigger
than 2GB, the binary filesystem automatically gets <br>
switched to fat32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bootappend-install
PARAMETER|&quot;PARAMETERS&quot; <br>
sets boot parameters specific to debian-installer, if
included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bootappend-live
PARAMETER|&quot;PARAMETERS&quot; <br>
sets boot parameters specific to debian-live. A complete
list of boot parameters can be found in the live-boot(7) and
live-config(7) manual pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bootloader grub|grub2|syslinux
<br>
defines which bootloader is being used in the generated
image. This has only an effect if the selected binary image
type does allow to choose the bootloader. For example, if
<br>
you build a iso, always syslinux (or more precise, isolinux)
is being used. Also note that some combinations of binary
images types and bootloaders may be possible but <br>
live-build does not support them yet. lb config will fail to
create such a not yet supported configuration and give a
explanation about it. For hdd images on amd64 and i386, <br>
the default is syslinux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cache true|false <br>
defines globally if any cache should be used at all.
Different caches can be controlled through the their own
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cache-indices true|false <br>
defines if downloaded package indices and lists should be
cached which is false by default. Enabling it would allow to
rebuild an image completely offline, however, you would <br>
not get updates anymore then.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cache-packages true|false <br>
defines if downloaded packages files should be cached which
is true by default. Disabling it does save space consumption
in your build directory, but remember that you will <br>
cause much unnecessary traffic if you do a couple of
rebuilds. In general you should always leave it true,
however, in some particular rare build setups, it can be
faster to <br>
refetch packages from the local network mirror rather than
to utilize the local disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cache-stages
true|false|STAGE|&quot;STAGES&quot; <br>
sets which stages should be cached. By default set to
bootstrap. As an exception to the normal stage names, also
rootfs can be used here which does only cache the generated
<br>
root filesystem in filesystem.{dir,ext*,squashfs}. This is
useful during development if you want to rebuild the binary
stage but not regenerate the root filesystem all the <br>
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--checksums md5|sha1|sha256|none
<br>
defines if the binary image should contain a file called
md5sums.txt, sha1sums.txt and/or sha256sums.txt. These lists
all files on the image together with their checksums. <br>
This in turn can be used by live-boot&rsquo;s built-in
integrity-check to verify the medium if specified at boot
prompt. In general, this should not be false and is an
important <br>
feature of live system released to the public. However,
during development of very big images it can save some time
by not calculating the checksums.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--compression
bzip2|gzip|lzip|none <br>
defines the compression program to be used to compress
tarballs. Defaults to gzip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config GIT_URL::GIT_ID <br>
allows to bootstrap a config tree from a git repositories,
optionally appended by a Git Id (branch, commit, tag,
etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--build-with-chroot true|false
<br>
defines whether live-build should use the tools from within
the chroot to build the binary image or not by using and
including the host system&rsquo;s tools. This is a very
danger&acirc; <br>
ous option, using the tools of the host system can lead to
tainted and even non-bootable images if the host systems
version of the required tools (mainly these are the
boot&acirc; <br>
loaders such as syslinux and grub, and the auxiliary tools
such as dosfstools, xorriso, squashfs-tools and others) do
not exactly match what is present at build-time in the <br>
target distribution. Never do disable this option unless you
are exactly sure what you are doing and have completely
understood its consequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--chroot-filesystem
ext2|ext3|ext4|squashfs|jffs2|none <br>
defines which filesystem type should be used for the root
filesystem image. If you use none, then no filesystem image
is created and the root filesystem content is copied on <br>
the binary image filesystem as flat files. Depending on what
binary filesystem you have chosen, it may not be possible to
build with such a plain root filesystem, e.g. <br>
fat16/fat32 will not work as linux does not support to run
directly on them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--clean <br>
minimizes config directory by automatically removing unused
and thus empty subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c|--conffile FILE <br>
using a user specified alternative configuration file in
addition to the normally used one in the config
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debconf-frontend
dialog|editor|noninteractive|readline <br>
defines what value the debconf frontend should be set to
inside the chroot. Note that setting it to anything but
noninteractive, which is the default, makes your build
asking <br>
questions during the build.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debconf-priority
low|medium|high|critical <br>
defines what value the debconf priority should be set to
inside the chroot. By default, it is set to critical, which
means that almost no questions are displayed. Note that <br>
this only has an effect if you use any debconf frontend
different from noninteractive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debian-installer
true|cdrom|netinst|netboot|businesscard|live|false <br>
defines which type, if any, of the debian-installer should
be included in the resulting binary image. By default, no
installer is included. All available flavours except live
<br>
are the identical configurations used on the installer media
produced by regular debian-cd. When live is chosen, the
live-installer udeb is included so that debian-installer
<br>
will behave different than usual - instead of installing the
debian system from packages from the medium or the network,
it installs the live system to the disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debian-installer-distribution
daily|CODENAME <br>
defines the distribution where the debian-installer files
should be taken out from. Normally, this should be set to
the same distribution as the live system. However, some <br>
times, one wants to use a newer or even daily built
installer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debian-installer-preseedfile
FILE|URL <br>
sets the filename or URL for an optionally used and included
preseeding file for debian-installer. If
config/binary_debian-installer/preseed.cfg exists, it will
be used by <br>
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debian-installer-gui
true|false <br>
defines if the debian-installer graphical GTK interface
should be true or not. In Debian mode and for most versions
of Ubuntu, this option is true, whereas otherwise false,
<br>
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
turn on debugging informational messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d|--distribution CODENAME <br>
defines the distribution of the resulting live system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d|--parent-distribution
CODENAME <br>
defines the parent distribution for derivatives of the
resulting live system.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d|--parent-debian-installer-distribution
CODENAME <br>
defines the parent debian-installer distribution for
derivatives of the resulting live system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dump <br>
prepares a report of the currently present live system
configuration and the version of live-build used. This is
useful to provide if you submit bug reports, we do get all
<br>
informations required for us to locate and replicate an
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fdisk fdisk|fdisk.dist <br>
sets the filename of the fdisk binary from the host system
that should be used. This is autodetected and does generally
not need any customization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force <br>
forces re-execution of already run stages. Use only if you
know what you are doing. It is generally safer to use lb
clean to clean up before re-executing lb build.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--grub-splash FILE <br>
defines the name of an optional to be included splash screen
graphic for the grub bootloader.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gzip-options
OPTION|&quot;OPTIONS&quot; <br>
defines the default options that will be appended to
(almost) every gzip call during the building of the image.
By default, this is set to --best to use highest (but
slowest) <br>
compression. Dynamically, if the host system supports it,
also --rsyncable is added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hooks FILE <br>
defines which hooks available in
/usr/share/live/build/examples/hooks should be activated.
Normally, there are no hooks executed. Make sure you know
and understood the hook <br>
before you enable it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-system-defaults <br>
lb config by default reads system defaults from
/etc/live/build.conf and /etc/live/build/* when generating a
new live system config directory. This is useful if you want
to <br>
set global settings, such as mirror locations, and
don&rsquo;t want to specify them all of the time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--initramfs
auto|none|live-boot|casper <br>
sets the name of package that contains the live system
specific initramfs modification. By default, auto is used,
which means that at build time of the image rather than on
<br>
configuration time, the value will be expanded to casper
when building ubuntu systems, to live-boot for all other
systems. Using &rsquo;none&rsquo; is useful if the resulting
system <br>
image should not be a live image (experimental).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--initramfs-compression
bzip2|gzip|lzma] <br>
defines the compression program to be used to compress the
initramfs. Defaults to gzip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--interactive shell <br>
defines if after the chroot stage and before the beginning
of the binary stage, a interactive shell login should be
spawned in the chroot in order to allow you to do manual
<br>
customizations. Once you close the shell with logout or
exit, the build will continue as usual. Note that it&rsquo;s
strongly discouraged to use this for anything else than
test&acirc; <br>
ing. Modifications that should be present in all builds of a
live system should be properly made through hooks.
Everything else destroys the beauty of being able to
com&acirc; <br>
pletely automatise the build process and making it non
interactive. By default, this is of course false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--isohybrid-options
OPTION|&quot;OPTIONS&quot; <br>
defines options to pass to isohybrid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--iso-application NAME <br>
sets the APPLICATION field in the header of a resulting
CD/DVD image and defaults to &quot;Debian Live&quot; in
debian mode, and &quot;Ubuntu Live&quot; in ubuntu mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--iso-preparer NAME <br>
sets the PREPARER field in the header of a resulting CD/DVD
image. By default this is set to &quot;live-build VERSION;
http://packages.qa.debian.org/live-build&quot;, where
VERSION is <br>
expanded to the version of live-build that was used to build
the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--iso-publisher NAME <br>
sets the PUBLISHED field in the header of a resulting CD/DVD
image. By default, this is set to &rsquo;Live Systems
project; http:/live-systems.org/;
debian-live@lists.debian.org&rsquo;. <br>
Remember to change this to the appropriate values at latest
when you distributing custom and unofficial images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--iso-volume NAME <br>
sets the VOLUME field in the header of a resulting CD/DVD
and defaults to &rsquo;(MODE) (DISTRIBUTION) (DATE)&rsquo;
whereas MODE is expanded to the name of the mode in use,
DISTRIBUTION <br>
the distribution name, and DATE with the current date and
time of the generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--jffs2-eraseblock SIZE <br>
sets the eraseblock size for a JFFS2 (Second Journaling
Flash File System) filesystem. The default is 64 KiB. If you
use an erase block size different than the erase block <br>
size of the target MTD device, JFFS2 may not perform
optimally. If the SIZE specified is below 4096, the units
are assumed to be KiB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keyring-packages
PACKAGE|&quot;PACKAGES&quot; <br>
sets the keyring package or additional keyring packages. By
default this is set to debian-archive-keyring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k|--linux-flavours
FLAVOUR|&quot;FLAVOURS&quot; <br>
sets the kernel flavours to be installed. Note that in case
you specify more than that the first will be configured the
default kernel that gets booted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--linux-packages
&quot;PACKAGES&quot; <br>
sets the internal name of the kernel packages naming scheme.
If you use debian kernel packages, you will not have to
adjust it. If you decide to use custom kernel packages <br>
that do not follow the debian naming scheme, remember to set
this option to the stub of the packages only (for debian
this is linux-image-2.6), so that STUB-FLAVOUR results <br>
in a valid package name (for debian e.g.
linux-image-686-pae). Preferably you use the meta package
name, if any, for the stub, so that your configuration is
ABI independent. <br>
Also don&rsquo;t forget that you have to include stubs of
the binary modules packages for unionfs or aufs, and
squashfs if you built them out-of-tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--losetup losetup|losetup.orig
<br>
sets the filename of the losetup binary from the host system
that should be used. This is autodetected and does generally
not need any customization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--memtest
memtest86+|memtest86|none <br>
defines if memtest, memtest86+ or no memory tester at all
should be included as secondary bootloader configuration.
This is only available on amd64 and i386 and defaults to
<br>
memtest86+.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m|--parent-mirror-bootstrap URL
<br>
sets the location of the debian package mirror that should
be used to bootstrap from. This defaults to
http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/ which may not be a good
default if you <br>
live outside of Europe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--parent-mirror-chroot URL <br>
sets the location of the debian package mirror that will be
used to fetch the packages in order to build the live
system. By default, this is set to the value of --par&acirc;
<br>
ent-mirror-bootstrap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--parent-mirror-chroot-security
URL <br>
sets the location of the debian security package mirror that
will be used to fetch the packages in order to build the
live system. By default, this points to http://secu&acirc;
<br>
rity.debian.org/debian/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--parent-mirror-chroot-updates
URL <br>
sets the location of the debian updates package mirror that
will be used to fetch packages in order to build the live
system. By default, this is set to the value of --par&acirc;
<br>
ent-mirror-chroot.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--parent-mirror-chroot-backports

Default is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quiet <br>
reduces the verbosity of messages output by lb build.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--archive-areas
ARCHIVE_AREA|&quot;ARCHIVE_AREAS&quot; <br>
defines which package archive areas of a debian packages
archive should be used for configured debian package
mirrors. By default, this is set to main. Remember to check
the <br>
licenses of each packages with respect to their
redistributability in your juristiction when enabling
contrib or non-free with this mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--source true|false <br>
defines if a corresponding source image to the binary image
should be build. By default this is false because most
people do not require this and would require to download
<br>
quite a few source packages. However, once you start
distributing your live image, you should make sure you build
it with a source image alongside.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s|--source-images
iso|netboot|tar|hdd <br>
defines the image type for the source image. Default is
tar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--firmware-binary true|false
<br>
defines if firmware packages should be automatically
included into the binary pool for debian-installer. Note
that only firmware packages available within the configured
ar&acirc; <br>
chive areas are included, e.g. an image with packages from
main only will not automatically include firmware from
non-free. This option does not interfere with explicitly
<br>
listed packages in binary package lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--firmware-chroot true|false
<br>
defines if firmware packages should be automatically
included into the live image. Note that only firmware
packages available within the configured archive areas are
<br>
included, e.g. an image with packages from main only will
not automatically include firmware from non-free. This
option does not interfere with explicitly listed packages in
<br>
chroot package lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--swap-file-path PATH <br>
defines the path to a swap file to create in the binary
image. Default is not to create a swap file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--swap-file-size MB <br>

/usr/share/live/build/templates/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hdd-size MB <br>
defines what size the hdd image should be. Note that
although the default is set to 10000 (= 10GB), it will not
need 10GB space on your harddisk as the files are created as
<br>
sparse files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--updates true|false <br>
defines if debian updates package archives should be
included in the image or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--backports true|false <br>
defines if debian backports package archives should be
included in the image or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--win32-loader true|false <br>
defines if win32-loader should be included in the binary
image or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Currently, command line switches can also be specified
through the corresponding environment variable. However,
this generally should not be relied upon, as it is an
implementa&acirc; <br>
tion detail that is subject to change in future releases.
For options applying directly to live-build, environment
variables are named LB_FOO, meaning, e.g. --apt-ftp-proxy
<br>
becomes LB_APT_FTP_PROXY (the exception being internal
options such as --debug). For options passed to another
program, as in APT_OPTIONS or GZIP_OPTIONS, no LB_ prefix is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
auto/config</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/live/build.conf,
/etc/live/build/* <br>
An optional, global configuration file for lb config
variables. It is useful to specify a few system wide
defaults, like LB_PARENT_MIRROR_BOOTSTRAP. This feature can
be false <br>
by specifying the --ignore-system-defaults option.</p>
