<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
creduce - C and C++ program reducer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
creduce 2.6.0 (b02c375) -- a C and C++ program reducer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-Reduce requires an
&quot;interestingness test&quot; and one or more files to
reduce, which must be writable. The interestingness test is
an executable program (usually a shell script) <br>
that returns 0 when a partially reduced file is interesting
(a candidate for further reduction) and returns non-zero
when a partially reduced file is not interesting (not a
can&acirc; <br>
didate for further reduction -- all uninteresting files are
discarded).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-Reduce runs the
interestingness test in a fresh temporary directory
containing only the partially reduced file(s). Thus, when
the interestingness test examines a partially <br>
reduced file, it must do so using a relative path to the
current working directory. On the other hand, when the
interestingness test refers to any file that is not being
reduced, <br>
this should be done using an absolute path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interestingness test should
be deterministic and should not expect any command line
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-Reduce can and does introduce
infinite loops during reduction. Therefore, if your
interestingness test runs the compiled program, this should
be done under a timeout. You can <br>
implement the timeout yourself, for example using the UNIX
&quot;timeout&quot; command, or alternatively you can give
C-Reduce a timeout (which is on by default, but is set very
long: 5 <br>
minutes). An advantage of using C-Reduce&rsquo;s timeout is
that when a test is killed due to timing out, a message will
be printed. If you do implement a timeout yourself, we
recom&acirc; <br>
mend that your interestingness test returns exit code 124
when a subcommand times out. This will not affect the
reduction but it will cause C-Reduce to print a message
stating <br>
the the interestingness test reported a timeout. It is
important to ensure that timeouts are not occurring too
often (especially during C-Reduce&rsquo;s initial passes) or
else <br>
C-Reduce will work poorly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a particularly subtle
issue regarding timeouts, which is that the interestingness
test may slow down due to resource contention when C-Reduce
runs multiple copies of it <br>
on different cores. We have observed slowdowns of up to 50%
due to (we suspect) cache thrashing. You must take this
slowdown into account when choosing a timeout or else
timeouts <br>
might occur very frequently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a quick example of an
interestingness test, if you consider a file to be
interesting if GCC&rsquo;s vectorizer fires while compiling
it, you might write this shell script:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -w -O3 foo.c -S &amp;&amp;
grep xmm foo.s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To see if your interestingness
test is working, try running these commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIR=&lsquo;mktemp -d&lsquo; cp
file_to_reduce [optionally, more files to reduce] $DIR cd
$DIR /path/to/interestingness_test echo $?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This should result in
&quot;0&quot; being echoed to the terminal. If this does not
happen, the interestingness test is flawed and C-Reduce
won&rsquo;t be able to make use of it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you haven&rsquo;t written an
interestingness test before, please refer to this tutorial
for additional guidance:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">https://embed.cs.utah.edu/creduce/using/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If at all possible, run C-Reduce
on preprocessed code, generated for example using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -E -P file.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you cannot reduce
preprocessed code, you can either reduce just the
non-preprocessed file or else perform a multi-file reduction
on the file and its transitive includes (or <br>
any subset of them). In the first case you need to set the
CREDUCE_INCLUDE_PATH environment variable to a
colonseparated list of include directories in order for
clang_delta to <br>
find them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your interestingness test
involves a cross compiler and the characteristics of the
cross target differs from the host you will need to set
CREDUCE_TARGET_TRIPLE to match the <br>
cross target. This is particularly important if you are
working with non-preprocessed code and use
CREDUCE_INCLUDE_PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Press &quot;s&quot; at any time
to skip to the next pass (this feature is disabled unless
the Perl module Term::ReadKey is available on your
system).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Summary of options: <br>
--abs-timing <br>

time</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--add-pass &lt;pass&gt;
&lt;sub-pass&gt; &lt;priority&gt; <br>
Add the specified pass to the schedule</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--also-interesting
&lt;exitcode&gt; <br>
A process exit code (somewhere in the range 64-113 would be
usual) that, when returned by the interestingness test, will
cause C-Reduce to save a copy of the variant <br>
[default: -1]</p>

transformation that C-Reduce should accept (useful only to
slow C-Reduce down)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--n &lt;N&gt; <br>
