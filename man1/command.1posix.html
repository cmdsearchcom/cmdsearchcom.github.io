<p>COMMAND(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
COMMAND(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
command &acirc; execute a simple command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
command [&acirc;p] command_name [argument...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command
[&acirc;p][&acirc;v|&acirc;V] command_name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The command utility shall cause the shell to treat the
arguments as a simple command, suppressing the shell
function lookup that is described in Section 2.9.1.1,
Command Search <br>
and Execution, item 1b.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the command_name is the same
as the name of one of the special built-in utilities, the
special properties in the enumerated list at the beginning
of Section 2.14, Special <br>
Built-In Utilities shall not occur. In every other respect,
if command_name is not the name of a function, the effect of
command (with no options) shall be the same as omitting <br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the &acirc;v or &acirc;V
option is used, the command utility shall provide
information concerning how a command name is interpreted by
the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The command utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;p Perform the command
search using a default value for PATH that is guaranteed to
find all of the standard utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;v Write a string to
standard output that indicates the pathname or command that
will be used by the shell, in the current shell execution
environment (see Section 2.12, <br>
Shell Execution Environment), to invoke command_name, but do
not invoke command_name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Utilities, regular built-in
utilities, command_names including a &lt;slash&gt;
character, and any implementation-defined functions that are
found using the PATH variable <br>
(as described in Section 2.9.1.1, Command Search and
Execution), shall be written as absolute pathnames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Shell functions, special
built-in utilities, regular built-in utilities not
associated with a PATH search, and shell reserved words
shall be written as just their <br>
names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* An alias shall be written as a
command line that represents its alias definition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Otherwise, no output shall be
written and the exit status shall reflect that the name was
not found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;V Write a string to
standard output that indicates how the name given in the
command_name operand will be interpreted by the shell, in
the current shell execution envi&acirc; <br>
ronment (see Section 2.12, Shell Execution Environment), but
do not invoke command_name. Although the format of this
string is unspecified, it shall indicate in which <br>
of the following categories command_name falls and shall
include the information stated:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Utilities, regular built-in
utilities, and any implementation-defined functions that are
found using the PATH variable (as described in Section
2.9.1.1, Command <br>
Search and Execution), shall be identified as such and
include the absolute pathname in the string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Other shell functions shall be
identified as functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Aliases shall be identified as
aliases and their definitions included in the string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Special built-in utilities
shall be identified as special built-in utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Regular built-in utilities not
associated with a PATH search shall be identified as regular
built-in utilities. (The term
&lsquo;&lsquo;regular&rsquo;&rsquo; need not be used.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Shell reserved words shall be
identified as reserved words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">argument One of the strings
treated as an argument to command_name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command_name <br>
The name of a utility or a special built-in utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in argu&acirc; <br>
ments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error and informative messages written to standard
<br>
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH Determine the search path
used during the command search described in Section 2.9.1.1,
Command Search and Execution, except as described under the
&acirc;p option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
When the &acirc;v option is specified, standard output shall
be formatted as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s0, &lt;pathname or
command&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the &acirc;V option is
specified, standard output shall be formatted as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s0,
&lt;unspecified&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
When the &acirc;v or &acirc;V options are specified, the
following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 The command_name could not
be found or an error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, the following exit
values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">126 The utility specified by
command_name was found but could not be invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">127 An error occurred in the
command utility or the utility specified by command_name
could not be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, the exit status of
command shall be that of the simple command specified by the
arguments to command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The order for command search allows functions to override
regular built-ins and path searches. This utility is
necessary to allow functions that have the same name as a
utility <br>
to call the utility (instead of a recursive call to the
function).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The system default path is
available using getconf; however, since getconf may need to
have the PATH set up before it can be called itself, the
following can be used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command &acirc;p getconf
PATH</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are some advantages to
suppressing the special characteristics of special built-ins
on occasion. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command exec &gt;
unwritable-file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">does not cause a non-interactive
script to abort, so that the output status can be checked by
the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command, env, nohup, time,
and xargs utilities have been specified to use exit code 127
if an error occurs so that applications can distinguish
&lsquo;&lsquo;failure to find a utility&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
from &lsquo;&lsquo;invoked utility exited with an error
indication&rsquo;&rsquo;. The value 127 was chosen because
it is not commonly used for other meanings; most utilities
use small values for &lsquo;&lsquo;nor&acirc; <br>
mal error conditions&rsquo;&rsquo; and the values above 128
can be confused with termination due to receipt of a signal.
The value 126 was chosen in a similar manner to indicate
that the <br>
utility could be found, but not invoked. Some scripts
produce meaningful error messages differentiating the 126
and 127 cases. The distinction between exit codes 126 and
127 is <br>
based on KornShell practice that uses 127 when all attempts
to exec the utility fail with [ENOENT], and uses 126 when
any attempt to exec the utility fails for any other
reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the &acirc;v and &acirc;V
options of command produce output in relation to the current
shell execution environment, command is generally provided
as a shell regular built-in. If it is <br>
called in a subshell or separate utility execution
environment, such as one of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(PATH=foo command &acirc;v) <br>
nohup command &acirc;v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">it does not necessarily produce
correct results. For example, when called with nohup or an
exec function, in a separate utility execution environment,
most implementations are <br>
not able to identify aliases, functions, or special
built-ins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two types of regular built-ins
could be encountered on a system and these are described
separately by command. The description of command search in
Section 2.9.1.1, Command <br>
Search and Execution allows for a standard utility to be
implemented as a regular built-in as long as it is found in
the appropriate place in a PATH search. So, for example,
com&acirc; <br>
mand &acirc;v true might yield /bin/true or some similar
pathname. Other implementation-defined utilities that are
not defined by this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 might exist
only as built- <br>
ins and have no pathname associated with them. These produce
output identified as (regular) built-ins. Applications
encountering these are not able to count on execing them,
<br>
using them with nohup, overriding them with a different
PATH, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. Make a version of cd that always prints out the new
working directory exactly once:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd() { <br>
command cd &quot;$@&quot; &gt;/dev/null <br>
pwd <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Start off a
&lsquo;&lsquo;secure shell script&rsquo;&rsquo; in which the
script avoids being spoofed by its parent:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IFS=&rsquo; <br>
&rsquo; <br>
# The preceding value should be
&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;. <br>
# Set IFS to its default value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nalias &acirc;a <br>
# Unset all possible aliases. <br>
# Note that unalias is escaped to prevent an alias <br>
# being used for unalias.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unset &acirc;f command <br>
# Ensure command is not a user function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH=&quot;$(command &acirc;p
getconf PATH):$PATH&quot; <br>
# Put on a reliable PATH prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At this point, given correct
permissions on the directories called by PATH, the script
has the ability to ensure that any utility it calls is the
intended one. It is being <br>
very cautious because it assumes that implementation
extensions may be present that would allow user functions to
exist when it is invoked; this capability is not specified
<br>
by this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, but it is not
prohibited as an extension. For example, the ENV variable
precedes the invocation of the script with a user start-up
script. <br>
Such a script could define functions to spoof the
application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
Since command is a regular built-in utility it is always
found prior to the PATH search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is nothing in the
description of command that implies the command line is
parsed any differently from that of any other simple
command. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command a | b ; c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is not parsed in any special way
that causes &rsquo;|&rsquo; or &rsquo;;&rsquo; to be treated
other than a pipe operator or &lt;semicolon&gt; or that
prevents function lookup on b or c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command utility is somewhat
similar to the Eighth Edition shell builtin command, but
since command also goes to the file system to search for
utilities, the name builtin <br>
would not be intuitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command utility is most
likely to be provided as a regular built-in. It is not
listed as a special built-in for the following reasons:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The removal of exportable
functions made the special precedence of a special built-in
unnecessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A special built-in has special
properties (see Section 2.14, Special Built-In Utilities)
that were inappropriate for invoking other utilities. For
example, two commands such <br>
as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">date &gt; unwritable-file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command date &gt;
unwritable-file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would have entirely different
results; in a non-interactive script, the former would
continue to execute the next command, the latter would
abort. Introducing this semantic <br>
difference along with suppressing functions was seen to be
non-intuitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;p option is present
because it is useful to be able to ensure a safe path search
that finds all the standard utilities. This search might not
be identical to the one that <br>
occurs through one of the exec functions (as defined in the
System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008) when PATH is
unset. At the very least, this feature is required to allow
the <br>
script to access the correct version of getconf so that the
value of the default path can be accurately retrieved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command &acirc;v and
&acirc;V options were added to satisfy requirements from
users that are currently accomplished by three different
historical utilities: type in the System V shell, <br>
whence in the KornShell, and which in the C shell. Since
there is no historical agreement on how and what to
accomplish here, the POSIX command utility was enhanced and
the his&acirc; <br>
torical utilities were left unmodified. The C shell which
merely conducts a path search. The KornShell whence is more
elaborate&acirc;in addition to the categories required by
POSIX, <br>
it also reports on tracked aliases, exported aliases, and
undefined functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output format of &acirc;V
was left mostly unspecified because human users are its only
audience. Applications should not be written to care about
this information; they can use <br>
the output of &acirc;v to differentiate between various
types of commands, but the additional information that may
be emitted by the more verbose &acirc;V is not needed and
should not be <br>
arbitrarily constrained in its verbosity or localization for
application parsing reasons.</p>
