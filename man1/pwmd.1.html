<p>PWMD(1) Password Manager Daemon PWMD(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pwmd - a univeral data server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pwmd [options] [file1] [...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Password Manager Daemon (or pwmd) is a server that
applications connect to and send commands to store and
retrieve data that is saved in an OpenPGP encrypted XML
document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server uses the Assuan
protocol (Implementation,,assuan) which is the same used by
gpg-agent, pinentry and scdaemon. It also uses libgpg-error
for error reporting with <br>
GPG_ERR_SOURCE_USER_1 being the error source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is recommended to read the
texinfo documentation of pwmd since it contains protocol
commands and syntax and other details not found here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
pwmd uses GpgME for encryption, decryption and signing of
the OpenPGP data file. GpgME itself makes use of gpg2 for
these operations so some configuration of gpg2 may also be
<br>
needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is recommended to pass the
--allow-preset-passphrase command line option to gpg-agent.
Doing so allows pwmd cache pushing on startup. It is also
recommended to pass the <br>
--allow-loopback-pinentry to gpg-agent. This option allows a
passphrase to be inquired from pwmd when a pinentry is
unavailable to the client (see: [TLS]). see: [Configuration]
<br>
for details about the gpg_homedir parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pwmd is executed as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pwmd options [ file1 ] [ ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-option arguments are data
files to cache on startup. When the data file requires a
passphrase for decryption a pinentry will prompt either on
the current TTY or from an X11 <br>
window when the &acirc;DISPLAY&acirc; environment variable
is set. see: [Pinentry].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following command line
options are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug
protocol:level[,protocol:level] <br>
Enable debugging output. This option can output sensitive
information such as passphrases and secret keys so care
should be taken where the output gets written to. The <br>
protocol is a single character representing the protocol to
log. Use a for libassuan with level being one or more
character flags: i for init, x for context, e for engine,
<br>
d for data, s for system IO or c for control. To debug gpgme
use g as the protocol with level being an integer from 1 to
9. To enable TLS debugging output use t as the <br>
protocol with level being an integer from 1 to 9. A value
over 10 will enable all TLS debugging output with 1 being
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--homedir directory <br>
The root directory where pwmd will store its data and
temporary files. The default is &acirc;~/.pwmd&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rcfile, -f rcfile <br>
Specify an alternate configuration file. The default is
&acirc;~/.pwmd/config&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--kill Terminate an existing
instance of pwmd. The process to terminate is determined
from the --homedir and --rcfile options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--import, -I filename <br>
Imports an XML file. The XML file should be in conformance
to the pwmd DTD (see: [Introduction]). You will be prompted
for a passphrase to encrypt with. The output is <br>
written to the filename specified with --outfile. To make
use of the imported data, place the output file in
&acirc;~/.pwmd/data&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keyparam filename <br>
The key parameters to use when generating a new key pair
while importing an XML file. The file contents must be in
GnuPG XML format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keyid
fingerprint[,&lt;fingerprint&gt;] <br>
Specifies the fingerprint of the encryption key to use as a
recipient when importing. When not specified a new key-pair
will be created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sign-keyid
fingerprint[,&lt;fingerprint&gt;] <br>
Specifies the fingerprint of the signing key to use for
signing of the data file when importing. When not specified
the signing key of the generated key-pair or the sign&acirc;
<br>
ing key of the --keyid option will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--symmetric, -s <br>
Use symmetric or conventional encryption rather than pubic
key encryption when importing. Signing is still possible by
using the --sign-keyid option. No signing is done <br>
by default when specifying this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--passphrase-file, -k
filename&quot; <br>
Obtain a passphrase from the specified filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-dump, -D <br>
Disable the XPATH, XPATHATTR, LIST and DUMP protocol
commands (see: [Commands]). This overrides any
disable_list_and_dump configuration parameter (see:
[Configuration]).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-fork, -n <br>
Run as a foreground process and do not fork into the
background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore, --force <br>
Ignore cache pushing failures on startup. By default, pwmd
will exit if an error occurred do to an invalid passphrase
or other error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Show the version, copyright and compile time features and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Print a summary of
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
If no configuration file is specified with the pwmd -f
command line option, pwmd will read
&acirc;~/.pwmd/config&acirc; if it exists, and if not, will
use defaults. Blank lines and lines <br>
beginning with &rsquo;#&rsquo; are ignored. Some parameters
may have data file specific settings by placing them in a
file section. A file section is declared by surrounding the
filename <br>
with braces (i.e., &rsquo;[filename]&rsquo;). Global options
may be specified in the global section &rsquo;e.g.,
[global]&rsquo; and are the default options for new or
unspecified file sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A tilde ~ will be expanded to
the home directory of the user starting pwmd when contained
in a parameter whose value is a filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration file can be
reloaded by sending the SIGHUP signal to a pwmd process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are only
for use in the [global] section:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">socket_path = /path/to/socket
<br>
Listen on the specified socket. The default is
&acirc;~/.pwmd/socket&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">socket_perms = octal_mode <br>
Permissions to set after creating the socket. This will
override any umask(2) setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invoking_user =
[-!]user,[-!]@group,[-!]#SHA-256,... <br>
This parameter is not to be confused with setuid or setguid
upon startup. It&rsquo;s syntax is the same as the allowed
parameter except that it is a list of local usernames, <br>
group names and TLS fingerprint hashes that may use the
XPATH, XPATHATTR and DUMP commands (except when disabled
with the disable_list_and_dump option) and also who may <br>
modify elements that have no _acl attribute or is not listed
in an _acl. It is similar to the system administrator root
account but for a data file and element paths (see: <br>
[Access Control]). The default is the user the executes
pwmd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invoking_file = filename <br>
A file containing one entry per line. An entry has the same
syntax as the invoking_user parameter. When both this
parameter and the invoking_user parameter are specified <br>
then the invoking_file entries will be appended to the
invoking_user parameter value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">strict_kill = boolean <br>
When false, the KILL command (see: [KILL]) will allow
killing another client that is not of the same UID or TLS
fingerprint of the current client and when not the
invok&acirc; <br>
ing_user. The default us false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allowed =
[-!]user,[-!]@group,[+,][-!]#SHA-256,... <br>
A comma separated list of local user names, group names or
TLS fingerprint SHA-256 hashes (in the case of a remote
client) who are allowed to connect. Groups should be <br>
prefixed with a &rsquo;@&rsquo;. When not specified only the
invoking user may connect. A username, group name or hash
may also be prefixed with a - or ! to prevent access to a
spe&acirc; <br>
cific user or group in the list. The order of the list is
important since a user may be a member of multiple
groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This parameter may also be
specified in a filename section to allow or deny a client to
OPEN (see: [OPEN]) a data file. It also affects the cache
commands CLEARCACHE (see: <br>
[CLEARCACHE]) and CACHETIMEOUT (see: [CACHETIMEOUT]). When
not specified in a file section any user that can connect
may also open any filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example would deny
all users in group primary but allow username who may be a
member of primary. It will also allow any TLS client except
for the client with <br>
TLS fingerprint hash #ABCDEF:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">allowed=-@primary,username,+,!#ABCDEF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allowed_file = filename <br>
A file containing one entry per line. An entry has the same
syntax as the allowed parameter. When both this parameter
and the allowed parameter are specified then the <br>
allowed_file entries will be appended to the allowed
parameter value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">encrypt_to = boolean <br>
When true and SAVE&rsquo;ing a data file, allow gpg2 to
append it&rsquo;s configured key to the list of recipients.
The default is false meaning that only keys specified with
SAVE <br>
--keyid are recipients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">always_trust = boolean <br>
When true, allow encrypting to untrusted recipients or
public encryption keys. The default is false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpg_homedir = path <br>
The location where gpg2 will store its public and private
keys and configuration. The default is
&acirc;HOMEDIR/.gnupg&acirc; where HOMEDIR is the default
(&acirc;~/.pwmd&acirc;) or the value <br>
specified on the command line (see: [Invoking]). If you want
to use your standard gpg2 keyring then set this to
&acirc;~/.gnupg&acirc;. Note that a new instance of
gpg-agent will be <br>
started when not using the standard keyring and that any
configuration options for gpg-agent will need to placed in
&acirc;HOMEDIR/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disable_mlockall = boolean <br>
When set to false, mlockall(2) will be called on startup.
This will use more physical memory but may also be more
secure since no swapping to disk will occur. The default
<br>
is true. If possible, use an encrypted swap file or
partition and leave this set to true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_path = /path/to/logfile <br>
Logs informational messages to the specified file. The
default is &acirc;~/.pwmd/log&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable_logging = boolean <br>
Enable or disable logging to log_path. The default is
false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_keepopen = boolean <br>
When set to false, the log file specified with log_path will
be closed after writing each line. The default is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syslog = boolean <br>
Enable logging to syslog(8) with facility LOG_DAEMON and
priority LOG_INFO. The default is false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_level = level <br>
When 0, only connections and errors are logged. When 1, data
file recipients and signers are logged during OPEN (see:
[OPEN]) and SAVE (see: [SAVE]). When 2, client com&acirc;
<br>
mands are also logged. The default is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill_scd = boolean <br>
Kill scdaemon after each OPEN (see: [OPEN]), SAVE (see:
[SAVE]) or PASSWD (see: [PASSWD]) command. The default is
false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disable_list_and_dump = boolean
<br>
When true, the XPATH, XPATHATTR, LIST and DUMP protocol
commands (see: [Commands]) will be disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cache_push = file1,file2 <br>
A comma separated list of filenames that will be pushed into
the file cache upon startup. pwmd will prompt for the
passphrase for each file unless specified with <br>
passphrase_file parameter in a matching file section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">priority = integer <br>
The priority, or niceness, of the server. The default is
inherited from the parent process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lock_timeout = integer <br>
The default timeout in tenths of a second before giving up
waiting for a file lock and returning an error. The default
is 50.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">send_state = integer <br>
Whether to send client state changes of the current client
to all connected clients. When 0 no client state changes
will be sent although a client state may be obtained <br>
with the GETINFO command (see: [GETINFO]). When 1 a status
message will be sent to all connected clients. When 2 the
status message will be sent only to the invoking_user <br>
(see: [Configuration]). The default is 2. Disabling this
option can significantly increase the performance of pwmd
when there are many connected clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
defaults for new files when specified in the
&rsquo;global&rsquo; section. When placed in a data file
section they are options specific to that data file
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require_save_key = boolean <br>
Require the passphrase needed to open a data file before
writing changes of the documment to disk reguardless of the
key cache status. The default is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">backup = boolean <br>
Whether to create a backup of the data file when saving. The
backup filename has the &acirc;.backup&acirc; extension
appended to the opened file. The default is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cache_timeout = seconds <br>
The number of seconds to keep the cache entry for this file.
If -1, the cache entry is kept forever. If 0, each time an
encrypted file is OPENed (see: [OPEN]) a passphrase <br>
will be required. The default is 600 or 10 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfer_progress = bytes <br>
Commands that send data lines to the client will also send
the XFER status message (see: [Status Messages]) after the
specified number of bytes have been sent. The number <br>
of bytes is rounded to ASSUAN_LINELENGTH or 1002 bytes. The
default is 8196.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">passphrase_file =
/path/to/filename <br>
Obtain the passphrase to open the data file from filename.
If specified in the &rsquo;global&rsquo; section then the
passphrase_file is a default for all data files. Note that
if a <br>
client changes the passphrase for this data file then the
passphrase_file will need to be updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recursion_depth = integer <br>
The maximum number of times to resolve a target attribute
for an element in an element path (see: [Target Attribute]).
An error is returned when this value is exceeded. <br>
The default is 100 but can be disabled by setting to 0 (not
recommended).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allowed =
[-]user,[-]@group,[!]#TLSFINGERPRINT,... <br>
Same parameter value as the allowed parameter mentioned
above in the &rsquo;[global]&rsquo; section but grants or
denies a user from opening a specific data file. The default
is to <br>
allow any user that is allowed to connect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remote connections can also be
made to pwmd over TLS. Authentication is done by using X.509
client certificates that are signed with the same
Certificate Authority (CA) as the <br>
server certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The CA certificate is expected
to be found in &acirc;~/.pwmd/ca-cert.pem&acirc; while the
pwmd server certificate and key file should be put in
&acirc;~/.pwmd/server-cert.pem&acirc; and
&acirc;~/.pwmd/server- <br>
key.pem&acirc;, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the documentation of
certtool or openssl for details about creating self-signed
certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following TLS configuration
options are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable_tcp = boolean <br>
Whether to enable TCP/TLS server support. If enabled, both
TCP and the local unix domain socket will listen for
connections. The default is false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_port = integer <br>
The TCP port to listen on when enable_tcp is true. The
default is 6466.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_bind = string <br>
The internet protocol to listen with. Must be one of ipv4,
ipv6 or any to listen for both IPv4 and IPv6 connections.
The default is any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_interface = string <br>
Only useful if running as root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tls_timeout = seconds <br>
The number of seconds to wait for a read() or write() call
on a TLS client file descriptor to complete before returning
an error. The default is 300.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keepalive_interval = seconds
<br>
Send a keepalive status message to an idle remote client. An
idle client is one who is not in a command. The purpose of
this status message is to disconnect a hung remote <br>
client and release any file mutex locks so another client
may open the same data file. The default is 60.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_require_key = boolean <br>
When true, require the remote client to provide the
passphrase to open a data file even if the file is cached.
This option is a default for all files when specified in
<br>
the &rsquo;[global]&rsquo; section. The default is
false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp_wait = integer <br>
The time in tenths of a second to wait between TCP
connections. Setting to 0 will disable waiting. The default
is 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tls_cipher_suite = string <br>
The GnuTLS cipher suite and protocol to use. See the GnuTLS
documentation for information about the format of this
string. The default is <br>

SECURE256:SECURE192:SECURE128:-VERS-SSL3.0:-VERS-TLS1.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tls_dh_level = string <br>
The security level (bits) of the generated key exchange
parameters. Possible values are low, medium or high. The
default is medium.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PINENTRY <br>
The pinentry program is used to prompt the user for
passphrase input or as a confirmation dialog; it needs to
know where to prompt for the input, beit from a terminal or
an X11 <br>
display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is the responsibility of the
user to tell pinentry about the terminal or X11 display
before requiring the input. This is done by using the
gpg-connect-agent program. Please <br>
read it&rsquo;s documentation about the UPDATESTARTUPTTY
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
Sending the SIGHUP signal to a pwmd process will reload the
configuration file and sending SIGUSR1 will clear the entire
file cache.</p>
