<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
druc - Design Rule Checker</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
druc input_name [ -v ] [ -h ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
DRuC is a general parametrized VLSI design rule checker.
<br>
This tool replace the VERSATIL tool that is not anymore
supported. <br>
This manual presents the layout rules for tle ALLIANCE
symbolic layout approach. The rules are described in a
technology file defined by the environment variable <br>
RDS_TECHNO_NAME (see bellow). <br>
The root cell and all the instanciated cells (except the
intanciated libraries cells) must be in the current
directory. <br>
The default mode of DRuC is (currently) full flat: it first
flatten all the hierarchy in order to obtain a flat,
rectangle level description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v Verbose mode on. Each step of the DRC is output on the
standard output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Hierarchical design rule
checking. Generates lots of files locally, to be used by
future invocation of druc. Don&rsquo;t ask me if and how
this works, but since you also <br>
fetched the sources, ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
If design errors are found, DRuC produces the list of them
in two files :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- &lt;root_name.drc&gt;: <br>
This ascii file contains the list of DRC violations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- &lt;root_name.iii&gt;: <br>
This gds ro cif file contains only rectangles detected in
violation. <br>
( suffix iii is defined with the environment )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RDS_OUT_PH is default setted to
gds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
DRuC uses several environment variables: <br>
- MBK_IN_PH - defines the layout input format. <br>
- RDS_OUT_PH - defines the layout output format. <br>
- RDS_TECHNO_NAME - defines the technology file. <br>
- MBK_CATA_LIB - defines the catalog directory.</p>
