<p>CODEGROUP(1) General Commands Manual CODEGROUP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
codegroup - encode / decode binary file as five letter
codegroups</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
codegroup -d|-e [ -u ] [ infile [ outfile ] ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
For decades, spies have written their encoded messages in
groups of five letters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">codegroup encodes any binary
file into this form, allowing it to be transmitted through
any medium, and decodes files containing codegroups into the
original input. Encoded <br>
files contain a 16-bit cyclical redundancy check (CRC) and
file size to verify, when decoded, that the message is
complete and correct. Files being decoded may contain other
<br>
information before and after the codegroups, allowing
in-the-clear annotations to be included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">codegroup makes no attempt, on
its own, to prevent your message from being read.
Cryptographic security should be delegated to a package
intended for that purpose, such as pgp. <br>
codegroup can then be applied to the encrypted binary
output, transforming it into easily transmitted text. Text
created by codegroup uses only upper case ASCII letters and
spa&acirc; <br>
ces. Unlike files encoded with uuencode or pgp&rsquo;s
&lsquo;&lsquo;ASCII armour&rsquo;&rsquo; facility, the
output of codegroup can be easily (albeit tediously) read
over the telephone, broadcast on short&acirc; <br>
wave radio to agents in the field, or sent by telegram,
telex, or Morse code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only codegroup conforms to the
telegraphic convention of all upper case letters, and passes
the &lsquo;&lsquo;telephone test&rsquo;&rsquo; of being
readable without any modifiers such as
&lsquo;&lsquo;capital&rsquo;&rsquo; and <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;lower-case&rsquo;&rsquo;. Avoiding punctuation
marks and lower case letters makes the output of codegroup
much easier to transmit over a voice or traditional
telegraphic link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-decode Decodes the input, previously created by codegroup,
to recover the original input file, and verifies it to
detect truncation or corruption of the contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-encode Encodes the input into
an output text file containing five letter code groups
(default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-usage Print how-to-call
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options may be abbreviated
to a single letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION NOTES <br>
Encoding a binary file as ASCII characters inevitably
increases its size. When used in conjunction with existing
compression and encryption tools, the resulting growth in
file <br>
size is usually acceptable. For example, a random extract of
electronic mail 32768 bytes in length was chosen as a test
sample. Compression with gzip compacted the file to <br>
15062 bytes. It was then encrypted for transmission to a
single recipient with pgp, which resulted in a 15233 byte
file. (Even though pgp has its own compression, smaller
files <br>
usually result from initial compression with gzip. In this
case, pgp alone would have produced a file of 15420
bytes.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">codegroup transforms the
encrypted file into a 37296 byte text file. Thus, due to
compression, the code groups for the encrypted file are only
a little larger than the original <br>
cleartext.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Restricting the character set
and including spaces between groups results in substantially
larger output files than those produced by uuencode and pgp.
Files encoded with code&acirc; <br>
group are about 2.5 times the size of the input file, while
uuencode and pgp expand the file only about 35%. codegroup
is thus preferable only for applications where its limited
<br>
character set is an advantage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
If no infile is specified or infile is a single
&lsquo;&lsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo;, codegroup reads from standard
input; if no outfile is given, or outfile is a single
&lsquo;&lsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo;, output is sent to standard
out&acirc; <br>
put. The input and output are processed strictly serially;
consequently codegroup may be used in pipelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
When a CRC error is detected, no indication is given of the
location in the file where the error(s) occurred. When
sending large files, you may want to break them into pieces
<br>
with the splits utility (available from the Web page cited
below) so, in case of error, only the erroneous pieces have
to be re-sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It might be nice to embed the
original file name and modes in the encoded output, but this
opens the door to all kinds of system-dependent problems.
You can always include this <br>
information as text before the first codegroup, or send an
archive created with tar or zip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
codegroup returns status 0 if processing was completed
without errors, 1 if errors were detected in decoding a file
which indicate the output is incorrect or incomplete, and 2
if <br>
processing could not be performed at all due, for example,
to a nonexistent input file or no codegroups found in the
input.</p>
