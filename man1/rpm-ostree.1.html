<p>RPM-OSTREE(1) rpm-ostree RPM-OSTREE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rpm-ostree - Operating system upgrade and software
management tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rpm-ostree {COMMAND} [OPTIONS...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
rpm-ostree (also called &quot;atomic&quot; if configured) is
a system software management tool that combines features of
both traditional RPM and OSTree. It has support for both
<br>
server-side composing of trees, as well as client-side
upgrading and management of deployments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On an rpm-ostree managed system,
the traditional yum (if installed) and rpm tools operate in
a read-only state; the RPM database is stored in
/usr/share/rpm which is underneath a <br>
read-only bind mount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of live
package-by-package upgrades, the underlying OSTree layer
replicates a complete filesystem tree from a compose server
into a new deployment, available on the next <br>
reboot. One benefit of this is that there will always be a
previous deployment, available for rollback.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note in this &quot;pure
replication&quot; model, at present there is no dependency
resolution on the client machines, nor any ability to add or
remove packages. You may however use <br>
/usr/local/bin, or an application mechanism such as
docker(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
compose <br>
Entrypoint for tree composition; most typically used on
servers to prepare trees for replication by client systems.
Currently has two subcommands, tree and sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">db <br>
Gives information pertaining to rpm data within the file
system trees within the ostree commits. There are three
sub-commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff to see how the packages are
different between the trees in two commits. The
--format=diff option uses - for removed packages, + for
added packages, and finally ! for <br>
the old version of an updated package, with a following =
for the new version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list to see which packages are
within the commit(s) (works like yum list). At least one
commit must be specified, but more than one or a range will
also work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version to see the rpmdb version
of the packages within the commit (works like yum version
nogroups). At least one commit must be specified, but more
than one or a range will <br>
also work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deploy <br>
Takes version, branch, or commit ID as an argument, and
creates a new deployment using it, setting it up as the
default for the next boot. Unlike most other commands, this
<br>
will automatically fetch and traverse the origin history to
find the target. By design, this has no effect on your
running filesystem tree. You must reboot for any changes to
<br>
take effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to exit status 0 for
success and 1 for error, this command also uses exit status
77 to indicate that the system is already on the specified
commit. This tristate <br>
return model is intended to support idempotency-oriented
systems automation tools like Ansible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reboot or -r to initiate a
reboot after the upgrade is prepared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preview download enough
metadata to inspect the RPM diff, but do not actually create
a new deployment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">install (pkg-add) <br>
Takes one or more packages as arguments. The packages are
fetched from the enabled repositories in /etc/yum.repos.d/
and are overlayed on top of a new deployment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reboot or -r to initiate a
reboot after the deployment is prepared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dry-run or -n to exit after
printing the transaction rather than downloading the
packages and creating a new deployment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uninstall (pkg-remove) <br>
Takes one or more packages as arguments. The packages are
removed from the set of packages that are currently
overlayed. The remaining packages in the set (if any) are
<br>
fetched from the enabled repositories in /etc/yum.repos.d/
and are overlayed on top of a new deployment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reboot or -r to initiate a
reboot after the deployment is prepared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dry-run or -n to exit after
printing the transaction rather than downloading the
packages and creating a new deployment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rebase <br>
Switch to a different branch (possibly using a new remote),
while preserving all of the state that upgrade does, such as
/etc changes, any layered RPM packages, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The full syntax is rebase
REMOTENAME:BRANCHNAME. Alternatively, you can use the
--branch or --remote options mentioned below. With the
argument syntax, specifying just <br>
BRANCHNAME will reuse the same remote. You may also omit one
of REMOTENAME or BRANCHNAME (keeping the colon). In the
former case, the branch refers to a local branch; in the
<br>
latter case, the same branch will be used on a different
remote.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--branch or -b to to pick a
branch name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remote or -m to to pick a
remote name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rollback <br>
OSTree manages an ordered list of bootloader entries, called
&quot;deployments&quot;. The entry at index 0 is the default
bootloader entry. Each entry has a separate /etc, but they
all <br>
share a single /var. You can use the bootloader to choose
between entries by pressing Tab to interrupt startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command then changes the
default bootloader entry. If the current default is booted,
then set the default to the previous entry. Otherwise, make
the currently booted <br>
tree the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reboot or -r to initiate a
reboot after rollback is prepared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status <br>
Gives information pertaining to the current deployment in
use. Lists the names and refspecs of all possible
deployments in order, such that the first deployment in the
list <br>
is the default upon boot. The deployment marked with * is
the current booted deployment, and marking with
&rsquo;r&rsquo; indicates the most recent upgrade (the
newest deployment <br>
version).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upgrade <br>
Download the latest version of the current tree, and deploy
it, setting it up as the default for the next boot. By
design, this has no effect on your running filesystem tree.
<br>
You must reboot for any changes to take effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to exit status 0 for
success and 1 for error, this command also uses exit status
77 to indicate that no upgrade is available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reboot or -r to initiate a
reboot after upgrade is prepared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-downgrade to permit
deployment of chronologically older trees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preview to download only
/usr/share/rpm in order to do a package-level diff between
the two versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check to just check if an
upgrade is available, without downloading it or performing a
package-level diff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cleanup <br>
Commands such as upgrade create new deployments, which
affect the next boot, and take up additional storage space.
In some cases, you may want to undo and clean up these <br>
operations. This command supports both removing additional
deployments such as the &quot;pending&quot; deployment (the
next boot) as well as the default rollback deployment. Use
<br>
-p/--pending to remove the pending deployment, and
-r/--rollback to remove the rollback.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -b/--base option does not
affect finished deployments, but will clean up any transient
allocated space that may result from interrupted operations.
If you want to free up <br>
disk space safely, use this option first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -m/--repomd option cleans up
cached RPM repodata and any partially downloaded (but not
imported) packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reload <br>
Some configuration and state data such as
/etc/ostree/remotes.d changes may not be reflected until a
daemon reload is invoked. Use this command to initiate a
reload.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">initramfs <br>
By default, the primary use case mode for rpm-ostree is to
replicate an initramfs as part of a base layer. However,
some use cases require locally regenerating it to add <br>
configuration or drivers. Use rpm-ostree initramfs to
inspect the current status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use --enable to turn on client
side initramfs regeneration. A new deployment will be
generated, and after reboot, further upgrades will continue
regenerating. You must reboot <br>
for the new initramfs to take effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To append additional custom
arguments to the initramfs program (currently dracut), use
--arg. For example, --arg=-I --arg=/etc/someconfigfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --disable option will
disable regeneration. You must reboot for the change to take
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ex <br>
This command offers access to experimental features; command
line stability is not guaranteed. The available subcommands
will be listed by invoking rpm-ostree ex. For <br>
example, there is rpm-ostree ex livefs which is an
experimental interface for applying changes to the booted
deployment.</p>
