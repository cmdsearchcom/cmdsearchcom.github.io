rpm-ostree - Operating system upgrade and software management tool
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<div class="Pp" style="margin-left: 11.00ex; text-indent: -11.00ex;"><b>rpm-ostree</b>
  {COMMAND} [OPTIONS...]</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
rpm-ostree (also called &quot;atomic&quot; if configured) is a system software
  management tool that combines features of both traditional RPM and OSTree. It
  has support for both server-side composing of trees, as well as client-side
  upgrading and management of deployments.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On an rpm-ostree managed system, the traditional yum (if installed) and rpm
  tools operate in a read-only state; the RPM database is stored in
  /usr/share/rpm which is underneath a read-only bind mount.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Instead of live package-by-package upgrades, the underlying OSTree layer
  replicates a complete filesystem tree from a compose server into a new
  deployment, available on the next reboot. One benefit of this is that there
  will always be a previous deployment, available for rollback.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note in this &quot;pure replication&quot; model, at present there is no
  dependency resolution on the client machines, nor any ability to add or remove
  packages. You may however use /usr/local/bin, or an application mechanism such
  as <b>docker</b>(1).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMMANDS"><a class="selflink" href="#COMMANDS">COMMANDS</a></h1>
<b>compose</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Entrypoint for tree composition; most
  typically used on servers to prepare trees for replication by client systems.
  Currently has two subcommands, tree and sign.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>db</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Gives information pertaining to rpm data
  within the file system trees within the ostree commits. There are three
  sub-commands:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>diff</b> to see how the packages are different between the trees in two
  commits. The <b>--format=diff</b> option uses - for removed packages, + for
  added packages, and finally ! for the old version of an updated package, with
  a following = for the new version.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>list</b> to see which packages are within the commit(s) (works like yum
  list). At least one commit must be specified, but more than one or a range
  will also work.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>version</b> to see the rpmdb version of the packages within the commit (works
  like yum version nogroups). At least one commit must be specified, but more
  than one or a range will also work.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>deploy</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Takes version, branch, or commit ID as an
  argument, and creates a new deployment using it, setting it up as the default
  for the next boot. Unlike most other commands, this will automatically fetch
  and traverse the origin history to find the target. By design, this has no
  effect on your running filesystem tree. You must reboot for any changes to
  take effect.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In addition to exit status 0 for success and 1 for error, this command also uses
  exit status 77 to indicate that the system is already on the specified commit.
  This tristate return model is intended to support idempotency-oriented systems
  automation tools like Ansible.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--reboot</b> or <b>-r</b> to initiate a reboot after the upgrade is prepared.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--preview</b> download enough metadata to inspect the RPM diff, but do not
  actually create a new deployment.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>install (pkg-add)</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Takes one or more packages as arguments. The
  packages are fetched from the enabled repositories in /etc/yum.repos.d/ and
  are overlayed on top of a new deployment.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--reboot</b> or <b>-r</b> to initiate a reboot after the deployment is
  prepared.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--dry-run</b> or <b>-n</b> to exit after printing the transaction rather than
  downloading the packages and creating a new deployment.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>uninstall (pkg-remove)</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Takes one or more packages as arguments. The
  packages are removed from the set of packages that are currently overlayed.
  The remaining packages in the set (if any) are fetched from the enabled
  repositories in /etc/yum.repos.d/ and are overlayed on top of a new
  deployment.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--reboot</b> or <b>-r</b> to initiate a reboot after the deployment is
  prepared.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--dry-run</b> or <b>-n</b> to exit after printing the transaction rather than
  downloading the packages and creating a new deployment.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>rebase</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Switch to a different branch (possibly using a
  new remote), while preserving all of the state that <b>upgrade</b> does, such
  as /etc changes, any layered RPM packages, etc.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The full syntax is rebase REMOTENAME:BRANCHNAME. Alternatively, you can use the
  <b>--branch</b> or <b>--remote</b> options mentioned below. With the argument
  syntax, specifying just BRANCHNAME will reuse the same remote. You may also
  omit one of REMOTENAME or BRANCHNAME (keeping the colon). In the former case,
  the branch refers to a local branch; in the latter case, the same branch will
  be used on a different remote.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--branch</b> or <b>-b</b> to to pick a branch name.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--remote</b> or <b>-m</b> to to pick a remote name.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>rollback</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">OSTree manages an ordered list of bootloader
  entries, called &quot;deployments&quot;. The entry at index 0 is the default
  bootloader entry. Each entry has a separate /etc, but they all share a single
  /var. You can use the bootloader to choose between entries by pressing Tab to
  interrupt startup.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This command then changes the default bootloader entry. If the current default
  is booted, then set the default to the previous entry. Otherwise, make the
  currently booted tree the default.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--reboot</b> or <b>-r</b> to initiate a reboot after rollback is
  prepared.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>status</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Gives information pertaining to the current
  deployment in use. Lists the names and refspecs of all possible deployments in
  order, such that the first deployment in the list is the default upon boot.
  The deployment marked with * is the current booted deployment, and marking
  with 'r' indicates the most recent upgrade (the newest deployment
  version).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>upgrade</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Download the latest version of the current
  tree, and deploy it, setting it up as the default for the next boot. By
  design, this has no effect on your running filesystem tree. You must reboot
  for any changes to take effect.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In addition to exit status 0 for success and 1 for error, this command also uses
  exit status 77 to indicate that no upgrade is available.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--reboot</b> or <b>-r</b> to initiate a reboot after upgrade is prepared.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--allow-downgrade</b> to permit deployment of chronologically older trees.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--preview</b> to download only /usr/share/rpm in order to do a package-level
  diff between the two versions.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--check</b> to just check if an upgrade is available, without downloading it
  or performing a package-level diff.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>cleanup</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Commands such as <b>upgrade</b> create new
  deployments, which affect the next boot, and take up additional storage space.
  In some cases, you may want to undo and clean up these operations. This
  command supports both removing additional deployments such as the
  &quot;pending&quot; deployment (the next boot) as well as the default rollback
  deployment. Use <b>-p/--pending</b> to remove the pending deployment, and
  <b>-r/--rollback</b> to remove the rollback.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>-b/--base</b> option does not affect finished deployments, but will clean
  up any transient allocated space that may result from interrupted operations.
  If you want to free up disk space safely, use this option first.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>-m/--repomd</b> option cleans up cached RPM repodata and any partially
  downloaded (but not imported) packages.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>reload</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Some configuration and state data such as
  /etc/ostree/remotes.d changes may not be reflected until a daemon reload is
  invoked. Use this command to initiate a reload.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>initramfs</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">By default, the primary use case mode for
  rpm-ostree is to replicate an initramfs as part of a base layer. However, some
  use cases require locally regenerating it to add configuration or drivers. Use
  <b>rpm-ostree initramfs</b> to inspect the current status.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Use <b>--enable</b> to turn on client side initramfs regeneration. A new
  deployment will be generated, and after reboot, further upgrades will continue
  regenerating. You must reboot for the new initramfs to take effect.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To append additional custom arguments to the initramfs program (currently
  dracut), use <b>--arg</b>. For example, <b>--arg=-I
  --arg=/etc/someconfigfile</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>--disable</b> option will disable regeneration. You must reboot for the
  change to take effect.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ex</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This command offers access to experimental
  features; command line stability is not guaranteed. The available subcommands
  will be listed by invoking <b>rpm-ostree ex</b>. For example, there is
  <b>rpm-ostree ex livefs</b> which is an experimental interface for applying
  changes to the booted deployment.</div>
