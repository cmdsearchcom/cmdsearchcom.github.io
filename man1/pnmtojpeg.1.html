This program is part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pnmtojpeg</b> converts the named PBM, PGM, or PPM image file, or the standard
  input if no file is named, to a JFIF file on the standard output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pnmtojpeg</b> uses the Independent JPEG Group's JPEG library to create the
  output file. See <b></b>
  <a class="Lk" title="Lk" href="http://www.ijg.org">http://www.ijg.org</a> <b>
  for information</b> <b>on the library.</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
'JFIF' is the correct name for the image format commonly known as 'JPEG.'
  Strictly speaking, JPEG is a method of compression. The image format using
  JPEG compression that is by far the most common is JFIF. There is also a
  subformat of TIFF that uses JPEG compression.
<div class="Pp"></div>
EXIF is an image format that is a subformat of JFIF (to wit, a JFIF file that
  contains an EXIF header as an APP1 marker). <b>pnmtojpeg</b> creates an EXIF
  image when you specify the <b>-exif</b> option.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The basic options are:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-exif=</b><i>filespec</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option specifies that the output image is to be EXIF
      (a subformat of JFIF), i.e. it will have an EXIF header as a JFIF APP1
      marker. The contents of that marker are the contents of the specified
      file. The special value <b>-</b> means to read the EXIF header contents
      from standard input. It is invalid to specify standard input for both the
      EXIF header and the input image.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The EXIF file starts with a two byte field which is the length of the file,
      including the length field, in pure binary, most significant byte first.
      The special value of zero for the length field means there is to be no
      EXIF header, i.e. the same as no <b>-exif</b> option. This is useful for
      when you convert a file from JFIF to PNM using <b>jpegtopnm</b>, then
      transform it, then convert it back to JFIF with <b>pnmtojpeg</b>, and you
      don't know whether or not it includes an EXIF header. <b>jpegtopnm</b>
      creates an EXIF file containing nothing but two bytes of zero when the
      input JFIF file has no EXIF header. Thus, you can transfer any EXIF header
      from the input JFIF to the output JFIF without worrying about whether an
      EXIF header actually exists.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The contents of the EXIF file after the length field are the exact byte for
      byte contents of the APP1 marker, not counting the length field, that
      constitutes the EXIF header.

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-rgb</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These options determine the color space used in the JFIF
      output. <b>-grayscale</b> (or <b>-greyscale</b>) means to create a gray
      scale JFIF, converting from color PPM input if necessary. <b>-rgb</b>
      means to create an RGB JFIF, and the program fails if the input is not
      PPM.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you specify neither, The output file is in YCbCr format if the input is
      PPM, and grayscale format if the input is PBM or PGM.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    YCbCr format (a color is represented by an intensity value and two
      chrominance values) usually compresses much better than RGB (a color is
      represented by one red, one green, and one blue value). RGB is rare. But
      you may be able to convert between JFIF and PPM faster with RGB, since
      it's the same color space PPM uses.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>testimg.ppm</b> file that comes with Netpbm is 2.3 times larger with
      the <b>-rgb</b> option than with the YCbCr default, and in one experiment
      <b>pnmtojpeg</b> took 16% more CPU time to convert it. The extra CPU time
      probably indicates that processing of all the extra compressed data
      consumed all the CPU time saved by not having to convert the RGB inputs to
      YCbCr.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Grayscale format takes up a lot less space and takes less time to create and
      process than the color formats, even if the image contains nothing but
      black, white, and gray.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <b>-rgb</b> option was added in Netpbm 10.11 in October 2002.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-density=</b><i>density</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option determines the density (aka resolution)
      information recorded in the JFIF output image. It does not affect the
      raster in any way; it just tells whoever reads the JFIF how to interpret
      the raster.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The density value takes the form <i>x</i><b>x</b><i>y</i> followed by an
      optional unit specifier of <b>dpi</b> or <b>dpcm</b>. Examples:
      <b>1x1</b>, <b>3x2</b>, <b>300x300dpi</b>, <b>100x200dpcm</b>. The first
      number is the horizontal density; the 2nd number is the vertical density.
      Each may be any integer from 1 to 65535. The unit specifier is <b>dpi</b>
      for dots per inch or <b>dpcm</b> for dots per centimeter. If you don't
      specify the units, the density information goes into the JFIF explicitly
      stating &quot;density unspecified&quot; (also interpreted as
      &quot;unknown&quot;). This may seem pointless, but note that even without
      specifying the units, the density numbers tell the aspect ratio of the
      pixels. E.g. <b>1x1</b> tells you the pixels are square. <b>3x2</b> tells
      you the pixels are vertical rectangles.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that if you specify different horizontal and vertical densities, the
      resulting JFIF image is <i>not</i> a true representation of the input PNM
      image, because <b>pnmtojpeg</b> converts the raster pixel-for-pixel and
      the pixels of a PNM image are defined to be square. Thus, if you start
      with a square PNM image and specify <b>-density=3x2</b>, the resulting
      JFIF image is a horizontally squashed version of the original. However, it
      is common to use an input image which is a slight variation on PNM rather
      than true PNM such that the pixels are not square. In that case, the
      appropriate -density option yields a faithful reproduction of the input
      pseudo-PNM image.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The default is 1x1 in unspecified units.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Before Netpbm 10.15 (April 2003), this option did not exist and the

<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-quality</b> option lets you trade off compressed file size against
  quality of the reconstructed image: the higher the quality setting, the larger
  the JFIF file, and the closer the output image will be to the original input.
  Normally you want to use the lowest quality setting (smallest file) that
  decompresses into something visually indistinguishable from the original
  image. For this purpose the quality setting should be between 50 and 95 for
  reasonable results; the default of 75 is often about right. If you see defects
  at <b>-quality=75</b>, then go up 5 or 10 counts at a time until you are happy
  with the output image. (The optimal setting will vary from one image to
  another.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-quality=100</b> generates a quantization table of all 1's, minimizing loss
  in the quantization step (but there is still information loss in subsampling,
  as well as roundoff error). This setting is mainly of interest for
  experimental purposes. Quality values above about 95 are <i>not</i>
  recommended for normal use; the compressed file size goes up dramatically for
  hardly any gain in output image quality.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the other direction, quality values below 50 will produce very small files of
  low image quality. Settings around 5 to 10 might be useful in preparing an
  index of a large image library, for example. Try <b>-quality=2</b> (or so) for
  some amusing Cubist effects. (Note: quality values below about 25 generate
  2-byte quantization tables, which are considered optional in the JFIF
  standard. <b>pnmtojpeg</b> emits a warning message when you give such a
  quality value, because some other JFIF programs may be unable to decode the
  resulting file. Use <b>-baseline</b> if you need to ensure compatibility at
  low quality values.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-progressive</b> option creates a 'progressive JPEG' file. In this type
  of JFIF file, the data is stored in multiple scans of increasing quality. If
  the file is being transmitted over a slow communications link, the decoder can
  use the first scan to display a low-quality image very quickly, and can then
  improve the display with each subsequent scan. The final image is exactly
  equivalent to a standard JFIF file of the same quality setting, and the total
  file size is about the same -- often a little smaller.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Caution:</b> progressive JPEG is not yet widely implemented, so many decoders
  will be unable to view a progressive JPEG file at all.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you're trying to control the quality/file size tradeoff, you might consider
  the JPEG2000 format instead. See <b>pamtojpeg2k</b>(1)

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The author of the FAQ recommends against using arithmetic coding (and therefore
  this option) because the space savings is not great enough to justify the
  legal hassles.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Most JPEG libraries, including any distributed by the Independent JPEG Group
  since about 1998 are not capable of arithmetic encoding. <b>pnmtojpeg</b> uses
  a JPEG library (either bound to it when the <b>pnmtojpeg</b> executable was
  built or accessed on your system at run time) to do the JPEG encoding. If
  <b>pnmtojpeg</b> terminates with the message, 'Sorry, there are legal
  restrictions on arithmetic coding' or 'Sorry, arithmetic coding not
  supported,' this is the problem.

The <b>-restart</b> option tells <b>pnmtojpeg </b> to insert extra markers that
  allow a JPEG decoder to resynchronize after a transmission error. Without
  restart markers, any damage to a compressed file will usually ruin the image
  from the point of the error to the end of the image; with restart markers, the
  damage is usually confined to the portion of the image up to the next restart
  marker. Of course, the restart markers occupy extra space. We recommend
  <b>-restart=1</b> for images that will be transmitted across unreliable
  networks such as Usenet.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-smooth</b> option filters the input to eliminate fine-scale noise. This
  is often useful when converting dithered images to JFIF: a moderate smoothing
  factor of 10 to 50 gets rid of dithering patterns in the input file, resulting
  in a smaller JFIF file and a better-looking image. Too large a smoothing
  factor will visibly blur the image, however.

The 'wizard' options are intended for experimentation with JPEG. If you don't
  know what you are doing, <b>don't use</b> <b>them</b>. These switches are

  Group's JPEG library.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
This example compresses the PPM file foo.ppm with a quality factor of 60 and
  saves the output as foo.jpg:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
     <b>pnmtojpeg -quality=60 foo.ppm &gt; foo.jpg</b>
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here's a more typical example. It converts from BMP to JFIF:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
     <b>cat foo.bmp | bmptoppm | pnmtojpeg &gt; foo.jpg</b>
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="JPEG_Loss"><a class="selflink" href="#JPEG_Loss">JPEG
  Loss</a></h1>
When you compress with JPEG, you lose information -- i.e. the resulting image
  has somewhat lower quality than the original. This is a characteristic of JPEG
  itself, not any particular program. So if you do the usual Netpbm thing and
  convert from JFIF to PNM, manipulate, then convert back to JFIF, you will lose
  quality. The more you do it, the more you lose. Drawings (charts, cartoons,
  line drawings, and such with few colors and sharp edges) suffer the most.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To avoid this, you can use a compressed image format other than JPEG. PNG and
  JPEG2000 are good choices, and Netpbm contains converters for those.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you need to use JFIF on a drawing, you should experiment with
  <b>pnmtojpeg</b>'s <b>-quality</b> and <b>-smooth</b> options to get a
  satisfactory conversion. <b>-smooth 10</b> or so is often helpful.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Because of the loss, you should do all the manipulation you have to do on the
  image in some other format and convert to JFIF as the last step. And if you
  can keep a copy in the original format, so much the better.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>-optimize</b> option to <b>pnmtojpeg</b> is worth using when you are
  making a 'final' version for posting or archiving. It's also a win when you
  are using low quality settings to make very small JFIF files; the percentage
  improvement is often a lot more than it is on larger files. (At present,
  <b>-optimize</b> mode is automatically in effect when you generate a
  progressive JPEG file).
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can do flipping and rotating transformations losslessly with the program
  <b>jpegtran</b>, which is packaged with the Independent Jpeg Group's JPEG
  library. <b>jpegtran</b> exercises its intimate knowledge of the way JPEG
  works to do the transformation without ever actually decompressing the image.

Another program, <b>cjpeg</b>, is similar. <b>cjpeg</b> is maintained by the
  Independent JPEG Group and packaged with the JPEG library which
  <b>pnmtojpeg</b> uses for all its JPEG work. Because of that, you may expect
  it to exploit more current JPEG features. Also, since you have to have the
  library to run <b>pnmtojpeg</b>, but not vice versa, <b>cjpeg</b> may be more
  commonly available.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On the other hand, <b>cjpeg</b> does not use the NetPBM libraries to process its
  input, as all the NetPBM tools such as <b>pnmtojpeg</b> do. This means it is
  less likely to be consistent with all the other programs that deal with the
  NetPBM formats. Also, the command syntax of <b>pnmtojpeg</b> is consistent
  with that of the other Netpbm tools, unlike <b>cjpeg</b>.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SCAN_SCRIPTS"><a class="selflink" href="#SCAN_SCRIPTS">SCAN
  SCRIPTS</a></h1>
Use the <b>-scan</b> option to specify a scan script. Or use the
  <b>-progressive</b> option to specify a particular built-in scan script.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Just what a scan script is, and the basic format of the scan script file, is
  covered in the <b>wizard.doc</b> file that comes with the Independent JPEG
  Group's JPEG library. Scan scripts are same for <b>pnmtojpeg</b> as the are
  for <b>cjpeg</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This section contains additional information that isn't, but probably should be,
  in that document.
<div class="Pp"></div>
First, there are many restrictions on what is a valid scan script. The JPEG
  library, and thus <b>pnmtojpeg</b>, checks thoroughly for any lack of
  compliance with these restrictions, but does little to tell you how the script
  fails to comply. The messages are very general and sometimes untrue.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To start with, the entries for the DC coefficient must come before any entries
  for the AC coefficients. The DC coefficient is Coefficient 0; all the other
  coefficients are AC coefficients. So in an entry for the DC coefficient, the
  two numbers after the colon must be 0 and 0. In an entry for AC coefficients,
  the first number after the colon must not be 0.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In a DC entry, the color components must be in increasing order. E.g. '0,2,1'
  before the colon is wrong. So is '0,0,0'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In an entry for an AC coefficient, you must specify only one color component.
  I.e. there can be only one number before the colon.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the first entry for a particular coefficient for a particular color
  component, the 'Ah' value must be zero, but the Al value can be any valid bit
  number. In subsequent entries, Ah must be the Al value from the previous entry
  (for that coefficient for that color component), and the Al value must be one
  less than the Ah value.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The script must ultimately specify at least some of the DC coefficient for every
  color component. Otherwise, you get the error message 'Script does not
  transmit all the data.' You need not specify all of the bits of the DC
  coefficient, or any of the AC coefficients.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is a standard option in building the JPEG library to omit scan script
  capability. If for some reason your library was built with this option, you
  get the message 'Requested feature was omitted at compile time.'
