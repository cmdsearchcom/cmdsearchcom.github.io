option is acceptable. You may use double hyphens instead of
single hyphen to denote options. You may use white space in

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmtojpeg converts the named
PBM, PGM, or PPM image file, or the standard input if no
file is named, to a JFIF file on the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmtojpeg uses the Independent
JPEG Group&rsquo;s JPEG library to create the output file.
See http://www.ijg.org
&acirc;&uml;http://www.ijg.org&acirc;&copy; for information
on the library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;JFIF&rsquo; is the
correct name for the image format commonly known as
&rsquo;JPEG.&rsquo; Strictly speaking, JPEG is a method of
compression. The image format using JPEG compression that is
by <br>
far the most common is JFIF. There is also a subformat of
TIFF that uses JPEG compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIF is an image format that is
a subformat of JFIF (to wit, a JFIF file that contains an
EXIF header as an APP1 marker). pnmtojpeg creates an EXIF
image when you specify the <br>
-exif option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The basic options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-exif=filespec <br>
This option specifies that the output image is to be EXIF (a
subformat of JFIF), i.e. it will have an EXIF header as a
JFIF APP1 marker. The contents of that marker are <br>
the contents of the specified file. The special value -
means to read the EXIF header contents from standard input.
It is invalid to specify standard input for both the <br>
EXIF header and the input image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The EXIF file starts with a two
byte field which is the length of the file, including the
length field, in pure binary, most significant byte first.
The special value of <br>
zero for the length field means there is to be no EXIF
header, i.e. the same as no -exif option. This is useful for
when you convert a file from JFIF to PNM using jpeg&acirc;
<br>
topnm, then transform it, then convert it back to JFIF with
pnmtojpeg, and you don&rsquo;t know whether or not it
includes an EXIF header. jpegtopnm creates an EXIF file
con&acirc; <br>
taining nothing but two bytes of zero when the input JFIF
file has no EXIF header. Thus, you can transfer any EXIF
header from the input JFIF to the output JFIF without <br>
worrying about whether an EXIF header actually exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The contents of the EXIF file
after the length field are the exact byte for byte contents
of the APP1 marker, not counting the length field, that
constitutes the EXIF <br>
header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quality=n <br>
Scale quantization tables to adjust image quality. n is 0
(worst) to 100 (best); default is 75. Below about 25 can
produce images some interpreters won&rsquo;t be able to <br>
interpret. See below for more info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-grayscale</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-greyscale</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rgb These options determine the
color space used in the JFIF output. -grayscale (or
-greyscale) means to create a gray scale JFIF, converting
from color PPM input if neces&acirc; <br>
sary. -rgb means to create an RGB JFIF, and the program
fails if the input is not PPM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify neither, The
output file is in YCbCr format if the input is PPM, and
grayscale format if the input is PBM or PGM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YCbCr format (a color is
represented by an intensity value and two chrominance
values) usually compresses much better than RGB (a color is
represented by one red, one <br>
green, and one blue value). RGB is rare. But you may be able
to convert between JFIF and PPM faster with RGB, since
it&rsquo;s the same color space PPM uses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The testimg.ppm file that comes
with Netpbm is 2.3 times larger with the -rgb option than
with the YCbCr default, and in one experiment pnmtojpeg took
16% more CPU time to <br>
convert it. The extra CPU time probably indicates that
processing of all the extra compressed data consumed all the
CPU time saved by not having to convert the RGB inputs <br>
to YCbCr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grayscale format takes up a lot
less space and takes less time to create and process than
the color formats, even if the image contains nothing but
black, white, and gray.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -rgb option was added in
Netpbm 10.11 in October 2002.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-density=density <br>
This option determines the density (aka resolution)
information recorded in the JFIF output image. It does not
affect the raster in any way; it just tells whoever reads
<br>
the JFIF how to interpret the raster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The density value takes the form
xxy followed by an optional unit specifier of dpi or dpcm.
Examples: 1x1, 3x2, 300x300dpi, 100x200dpcm. The first
number is the horizon&acirc; <br>
tal density; the 2nd number is the vertical density. Each
may be any integer from 1 to 65535. The unit specifier is
dpi for dots per inch or dpcm for dots per centime&acirc;
<br>
ter. If you don&rsquo;t specify the units, the density
information goes into the JFIF explicitly stating
&quot;density unspecified&quot; (also interpreted as
&quot;unknown&quot;). This may seem <br>
pointless, but note that even without specifying the units,
the density numbers tell the aspect ratio of the pixels.
E.g. 1x1 tells you the pixels are square. 3x2 tells <br>
you the pixels are vertical rectangles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if you specify
different horizontal and vertical densities, the resulting
JFIF image is not a true representation of the input PNM
image, because pnmtojpeg con&acirc; <br>
verts the raster pixel-for-pixel and the pixels of a PNM
image are defined to be square. Thus, if you start with a
square PNM image and specify -density=3x2, the result&acirc;
<br>
ing JFIF image is a horizontally squashed version of the
original. However, it is common to use an input image which
is a slight variation on PNM rather than true PNM <br>
such that the pixels are not square. In that case, the
appropriate -density option yields a faithful reproduction
of the input pseudo-PNM image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is 1x1 in
unspecified units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 10.15 (April
2003), this option did not exist and the pnmtojpeg always
created a JFIF with a density of 1x1 in unspecified
units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-optimize <br>
Perform optimization of entropy encoding parameters. Without
this, pnmtojpeg uses default encoding parameters. -optimize
usually makes the JFIF file a little smaller, <br>
but pnmtojpeg runs somewhat slower and needs much more
memory. Image quality and speed of decompression are
unaffected by -optimize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-progressive <br>
Create a progressive JPEG file (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-comment=text <br>
Include a comment marker in the JFIF output, with comment
text text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without this option, there are
no comment markers in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -quality option lets you
trade off compressed file size against quality of the
reconstructed image: the higher the quality setting, the
larger the JFIF file, and the closer <br>
the output image will be to the original input. Normally you
want to use the lowest quality setting (smallest file) that
decompresses into something visually indistinguishable <br>
from the original image. For this purpose the quality
setting should be between 50 and 95 for reasonable results;
the default of 75 is often about right. If you see defects
at <br>
-quality=75, then go up 5 or 10 counts at a time until you
are happy with the output image. (The optimal setting will
vary from one image to another.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quality=100 generates a
quantization table of all 1&rsquo;s, minimizing loss in the
quantization step (but there is still information loss in
subsampling, as well as roundoff error). <br>
This setting is mainly of interest for experimental
purposes. Quality values above about 95 are not recommended
for normal use; the compressed file size goes up
dramatically for <br>
hardly any gain in output image quality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the other direction, quality
values below 50 will produce very small files of low image
quality. Settings around 5 to 10 might be useful in
preparing an index of a large <br>
image library, for example. Try -quality=2 (or so) for some
amusing Cubist effects. (Note: quality values below about 25
generate 2-byte quantization tables, which are consid&acirc;
<br>
ered optional in the JFIF standard. pnmtojpeg emits a
warning message when you give such a quality value, because
some other JFIF programs may be unable to decode the
resulting <br>
file. Use -baseline if you need to ensure compatibility at
low quality values.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -progressive option creates
a &rsquo;progressive JPEG&rsquo; file. In this type of JFIF
file, the data is stored in multiple scans of increasing
quality. If the file is being transmit&acirc; <br>
ted over a slow communications link, the decoder can use the
first scan to display a low-quality image very quickly, and
can then improve the display with each subsequent scan. <br>
The final image is exactly equivalent to a standard JFIF
file of the same quality setting, and the total file size is
about the same -- often a little smaller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution: progressive JPEG is not
yet widely implemented, so many decoders will be unable to
view a progressive JPEG file at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re trying to
control the quality/file size tradeoff, you might consider
the JPEG2000 format instead. See pamtojpeg2k(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for advanced users:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dct=int <br>
Use integer DCT method (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dct=fast <br>
Use fast integer DCT (less accurate).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dct=float <br>
Use floating-point DCT method. The float method is very
slightly more accurate than the int method, but is much
slower unless your machine has very fast floating-point <br>
hardware. Also note that results of the floating-point
method may vary slightly across machines, while the integer
methods should give the same results everywhere. The <br>
fast integer method is much less accurate than the other
two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-arithmetic <br>
Use arithmetic coding. Default is Huffman encoding.
Arithmetic coding tends to get you a smaller result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may need patent licenses to
use this option. According to the JPEG FAQ
&acirc;&uml;http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq&acirc;&copy; ,
This method is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&amp;T,
and <br>
Mitsubishi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The author of the FAQ recommends
against using arithmetic coding (and therefore this option)
because the space savings is not great enough to justify the
legal hassles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most JPEG libraries, including
any distributed by the Independent JPEG Group since about
1998 are not capable of arithmetic encoding. pnmtojpeg uses
a JPEG library <br>
(either bound to it when the pnmtojpeg executable was built
or accessed on your system at run time) to do the JPEG
encoding. If pnmtojpeg terminates with the message, <br>
&rsquo;Sorry, there are legal restrictions on arithmetic
coding&rsquo; or &rsquo;Sorry, arithmetic coding not
supported,&rsquo; this is the problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-restart=n <br>
Emit a JPEG restart marker every n MCU rows, or every n MCU
blocks if you append B to the number. -restart 0 (the
default) means no restart markers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-smooth=n <br>
Smooth the input image to eliminate dithering noise. n,
ranging from 1 to 100, indicates the strength of smoothing.
0 (the default) means no smoothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maxmemory=n <br>
Set a limit for amount of memory to use in processing large
images. Value is in thousands of bytes, or millions of bytes
if you append M to the number. For example, <br>
-max=4m selects 4,000,000 bytes. If pnmtojpeg needs more
space, it will use temporary files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Print to the Standard Error file messages about the
conversion process. This can be helpful in debugging
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -restart option tells
pnmtojpeg to insert extra markers that allow a JPEG decoder
to resynchronize after a transmission error. Without restart
markers, any damage to a com&acirc; <br>
pressed file will usually ruin the image from the point of
the error to the end of the image; with restart markers, the
damage is usually confined to the portion of the image up
<br>
to the next restart marker. Of course, the restart markers
occupy extra space. We recommend -restart=1 for images that
will be transmitted across unreliable networks such as <br>
Usenet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -smooth option filters the
input to eliminate fine-scale noise. This is often useful
when converting dithered images to JFIF: a moderate
smoothing factor of 10 to 50 gets <br>
rid of dithering patterns in the input file, resulting in a
smaller JFIF file and a better-looking image. Too large a
smoothing factor will visibly blur the image, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for wizards:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-baseline <br>
Force baseline-compatible quantization tables to be
generated. This clamps quantization values to 8 bits even at
low quality settings. (This switch is poorly named, <br>
since it does not ensure that the output is actually
baseline JPEG. For example, you can use -baseline and
-progressive together.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-qtables=filespec <br>
Use the quantization tables given in the specified text
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-qslots=n[,...] <br>
Select which quantization table to use for each color
component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sample=HxV[,...] <br>
Set JPEG sampling factors for each color component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-scans=filespec <br>
Use the scan script given in the specified text file. See
below for information on scan scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tracelevel=N <br>
This sets the level of debug tracing the program outputs as
it runs. 0 means none, and is the default. This level
primarily controls tracing of the JPEG library, and you <br>
can get some pretty interesting information about the
compression process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;wizard&rsquo; options
are intended for experimentation with JPEG. If you
don&rsquo;t know what you are doing, don&rsquo;t use them.
These switches are documented further in the file wiz&acirc;
<br>
ard.doc that comes with the Independent JPEG Group&rsquo;s
JPEG library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
This example compresses the PPM file foo.ppm with a quality
factor of 60 and saves the output as foo.jpg:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmtojpeg -quality=60 foo.ppm
&gt; foo.jpg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s a more typical
example. It converts from BMP to JFIF:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat foo.bmp | bmptoppm |
pnmtojpeg &gt; foo.jpg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JPEG Loss <br>
When you compress with JPEG, you lose information -- i.e.
the resulting image has somewhat lower quality than the
original. This is a characteristic of JPEG itself, not any
par&acirc; <br>
ticular program. So if you do the usual Netpbm thing and
convert from JFIF to PNM, manipulate, then convert back to
JFIF, you will lose quality. The more you do it, the more
<br>
you lose. Drawings (charts, cartoons, line drawings, and
such with few colors and sharp edges) suffer the most.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To avoid this, you can use a
compressed image format other than JPEG. PNG and JPEG2000
are good choices, and Netpbm contains converters for
those.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need to use JFIF on a
drawing, you should experiment with pnmtojpeg&rsquo;s
-quality and -smooth options to get a satisfactory
conversion. -smooth 10 or so is often helpful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because of the loss, you should
do all the manipulation you have to do on the image in some
other format and convert to JFIF as the last step. And if
you can keep a copy in the <br>
original format, so much the better.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -optimize option to
pnmtojpeg is worth using when you are making a
&rsquo;final&rsquo; version for posting or archiving.
It&rsquo;s also a win when you are using low quality
settings to make <br>
very small JFIF files; the percentage improvement is often a
lot more than it is on larger files. (At present, -optimize
mode is automatically in effect when you generate a
pro&acirc; <br>
gressive JPEG file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can do flipping and rotating
transformations losslessly with the program jpegtran, which
is packaged with the Independent Jpeg Group&rsquo;s JPEG
library. jpegtran exercises its <br>
intimate knowledge of the way JPEG works to do the
transformation without ever actually decompressing the
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another program, cjpeg, is
similar. cjpeg is <br>
maintained by the Independent JPEG Group and packaged with
the JPEG library which pnmtojpeg uses for all its JPEG work.
Because of that, you may expect it to exploit more
cur&acirc; <br>
rent JPEG features. Also, since you have to have the library
to run pnmtojpeg, but not vice versa, cjpeg may be more
commonly available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the other hand, cjpeg does
not use the NetPBM libraries to process its input, as all
the NetPBM tools such as pnmtojpeg do. This means it is less
likely to be consistent with <br>
all the other programs that deal with the NetPBM formats.
Also, the command syntax of pnmtojpeg is consistent with
that of the other Netpbm tools, unlike cjpeg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCAN SCRIPTS <br>
Use the -scan option to specify a scan script. Or use the
-progressive option to specify a particular built-in scan
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Just what a scan script is, and
the basic format of the scan script file, is covered in the
wizard.doc file that comes with the Independent JPEG
Group&rsquo;s JPEG library. Scan <br>
scripts are same for pnmtojpeg as the are for cjpeg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This section contains additional
information that isn&rsquo;t, but probably should be, in
that document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, there are many
restrictions on what is a valid scan script. The JPEG
library, and thus pnmtojpeg, checks thoroughly for any lack
of compliance with these restrictions, <br>
but does little to tell you how the script fails to comply.
The messages are very general and sometimes untrue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start with, the entries for
the DC coefficient must come before any entries for the AC
coefficients. The DC coefficient is Coefficient 0; all the
other coefficients are AC <br>
coefficients. So in an entry for the DC coefficient, the two
numbers after the colon must be 0 and 0. In an entry for AC
coefficients, the first number after the colon must not <br>
be 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a DC entry, the color
components must be in increasing order. E.g.
&rsquo;0,2,1&rsquo; before the colon is wrong. So is
&rsquo;0,0,0&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In an entry for an AC
coefficient, you must specify only one color component. I.e.
there can be only one number before the colon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the first entry for a
particular coefficient for a particular color component, the
&rsquo;Ah&rsquo; value must be zero, but the Al value can be
any valid bit number. In subsequent <br>
entries, Ah must be the Al value from the previous entry
(for that coefficient for that color component), and the Al
value must be one less than the Ah value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The script must ultimately
specify at least some of the DC coefficient for every color
component. Otherwise, you get the error message
&rsquo;Script does not transmit all the data.&rsquo; <br>
You need not specify all of the bits of the DC coefficient,
or any of the AC coefficients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a standard option in
building the JPEG library to omit scan script capability. If
for some reason your library was built with this option, you
get the message <br>
&rsquo;Requested feature was omitted at compile
time.&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
JPEGMEM <br>
If this environment variable is set, its value is the
default memory limit. The value is specified as described
for the -maxmemory option. An explicit -maxmemory option
<br>
overrides any JPEGMEM.</p>
