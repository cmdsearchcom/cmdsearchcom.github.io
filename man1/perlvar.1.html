<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_Syntax_of_Variable_Names"><a class="selflink" href="#The_Syntax_of_Variable_Names">The
  Syntax of Variable Names</a></h2>
Variable names in Perl can have several formats. Usually, they must begin with a
  letter or underscore, in which case they can be arbitrarily long (up to an
  internal limit of 251 characters) and may contain letters, digits,
  underscores, or the special sequence &quot;::&quot; or &quot;'&quot;. In this
  case, the part before the last &quot;::&quot; or &quot;'&quot; is taken to be
  a <i>package qualifier</i>; see perlmod.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl variable names may also be a sequence of digits or a single punctuation or
  control character. These names are all reserved for special uses by Perl; for
  example, the all-digits names are used to hold data captured by backreferences
  after a regular expression match. Perl has a special syntax for the
  single-control-character names: It understands &quot;^X&quot; (caret
  &quot;X&quot;) to mean the control-&quot;X&quot; character. For example, the
  notation $^W (dollar-sign caret &quot;W&quot;) is the scalar variable whose
  name is the single character control-&quot;W&quot;. This is better than typing
  a literal control-&quot;W&quot; into your program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since Perl 5.6, Perl variable names may be alphanumeric strings that begin with
  control characters (or better yet, a caret). These variables must be written
  in the form &quot;${^Foo}&quot;; the braces are not optional.
  &quot;${^Foo}&quot; denotes the scalar variable whose name is a
  control-&quot;F&quot; followed by two &quot;o&quot;'s. These variables are
  reserved for future special uses by Perl, except for the ones that begin with
  &quot;^_&quot; (control-underscore or caret-underscore). No control-character
  name that begins with &quot;^_&quot; will acquire a special meaning in any
  future version of Perl; such names may therefore be used safely in programs.
  $^_ itself, however, <i>is</i> reserved.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl identifiers that begin with digits, control characters, or punctuation
  characters are exempt from the effects of the &quot;package&quot; declaration
  and are always forced to be in package &quot;main&quot;; they are also exempt
  from &quot;strict 'vars'&quot; errors. A few other names are also exempt in
  these ways:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    ENV      STDIN
    INC      STDOUT
    ARGV     STDERR
    ARGVOUT
    SIG
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In particular, the special &quot;${^_XYZ}&quot; variables are always taken to be
  in package &quot;main&quot;, regardless of any &quot;package&quot;
  declarations presently in scope.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SPECIAL_VARIABLES"><a class="selflink" href="#SPECIAL_VARIABLES">SPECIAL
  VARIABLES</a></h1>
The following names have special meaning to Perl. Most punctuation names have
  reasonable mnemonics, or analogs in the shells. Nevertheless, if you wish to
  use long variable names, you need only say:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use English;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
at the top of your program. This aliases all the short names to the long names
  in the current package. Some even have medium names, generally borrowed from
  <b>awk</b>. To avoid a performance hit, if you don't need the $PREMATCH,
  $MATCH, or $POSTMATCH it's best to use the &quot;English&quot; module without
  them:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use English '-no_match_vars';
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before you continue, note the sort order for variables. In general, we first
  list the variables in case-insensitive, almost-lexigraphical order (ignoring
  the &quot;{&quot; or &quot;^&quot; preceding words, as in
  &quot;${^UNICODE}&quot; or $^T), although $_ and @_ move up to the top of the
  pile. For variables with the same identifier, we list it in order of scalar,
  array, hash, and bareword.

As $_ is a global variable, this may lead in some cases to unwanted
  side-effects. As of perl 5.10, you can now use a lexical version of $_ by
  declaring it in a file or in a block with &quot;my&quot;. Moreover, declaring
  &quot;our $_&quot; restores the global $_ in the current scope.

    Note for Linux and Debian GNU/kFreeBSD users: Before Perl v5.16.0 perl would
      emulate POSIX semantics on Linux systems using LinuxThreads, a partial
      implementation of POSIX Threads that has since been superseded by the
      Native POSIX Thread Library (NPTL).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    LinuxThreads is now obsolete on Linux, and and caching &quot;getpid()&quot;
      like this made embedding perl unnecessarily complex (since you'd have to
      manually update the value of $$), so now $$ and &quot;getppid()&quot; will
      always return the same values as the underlying C library.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Debian GNU/kFreeBSD systems also used LinuxThreads up until and including
      the 6.0 release, but after that moved to FreeBSD thread semantics, which
      are POSIX-like.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    To see if your system is affected by this discrepancy check if &quot;getconf
      GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION | grep -q NPTL&quot; returns a false value. NTPL
      threads preserve the POSIX semantics.

    On some (but not all) operating systems assigning to $0 modifies the
      argument area that the &quot;ps&quot; program sees. On some platforms you
      may have to use special &quot;ps&quot; options or a different
      &quot;ps&quot; to see the changes. Modifying the $0 is more useful as a
      way of indicating the current program state than it is for hiding the
      program you're running.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that there are platform-specific limitations on the maximum length of
      $0. In the most extreme case it may be limited to the space occupied by
      the original $0.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In some platforms there may be arbitrary amount of padding, for example
      space characters, after the modified name as shown by &quot;ps&quot;. In
      some platforms this padding may extend all the way to the original length
      of the argument area, no matter what you do (this is the case for example
      with Linux 2.2).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note for BSD users: setting $0 does not completely remove &quot;perl&quot;
      from the <i>ps</i>(1) output. For example, setting $0 to
      &quot;foobar&quot; may result in &quot;perl: foobar (perl)&quot; (whether
      both the &quot;perl: &quot; prefix and the &quot; (perl)&quot; suffix are
      shown depends on your exact BSD variant and version). This is an operating
      system feature, Perl cannot help it.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In multithreaded scripts Perl coordinates the threads so that any thread may
      modify its copy of the $0 and the change becomes visible to <i>ps</i>(1)
      (assuming the operating system plays along). Note that the view of $0 the
      other threads have will not change since they have their own copies of it.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the program has been given to perl via the switches &quot;-e&quot; or
      &quot;-E&quot;, $0 will contain the string &quot;-e&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    On Linux as of perl 5.14 the legacy process name will be set with prctl(2),
      in addition to altering the POSIX name via &quot;argv[0]&quot; as perl has
      done since version 4.000. Now system utilities that read the legacy
      process name such as ps, top and killall will recognize the name you set
      when assigning to $0. The string you supply will be cut off at 16 bytes,
      this is a limitation imposed by Linux.

    Similarly, a value assigned to $) must also be a space-separated list of

  <dd class="It-tag">The hash %SIG contains signal handlers for signals. For

    <pre>
    sub handler {   # 1st argument is signal name
        my($sig) = @_;

        close(LOG);
        exit(0);

    $SIG{'QUIT'} = \&amp;handler;
    ...
    $SIG{'INT'}  = 'DEFAULT';   # restore default action
    $SIG{'QUIT'} = 'IGNORE';    # ignore SIGQUIT
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Using a value of 'IGNORE' usually has the effect of ignoring the signal,
      except for the &quot;CHLD&quot; signal. See perlipc for more about this
      special case.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Here are some other examples:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

    $SIG{&quot;PIPE&quot;} = \&amp;Plumber;   # just fine; assume current
                                # Plumber
    $SIG{&quot;PIPE&quot;} = *Plumber;    # somewhat esoteric
    $SIG{&quot;PIPE&quot;} = Plumber();   # oops, what did Plumber()
                                # return??
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Be sure not to use a bareword as the name of a signal handler, lest you
      inadvertently call it.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If your system has the &quot;sigaction()&quot; function then signal handlers
      are installed using it. This means you get reliable signal handling.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The default delivery policy of signals changed in Perl 5.8.0 from immediate
      (also known as &quot;unsafe&quot;) to deferred, also known as &quot;safe
      signals&quot;. See perlipc for more information.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Certain internal hooks can be also set using the %SIG hash. The routine
      indicated by $SIG{__WARN__} is called when a warning message is about to
      be printed. The warning message is passed as the first argument. The
      presence of a &quot;__WARN__&quot; hook causes the ordinary printing of
      warnings to &quot;STDERR&quot; to be suppressed. You can use this to save
      warnings in a variable, or turn warnings into fatal errors, like this:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    local $SIG{__WARN__} = sub { die $_[0] };
    eval $proggie;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    As the 'IGNORE' hook is not supported by &quot;__WARN__&quot;, you can
      disable warnings using the empty subroutine:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    local $SIG{__WARN__} = sub {};
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The routine indicated by $SIG{__DIE__} is called when a fatal exception is
      about to be thrown. The error message is passed as the first argument.
      When a &quot;__DIE__&quot; hook routine returns, the exception processing
      continues as it would have in the absence of the hook, unless the hook
      routine itself exits via a &quot;goto &amp;sub&quot;, a loop exit, or a
      &quot;die()&quot;. The &quot;__DIE__&quot; handler is explicitly disabled
      during the call, so that you can die from a &quot;__DIE__&quot; handler.
      Similarly for &quot;__WARN__&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Due to an implementation glitch, the $SIG{__DIE__} hook is called even
      inside an &quot;eval()&quot;. Do not use this to rewrite a pending
      exception in $@, or as a bizarre substitute for overriding
      &quot;CORE::GLOBAL::die()&quot;. This strange action at a distance may be
      fixed in a future release so that $SIG{__DIE__} is only called if your
      program is about to exit, as was the original intent. Any other use is
      deprecated.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;__DIE__&quot;/&quot;__WARN__&quot; handlers are very special in one
      respect: they may be called to report (probable) errors found by the
      parser. In such a case the parser may be in inconsistent state, so any
      attempt to evaluate Perl code from such a handler will probably result in
      a segfault. This means that warnings or errors that result from parsing
      Perl should be used with extreme caution, like this:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    require Carp if defined $^S;
    Carp::confess(&quot;Something wrong&quot;) if defined &amp;Carp::confess;
    die &quot;Something wrong, but could not load Carp to give &quot;
      . &quot;backtrace...\n\t&quot;
      . &quot;To see backtrace try starting Perl with -MCarp switch&quot;;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Here the first line will load &quot;Carp&quot; <i>unless</i> it is the
      parser who called the handler. The second line will print backtrace and
      die if &quot;Carp&quot; was available. The third line will be executed
      only if &quot;Carp&quot; was not available.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Having to even think about the $^S variable in your exception handlers is
      simply wrong. $SIG{__DIE__} as currently implemented invites grievous and
      difficult to track down errors. Avoid it and use an &quot;END{}&quot; or
      CORE::GLOBAL::die override instead.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    $^V can be used to determine whether the Perl interpreter executing a script

    Depending on the host operating system, the value of $^X may be a relative
      or absolute pathname of the perl program file, or may be the string used
      to invoke perl but not the pathname of the perl program file. Also, most
      operating systems permit invoking programs that are not in the PATH
      environment variable, so there is no guarantee that the value of $^X is in
      PATH. For VMS, the value may or may not include a version number.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You usually can use the value of $^X to re-invoke an independent copy of the
      same perl that is currently running, e.g.,
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    @first_run = `$^X -le &quot;print int rand 100 for 1..100&quot;`;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    But recall that not all operating systems support forking or capturing of
      the output of commands, so this complex statement may not be portable.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    It is not safe to use the value of $^X as a path name of a file, as some
      operating systems that have a mandatory suffix on executable files do not
      require use of the suffix when invoking a command. To convert the value of
      $^X to a path name, use the following statements:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    # Build up a set of file names (not command names).
    use Config;
    my $this_perl = $^X;
    if ($^O ne 'VMS') {
        $this_perl .= $Config{_exe}
          unless $this_perl =~ m/$Config{_exe}$/i;
        }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Because many operating systems permit anyone with read access to the Perl
      program file to make a copy of it, patch the copy, and then execute the
      copy, the security-conscious Perl programmer should take care to invoke
      the installed copy of perl, not the copy referenced by $^X. The following
      statements accomplish this goal, and produce a pathname that can be
      invoked as a command or referenced as a file.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    use Config;
    my $secure_perl_path = $Config{perlpath};
    if ($^O ne 'VMS') {
        $secure_perl_path .= $Config{_exe}

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Variables_related_to_regular_expressions"><a class="selflink" href="#Variables_related_to_regular_expressions">Variables
  related to regular expressions</a></h2>
Most of the special variables related to regular expressions are side effects.
  Perl sets these variables when it has a successful match, so you should check
  the match result before using them. For instance:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    if( /P(A)TT(ER)N/ ) {
        print &quot;I found $1 and $2\n&quot;;
        }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
These variables are read-only and dynamically-scoped, unless we note otherwise.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The dynamic nature of the regular expression variables means that their value is
  limited to the block that they are in, as demonstrated by this bit of code:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    my $outer = 'Wallace and Grommit';
    my $inner = 'Mutt and Jeff';
    my $pattern = qr/(\S+) and (\S+)/;
    sub show_n { print &quot;\$1 is $1; \$2 is $2\n&quot; }
    {
    OUTER:
        show_n() if $outer =~ m/$pattern/;
        INNER: {
            show_n() if $inner =~ m/$pattern/;
            }
        show_n();
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The output shows that while in the &quot;OUTER&quot; block, the values of $1 and
  $2 are from the match against $outer. Inside the &quot;INNER&quot; block, the
  values of $1 and $2 are from the match against $inner, but only until the end
  of the block (i.e. the dynamic scope). After the &quot;INNER&quot; block
  completes, the values of $1 and $2 return to the values for the match against
  $outer even though we have not made another match:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $1 is Wallace; $2 is Grommit
    $1 is Mutt; $2 is Jeff
    $1 is Wallace; $2 is Grommit
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Due to an unfortunate accident of Perl's implementation, &quot;use English&quot;
  imposes a considerable performance penalty on all regular expression matches
  in a program because it uses the &quot;$`&quot;, $&amp;, and &quot;$'&quot;,
  regardless of whether they occur in the scope of &quot;use English&quot;. For
  that reason, saying &quot;use English&quot; in libraries is strongly
  discouraged unless you import it without the match variables:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use English '-no_match_vars'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;Devel::NYTProf&quot; and &quot;Devel::FindAmpersand&quot; modules can
  help you find uses of these problematic match variables in your code.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since Perl 5.10, you can use the &quot;/p&quot; match operator flag and the
  &quot;${^PREMATCH}&quot;, &quot;${^MATCH}&quot;, and &quot;${^POSTMATCH}&quot;
  variables instead so you only suffer the performance penalties.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">$&lt;<i>digits</i>&gt; ($1, $2, ...)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Contains the subpattern from the corresponding set of

      patterns matched in nested blocks that have been exited already.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    These variables are read-only and dynamically-scoped.

    The use of this variable anywhere in a program imposes a considerable
      performance penalty on all regular expression matches. To avoid this
      penalty, you can extract the same substring by using &quot;@-&quot;.
      Starting with Perl 5.10, you can use the &quot;/p&quot; match flag and the
      &quot;${^MATCH}&quot; variable to do the same thing for particular match
      operations.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Variables_related_to_filehandles"><a class="selflink" href="#Variables_related_to_filehandles">Variables
  related to filehandles</a></h2>
Variables that depend on the currently selected filehandle may be set by calling
  an appropriate object method on the &quot;IO::Handle&quot; object, although
  this is less efficient than using the regular built-in variables. (Summary
  lines below for this contain the word HANDLE.) First you must say
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use IO::Handle;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
after which you may use either
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    method HANDLE EXPR
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or more safely,
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    HANDLE-&gt;method(EXPR)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each method returns the old value of the &quot;IO::Handle&quot; attribute. The
  methods each take an optional EXPR, which, if supplied, specifies the new
  value for the &quot;IO::Handle&quot; attribute in question. If not supplied,
  most methods do nothing to the current value--except for
  &quot;autoflush()&quot;, which will assume a 1 for you, just to be different.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Because loading in the &quot;IO::Handle&quot; class is an expensive operation,
  you should learn how to use the regular built-in variables.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A few of these variables are considered &quot;read-only&quot;. This means that
  if you try to assign to this variable, either directly or indirectly through a
  reference, you'll raise a run-time exception.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You should be very careful when modifying the default values of most special
  variables described in this document. In most cases you want to localize these
  variables before changing them, since if you don't, the change may affect
  other modules which rely on the default values of the special variables that
  you have changed. This is one of the correct ways to read the whole file at
  once:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;foo&quot; or die $!;
    local $/; # enable localized slurp mode
    my $content = &lt;$fh&gt;;
    close $fh;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
But the following code is quite bad:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;foo&quot; or die $!;
    undef $/; # enable slurp mode
    my $content = &lt;$fh&gt;;
    close $fh;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
since some other module, may want to read data from some file in the default
  &quot;line mode&quot;, so if the code we have just presented has been
  executed, the global value of $/ is now changed for any other code running
  inside the same Perl interpreter.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Usually when a variable is localized you want to make sure that this change
  affects the shortest scope possible. So unless you are already inside some
  short &quot;{}&quot; block, you should create one yourself. For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    my $content = '';
    open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;foo&quot; or die $!;
    {
        local $/;
        $content = &lt;$fh&gt;;
    }
    close $fh;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here is an example of how your own code can go broken:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    for ( 1..3 ){
        $\ = &quot;\r\n&quot;;
        nasty_break();
        print &quot;$_&quot;;
    }
    sub nasty_break {
        $\ = &quot;\f&quot;;
        # do something with $_
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You probably expect this code to print the equivalent of
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    &quot;1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
but instead you get:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    &quot;1\f2\f3\f&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Why? Because &quot;nasty_break()&quot; modifies &quot;$\&quot; without
  localizing it first. The value you set in &quot;nasty_break()&quot; is still
  there when you return. The fix is to add &quot;local()&quot; so the value
  doesn't leak out of &quot;nasty_break()&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    local $\ = &quot;\f&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It's easy to notice the problem in such a short example, but in more complicated
  code you are looking for trouble if you don't localize changes to the special
  variables.

  <dd class="It-tag">Current line number for the last filehandle accessed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Each filehandle in Perl counts the number of lines that have been read from
      it. (Depending on the value of $/, Perl's idea of what constitutes a line
      may not match yours.) When a line is read from a filehandle (via
      &quot;readline()&quot; or &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;), or when
      &quot;tell()&quot; or &quot;seek()&quot; is called on it, $. becomes an
      alias to the line counter for that filehandle.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You can adjust the counter by assigning to $., but this will not actually
      move the seek pointer. <i>Localizing </i><i>$.</i><i> will not
      localize</i> <i>the filehandle's line count</i>. Instead, it will localize
      perl's notion of which filehandle $. is currently aliased to.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    $. is reset when the filehandle is closed, but <b>not</b> when an open
      filehandle is reopened without an intervening &quot;close()&quot;. For
      more details, see &quot;I/O Operators&quot; in perlop. Because
      &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; never does an explicit close, line numbers increase
      across &quot;ARGV&quot; files (but see examples in &quot;eof&quot; in
      perlfunc).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You can also use &quot;HANDLE-&gt;input_line_number(EXPR)&quot; to access
      the line counter for a given filehandle without having to worry about
      which handle you last accessed.

  <dd class="It-tag">The input record separator, newline by default. This
      influences Perl's idea of what a &quot;line&quot; is. Works like
      <b>awk</b>'s RS variable, including treating empty lines as a terminator
      if set to the null string (an empty line cannot contain any spaces or
      tabs). You may set it to a multi-character string to match a
      multi-character terminator, or to &quot;undef&quot; to read through the
      end of file. Setting it to &quot;\n\n&quot; means something slightly
      different than setting to &quot;&quot;, if the file contains consecutive
      empty lines. Setting to &quot;&quot; will treat two or more consecutive
      empty lines as a single empty line. Setting to &quot;\n\n&quot; will
      blindly assume that the next input character belongs to the next
      paragraph, even if it's a newline.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    local $/;           # enable &quot;slurp&quot; mode
    local $_ = &lt;FH&gt;;    # whole file now here
    s/\n[ \t]+/ /g;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Remember: the value of $/ is a string, not a regex. <b>awk</b> has to be
      better for something. :-)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Setting $/ to a reference to an integer, scalar containing an integer, or
      scalar that's convertible to an integer will attempt to read records
      instead of lines, with the maximum record size being the referenced
      integer. So this:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    local $/ = \32768; # or \&quot;32768&quot;, or \$var_containing_32768
    open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, $myfile or die $!;
    local $_ = &lt;$fh&gt;;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    will read a record of no more than 32768 bytes from FILE. If you're not
      reading from a record-oriented file (or your OS doesn't have
      record-oriented files), then you'll likely get a full chunk of data with
      every read. If a record is larger than the record size you've set, you'll
      get the record back in pieces. Trying to set the record size to zero or
      less will cause reading in the (rest of the) whole file.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    On VMS only, record reads bypass PerlIO layers and any associated
      buffering,so you must not mix record and non-record reads on the same
      filehandle. Record mode mixes with line mode only when the same buffering
      layer is in use for both modes.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you perform a record read on a FILE with an encoding layer such as
      &quot;:encoding(latin1)&quot; or &quot;:utf8&quot;, you may get an invalid
      string as a result, may leave the FILE positioned between characters in
      the stream and may not be reading the number of bytes from the underlying
      file that you specified. This behaviour may change without warning in a
      future version of perl.

      primarily when you are outputting to a pipe or socket, such as when you

      it's happening. This has no effect on input buffering. See

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Error_Variables"><a class="selflink" href="#Error_Variables">Error
  Variables</a></h2>
The variables $@, $!, $^E, and $? contain information about different types of
  error conditions that may appear during execution of a Perl program. The
  variables are shown ordered by the &quot;distance&quot; between the subsystem
  which reported the error and the Perl process. They correspond to errors
  detected by the Perl interpreter, C library, operating system, or an external
  program, respectively.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To illustrate the differences between these variables, consider the following
  Perl expression, which uses a single-quoted string. After execution of this
  statement, perl may have set all four special error variables:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    eval q{
        open my $pipe, &quot;/cdrom/install |&quot; or die $!;
        my @res = &lt;$pipe&gt;;
        close $pipe or die &quot;bad pipe: $?, $!&quot;;
    };
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When perl executes the &quot;eval()&quot; expression, it translates the
  &quot;open()&quot;, &quot;&lt;PIPE&gt;&quot;, and &quot;close&quot; calls in
  the C run-time library and thence to the operating system kernel. perl sets $!
  to the C library's &quot;errno&quot; if one of these calls fails.
<div class="Pp"></div>
$@ is set if the string to be &quot;eval&quot;-ed did not compile (this may
  happen if &quot;open&quot; or &quot;close&quot; were imported with bad
  prototypes), or if Perl code executed during evaluation &quot;die()&quot;d. In
  these cases the value of $@ is the compile error, or the argument to
  &quot;die&quot; (which will interpolate $! and $?). (See also Fatal, though.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Under a few operating systems, $^E may contain a more verbose error indicator,
  such as in this case, &quot;CDROM tray not closed.&quot; Systems that do not
  support extended error messages leave $^E the same as $!.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, $? may be set to non-0 value if the external program
  <i>/cdrom/install</i> fails. The upper eight bits reflect specific error
  conditions encountered by the program (the program's &quot;exit()&quot;
  value). The lower eight bits reflect mode of failure, like signal death and
  core dump information. See <i>wait</i>(2) for details. In contrast to $! and
  $^E, which are set only if error condition is detected, the variable $? is set
  on each &quot;wait&quot; or pipe &quot;close&quot;, overwriting the old value.
  This is more like $@, which on every &quot;eval()&quot; is always set on
  failure and cleared on success.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For more details, see the individual descriptions at $@, $!, $^E, and $?.
<dl class="Bl-tag">

      POSIX-like systems this value can be decoded with the WIFEXITED,
      WEXITSTATUS, WIFSIGNALED, WTERMSIG, WIFSTOPPED, WSTOPSIG and WIFCONTINUED
      functions provided by the POSIX module.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Under VMS this reflects the actual VMS exit status; i.e. it is the same as
      $? when the pragma &quot;use vmsish 'status'&quot; is in effect.

      At the moment, this differs from $! under only VMS, OS/2, and Win32 (and
      for MacPerl). On all other platforms, $^E is always just the same as $!.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Under VMS, $^E provides the VMS status value from the last system error.
      This is more specific information about the last system error than that
      provided by $!. This is particularly important when $! is set to
      <b>EVMSERR</b>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Under OS/2, $^E is set to the error code of the last call to OS/2 API either
      via CRT, or directly from perl.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Under Win32, $^E always returns the last error information reported by the
      Win32 call &quot;GetLastError()&quot; which describes the last error from
      within the Win32 API. Most Win32-specific code will report errors via $^E.
      ANSI C and Unix-like calls set &quot;errno&quot; and so most portable Perl
      code will report errors via $!.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Caveats mentioned in the description of $! generally apply to $^E, also.

      yields the system error string corresponding to &quot;errno&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Many system or library calls set &quot;errno&quot; if they fail, to indicate
      the cause of failure. They usually do <b>not</b> set &quot;errno&quot; to
      zero if they succeed. This means &quot;errno&quot;, hence $!, is
      meaningful only <i>immediately</i> after a <b>failure</b>:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    if (open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, $filename) {
                # Here $! is meaningless.
                ...
    }
    else {
                # ONLY here is $! meaningful.
                ...
                # Already here $! might be meaningless.
    }
    # Since here we might have either success or failure,
    # $! is meaningless.
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Here, <i>meaningless</i> means that $! may be unrelated to the outcome of
      the &quot;open()&quot; operator. Assignment to $! is similarly ephemeral.
      It can be used immediately before invoking the &quot;die()&quot; operator,
      to set the exit value, or to inspect the system error string corresponding

    Inside an &quot;END&quot; subroutine $? contains the value that is going to

    <pre>

This variable was added in Perl 5.14.0.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">$^H</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">WARNING: This variable is strictly for internal use only.
      Its availability, behavior, and contents are subject to change without
      notice.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This variable contains compile-time hints for the Perl interpreter. At the
      end of compilation of a BLOCK the value of this variable is restored to
      the value when the interpreter started to compile the BLOCK.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When perl begins to parse any block construct that provides a lexical scope
      (e.g., eval body, required file, subroutine body, loop body, or
      conditional block), the existing value of $^H is saved, but its value is
      left unchanged. When the compilation of the block is completed, it regains
      the saved value. Between the points where its value is saved and restored,
      code that executes within BEGIN blocks is free to change the value of $^H.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This behavior provides the semantic of lexical scoping, and is used in, for
      instance, the &quot;use strict&quot; pragma.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The contents should be an integer; different bits of it are used for
      different pragmatic flags. Here's an example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    sub add_100 { $^H |= 0x100 }
    sub foo {
        BEGIN { add_100() }
        bar-&gt;baz($boon);
    }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Consider what happens during execution of the BEGIN block. At this point the
      BEGIN block has already been compiled, but the body of &quot;foo()&quot;
      is still being compiled. The new value of $^H will therefore be visible
      only while the body of &quot;foo()&quot; is being compiled.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Substitution of &quot;BEGIN { add_100() }&quot; block with:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    BEGIN { require strict; strict-&gt;import('vars') }
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    demonstrates how &quot;use strict 'vars'&quot; is implemented. Here's a
      conditional version of the same lexical pragma:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    BEGIN {
        require strict; strict-&gt;import('vars') if $condition
    }

  <dt class="It-tag">%^H</dt>

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When putting items into &quot;%^H&quot;, in order to avoid conflicting with
      other users of the hash there is a convention regarding which keys to use.
      A module should use only keys that begin with the module's name (the name
      of its main package) and a &quot;/&quot; character. For example, a module
      &quot;Foo::Bar&quot; should use keys such as &quot;Foo::Bar/baz&quot;.

    As of release 5 of Perl, assignment to $[ is treated as a compiler

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Prior to Perl 5.10, assignment to $[ could be seen from outer lexical scopes
      in the same file, unlike other compile-time directives (such as strict).
      Using <i>local()</i> on it would bind its value strictly to a lexical

    The version + patchlevel / 1000 of the Perl interpreter. This variable can
      be used to determine whether the Perl interpreter executing a script is in
      the right range of versions:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    warn &quot;No checksumming!\n&quot; if $] &lt; 3.019;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The floating point representation can sometimes lead to inaccurate numeric
      comparisons.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    See also the documentation of &quot;use VERSION&quot; and &quot;require
      VERSION&quot; for a convenient way to fail if the running Perl interpreter
      is too old.
