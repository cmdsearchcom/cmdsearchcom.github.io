<p>PERLVAR(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLVAR(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlvar - Perl predefined variables</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The Syntax of Variable Names <br>
Variable names in Perl can have several formats. Usually,
they must begin with a letter or underscore, in which case
they can be arbitrarily long (up to an internal limit of 251
<br>
characters) and may contain letters, digits, underscores, or
the special sequence &quot;::&quot; or &quot;&rsquo;&quot;.
In this case, the part before the last &quot;::&quot; or
&quot;&rsquo;&quot; is taken to be a package <br>
qualifier; see perlmod.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl variable names may also be
a sequence of digits or a single punctuation or control
character. These names are all reserved for special uses by
Perl; for example, the all- <br>
digits names are used to hold data captured by
backreferences after a regular expression match. Perl has a
special syntax for the single-control-character names: It
understands <br>
&quot;^X&quot; (caret &quot;X&quot;) to mean the
control-&quot;X&quot; character. For example, the notation
$^W (dollar-sign caret &quot;W&quot;) is the scalar variable
whose name is the single character control-&quot;W&quot;.
<br>
This is better than typing a literal control-&quot;W&quot;
into your program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since Perl 5.6, Perl variable
names may be alphanumeric strings that begin with control
characters (or better yet, a caret). These variables must be
written in the form <br>
&quot;${^Foo}&quot;; the braces are not optional.
&quot;${^Foo}&quot; denotes the scalar variable whose name
is a control-&quot;F&quot; followed by two
&quot;o&quot;&rsquo;s. These variables are reserved for
future special <br>
uses by Perl, except for the ones that begin with
&quot;^_&quot; (control-underscore or caret-underscore). No
control-character name that begins with &quot;^_&quot; will
acquire a special meaning <br>
in any future version of Perl; such names may therefore be
used safely in programs. $^_ itself, however, is
reserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl identifiers that begin with
digits, control characters, or punctuation characters are
exempt from the effects of the &quot;package&quot;
declaration and are always forced to be in <br>
package &quot;main&quot;; they are also exempt from
&quot;strict &rsquo;vars&rsquo;&quot; errors. A few other
names are also exempt in these ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENV STDIN <br>
INC STDOUT <br>
ARGV STDERR <br>
ARGVOUT <br>
SIG</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In particular, the special
&quot;${^_XYZ}&quot; variables are always taken to be in
package &quot;main&quot;, regardless of any
&quot;package&quot; declarations presently in scope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPECIAL VARIABLES <br>
The following names have special meaning to Perl. Most
punctuation names have reasonable mnemonics, or analogs in
the shells. Nevertheless, if you wish to use long variable
<br>
names, you need only say:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use English;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">at the top of your program. This
aliases all the short names to the long names in the current
package. Some even have medium names, generally borrowed
from awk. To avoid a <br>
performance hit, if you don&rsquo;t need the $PREMATCH,
$MATCH, or $POSTMATCH it&rsquo;s best to use the
&quot;English&quot; module without them:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use English
&rsquo;-no_match_vars&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before you continue, note the
sort order for variables. In general, we first list the
variables in case-insensitive, almost-lexigraphical order
(ignoring the &quot;{&quot; or &quot;^&quot; <br>
preceding words, as in &quot;${^UNICODE}&quot; or $^T),
although $_ and @_ move up to the top of the pile. For
variables with the same identifier, we list it in order of
scalar, array, <br>
hash, and bareword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General Variables <br>
$ARG <br>
$_ The default input and pattern-searching space. The
following pairs are equivalent:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while (&lt;&gt;) {...} #
equivalent only in while! <br>
while (defined($_ = &lt;&gt;)) {...}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/^Subject:/ <br>
$_ =~ /^Subject:/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tr/a-z/A-Z/ <br>
$_ =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chomp <br>
chomp($_)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are the places where Perl
will assume $_ even if you don&rsquo;t use it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The following
functions use $_ as a default argument:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">abs, alarm, chomp, chop, chr,
chroot, cos, defined, eval, evalbytes, exp, glob, hex, int,
lc, lcfirst, length, log, lstat, mkdir, oct, ord, pos,
print, quotemeta, <br>
readlink, readpipe, ref, require, reverse (in scalar context
only), rmdir, sin, split (on its second argument), sqrt,
stat, study, uc, ucfirst, unlink, unpack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; All file tests
(&quot;-f&quot;, &quot;-d&quot;) except for &quot;-t&quot;,
which defaults to STDIN. See &quot;-X&quot; in perlfunc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The pattern
matching operations &quot;m//&quot;, &quot;s///&quot; and
&quot;tr///&quot; (aka &quot;y///&quot;) when used without
an &quot;=~&quot; operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The default
iterator variable in a &quot;foreach&quot; loop if no other
variable is supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The implicit
iterator variable in the &quot;grep()&quot; and
&quot;map()&quot; functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The implicit
variable of &quot;given()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The default
place to put an input record when a &quot;&lt;FH&gt;&quot;
operation&rsquo;s result is tested by itself as the sole
criterion of a &quot;while&quot; test. Outside a
&quot;while&quot; test, this <br>
will not happen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As $_ is a global variable, this
may lead in some cases to unwanted side-effects. As of perl
5.10, you can now use a lexical version of $_ by declaring
it in a file or <br>
in a block with &quot;my&quot;. Moreover, declaring
&quot;our $_&quot; restores the global $_ in the current
scope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mnemonic: underline is
understood in certain operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@ARG <br>
@_ Within a subroutine the array @_ contains the parameters
passed to that subroutine. Inside a subroutine, @_ is the
default array for the array operators &quot;push&quot;,
&quot;pop&quot;, <br>
&quot;shift&quot;, and &quot;unshift&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$LIST_SEPARATOR <br>
$&quot; When an array or an array slice is interpolated into
a double-quoted string or a similar context such as
&quot;/.../&quot;, its elements are separated by this value.
Default is a <br>
space. For example, this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;The array is:
@array0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is equivalent to this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;The array is: &quot;
. join($&quot;, @array) . &quot;0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mnemonic: works in double-quoted
context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PROCESS_ID <br>
$PID <br>
$$ The process number of the Perl running this script.
Though you can set this variable, doing so is generally
discouraged, although it can be invaluable for some testing
<br>
purposes. It will be reset automatically across
&quot;fork()&quot; calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note for Linux and Debian
GNU/kFreeBSD users: Before Perl v5.16.0 perl would emulate
POSIX semantics on Linux systems using LinuxThreads, a
partial implementation of <br>
POSIX Threads that has since been superseded by the Native
POSIX Thread Library (NPTL).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LinuxThreads is now obsolete on
Linux, and and caching &quot;getpid()&quot; like this made
embedding perl unnecessarily complex (since you&rsquo;d have
to manually update the value of <br>
$$), so now $$ and &quot;getppid()&quot; will always return
the same values as the underlying C library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debian GNU/kFreeBSD systems also
used LinuxThreads up until and including the 6.0 release,
but after that moved to FreeBSD thread semantics, which are
POSIX-like.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To see if your system is
affected by this discrepancy check if &quot;getconf
GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION | grep -q NPTL&quot; returns a false
value. NTPL threads preserve the POSIX <br>
semantics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mnemonic: same as shells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PROGRAM_NAME <br>
$0 Contains the name of the program being executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some (but not all) operating
systems assigning to $0 modifies the argument area that the
&quot;ps&quot; program sees. On some platforms you may have
to use special &quot;ps&quot; options <br>
or a different &quot;ps&quot; to see the changes. Modifying
the $0 is more useful as a way of indicating the current
program state than it is for hiding the program you&rsquo;re
<br>
running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that there are
platform-specific limitations on the maximum length of $0.
In the most extreme case it may be limited to the space
occupied by the original $0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some platforms there may be
arbitrary amount of padding, for example space characters,
after the modified name as shown by &quot;ps&quot;. In some
platforms this padding may <br>
extend all the way to the original length of the argument
area, no matter what you do (this is the case for example
with Linux 2.2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note for BSD users: setting $0
does not completely remove &quot;perl&quot; from the ps(1)
output. For example, setting $0 to &quot;foobar&quot; may
result in &quot;perl: foobar (perl)&quot; (whether <br>
both the &quot;perl: &quot; prefix and the &quot;
(perl)&quot; suffix are shown depends on your exact BSD
variant and version). This is an operating system feature,
Perl cannot help it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In multithreaded scripts Perl
coordinates the threads so that any thread may modify its
copy of the $0 and the change becomes visible to ps(1)
(assuming the operating <br>
system plays along). Note that the view of $0 the other
threads have will not change since they have their own
copies of it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the program has been given to
perl via the switches &quot;-e&quot; or &quot;-E&quot;, $0
will contain the string &quot;-e&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Linux as of perl 5.14 the
legacy process name will be set with prctl(2), in addition
to altering the POSIX name via &quot;argv[0]&quot; as perl
has done since version 4.000. <br>
Now system utilities that read the legacy process name such
as ps, top and killall will recognize the name you set when
assigning to $0. The string you supply will be <br>
cut off at 16 bytes, this is a limitation imposed by
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mnemonic: same as sh and
ksh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$REAL_GROUP_ID <br>
$GID <br>
$( The real gid of this process. If you are on a machine
that supports membership in multiple groups simultaneously,
gives a space separated list of groups you are in. The <br>
first number is the one returned by &quot;getgid()&quot;,
and the subsequent ones by &quot;getgroups()&quot;, one of
which may be the same as the first number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, a value assigned to $(
must be a single number used to set the real gid. So the
value given by $( should not be assigned back to $( without
being forced <br>
numeric, such as by adding zero. Note that this is different
to the effective gid ($)) which does take a list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can change both the real gid
and the effective gid at the same time by using
&quot;POSIX::setgid()&quot;. Changes to $( require a check
to $! to detect any possible errors <br>
after an attempted change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mnemonic: parentheses are used
to group things. The real gid is the group you left, if
you&rsquo;re running setgid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$EFFECTIVE_GROUP_ID <br>
$EGID <br>
$) The effective gid of this process. If you are on a
machine that supports membership in multiple groups
simultaneously, gives a space separated list of groups you
are in. <br>
The first number is the one returned by
&quot;getegid()&quot;, and the subsequent ones by
&quot;getgroups()&quot;, one of which may be the same as the
first number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, a value assigned to
$) must also be a space-separated list of numbers. The first
number sets the effective gid, and the rest (if any) are
passed to <br>
&quot;setgroups()&quot;. To get the effect of an empty list
for &quot;setgroups()&quot;, just repeat the new effective
gid; that is, to force an effective gid of 5 and an
effectively empty <br>
&quot;setgroups()&quot; list, say &quot; $) = &quot;5
5&quot; &quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can change both the
effective gid and the real gid at the same time by using
&quot;POSIX::setgid()&quot; (use only a single numeric
argument). Changes to $) require a check to <br>
$! to detect any possible errors after an attempted
change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$&lt;, $&gt;, $( and $) can be
set only on machines that support the corresponding
set[re][ug]id() routine. $( and $) can be swapped only on
machines supporting &quot;setregid()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mnemonic: parentheses are used
to group things. The effective gid is the group that&rsquo;s
right for you, if you&rsquo;re running setgid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$REAL_USER_ID <br>
$UID <br>
$&lt; The real uid of this process. You can change both the
real uid and the effective uid at the same time by using
&quot;POSIX::setuid()&quot;. Since changes to $&lt; require
a system <br>
call, check $! after a change attempt to detect any possible
errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mnemonic: it&rsquo;s the uid you
came from, if you&rsquo;re running setuid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$EFFECTIVE_USER_ID <br>
$EUID <br>
$&gt; The effective uid of this process. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$&lt; = $&gt;; # set real to
effective uid <br>
($&lt;,$&gt;) = ($&gt;,$&lt;); # swap real and effective
uids</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can change both the
effective uid and the real uid at the same time by using
&quot;POSIX::setuid()&quot;. Changes to $&gt; require a
check to $! to detect any possible errors <br>
after an attempted change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$&lt; and $&gt; can be swapped
only on machines supporting &quot;setreuid()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mnemonic: it&rsquo;s the uid you
went to, if you&rsquo;re running setuid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SUBSCRIPT_SEPARATOR <br>
$SUBSEP <br>
$; The subscript separator for multidimensional array
emulation. If you refer to a hash element as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$foo{$a,$b,$c}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">it really means</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$foo{join($;, $a, $b, $c)}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But don&rsquo;t put</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@foo{$a,$b,$c} # a slice--note
the @</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which means</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">($foo{$a},$foo{$b},$foo{$c})</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default is &quot; 34&quot;, the
same as SUBSEP in awk. If your keys contain binary data
there might not be any safe value for $;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consider using &quot;real&quot;
multidimensional arrays as described in perllol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mnemonic: comma (the syntactic
subscript separator) is a semi-semicolon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$a <br>
$b Special package variables when using &quot;sort()&quot;,
see &quot;sort&quot; in perlfunc. Because of this
specialness $a and $b don&rsquo;t need to be declared (using
&quot;use vars&quot;, or &quot;our()&quot;) <br>
even when using the &quot;strict &rsquo;vars&rsquo;&quot;
pragma. Don&rsquo;t lexicalize them with &quot;my $a&quot;
or &quot;my $b&quot; if you want to be able to use them in
the &quot;sort()&quot; comparison block or <br>
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%ENV The hash %ENV contains your
current environment. Setting a value in &quot;ENV&quot;
changes the environment for any child processes you
subsequently &quot;fork()&quot; off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYSTEM_FD_MAX <br>
$^F The maximum system file descriptor, ordinarily 2. System
file descriptors are passed to &quot;exec()&quot;ed
processes, while higher file descriptors are not. Also,
during an <br>
&quot;open()&quot;, system file descriptors are preserved
even if the &quot;open()&quot; fails (ordinary file
descriptors are closed before the &quot;open()&quot; is
attempted). The close-on-exec <br>
status of a file descriptor will be decided according to the
value of $^F when the corresponding file, pipe, or socket
was opened, not the time of the &quot;exec()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@F The array @F contains the
fields of each line read in when autosplit mode is turned
on. See perlrun for the -a switch. This array is
package-specific, and must be <br>
declared or given a full package name if not in package main
when running under &quot;strict
&rsquo;vars&rsquo;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@INC The array @INC contains the
list of places that the &quot;do EXPR&quot;,
&quot;require&quot;, or &quot;use&quot; constructs look for
their library files. It initially consists of the arguments
to any <br>
-I command-line switches, followed by the default Perl
library, probably /usr/local/lib/perl, followed by
&quot;.&quot;, to represent the current directory.
(&quot;.&quot; will not be <br>
appended if taint checks are enabled, either by
&quot;-T&quot; or by &quot;-t&quot;.) If you need to modify
this at runtime, you should use the &quot;use lib&quot;
pragma to get the machine-dependent <br>
library properly loaded also:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use lib
&rsquo;/mypath/libdir/&rsquo;; <br>
use SomeMod;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also insert hooks into
the file inclusion system by putting Perl code directly into
@INC. Those hooks may be subroutine references, array
references or blessed <br>
objects. See &quot;require&quot; in perlfunc for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%INC The hash %INC contains
entries for each filename included via the &quot;do&quot;,
&quot;require&quot;, or &quot;use&quot; operators. The key
is the filename you specified (with module names converted
<br>
to pathnames), and the value is the location of the file
found. The &quot;require&quot; operator uses this hash to
determine whether a particular file has already been
included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file was loaded via a
hook (e.g. a subroutine reference, see &quot;require&quot;
in perlfunc for a description of these hooks), this hook is
by default inserted into %INC in <br>
place of a filename. Note, however, that the hook may have
set the %INC entry by itself to provide some more specific
info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$INPLACE_EDIT <br>
$^I The current value of the inplace-edit extension. Use
&quot;undef&quot; to disable inplace editing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mnemonic: value of -i
switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$^M By default, running out of
memory is an untrappable, fatal error. However, if suitably
built, Perl can use the contents of $^M as an emergency
memory pool after <br>
&quot;die()&quot;ing. Suppose that your Perl were compiled
with &quot;-DPERL_EMERGENCY_SBRK&quot; and used Perl&rsquo;s
malloc. Then</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$^M = &rsquo;a&rsquo; x (1
&lt;&lt; 16);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would allocate a 64K buffer for
use in an emergency. See the INSTALL file in the Perl
distribution for information on how to add custom C
compilation flags when <br>
compiling perl. To discourage casual use of this advanced
feature, there is no English long name for this
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This variable was added in Perl
5.004.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$OSNAME <br>
$^O The name of the operating system under which this copy
of Perl was built, as determined during the configuration
process. For examples see &quot;PLATFORMS&quot; in
perlport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value is identical to
$Config{&rsquo;osname&rsquo;}. See also Config and the -V
command-line switch documented in perlrun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Windows platforms, $^O is not
very helpful: since it is always &quot;MSWin32&quot;, it
doesn&rsquo;t tell the difference between
95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP/CE/.NET. Use
&quot;Win32::GetOSName()&quot; <br>
or Win32::GetOSVersion() (see Win32 and perlport) to
distinguish between the variants.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This variable was added in Perl
5.003.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%SIG The hash %SIG contains
signal handlers for signals. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub handler { # 1st argument is
signal name <br>
my($sig) = @_; <br>
print &quot;Caught a SIG$sig--shutting down0; <br>
close(LOG); <br>
exit(0); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SIG{&rsquo;INT&rsquo;} =
handler; <br>
$SIG{&rsquo;QUIT&rsquo;} = handler; <br>
... <br>
$SIG{&rsquo;INT&rsquo;} = &rsquo;DEFAULT&rsquo;; # restore
default action <br>
$SIG{&rsquo;QUIT&rsquo;} = &rsquo;IGNORE&rsquo;; # ignore
SIGQUIT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using a value of
&rsquo;IGNORE&rsquo; usually has the effect of ignoring the
signal, except for the &quot;CHLD&quot; signal. See perlipc
for more about this special case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are some other
examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SIG{&quot;PIPE&quot;} =
&quot;Plumber&quot;; # assumes main::Plumber (not <br>
# recommended) <br>
$SIG{&quot;PIPE&quot;} = Plumber; # just fine; assume
current <br>
# Plumber <br>
$SIG{&quot;PIPE&quot;} = *Plumber; # somewhat esoteric <br>
$SIG{&quot;PIPE&quot;} = Plumber(); # oops, what did
Plumber() <br>
# return??</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be sure not to use a bareword as
the name of a signal handler, lest you inadvertently call
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your system has the
&quot;sigaction()&quot; function then signal handlers are
installed using it. This means you get reliable signal
handling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default delivery policy of
signals changed in Perl 5.8.0 from immediate (also known as
&quot;unsafe&quot;) to deferred, also known as &quot;safe
signals&quot;. See perlipc for more <br>
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Certain internal hooks can be
also set using the %SIG hash. The routine indicated by
$SIG{__WARN__} is called when a warning message is about to
be printed. The warning <br>
message is passed as the first argument. The presence of a
&quot;__WARN__&quot; hook causes the ordinary printing of
warnings to &quot;STDERR&quot; to be suppressed. You can use
this to <br>
save warnings in a variable, or turn warnings into fatal
errors, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local $SIG{__WARN__} = sub { die

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As the &rsquo;IGNORE&rsquo; hook
is not supported by &quot;__WARN__&quot;, you can disable
warnings using the empty subroutine:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local $SIG{__WARN__} = sub
{};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The routine indicated by
$SIG{__DIE__} is called when a fatal exception is about to
be thrown. The error message is passed as the first
argument. When a &quot;__DIE__&quot; hook <br>
routine returns, the exception processing continues as it
would have in the absence of the hook, unless the hook
routine itself exits via a &quot;goto &amp;sub&quot;, a loop
exit, or a <br>
&quot;die()&quot;. The &quot;__DIE__&quot; handler is
explicitly disabled during the call, so that you can die
from a &quot;__DIE__&quot; handler. Similarly for
&quot;__WARN__&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to an implementation glitch,
the $SIG{__DIE__} hook is called even inside an
&quot;eval()&quot;. Do not use this to rewrite a pending
exception in $@, or as a bizarre <br>
substitute for overriding &quot;CORE::GLOBAL::die()&quot;.
This strange action at a distance may be fixed in a future
release so that $SIG{__DIE__} is only called if your program
<br>
is about to exit, as was the original intent. Any other use
is deprecated.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__DIE__&quot;/&quot;__WARN__&quot;
handlers are very special in one respect: they may be called
to report (probable) errors found by the parser. In such a
case the parser may be in <br>
inconsistent state, so any attempt to evaluate Perl code
from such a handler will probably result in a segfault. This
means that warnings or errors that result from <br>
parsing Perl should be used with extreme caution, like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require Carp if defined $^S;
<br>
Carp::confess(&quot;Something wrong&quot;) if defined
&amp;Carp::confess; <br>
die &quot;Something wrong, but could not load Carp to give
&quot; <br>
. &quot;backtrace...&quot; <br>
. &quot;To see backtrace try starting Perl with -MCarp
switch&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here the first line will load
&quot;Carp&quot; unless it is the parser who called the
handler. The second line will print backtrace and die if
&quot;Carp&quot; was available. The third <br>
line will be executed only if &quot;Carp&quot; was not
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Having to even think about the
$^S variable in your exception handlers is simply wrong.
$SIG{__DIE__} as currently implemented invites grievous and
difficult to track <br>
down errors. Avoid it and use an &quot;END{}&quot; or
CORE::GLOBAL::die override instead.</p>

&quot;warn&quot; in perlfunc, &quot;eval&quot; in perlfunc,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$BASETIME <br>
$^T The time at which the program began running, in seconds
since the epoch (beginning of 1970). The values returned by
the -M, -A, and -C filetests are based on this value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PERL_VERSION <br>
$^V The revision, version, and subversion of the Perl
interpreter, represented as a &quot;version&quot;
object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This variable first appeared in
perl 5.6.0; earlier versions of perl will see an undefined
value. Before perl 5.10.0 $^V was represented as a
v-string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$^V can be used to determine
whether the Perl interpreter executing a script is in the
right range of versions. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warn &quot;Hashes not
randomized!0 if !$^V or $^V lt v5.8.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To convert $^V into its string
representation use &quot;sprintf()&quot;&rsquo;s
&quot;%vd&quot; conversion:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf &quot;version is v%vd0,
$^V; # Perl&rsquo;s version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the documentation of
&quot;use VERSION&quot; and &quot;require VERSION&quot; for
a convenient way to fail if the running Perl interpreter is
too old.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also $] for an older
representation of the Perl version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This variable was added in Perl
5.6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mnemonic: use ^V for Version
Control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT} <br>
If this variable is set to a true value, then
&quot;stat()&quot; on Windows will not try to open the file.
This means that the link count cannot be determined and file
attributes <br>
may be out of date if additional hardlinks to the file
exist. On the other hand, not opening the file is
considerably faster, especially for files on network
drives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This variable could be set in
the sitecustomize.pl file to configure the local Perl
installation to use &quot;sloppy&quot; &quot;stat()&quot; by
default. See the documentation for -f in <br>
perlrun for more information about site customization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This variable was added in Perl
5.10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$EXECUTABLE_NAME <br>
$^X The name used to execute the current copy of Perl, from
C&rsquo;s &quot;argv[0]&quot; or (where supported)
/proc/self/exe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Depending on the host operating
system, the value of $^X may be a relative or absolute
pathname of the perl program file, or may be the string used
to invoke perl but not <br>
the pathname of the perl program file. Also, most operating
systems permit invoking programs that are not in the PATH
environment variable, so there is no guarantee that <br>
the value of $^X is in PATH. For VMS, the value may or may
not include a version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You usually can use the value of
$^X to re-invoke an independent copy of the same perl that
is currently running, e.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@first_run = &lsquo;$^X -le
&quot;print int rand 100 for 1..100&quot;&lsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But recall that not all
operating systems support forking or capturing of the output
of commands, so this complex statement may not be
portable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not safe to use the value
of $^X as a path name of a file, as some operating systems
that have a mandatory suffix on executable files do not
require use of the <br>
suffix when invoking a command. To convert the value of $^X
to a path name, use the following statements:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Build up a set of file names
(not command names). <br>
use Config; <br>
my $this_perl = $^X; <br>
if ($^O ne &rsquo;VMS&rsquo;) { <br>
$this_perl .= $Config{_exe} <br>
unless $this_perl =~ m/$Config{_exe}$/i; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because many operating systems
permit anyone with read access to the Perl program file to
make a copy of it, patch the copy, and then execute the
copy, the security- <br>
conscious Perl programmer should take care to invoke the
installed copy of perl, not the copy referenced by $^X. The
following statements accomplish this goal, and <br>
produce a pathname that can be invoked as a command or
referenced as a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Config; <br>
my $secure_perl_path = $Config{perlpath}; <br>
if ($^O ne &rsquo;VMS&rsquo;) { <br>
$secure_perl_path .= $Config{_exe} <br>
unless $secure_perl_path =~ m/$Config{_exe}$/i; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variables related to regular
expressions <br>
Most of the special variables related to regular expressions
are side effects. Perl sets these variables when it has a
successful match, so you should check the match result <br>
before using them. For instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if( /P(A)TT(ER)N/ ) { <br>
print &quot;I found $1 and $20; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These variables are read-only
and dynamically-scoped, unless we note otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dynamic nature of the
regular expression variables means that their value is
limited to the block that they are in, as demonstrated by
this bit of code:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $outer = &rsquo;Wallace and
Grommit&rsquo;; <br>
my $inner = &rsquo;Mutt and Jeff&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $pattern = qr/() and ()/;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub show_n { print &quot; is $1;
is $20 }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ <br>
OUTER: <br>
show_n() if $outer =~ m/$pattern/;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INNER: { <br>
show_n() if $inner =~ m/$pattern/; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show_n(); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output shows that while in
the &quot;OUTER&quot; block, the values of $1 and $2 are
from the match against $outer. Inside the &quot;INNER&quot;
block, the values of $1 and $2 are from the match <br>
against $inner, but only until the end of the block (i.e.
the dynamic scope). After the &quot;INNER&quot; block
completes, the values of $1 and $2 return to the values for
the match <br>
against $outer even though we have not made another
match:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$1 is Wallace; $2 is Grommit
<br>
$1 is Mutt; $2 is Jeff <br>
$1 is Wallace; $2 is Grommit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to an unfortunate accident
of Perl&rsquo;s implementation, &quot;use English&quot;
imposes a considerable performance penalty on all regular
expression matches in a program because it uses <br>
the &quot;$&lsquo;&quot;, $&amp;, and &quot;$&rsquo;&quot;,
regardless of whether they occur in the scope of &quot;use
English&quot;. For that reason, saying &quot;use
English&quot; in libraries is strongly discouraged unless
you <br>
import it without the match variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use English
&rsquo;-no_match_vars&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Devel::NYTProf&quot;
and &quot;Devel::FindAmpersand&quot; modules can help you
find uses of these problematic match variables in your
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since Perl 5.10, you can use the
&quot;/p&quot; match operator flag and the
&quot;${^PREMATCH}&quot;, &quot;${^MATCH}&quot;, and
&quot;${^POSTMATCH}&quot; variables instead so you only
suffer the performance penalties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$&lt;digits&gt; ($1, $2, ...)
<br>
Contains the subpattern from the corresponding set of
capturing parentheses from the last successful pattern
match, not counting patterns matched in nested blocks that

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mnemonic: like igits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of this variable

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@LAST_MATCH_END <br>
@+ This array holds the offsets of the ends of the last
successful submatches in the currently active dynamic scope.
$+[0] is the offset into the string of the end of the <br>
entire match. This is the same value as what the
&quot;pos&quot; function returns when called on the variable
that was matched against. The nth element of this array
holds the <br>
offset of the nth submatch, so $+[1] is the offset past
where $1 ends, $+[2] the offset past where $2 ends, and so
on. You can use $#+ to determine how many subgroups <br>
were in the last successful match. See the examples given
for the &quot;@-&quot; variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This variable was added in Perl
5.6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%LAST_PAREN_MATCH <br>
%+ Similar to &quot;@+&quot;, the &quot;%+&quot; hash allows

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, $+{foo} is
equivalent to $1 after the following match:</p>

@- &quot;$-[0]&quot; is the offset of the start of the last

$-[n], $+[n] - $-[n]&quot; if &quot;$-[n]&quot; is <br>
defined, and $+ coincides with &quot;substr $_, $-[$#-],
$+[$#-] - $-[$#-]&quot;. One can use &quot;$#-&quot; to find
the last matched subgroup in the last successful match.
Contrast with <br>
$#+, the number of subgroups in the regular expression.
Compare with &quot;@+&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This array holds the offsets of

through a reference, you&rsquo;ll raise a <br>
run-time exception.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should be very careful when
modifying the default values of most special variables
described in this document. In most cases you want to
localize these variables before <br>
changing them, since if you don&rsquo;t, the change may
affect other modules which rely on the default values of the
special variables that you have changed. This is one of the
<br>
correct ways to read the whole file at once:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;,
&quot;foo&quot; or die $!; <br>
local $/; # enable localized slurp mode <br>
my $content = &lt;$fh&gt;; <br>
close $fh;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But the following code is quite
bad:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;,
&quot;foo&quot; or die $!; <br>
undef $/; # enable slurp mode <br>
my $content = &lt;$fh&gt;; <br>
close $fh;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">since some other module, may
want to read data from some file in the default &quot;line
mode&quot;, so if the code we have just presented has been
executed, the global value of $/ is now <br>
changed for any other code running inside the same Perl
interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usually when a variable is
localized you want to make sure that this change affects the
shortest scope possible. So unless you are already inside
some short &quot;{}&quot; block, you <br>
should create one yourself. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $content = &rsquo;&rsquo;;
<br>
open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;foo&quot; or die $!;
<br>
{ <br>
local $/; <br>
$content = &lt;$fh&gt;; <br>
} <br>
close $fh;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an example of how your
own code can go broken:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for ( 1..3 ){0; <br>
$&nbsp;= &quot; <br>
nasty_break(); <br>
print &quot;$_&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub nasty_break { <br>
$&nbsp;= &quot;; <br>
# do something with $_ <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You probably expect this code to
print the equivalent of 0 0 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but instead you get:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Why? Because
&quot;nasty_break()&quot; modifies &quot;$ <br>

&quot;nasty_break()&quot;:</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>local $&nbsp;=
&quot;;</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>It&rsquo;s easy to notice the

changes to the special variables.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>$ARGV Contains the name of

filehandle may not cause your function to automatically read
the contents of all the files in @ARGV.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>ARGVOUT The special

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Each filehandle in Perl
counts the number of lines that have been read from it.
(Depending on the value of $/, Perl&rsquo;s idea of what
constitutes a line may not match <br>
yours.) When a line is read from a filehandle (via
&quot;readline()&quot; or &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;), or when
&quot;tell()&quot; or &quot;seek()&quot; is called on it, $.
becomes an alias to the line counter for that <br>
filehandle.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>You can adjust the counter by
assigning to $., but this will not actually move the seek
pointer. Localizing $. will not localize the

it will localize perl&rsquo;s notion of which filehandle $.
is currently aliased to.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>$. is reset when the

reopened without an intervening &quot;close()&quot;. For

line numbers increase across &quot;ARGV&quot; files (but see

$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR <br>
$RS <br>
$/ The input record separator, newline by default. This

Works like awk&rsquo;s RS variable, including treating empty
lines as a <br>

contain any spaces or tabs). You may set it to a
multi-character string to match a multi-character
terminator, <br>
or to &quot;undef&quot; to read through the end of file.
Setting it to &quot;0 means something slightly different
than setting to &quot;&quot;, if the file contains
consecutive empty lines. <br>
Setting to &quot;&quot; will treat two or more consecutive
empty lines as a single empty line. Setting to &quot;0 will
blindly assume that the next input character belongs to the
<br>
next paragraph, even if it&rsquo;s a newline.</b></p>

:-)</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Setting $/ to a reference to
an integer, scalar containing an integer, or scalar
that&rsquo;s convertible to an integer will attempt to read
records instead of lines, with the <br>

this:</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>local $/ = 32768; # or <br>

likely get a full chunk of data with every read. If a record
is larger than the record size you&rsquo;ve set,
you&rsquo;ll get the record back in pieces. Trying to set
the record <br>
size to zero or less will cause reading in the (rest of the)
whole file.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>On VMS only, record reads
bypass PerlIO layers and any associated buffering,so you
must not mix record and non-record reads on the same

for both modes.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>If you perform a record read

really buffered by the system or not; $| tells you only
whether you&rsquo;ve asked Perl explicitly to flush after

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Mnemonic: brother to
$^.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Error Variables <br>
The variables $@, $!, $^E, and $? contain information about
different types of error conditions that may appear during
execution of a Perl program. The variables are shown <br>
ordered by the &quot;distance&quot; between the subsystem
which reported the error and the Perl process. They
correspond to errors detected by the Perl interpreter, C
library, operating <br>
system, or an external program, respectively.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>To illustrate the differences
between these variables, consider the following Perl
expression, which uses a single-quoted string. After
execution of this statement, perl may <br>
have set all four special error variables:</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>eval q{ <br>
open my $pipe, &quot;/cdrom/install |&quot; or die $!; <br>
my @res = &lt;$pipe&gt;; <br>
close $pipe or die &quot;bad pipe: $?, $!&quot;; <br>
};</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>When perl executes the
&quot;eval()&quot; expression, it translates the
&quot;open()&quot;, &quot;&lt;PIPE&gt;&quot;, and
&quot;close&quot; calls in the C run-time library and thence
to the operating system kernel. perl <br>
sets $! to the C library&rsquo;s &quot;errno&quot; if one of
these calls fails.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>$@ is set if the string to be
&quot;eval&quot;-ed did not compile (this may happen if
&quot;open&quot; or &quot;close&quot; were imported with bad
prototypes), or if Perl code executed during evaluation <br>
&quot;die()&quot;d. In these cases the value of $@ is the
compile error, or the argument to &quot;die&quot; (which
will interpolate $! and $?). (See also Fatal,
though.)</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Under a few operating
systems, $^E may contain a more verbose error indicator,
such as in this case, &quot;CDROM tray not closed.&quot;
Systems that do not support extended error messages <br>
leave $^E the same as $!.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Finally, $? may be set to
non-0 value if the external program /cdrom/install fails.
The upper eight bits reflect specific error conditions
encountered by the program (the <br>
program&rsquo;s &quot;exit()&quot; value). The lower eight
bits reflect mode of failure, like signal death and core
dump information. See wait(2) for details. In contrast to $!
and $^E, which <br>
are set only if error condition is detected, the variable $?
is set on each &quot;wait&quot; or pipe &quot;close&quot;,
overwriting the old value. This is more like $@, which on
every &quot;eval()&quot; is <br>
always set on failure and cleared on success.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>For more details, see the
individual descriptions at $@, $!, $^E, and $?.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE} <br>

&quot;system()&quot; operator. On POSIX-like <br>
systems this value can be decoded with the WIFEXITED,
WEXITSTATUS, WIFSIGNALED, WTERMSIG, WIFSTOPPED, WSTOPSIG and
WIFCONTINUED functions provided by the POSIX module.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Under VMS this reflects the
actual VMS exit status; i.e. it is the same as $? when the
pragma &quot;use vmsish &rsquo;status&rsquo;&quot; is in
effect.</b></p>

Perl 5.8.9.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>$EXTENDED_OS_ERROR <br>
$^E Error information specific to the current operating
system. At the moment, this differs from $! under only VMS,
OS/2, and Win32 (and for MacPerl). On all other <br>
platforms, $^E is always just the same as $!.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Under VMS, $^E provides the
VMS status value from the last system error. This is more
specific information about the last system error than that
provided by $!. This is <br>
particularly important when $! is set to EVMSERR.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Under OS/2, $^E is set to the
error code of the last call to OS/2 API either via CRT, or
directly from perl.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Under Win32, $^E always
returns the last error information reported by the Win32
call &quot;GetLastError()&quot; which describes the last
error from within the Win32 API. Most <br>
Win32-specific code will report errors via $^E. ANSI C and
Unix-like calls set &quot;errno&quot; and so most portable

interpreter state.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>$COMPILING <br>
$^C The current value of the flag associated with the -c
switch. Mainly of use with -MO=... to allow code to alter
its behavior when being compiled, such as for example to
<br>
&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; at compile time rather than normal,
deferred loading. Setting &quot;$^C = 1&quot; is similar to
calling &quot;B::minus_c&quot;.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>This variable was added in
Perl 5.6.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>$DEBUGGING <br>
$^D The current value of the debugging flags. May be read or
set. Like its command-line equivalent, you can use numeric
or symbolic values, eg &quot;$^D = 10&quot; or &quot;$^D =
&quot;st&quot;&quot;.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Mnemonic: value of -D
switch.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>${^ENCODING} <br>
The object reference to the &quot;Encode&quot; object that
is used to convert the source code to Unicode. Thanks to
this variable your Perl script does not have to be written
in <br>
UTF-8. Default is undef. The direct manipulation of this
variable is highly discouraged.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>This variable was added in
Perl 5.8.2.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>${^GLOBAL_PHASE} <br>
The current phase of the perl interpreter.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Possible values are:</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>CONSTRUCT <br>
The &quot;PerlInterpreter*&quot; is being constructed via
&quot;perl_construct&quot;. This value is mostly there for
completeness and for use via the underlying C variable <br>
&quot;PL_phase&quot;. It&rsquo;s not really possible for
Perl code to be executed unless construction of the
interpreter is finished.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>START This is the global
compile-time. That includes, basically, every
&quot;BEGIN&quot; block executed directly or indirectly from
during the compile-time of the top-level <br>
program.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>This phase is not called
&quot;BEGIN&quot; to avoid confusion with
&quot;BEGIN&quot;-blocks, as those are executed during
compile-time of any compilation unit, not just the top-level
<br>
program. A new, localised compile-time entered at run-time,
for example by constructs as &quot;eval &quot;use
SomeModule&quot;&quot; are not global interpreter phases,
and therefore <br>
aren&rsquo;t reflected by
&quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot;.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>CHECK Execution of any
&quot;CHECK&quot; blocks.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>INIT Similar to
&quot;CHECK&quot;, but for &quot;INIT&quot;-blocks, not
&quot;CHECK&quot; blocks.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>RUN The main run-time, i.e.
the execution of &quot;PL_main_root&quot;.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>END Execution of any
&quot;END&quot; blocks.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>DESTRUCT <br>
Global destruction.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Also note that there&rsquo;s
no value for UNITCHECK-blocks. That&rsquo;s because those
are run for each compilation unit individually, and
therefore is not a global interpreter <br>
phase.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Not every program has to go
through each of the possible phases, but transition from one
phase to another can only happen in the order described in
the above list.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>This variable was added in

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>$^H WARNING: This variable is
strictly for internal use only. Its availability, behavior,
and contents are subject to change without notice.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>This variable contains
compile-time hints for the Perl interpreter. At the end of
compilation of a BLOCK the value of this variable is
restored to the value when the <br>
interpreter started to compile the BLOCK.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>When perl begins to parse any
block construct that provides a lexical scope (e.g., eval
body, required file, subroutine body, loop body, or
conditional block), the <br>
existing value of $^H is saved, but its value is left
unchanged. When the compilation of the block is completed,
it regains the saved value. Between the points where <br>
its value is saved and restored, code that executes within
BEGIN blocks is free to change the value of $^H.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>This behavior provides the
semantic of lexical scoping, and is used in, for instance,
the &quot;use strict&quot; pragma.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>The contents should be an
integer; different bits of it are used for different
pragmatic flags. Here&rsquo;s an example:</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>sub add_100 { $^H |= 0x100
}</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>sub foo { <br>
BEGIN { add_100() } <br>
bar-&gt;baz($boon); <br>
}</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Consider what happens during
execution of the BEGIN block. At this point the BEGIN block
has already been compiled, but the body of &quot;foo()&quot;
is still being compiled. The <br>
new value of $^H will therefore be visible only while the
body of &quot;foo()&quot; is being compiled.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Substitution of &quot;BEGIN {

$condition <br>
}</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>This variable was added in
Perl 5.003.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>%^H The &quot;%^H&quot; hash
provides the same scoping semantic as $^H. This makes it
useful for implementation of lexically scoped pragmas. See
perlpragma.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>When putting items into
&quot;%^H&quot;, in order to avoid conflicting with other
users of the hash there is a convention regarding which keys
to use. A module should use only <br>
keys that begin with the module&rsquo;s name (the name of
its main package) and a &quot;/&quot; character. For
example, a module &quot;Foo::Bar&quot; should use keys such
as &quot;Foo::Bar/baz&quot;.</b></p>
