envpath - Advanced operations on path variables
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
Run this script with the &quot;-help&quot; option for usage details.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Parses the command line, modifies the specified path variable(s), and execs the
  remaining arguments. There are two modes, <b>simple</b> and <b>advanced</b>:
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="SIMPLE_MODE"><a class="selflink" href="#SIMPLE_MODE">SIMPLE
  MODE</a></h2>
Simple mode presents an alternative, platform-independent syntax for specifying
  paths wherein the path separator is &quot;,&quot; and environment variables
  can be expanded with @NAME@. For example
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    envpath PATH=@PATH@,/usr/ucb -- printenv PATH
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
appends &quot;/usr/ucb&quot; to $PATH and execs <i>printenv PATH</i>. The
  &quot;--&quot; is optional.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also specify prepending or appending by using &quot;+=&quot; or
  &quot;=+&quot; respectively:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # place /usr/ucb at the front
    envpath PATH+=/usr/ucb -- printenv PATH
    # place /usr/ucb at the back
    envpath PATH=+/usr/ucb -- printenv PATH
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Simple mode requires only this script; it does not require Env::Path to be
  installed.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="ADVANCED_MODE"><a class="selflink" href="#ADVANCED_MODE">ADVANCED
  MODE</a></h2>
Advanced mode basically provides command-line access to the features of
  Env::Path (see), which must be installed. The &quot;-E&quot; flag selects the
  path variable to operate on and other flags specify operations on it. E.g.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    envpath -E MANPATH -A /tmp -R /usr/share/man -N -U -- man ...
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
would take MANPATH, append /tmp to it, remove any references to
  &quot;/usr/share/man&quot;, remove any dirs which don't exist (&quot;-N&quot;)
  and remove redundant entries (&quot;-U&quot;) before running <i>man</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The -Whence option allows patterns. Thus
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    envpath -W &quot;cat*&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
would find all programs on PATH which match cat*.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CLEARCASE_WINKINS"><a class="selflink" href="#CLEARCASE_WINKINS">CLEARCASE
  WINKINS</a></h1>
A big part of the motivation for this script was for use with ClearCase builds;
  iff you know or care about ClearCase read on. Typically, during builds (and
  not just with ClearCase), pathvars such as PATH, CLASSPATH, and
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH must be strictly controlled. One choice is to force static
  values of these into the environment during the build process, another is to
  simply require/expect users to set their paths appropriately. Each of these
  can lead to subtle build or runtime errors, however, and makes it hard for new
  users to get up to speed since their personal environment must be just so.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another common choice is to use only full pathnames within the Makefile,
  avoiding reliance on search paths at all. This is often the best way to go but
  can suppress ClearCase winkins. For example, say you're generating ascii files
  of some type with a binary executable you just built:
<div class="Pp"></div>
$(INCDIR)/foo.h: $(BINDIR)/foomaker 	$(BINDIR)/foomaker ...
<div class="Pp"></div>
The problem with this is that $(BINDIR) likely contains a platform part such as
  'solaris' or 'hpux', which makes it impossible to wink in the foo.h file on
  other platforms even though it's ascii. This same thing could come up even
  with a standard pre-built utility that's in different places on different
  platforms; &quot;yacc&quot;, for instance, is in /usr/bin on Linux and
  /usr/ccs/bin on Solaris.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You could modify the path on the fly:
<div class="Pp"></div>
$(INCDIR)/foo.h: $(BINDIR)/foomaker 	PATH=$(BINDIR)$(SEP)$$PATH foomaker ...
<div class="Pp"></div>
but this suffers from the same problem: since $(BINDIR) and $PATH are expanded
  literally within the build script they'll suppress winkins. Here's a solution
  using <i>envpath</i>:
<div class="Pp"></div>
$(INCDIR)/foo.h: $(BINDIR)/foomaker 	envpath PATH=@BINDIR@,@PATH@ foomaker ...
<div class="Pp"></div>
This hides the evaluation of BINDIR and PATH such that <i>clearmake</i> never
  sees anything but the literals, thus clearing the field for winkins. Of course
  <i>envpath</i> is capable of doing more than this, but it's the original
  reason it was written.
