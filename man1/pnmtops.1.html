<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pnmtops - convert PNM image to PostScript</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pnmtops [-scale=s] [-dpi=N[xN]] [-imagewidth=n]
[-imageheight=n] [-width=N] [-height=N] [-equalpixels]
[-bitspersample=N] [-turn|-noturn] [-rle|-runlength]
[-flate] [-ascii85] <br>
[-nocenter|-center] [-nosetpage|-setpage] [-level=N] [-dict]
[-vmreclaim] [-psfilter] [-noshowpage] [-verbose]
[pnmfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options can be abbreviated
to their shortest unique prefix. You may use two hyphens
instead of one. You may separate an option name and its
value with white space instead <br>
of an equals sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmtops reads a Netpbm image
stream as input and produces Encapsulated PostScript (EPSF)
as output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the input file is in color
(PPM), pnmtops generates a color PostScript file. Some
PostScript interpreters can&rsquo;t handle color PostScript.
If you have one of these you will <br>
need to run your image through ppmtopgm first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify no output
dimensioning options, the output image is dimensioned as if
you had specified -scale=1.0, which means approximately 72
pixels of the input image generate <br>
one inch of output (if that fits the page).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -imagewidth, -imageheight,
-equalpixels, -width, -height, and -scale to adjust
that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each image in the input stream
becomes one complete one-page Postscript program in the
output. (This may not be the best way to create a multi-page
Postscript stream; someone <br>
who knows Postscript should work on this).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The line at the top of the file
produced by pnmtops is either &rsquo;%!PS-Adobe-3.0
EPSF-3.0&rsquo; or just &rsquo;%!PS-Adobe-3.0&rsquo;. The
numbers do not reflect the Postscript language level, but
<br>
the version of the DSC comment specification and EPS
specification implemented. The Postscript language level is
in the &quot;%%LanguageLevel:&quot; comment. pnmtops omits
&quot;EPSF-3.0&quot; if <br>
you specify -setpage, because it is incorrect to claim EPS
compliance if the file uses setpagedevice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What is Encapsulated Postscript?
<br>
Encapsulated Postscript (EPSF) is a subset of Postscript
(i.e. the set of streams that conform to EPSF is a subset of
those that conform to Postscript). It is designed so that
<br>
an EPSF stream can be embedded in another Postscript stream.
A typical reason to do that is where an EPSF stream
describes a picture you want in a larger document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An Encapsulated Postscript
document conforms to the DSC (Document Structuring
Convention). The DSC defines some Postscript comments
(they&rsquo;re comments from a Postscript point of <br>
view, but have semantic value from a DSC point of view).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More information about
Encapsulated Postscript is at
http://http://www.tailrecursive.org/postscript/eps.html
(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the ideas in pnmtops
come from Dirk Krause&rsquo;s bmeps. See SEE ALSO
&acirc;&uml;#seealso&acirc;&copy; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-imagewidth, -imageheight <br>
Tells how wide and high you want the image on the page, in
inches. The aspect ratio of the image is preserved, so if
you specify both of these, the image on the page will <br>
be the largest image that will fit within the box of those
dimensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If these dimensions are greater
than the page size, you get Postscript output that runs off
the page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You cannot use imagewidth or
imageheight with -scale or -equalpixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-equalpixels <br>
This option causes the output image to have the same number
of pixels as the input image. So if the output device is 600
dpi and your image is 3000 pixels wide, the out&acirc; <br>
put image would be 5 inches wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You cannot use -equalpixels with
-imagewidth, -imageheight, or -scale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bitspersample=N <br>
This option selects the number of bits for each component of
each pixel in the Postscript output. By default, pnmtops
chooses the value that corresponds to the maxval of <br>
the PNM input, subject to constraints of the Postscript
language. In particular, if you don&rsquo;t select
Postscript level 2 (-level) with built-in Postscript
(-psfilter), the <br>
most bits per pixel you can have is 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value must be 1, 2, 4, 8, or
12, with 12 being restricted to the case described
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.51 (June 2010).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-scale tells how big you want
the image on the page. The value is the number of inches of
output image that you want 72 pixels of the input to
generate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But pnmtops rounds the number to
something that is an integral number of output device
pixels. E.g. if the output device is 300 dpi and you specify
-scale=1.0, then 75 <br>
(not 72) pixels of input becomes one inch of output (4
output pixels for each input pixel). Note that the -dpi
option tells pnmtops how many pixels per inch the output
<br>
device generates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the size so specified does
not fit on the page (as measured either by the -width and
-height options or the default page size of 8.5 inches by 11
inches), pnmtops <br>
ignores the -scale option, issues a warning, and scales the
image to fit on the page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dpi=N[xN]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the dots
per inch resolution of your output device. The default is
300 dpi. In theory PostScript is device-independent and you
don&rsquo;t have to worry <br>
about this, but in practice its raster rendering can have
unsightly bands if the device pixels and the image pixels
aren&rsquo;t in sync.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also this option is crucial to
the working of the equalpixels option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify NxN, the first
number is the horizontal resolution and the second number is
the vertical resolution. If you specify just a single number
N, that is the <br>
resolution in both directions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-width, -height <br>
These options specify the dimensions, in inches, of the page
on which the output is to be printed. This can affect the
size of the output image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The page size has no effect,
however, when you specify the -imagewidth, -imageheight, or
-equalpixels options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options may also affect
positioning of the image on the page and even the paper
selected (or cut) by the printer/plotter when the output is
printed. See the -noset&acirc; <br>
page option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is 8.5 inches by 11
inches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-turn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noturn <br>
These options control whether the image gets turned 90
degrees. Normally, if an image fits the page better when
turned (e.g. the image is wider than it is tall, but the
<br>
page is taller than it is wide), it gets turned
automatically to better fit the page. If you specify the
-turn option, pnmtops turns the image no matter what its
shape; <br>
If you specify -noturn, pnmtops does not turn it no matter
what its shape.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rle</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-runlength <br>
These identical options tell pnmtops to use run length
compression in encoding the image in the Postscript program.
This may save time if the host-to-printer link is <br>
slow; but normally the printer&rsquo;s processing time
dominates, so -rle has no effect (and in the absence of
buffering, may make things slower).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This may, however, make the
Postscript program considerable smaller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This usually doesn&rsquo;t help
at all with a color image and -psfilter, because in that
case, the Postscript program pnmtops creates has the red,
green, and blue values for <br>
each pixel together, which means you would see long runs of
identical bytes only in the unlikely event that the red,
green, and blue values for a bunch of adjacent pixels <br>
are all the same. But without -psfilter, the Postscript
program has all the red values, then all the green values,
then all the blue values, so long runs appear wherever <br>
there are long stretches of the same color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an explanation by Jef
Poskanzer of why he invented the -rle option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I just spent a few hours
modifying my pbmtops filter to produce run length encoded
PostScript output. The results are not spectacular for me -
yes, the files are smaller, <br>
but the printing times are about the same. But I&rsquo;m
printing over the network. If you were stuck with the serial
line, this would be a big win. I&rsquo;ve appended a sample
<br>
program generated by my filter. If anyone sees ways to
improve the code, please let me know, I&rsquo;m not much of
a PostScript hacker. This version of pbmtops will be
dis&acirc; <br>
tributed to comp.sources.misc and expo.lcs.mit.edu sometime
in October. - Jef</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is from a forum about
Postscript
&acirc;&uml;http://www.lngpstscrpt.tk/re-postscript-run-length-encoding-again&acirc;&copy;
, extracted in October 2010. Jef added -rle in August 1988.
In those <br>
days, RS-232 lines (referred to a &rsquo;serial&rsquo; in
the quotation) were typically 9600bps. 2400 bps lines were
still around. What the quotation calls &rsquo;the
network&rsquo; is probably a 10 <br>
Mbps Ethernet connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flate This option tells pnmtops
to use &rsquo;flate&rsquo; compression (i.e. compression via
the &rsquo;Z&rsquo; library -- the same as PNG).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the -rle option for
information about compression in general.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You must specify -psfilter if
you specify -flate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There exist modern versions of
pnmtops that cannot do flate compression; these versions
were built without the Z library and built not to require
the Z library. If you <br>
have such a version, it fails with an explanatory error
message when you specify -flate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netbpm
10.27 (March 2005).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 10.32 (February
2006), you could not specify -rle and -flate together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ascii85 <br>
By default, pnmtops uses &rsquo;asciihex&rsquo; encoding of
the image raster. The image raster is a stream of bits,
while a Postscript program is text, so there has to be an
encoding <br>
from bits to text. Asciihex encoding is just the common
hexadecimal representation of bits. E.g. 8 1 bits would be
encoded as the two characters &rsquo;FF&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the -ascii85 option,
pnmtops uses &rsquo;ascii85&rsquo; encoding instead. This is
an encoding in which 32 bits are encoded into five
characters of text. Thus, it produces less <br>
text for the same raster than asciihex. But ascii85 is not
available in Postscript Level 1, whereas asciihex is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netbpm
10.27 (March 2005).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-psfilter <br>
pnmtops can generate two different kinds of Encapsulated
Postscript programs to represent an image. By default, it
generates a program that redefines readstring in a
cus&acirc; <br>
tom manner and doesn&rsquo;t rely on any built-in Postscript
filters. But with the -psfilter option, pnmtops leaves
readstring alone and uses the built-in Postscript filters
<br>
/ASCII85Decode, /ASCIIHexDecode, /RunLengthDecode, and
/FlateDecode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netbpm
10.27 (March 2005). Before that, pnmtops always used the
custom readstring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The custom code can&rsquo;t do
flate or ascii85 encoding, so you must use -psfilter if you
want those (see -flate, -ascii85).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-level This option determines
the level (version number) of Postscript that pnmtops uses.
By default, pnmtops uses Level 2. Some features of pnmtops
are available only in <br>
higher Postscript levels, so if you specify too low a level
for your image and your options, pnmtops fails. For example,
pnmtops cannot do a color image in Level 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.27 (March 2005). Before that, pnmtops always used Level
2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dict This causes the Postscript
program create a separated dictionary for its local
variables and remove it from the stack as it exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netbpm
10.27 (March 2005).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vmreclaim <br>
This option causes the Postscript program to force a memory
garbage collection as it exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netbpm
10.27 (March 2005).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nocenter <br>
By default, pnmtops centers the image on the output page.
<br>
You can cause pnmtops to instead put the image against the
<br>
lower left corner of the page with the -nocenter <br>
option. This is useful for programs which can include <br>
PostScript files, but can&rsquo;t cope with pictures which
are not <br>
positioned in the lower left corner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For backward compatibility,
pnmtops accepts the option <br>
-center, but it has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-setpage <br>
This causes pnmtops to include a &rsquo;setpagedevice&rsquo;
<br>
directive in the output. This causes the output to violate
specifications <br>
of EPSF encapsulated Postscript, but if you&rsquo;re not
using it in an <br>
encapsulated way, may be what you need. The directive tells
the <br>
printer/plotter what size paper to use (or cut). The
dimensions it <br>
specifies on this directive are those selected by the <br>
-width and -height options or defaulted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From January through May 2002,
the default was to include <br>
&rsquo;setpagedevice&rsquo; and this option did not exist.
Before <br>
January 2002, there was no way to include
&rsquo;setpagedevice&rsquo; <br>
and neither the -setpage nor -nosetpage option existed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nosetpage <br>
This tells pnmtops not to include a
&rsquo;setpagedevice&rsquo; <br>
directive in the output. This is the default, so the option
has no <br>
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the -setpage option for the
history of this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noshowpage <br>
This tells pnmtops not to include a &rsquo;showpage&rsquo;
<br>
directive in the output. By default, pnmtops includes a <br>
&rsquo;showpage&rsquo; at the end of the EPSF program
According to <br>
EPSF specs, this is OK, and the program that includes the
EPSF is <br>
supposed to redefine showpage so this doesn&rsquo;t cause
undesirable <br>
behavior. But it&rsquo;s often easier just not to have the
showpage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This options was new in Netpbm
10.27 (March 2005). Earlier <br>
versions of pnmtops always include the showpage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-showpage <br>
This tells pnmtops to include a &rsquo;showpage&rsquo;
directive <br>
at the end of the EPSF output. This is the default, so the
option has <br>
no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.27 (March 2005).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
This causes informational messages about the conversion
process and <br>
result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
If the PNM image has a maxval greater than 255, pnmtops will
produce output with 8 bits per sample resolution unless you
specify -psfilter, even though Postscript Level 2 has a <br>
12 bits per sample format. pnmtops&rsquo;s custom
raster-generating code just doesn&rsquo;t know the 12 bit
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATIONS <br>
You can use the Postscript output a number of ways. Many
printers take Postscript input (but you still need some kind
of printer driver to transport the Postscript to the <br>
printer).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also the Ghostscript
program (not part of Netpbm), which takes Postscript as
input and generates an output stream to control any of
myriad models of printer (but you <br>
still need some kind of printer driver to transport that
stream to the printer).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ghostscript also can convert the
Postscript file to PDF, which is a very popular document and
image format. Use Ghostscript&rsquo;s pdfwrite output device
type. The program ps2pdf <br>
(distributed with Ghostscript) is a convenient way to run
Ghostscript with pdfwrite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bmeps has a few functions
pnmtops does not, such as the ability to include a
transparency mask in the Postscript program (but not from
PAM input -- only from PNG input).</p>
