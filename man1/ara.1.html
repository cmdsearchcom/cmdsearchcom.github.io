<p>ARA(1) General Commands Manual ARA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ara - a utility for doing boolean regexp queries on the the
Debian package database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Batch mode: <br>
ara [options] query</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In batch mode, ara takes one or
more queries as arguments, read the database files according
to its configuration, and outputs the results to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interactive mode: <br>
ara [options] -i</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the -i or -interactive
options, ara reads the database files and then prompts the
user for queries or commands. The results are displayed
(with the help of a pager such as <br>
more or less if necessary), and ara prompts the user again.
Interactive mode is strongly recommended, since loading the
package databases can be long, but once loaded, queries <br>
run quite fast. This is a major advantage of ara over tools
such as dpkg-iasearch or dpkg-dctrl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For key bindings see KEY
BINDINGS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Graphical interface (GTK2): <br>
A graphical interface, xara(1), is provided by the Debian
package xara-gtk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Query syntax <br>
See the EXAMPLES section for a quick introduction ; xara has
some built-in help. The syntax is described in detail
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ara and xara allow the user to search the Debian software
package database (which includes installed and uninstalled
packages) using powerful queries made of boolean
combinations <br>
of regular expressions acting on fields given by
patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the query
section=utils &amp; depends:(gtk or tk8 or xlibs or kde or
gnome or qt) &amp; debian &amp; package will display
packages in the section utils that have graphical <br>
interfaces (because they depend on graphical toolkits or X11
libraries), and whose description contains the words debian
and package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
Debian users can easily install software with the commands
dselect or apt-get install. They can choose (on Debian 3.1
unstable) from over 30,000 packages. Finding the right <br>
package can be quite difficult. Although packages are
categorized in crude sections, there are still too many
packages and reading all descriptions is out of the
question.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The database files are huge and
their mail-like syntax makes them hard to search with
line-oriented tools like grep. There exist commands such as
dpkg-iasearch(1) or <br>
dpkg-dctrl(1) but their capabilities are limited. Graphical
package management tools such as aptitude or synaptic have
search capabilities. Although ara can call apt to install
<br>
or remove packages, its orientation is that of a powerful
search tool. Indeed, the name ara comes from the imperative
form of the Turkish verb aramak which means &quot;to
search&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE DEBIAN PACKAGE DATABASE <br>
The database of Debian packages is a huge text file at
/var/lib/dpkg/available (or a collection of text files under
/var/lib/apt/lists/). These files are in a mailbox-like
for&acirc; <br>
mat, and a typical entry looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Priority: required <br>
Section: base <br>
Installed-Size: 460 <br>
Origin: debian <br>
Maintainer: Dpkg Development
&lt;debian-dpkg@lists.debian.org&gt; <br>
Bugs: debbugs://bugs.debian.org <br>
Architecture: i386 <br>
Source: dpkg <br>
Version: 1.10.24 <br>
Replaces: dpkg (&lt;&lt; 1.10.3) <br>
Depends: libc6 (&gt;= 2.3.2.ds1-4), .... <br>
Filename: pool/main/d/dpkg/dselect_1.10.24_i386.deb <br>
Size: 119586 <br>
MD5sum: c740f7f68dab08badf4f60b51a33500a <br>
Description: a user tool to manage Debian packages <br>
dselect is the primary user interface for installing,
removing and <br>
managing Debian packages. It is a front-end to dpkg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each package is thus described
by a set of fields (like Package, Description,
Version...).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUERY SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS <br>
Here we describe the query syntax in some detail. As of
version 1.0, ara introduces new, simplified syntax which is
quite traditional and should be familiar to anyone having
<br>
used search engines. Search terms are simply combined with
AND, OR and NOT boolean operators. Having a look at the
EXAMPLES section at the end of this manual should provide
you <br>
a starting point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consider the set D of Debian
package descriptions contained in the file
/var/lib/dpkg/available (or in files under
/var/lib/apt/lists/). Each description is a set of couples
of <br>
the form (f,v) where f and v are strings: f is the name of
the field (namely, Package, Description, Filename, Depends,
etc.); v is its value. Thus D is a set of set of couples,
<br>
forming the universe. Queries select subsets of the universe
D. Output options select which fields of the selected part
of the universe to display, and how to display them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Queries <br>
A query is a boolean combination of atomic expressions. An
atomic expression selects a subset of the set D of
descriptions. I call this set the meaning of the expression;
if e <br>
denotes an atomic expression, its meaning is denoted by [e].
The meaning of a boolean combination of atomic expressions
is just the boolean combination of the meaning of its <br>
constituents. In other words, if e1 and e2 are atomic
expressions, then e1 &amp; e2 is a query, whose meaning is
the intersection of the meanings of e1 and e2; and the
meaning of e1 <br>
| e2 is the union of the meanings of e1 and e2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Atomic expressions <br>
Atomic expressions can be of the forms pattern, /regexp/,
quoted_string, fieldspec operator1 string, or fieldspec
operator2 regexp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Boolean operators and constants
<br>
e1 &amp; e2 (also e1 AND e2, e1 and e2) <br>
This is logical conjunction (set intersection). Returns the
intersection of [e1] and [e2], i.e. packages satisfying both
e1 and e2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e1 | e2 (also e1 OR e2, e1 or
e2) <br>
This is logical disjunction (set union). Union of [e1] and
[e2], i.e. packages satisfying e1, e2 or both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!e1 (also NOT e1, not e1) <br>
This is logical negation (set complementation). Complement
of [e1], i.e. packages not satisfying e1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that ~ stands for
the current default field specifier and is not an alias for
the complementation operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">true (also all) <br>
The set of all descriptions, i.e. all packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">false (also none) <br>
The empty set, i.e. no packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Field specifiers <br>
A field specifier fieldspec is a comma-separated list of
field patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Field patterns are like simple
shell patterns and they may contain star characters (which
stand for anything) or question marks (which stand for any
single character). They are <br>
case-insensitive. They specify a set of fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example description and
Description specify the set of fields { Description },
whereas de* specifies { Description, Depends }.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special specifier ~ denotes
the current default specifier (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Current fields specifiers and
simplified atomic expressions <br>
The need to repeat the field specifier can make the above
syntax cumbersome. That is why there is a current field
specifier. The current field specified is, by default, <br>
Description,Package. Simplified atomic expressions are
simply words or simplified shell expressions (which do not
need to be enclosed in double quotes) and they are searched
in <br>
fields in the current field specifier. They can be made of
letters, digits, underscores, dashes and periods. They may
contain stars of question marks which are interpreted as
<br>
for field patterns (i.e., as simplified shell expressions).
If double quotes are used, other characters and spaces can
be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default field specifier in a
query query can be changed to fieldspec by simply prefixing
the query with fieldspec:. This gives fieldspec:query.
However if query is complex <br>
(i.e., contains binary boolean operators) you need to
enclose query in parentheses, as in fieldspec:(query1 or
query2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">String literals <br>
String literals can be given with or without double quotes;
without double quotes, the syntax is as for C identifiers,
except that you can use dashes, you must start with a latin
<br>
letter ([a-zA-Z]) and you can continue with Latin letters,
decimal digits or underscore ([a-zA-Z0-9_]). Inside double
quotes, all characters are allowed, except double quotes,
<br>
which must be preceded by a backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variables <br>
Results of queries can be stored in variables, which may be
recalled later. This isn&rsquo;t very useful in batch mode
but is useful in interactive and graphical modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable names start with a
dollar and follow usual conventions for variables, i.e.,
they can be any mix of alphanumeric characters and symbols
such as underscore, dash, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable names are
case-sensitive so that $Installed and $installed are
different.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To assign the result of a query
(which is a set of packages) a variable named $variable just
execute the query $variable := query. You may then recall
this particular set by <br>
simply writing $variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: $installed :=
status:(installed &amp; !not-installed)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operators <br>
Hierarchical comparison operators can be negated by changing
the direction of the angle brackets and adding or removing
an equality sign at end (&lt;= becomes &gt;). Other
operators <br>
are negated as follows: = becomes != and =~ becomes !~.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fieldspec=string <br>
Atomic expression selecting packages having a field in
fieldspec having a value a value exactly equal to
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fieldspec&lt;string
(fieldspec&lt;=string, fieldspec&gt;string,
fieldspec&gt;=string) <br>
Atomic expression selecting packages having a field in
fieldspec whose value is strictly less than string. The
order used is the Debian versioning order. This order is
<br>
compatible with the natural order on integers and with
Debian version numbers. When comparing strings not
containing special characters, letters sort before numbers,
as <br>
opposed to lexicographic ASCII order we are used to. This
means that hexadecimal numbers (such as MD5 sums) will not
have their usual order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that string must be on the
right side of the operator (i.e., you cannot write 1000 &lt;
Size).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fieldspec=~/expression/ (also
fieldspec:/expression/) <br>
Selects descriptions whose field named fieldspec exists and
whose value matches, case-sensitively, the regular
expression expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fieldspec=~/expression/i (also
fieldspec:/expression/i) <br>
Same as above, but the regular expression is
case-insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fieldspec=~/expression/w (also
fieldspec:/expression/w) <br>
Same as above, but the regular expression is case-sensitive
and matches only at word boundaries. Note that
letters-to-digit or digit-to-letter transitions are
considered <br>
to be word boundaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fieldspec=~/expression/iw (also
fieldspec:/expression/iw) <br>
The regular expression here is case-insensitive and matched
at word boundaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regular expressions <br>
Regular expressions are given between a pair of slashes; the
last slash can be followed by a commutative sequence of
letters denoting flags. Regular expression syntax is <br>
sed-like: grouping parentheses and alternation must be
backslashed. For more details, see the Objective Caml manual
chapter on the Str module. In short (x,x1,x2 are
meta-sym&acirc; <br>
bols denoting regular expressions):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/./ Any character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/toto/ Literal string toto.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/x1x2/ Concatenation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/x1x2/ <br>
Alternation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* <br>
Star closure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[c-d] Character range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Word boundaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/x/i Case insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/x/w At word boundaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remark <br>
Most queries will contain an appreciable amount of shell
metacharacters. For example, logical disjunction is denoted
by the pipe character, which is used by all known shells.
<br>
The problem is aggravated by the fact that names of real
commands are likely to appear in the used expressions;
successfully setting up a UNIX pipeline by error is
therefore <br>
plausible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When calling ara from the
command line in batch mode, You are strongly urged to
protect your queries by surrounding them with simple quotes;
never write something like ara <br>
Pack*=~/halt|reboot|shutdown/ as this will very likely
reboot your system (and is incorrect regular expression
syntax, if halt or reboot or shutdown is meant: pipes must
be back&acirc; <br>
slashed). Instead, one should write ara
&rsquo;Pack*=~/haltrebootshutdown /&rsquo;</p>

strategy, conquest or three-dimensional, and yet depend on
either <br>
xlibs or svga to exclude console-based games.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPEED <br>
ara reads the whole database into memory and then processes
queries. Since the database is usually big, this takes some
time. However, queries then run quite fast. So specify <br>
multiple queries or use the -interactive option to amortize
the cost of reading the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LICENSE <br>
ara is released under the GNU General Public License,
version 2, a copy of which is included in the source
distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THANKS <br>
Many thanks to George Danchev, Thomas Schoepf and Sven
Luther for doing the Debian packaging of ara and many
helpful comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILES <br>
The system-wide configuration file for ara is
/etc/ara.config. Its syntax is self-evident and follows the
Ocaml lexical conventions.</p>
