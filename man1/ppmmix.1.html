<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ppmmix - blend together two PPM images</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ppmmix fadefactor ppmfile1 ppmfile2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppmmix reads two PPM images as
input and mixes them together using the specified fade
factor. The fade factor may be in the range from 0.0 (only
ppmfile1&rsquo;s image data) to 1.0 <br>
(only ppmfile2&rsquo;s image data). Anything in between
specifies a smooth blend between the two images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The two images must have the
same dimensions and the same maxval. Before Netpbm 10.54
(March 2011), they must also have the same type
(PBM/PGM/PPM).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fade factor is applied to
brightness, not light intensity. That means for example that
if you have a series of images you generated using ppmmix of
a black and a white image <br>
with a linearly increasing fade factor, you will see an
image getting linearly brighter, but the light intensity
will increase faster at the end. That is because it requires
<br>
more intensity change at the bright end of the scale than at
the dark end for the human eye to perceive the same
brightness change. This also means that if the original
images <br>
aren&rsquo;t all one color, the mixed image is distorted,
since the intensity relationship between pixels is different
from the original image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamcomp is a more general
alternative. It allows you to mix images of different size
and to have the fade factor vary throughout the image
(through the use of an alpha mask). <br>
It does not have the same-maxval and same-type restrictions.
It mixes light intensity, not brightness.</p>
