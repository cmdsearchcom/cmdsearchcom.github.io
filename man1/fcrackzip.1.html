<p>FCRACKZIP(1) General Commands Manual FCRACKZIP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fcrackzip - a Free/Fast Zip Password Cracker</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fcrackzip [-bDBchVvplum2] [--brute-force] [--dictionary]
[--benchmark] [--charset characterset] [--help] [--validate]
[--verbose] [--init-password string/path] [--length min-max]
<br>
[--use-unzip] [--method name] [--modulo r/m] file...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
fcrackzip searches each zipfile given for encrypted files
and tries to guess the password. All files must be encrypted
with the same password, the more files you provide, the <br>
better.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h, --help <br>
Prints the version number and (hopefully) some helpful
insights.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Each -v makes the program more verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --brute-force <br>
Select brute force mode. This tries all possible
combinations of the letters you specify.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --dictionary <br>
Select dictionary mode. In this mode, fcrackzip will read
passwords from a file, which must contain one password per
line and should be alphabetically sorted (e.g. using <br>
sort(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --charset
characterset-specification <br>
Select the characters to use in brute-force cracking. Must
be one of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a include all lowercase
characters [a-z] <br>
A include all uppercase characters [A-Z] <br>
1 include the digits [0-9] <br>
! include [!:$%&amp;/()=?{[]}+*~#] <br>
: the following characters up to the end of the spe- <br>
cification string are included in the character set. <br>
This way you can include any character except binary <br>
null (at least under unix).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, a1:$% selects
lowercase characters, digits and the dollar and percent
signs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --init-password string <br>
Set initial (starting) password for brute-force searching to
string, or use the file with the name string to supply
passwords for dictionary searching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --length min[-max] <br>
Use an initial password of length min, and check all
passwords up to passwords of length max (including). You can
omit the max parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --use-unzip <br>
Try to decompress the first file by calling unzip with the
guessed password. This weeds out false positives when not
enough files have been given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --method name <br>
Use method number &quot;name&quot; instead of the default
cracking method. The switch --help will print a list of
available methods. Use --benchmark to see which method does
perform <br>
best on your machine. The name can also be the number of the
method to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2, --modulo r/m <br>
Calculate only r/m of the password. Not yet supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --benchmark <br>
Make a small benchmark, the output is nearly
meaningless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --validate <br>
Make some basic checks whether the cracker works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZIP PASSWORD BASICS <br>
Have you ever mis-typed a password for unzip? Unzip reacted
pretty fast with &Acirc;&acute;incorrect
password&Acirc;&acute;, without decrypting the whole file.
While the encryption algorithm used by zip <br>
is relatively secure, PK made cracking easy by providing
hooks for very fast password-checking, directly in the zip
file. Understanding these is crucial to zip password
cracking:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each password that is tried,
the first twelve bytes of the file are decrypted. Depending
on the version of zip used to encrypt the file (more on that
later), the first ten or <br>
eleven bytes are random, followed by one or two bytes whose
values are stored elsewhere in the zip file, i.e. are known
beforehand. If these last bytes don&rsquo;t have the correct
<br>
(known) value, the password is definitely wrong. If the
bytes are correct, the password might be correct, but the
only method to find out is to unzip the file and compare the
<br>
uncompressed length and crc&Acirc;&acute;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Earlier versions of pkzip (1.xx)
(and, incidentally, many zip clones for other operating
systems!) stored two known bytes. Thus the error rate was
roughly 1/2^16 = 0.01%. PKWARE <br>
&Acirc;&acute;improved&Acirc;&acute; (interesting what
industry calls improved) the security of their format by
only including one byte, so the possibility of false
passwords is now raised to 0.4%. Unfor&acirc; <br>
tunately, there is no real way to distinguish one byte from
two byte formats, so we have to be conservative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BRUTE FORCE MODE <br>
By default, brute force starts at the given starting
password, and successively tries all combinations until they
are exhausted, printing all passwords that it detects,
together <br>
with a rough correctness indicator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The starting password given by
the -p switch determines the length. fcrackzip will not
currently increase the password length automatically, unless
the -l switch is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DICTIONARY MODE <br>
This mode is similar to brute force mode, but instead of
generating passwords using a given set of characters and a
length, the passwords will be read from a file that you have
<br>
to specify using the -p switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CP MASK <br>
A CP mask is a method to obscure images or parts of images
using a password. These obscured images can be restored even
when saved as JPEG files. In most of these files the <br>
password is actually hidden and can be decoded easily (using
one of the many available viewer and masking programs, e.g.
xv). If you convert the image the password, however, is <br>
lost. The cpmask crack method can be used to brute-force
these images. Instead of a zip file you supply the obscured
part (and nothing else) of the image in the PPM-Image Format
<br>
(xv and other viewers can easily do this).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The cpmask method can only cope
with password composed of uppercase letters, so be sure to
supply the --charset A or equivalent option, together with a
suitable initialization <br>
password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
fcrackzip -c a -p aaaaaa sample.zip <br>
checks the encrypted files in sample.zip for all lowercase 6
character passwords (aaaaaa ... abaaba ... ghfgrg ...
zzzzzz).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fcrackzip --method cpmask
--charset A --init AAAA test.ppm <br>
checks the obscured image test.ppm for all four character
passwords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fcrackzip -D -p passwords.txt
sample.zip <br>
check for every password listed in the file
passwords.txt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERFORMANCE <br>
fzc, which seems to be widely used as a fast password
cracker, claims to make 204570 checks per second on my
machine (measured under plain dos w/o memory manager).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fcrackzip, being written in C
and not in assembler, naturally is slower. Measured on a
slightly loaded unix (same machine), it&Acirc;&acute;s 12
percent slower (the compiler used was pgcc, <br>
from http://www.gcc.ml.org/).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To remedy this a bit, I
converted small parts of the encryption core to x86
assembler (it will still compile on non x86 machines), and
now it&Acirc;&acute;s about 4-12 percent faster than fzc
<br>
(again, the fcrackzip performance was measured under a
multitasking os, so there are inevitably some meaurement
errors), so there shouldn&rsquo;t be a tempting reason to
switch to <br>
other programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Further improvements are
definitely possible: fzc took 4 years to get into shape,
while fcrackzip was hacked together in under 10 hours. And
not to forget you have the source, <br>
while other programs (like fzc), even come as an encrypted
.exe file (maybe because their programmers are afraid of
other people could having a look at their lack of
programming <br>
skills? nobody knows...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The reason I wrote fcrackzip was NOT to have the fastest zip
cracker available, but to provide a portable, free (thus
extensible), but still fast zip password cracker. I was <br>
really pissed of with that dumb, nonextendable zipcrackers
that were either slow, were too limited, or wouldn&rsquo;t
run in the background (say, under unix). (And you
can&rsquo;t run them <br>
on your superfast 600Mhz Alpha).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
No automatic unzip checking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stop/resume facility is
missing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Should be able to distinguish
between files with 16 bit stored CRC&Acirc;&acute;s and 8
bit stored CRC&Acirc;&acute;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The benchmark does not work on
all systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s still early
alpha.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Method &quot;cpmask&quot; only
accepts ppms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Could be faster.</p>
