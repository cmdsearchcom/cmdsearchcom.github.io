<i>fcrackzip</i> searches each zipfile given for encrypted files and tries to
  guess the password. All files must be encrypted with the same password, the
  more files you provide, the better.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ZIP_PASSWORD_BASICS"><a class="selflink" href="#ZIP_PASSWORD_BASICS">ZIP
  PASSWORD BASICS</a></h1>
Have you ever mis-typed a password for unzip? Unzip reacted pretty fast with
  &#x00B4;incorrect password&#x00B4;, <i>without</i> decrypting the whole file.
  While the encryption algorithm used by zip is relatively secure, PK made
  cracking easy by providing hooks for very fast password-checking, directly in
  the zip file. Understanding these is crucial to zip password cracking:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For each password that is tried, the first twelve bytes of the file are
  decrypted. Depending on the version of zip used to encrypt the file (more on
  that later), the first ten or eleven bytes are random, followed by one or two
  bytes whose values are stored elsewhere in the zip file, i.e. are known
  beforehand. If these last bytes don't have the correct (known) value, the
  password is definitely wrong. If the bytes are correct, the password
  <i>might</i> be correct, but the only method to find out is to unzip the file
  and compare the uncompressed length and crc&#x00B4;s.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Earlier versions of pkzip (1.xx) (and, incidentally, many zip clones for other
  operating systems!) stored two known bytes. Thus the error rate was roughly
  1/2^16 = 0.01%. PKWARE &#x00B4;improved&#x00B4; (interesting what industry
  calls improved) the security of their format by only including one byte, so
  the possibility of false passwords is now raised to 0.4%. Unfortunately, there
  is no real way to distinguish one byte from two byte formats, so we have to be
  conservative.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BRUTE_FORCE_MODE"><a class="selflink" href="#BRUTE_FORCE_MODE">BRUTE
  FORCE MODE</a></h1>
By default, brute force starts at the given starting password, and successively
  tries all combinations until they are exhausted, printing all passwords that
  it detects, together with a rough correctness indicator.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The starting password given by the <i>-p</i> switch determines the length.
  fcrackzip will not currently increase the password length automatically,
  unless the <i>-l</i> switch is used.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DICTIONARY_MODE"><a class="selflink" href="#DICTIONARY_MODE">DICTIONARY
  MODE</a></h1>
This mode is similar to brute force mode, but instead of generating passwords
  using a given set of characters and a length, the passwords will be read from
  a file that you have to specify using the <i>-p</i> switch.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CP_MASK"><a class="selflink" href="#CP_MASK">CP
  MASK</a></h1>
A CP mask is a method to obscure images or parts of images using a password.
  These obscured images can be restored even when saved as JPEG files. In most
  of these files the password is actually hidden and can be decoded easily
  (using one of the many available viewer and masking programs, e.g. xv). If you
  convert the image the password, however, is lost. The <b>cpmask</b> crack
  method can be used to brute-force these images. Instead of a zip file you
  supply the obscured part (and nothing else) of the image in the
  <b>PPM</b>-Image Format ( <b>xv</b> and other viewers can easily do this).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>cpmask</b> method can only cope with password composed of uppercase
  letters, so be sure to supply the <b>--charset A</b> or equivalent option,
  together with a suitable initialization password.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>fcrackzip -c a -p aaaaaa sample.zip</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">checks the encrypted files in sample.zip for all lowercase
      6 character passwords (aaaaaa ... abaaba ... ghfgrg ... zzzzzz).</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">check for every password listed in the file

</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PERFORMANCE"><a class="selflink" href="#PERFORMANCE">PERFORMANCE</a></h1>
<i>fzc</i>, which seems to be widely used as a fast password cracker, claims to
  make 204570 checks per second on my machine (measured under plain dos w/o
  memory manager).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<i>fcrackzip</i>, being written in C and not in assembler, naturally is slower.
  Measured on a slightly loaded unix (same machine), it&#x00B4;s 12 percent
  slower (the compiler used was <i>pgcc</i>, from
  <b>http://www.gcc.ml.org/</b>).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To remedy this a bit, I converted small parts of the encryption core to x86
  assembler (it will still compile on non x86 machines), and now it&#x00B4;s
  about 4-12 percent faster than <i>fzc</i> (again, the <i>fcrackzip</i>
  performance was measured under a multitasking os, so there are inevitably some
  meaurement errors), so there shouldn't be a tempting reason to switch to other
  programs.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Further improvements are definitely possible: <i>fzc</i> took 4 years to get
  into shape, while fcrackzip was hacked together in under 10 hours. And not to
  forget you have the source, while other programs (like <i>fzc</i>), even come
  as an <i>encrypted .exe</i> file (maybe because their programmers are afraid
  of other people could having a look at their lack of programming skills?
  nobody knows...)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="selflink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
The reason I wrote <i>fcrackzip</i> was <b>NOT</b> to have the fastest zip
  cracker available, but to provide a <i>portable</i>, <i>free</i> (thus
  <i>extensible</i>), but still <i>fast</i> zip password cracker. I was really
  pissed of with that dumb, nonextendable zipcrackers that were either slow,
  were too limited, or wouldn't run in the background (say, under unix). (And
  you can't run them on your superfast 600Mhz Alpha).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
No automatic unzip checking.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Stop/resume facility is missing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Should be able to distinguish between files with 16 bit stored CRC&#x00B4;s and
  8 bit stored CRC&#x00B4;s.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The benchmark does not work on all systems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It's still early alpha.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Method &quot;cpmask&quot; only accepts ppms.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Could be faster.
