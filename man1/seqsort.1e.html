<p>SEQSORT(1e) EMBOSS Manual for Debian SEQSORT(1e)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
seqsort - Remove ambiguous classified sequences from DHF
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
seqsort -dhfindir directory -overlap integer -dofamilies
toggle -doambiguities toggle -dhfoutdir outdir -hitsfile
outfile -ambigfile outfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">seqsort -help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
seqsort is a command line program from EMBOSS (&acirc;the
European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite&acirc;). It
is part of the &quot;Protein:3D Structure&quot; command
group(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Input section <br>
-dhfindir directory <br>
This option specifies the location of DHF files (domain hits
files) (input). A &rsquo;domain hits file&rsquo; contains
database hits (sequences) with domain classification
information, <br>
in the DHF format (FASTA or EMBL-like). The hits are
relatives to a SCOP or CATH family and are found from a
search of a sequence database. Files containing hits
retrieved by <br>
PSIBLAST are generated by using SEQSEARCH. Default value:
./</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Required section <br>
-overlap integer <br>
This option specifies the number of overlapping residues
required for merging of two hits. Each family is also
processed so that ovlerapping hits (hits with identical <br>
accesssion number that overlap by at least a user-defined
number of residues) are replaced by a hit that is produced
from merging the two overlapping hits. Default value: 10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dofamilies toggle <br>
This option specifies to write a domain families file. If
this option is set a domain families file is written.
Default value: N</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-doambiguities toggle <br>
This option specifies whether to write a domain ambiguities
file. If this option is set a domain ambiguities file is
written. Default value: N</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output section <br>
-dhfoutdir outdir <br>
This option specifies the location of DHF files (domain hits
files) (output). A &rsquo;domain hits file&rsquo; contains
database hits (sequences) with domain classification
information, <br>
in the DHF format (FASTA or EMBL-like). The hits are
relatives to a SCOP or CATH family and are found from a
search of a sequence database. Files containing hits
retrieved by <br>
PSIBLAST are generated by using SEQSEARCH. Default value:
./</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hitsfile outfile <br>
This option specifies the name of domain families file
(output). A &rsquo;domain families file&rsquo; contains
sequence relatives (hits) for each of a number of different
SCOP or CATH <br>
families found from searching a sequence database, e.g. by
using SEQSEARCH (psiblast). The file contains the collated
search results for the indvidual families; only those <br>
hits of unambiguous family assignment are included. Hits of
ambiguous family assignment are assigned as relatives to a
SCOP or CATH superfamily or fold instead and are <br>
collated into a &rsquo;domain ambiguities file&rsquo;. The
domain families and ambiguities files are generated by using
SEQSORT and use the same format as a DHF file (domain hits
file). <br>
Default value: fam.dhf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ambigfile outfile <br>
This option specifies the name of domain ambiguities file
(output). A &rsquo;domain families file&rsquo; contains
sequence relatives (hits) for each of a number of different
SCOP or CATH <br>
families found from searching a sequence database, e.g. by
using SEQSEARCH (psiblast). The file contains the collated
search results for the indvidual families; only those <br>
hits of unambiguous family assignment are included. Hits of
ambiguous family assignment are assigned as relatives to a
SCOP or CATH superfamily or fold instead and are <br>
collated into a &rsquo;domain ambiguities file&rsquo;. The
domain families and ambiguities files are generated by using
SEQSORT and use the same format as a DHF file (domain hits
file). <br>
Default value: oth.dhf</p>
