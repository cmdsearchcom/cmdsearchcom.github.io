 colmux - multiplex communications to multiple systems running collectl from a
  single system
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

colmux [-command &quot;collectl-switches... [-p filespec]]&quot; [-address
  addr1[,addr2,...]|-addr filename] [-cols col1[,col2...]] | [-column num]
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This utility gathers up data generated by collectl from multiple systems and
  multiplexes it into a single consolidated format. It runs in essentially 2
  distinct modes, the first is known as real-time, because data is retrieved and
  displayed in real time. The second is playback mode because data is played
  back from existing collectl data files.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There are also 2 general formats for the data being displayed. The first is a
  multi-line display in which the data is displayed in the native form that
  collectl displays it, except it is sorted by a distint column, essentially
  allowing one to see the TOP producers of that data. The second format is a
  single line display in which one or more distinct data elements from each
  source is displayed on the same line. This latter format is never sorted, but
  rather positionally organized by the name of the system that generated it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Collectl will be then be executed, using any optional switches specified by
  -command, on each of the systems specified by -address OR read those addresses
  from a file it the target of that switch is a filename rather than a list of
  hosts OR on the local system if -address is not specified. See collectl for
  details of the various switches. In some cases certain collectl switches will
  not make sense in a colmux environment and if chosen will generate an error.
  Further, if hosts are specified with -address, they should be a individual
  addresses or hostnames separated by commas. In turn, any of them can be in
  what those familiar with pdsh would recognize as -w format.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Colmux will then execute the collectl command, gather the results from all
  sources for a particular interval and display them one result per line, sorted
  by the specified column OR all on the same line in groups specified by -cols.
  The number of lines displayed is set to the size of the terminal window by
  default, but can be changed using -lines. The one exception is the use of
  -nosort which only applies to the playback of existing collectl raw files. In
  this mode all records for a particular interval will be displayed and the
  sorting bypassed, making this a speedy and convenient mechanism for gathering
  all data from all systems in one place for potential further processing.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Colmux will never modify the size of the terminal window so to see more or wider
  lines either expand the window or override the number of display lines and run
  it again. If the number display lines is set greater then the terminal height
  or 0, colmux will no longer overlay the previous window and simply run in a
  continuous scrolling mode.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Common Switches
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-address list|pdsh|filename</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Specify any combination of addresses as
  hostnames OR in pdsh -w format OR a filename containing a list of
  hostnames/addresses, 1 per line. You MUST have passwordless ssh access to
  these nodes. If a different username is required, be sure to specify addresses
  in username@host format noting you do not have to have the same username on
  each host. If specified, these usernames will override those specified with
  the -username switch. rsh access is not supported.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-command switches</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">One can specify virtually any collectl command
  here, both in real-time or playback mode. Some switches may only be used
  during one mode or the other and colmux will usually let you know if you
  specify an invalid combination or an otherwise restricted switch. Only those
  directly affecting colmux are listed below:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--from, --thru</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Limit the timeframe for data being played
  back, noting you can include both the from and thru times with the --from
  switch if you separate then with a hyphen.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-o time-format</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This is a &quot;magic&quot; switch in that it
  not only tells collectl how to display dates/times (no other options are
  permitted using -o other than those from the set [dDTm]), it also tells colmux
  how to display dates/times too.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In single line mode, the timestamp will either come from the host system in
  real-time mode OR the first host when run in playback mode. This is the most
  common use/need for this switch. But be careful in choosing column numbers
  with -cols as the position of the data shifts by 1 when time is included and
  by 2 if date and time are. Using -test will correctly show the shifted
  positions but only if you include -o with the command at the same time you use
  -test.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In real-time/top mode this switch is not allowed since colmux simply reports the
  current time of the system it is running on.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When playing back data multi-line formatted data from one or more files, a
  timestamp for each interval is reported, consisting of the time of that
  interval. When this switch is included, each line will be tagged with an
  appropriate timestamp since on rare occasions they may not necessarily all be
  identical.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-p playback-file</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This switch tells colmux to run in playback
  mode. The filename should include the directory location and is usually
  specified with wild cards, limiting the selected file(s) to a specific date.
  When those files are on the same host (-address is not specified), they may be
  for multiple hosts, but when the files are on remote hosts they must all be
  for be that unique host. If the file specification includes the string TODAY
  or YESTERDAY they will be replaced with *yyyymmdd* for that date.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-P</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Run collectl in plot-format. This allows one
  to specify just about any combination of subsystems since all data is always
  displayed on a single line. However, due to the lack of formatting, this also
  makes no sense for multi-line displays and is therefore only supported in
  single-line format.</div>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-help</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Show a brief help message and exit.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-hostwidth n</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">By default, colmux set the hostwidth to 8,
  unless it sees something wider and for most situations this is sufficient.
  However, if one specifies hostnames that are aliases of the longer hostname,
  colmux has no way of knowing the real hostlengths until after it starts
  receiving data from collectl and the formatting will be off if the hostnames
  are longer than the default. To overcome this problem, use this switch to
  force the hostname to be wider.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-lines</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Change the number of lines that are displayed
  for each interval in multi-line mode. The default will be determined by the
  terminal size returned by the linux resize command if present. If that command
  is not present, the size will be initially set to 24. If -lines is greater
  than the terminal size or 0, top-like behavior will not be used when in
  real-time mode.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Single-line format controls the number of lines displayed between headers. A
  value of 0 will only display the header one time.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-noescape</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Colmux uses brute-force screen formatting,
  that is it generates its own VT100 escape sequences to clear lines and/or move
  the cursor. On some occasions you may want to disable this sequences if you
  wish to recode the output and do your own post-processing of it. This switch
  will do just that.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-port</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Sometimes a remote version of collectl is
  already using the default socket. This allows one to start another instance
  and override that value.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-test</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This tells colmux to execute the specified
  collectl command either locally or on the first remote system specified by
  -address, print the associated header with the selected column(s) highlighted
  and also include each column name along with its ordinal number, making it
  fairly easy to make sure you've selected the right column(s).</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-username name</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Use this username for ALL ssh commands. It can
  be overridden for specific hosts by specifying them with the -address switch
  with the desired hostnames.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-version</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Display the version and exit. It will also
  report if Term::ReadKey is installed and if so what its version number
  is.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Playback Mode Specific
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The following additional switches only apply to playback mode. There are no
  real-time mode specific switches.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-delay seconds</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Introduce a delay between intervals in
  seconds. You can specify fractional values. Not using this switch will cause
  the output to be displayed as fast as it can be rendered.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-home</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move the cursor to the home position (upper
  left-hand corner) of the display to use a top-like display format. This ONLY
  applies to multi-line mode when in playback mode and provides a mechanism for
  displaying recorded data in a top-like fashion.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-hostfilter addr[,addr]</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">When playing back files for multiple hosts on
  the local system, sometimes you do not want to play back ALL the host files.
  This filter allows you to specify only those hosts which you want to process.
  The format of the list of addresses is specified in the same way as -address
  except that you cannot specify a filename.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-nosort</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Intended primarily for output that would be
  redirected to a file, do not sort or include any escape sequences in the
  output.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Multi-Line Format
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">When there is more output then will fit on the
  screen, colmux includes the text:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Displaying: lines xx thru yy out of zz</div>
on the right-side of the top line of the display, where xx is typically 1.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
However, once colmux is running, one might want to look at subsequent lines, ie
  those below the bottom of the screen and therefore invisible. If the ReadKey
  module is installed, one can simply use the PageDown key to move down the
  display and the PageUp key to move in the other direction. If ReadKey is not
  installed, typing the multi-key sequences pd&lt;ENTER&gt; or pu&lt;ENTER&gt;
  will cause the same thing to happen.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-colhelp</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">When you wish to change the sort column and
  the arrow keys aren't available to you, it may be cumbersome to identify the
  number of the column to type in followed by RETURN. This tells colmux to
  display the numbers over each column eliminating the need to manually count
  them and find the one you want.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-column num</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Set the sort column to this number. The column
  numbering is determined by the columns returned by collectl for the requested
  command. Since date/time columns are optional for non-plot data, their
  inclusion will change the numbering of the columns so if you are not sure you
  selected the correct column, you should first execute your command with -test
  included.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can also change the column number interactively with the RIGHT/LEFT arrow
  keys IF the ReadKey module is installed (see colmux -version) OR simply type
  it in followed by the &lt;ENTER&gt; key.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-finalcr</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">There is a real odd case in which you might
  want to pipe colmux real-time output to a script for further processing.
  However, if you do this you can't read the final line with a routine that
  expects a terminating CR, like python's readline(). Rather, that last line and
  the one that follows will be returned as one long string. This switch tell
  colmux to insert that final CR, which WILL mess up the screen under normal
  operations, so be forewarned.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-hostformat char:pos</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">There are times one has long hostnames which
  can either take up valuable screen real estate or are simply painful to look
  at. This switch may evolve over time and is currently targetted as hostnames
  that have repeating parts along with a unique part, separated by a character
  such as a hyphen. This switch allows you to specify a single character
  followed by the piece of the hostname you'd like to see displayed. For
  example, if you have a hostname like aaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd, -hostformat -:3 will
  cause the cccc piece to be displayed.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-nobold</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Do not highlight the selected column. This may
  be useful when redirecting output to a file and you do not want the associated
  escape sequences to be written to it.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-reverse</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Reverse the default sort order. You can also
  change the direction of the sort interactively with the UP/DOWN arrow keys IF
  the ReadKey module is installed (see colmux -version)
<br/>
 OR simply type the r key and &lt;ENTER&gt;.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-zero</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Do not display any rows with 0 in the sort
  column. You can also type z&lt;ENTER&gt;interactively.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Single-Line Format
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-col1000</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Divide each column by 1000 before
  display</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-colk</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Divide each column by 1024 before
  display</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-collog10</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Remap large numbers to a smaller number of
  values by taking the log10 of them and further transforming by the followign
  mapping: 0,1 to 0, 10 to 10, 100 to 20, 1000 to 30, 10000 to 40, ... 1e9 to
  90.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-cols num,...</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Group all data together for each host by
  column number(s). As with -column, you can confirm the correct column(s) have
  been selected by first running with -test.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-colnodet</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Do not show data for individual hosts, just
  display the totals.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-colnodiv num,...</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Do not divide the specified column numbers by
  1000 or 1024 when col1000 or colk or apply the colllog10 transformation when
  specified. A typical usage is if you want to look at cpu loads as well as
  network or disk stats in which case you may want to divide the latter by 1024
  but not the cpu.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-colnoinst</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Do no include instance portion (and
  surrounding brackets) in totals column headers.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-coltotal</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Include the totals for each column to the
  right.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-colwidth</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Set the output columns to this width,
  typically used in conjunction with -col1000 or colk to allow more hosts to fit
  onto the same line. It can also be used if the host names are too narrow for
  column headers and you have room to display wider names.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Exception Reporting Specific
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In single-line format, rather than wait for all hosts to report their data,
  colmux simply reports the last data seen when the time to generate a line of
  output has come. In most cases, these do reflect the most recent data values
  but in times of load, the data may be late getting to colmux and so a previous
  value may be reported. If the age of that data exceeds a defined number of
  intervals, the default is currently 2, an exception value will be reported of
  -1. At other times it has been seen where kernel/driver bugs may cause
  incorrect values to be reported as negative numbers and those values are also
  reported as -1. Both the age and exception values can be changed with the
  following switches.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-age number</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">When initially starting up and all hosts have
  not yet reported any data, colmux will display a -1 to indicate no data has
  been seen yet. If during processing a host fails to report in -age intervals,
  the default is 2, colmux will also report a -1 indicating the data is
  stale.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-negdataval val</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">In some cases, there could be erroneous data
  reported as negative numbers (though sometimes negative numbers are valid).
  When specified, replace any negative numbers with this value.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-nodataval val</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This switch allows you to change the -1 that
  is normally reported for missing or stale data to the specified value, most
  commonly 0.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Diagnostics
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The following switches are intended more for diagnostic purposes than normal
  operation, though are also worth using on appropriate occasions.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-debug val</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This switch is for generating diagnostic
  information at various levels. It is actually a bit mask, whose values are
  listed in the beginning on colmux itself. Perhaps the most useful value is 1
  as it will cause colmux to display all the remote commands issues to each host
  in the address list and can often reveal problems when things don't seem to be
  working correctly</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-nocheck</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This switch was initially included in an
  earlier version when remote host checking was causing problem in some cases
  and by skipping those checks, colmux would run more reliably. While it is felt
  that as of V3.2.0 these reachability checks are now reliable and should not be
  skipped, this switch has been left in place.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-quiet</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">By default and when -nocheck not specified,
  colmux checks the versions of all collectl instances against that of the first
  node found to be running collectl and if different, reports the mismatch. This
  switch suppresses that warning.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When a connection is received from an unexpected address, a warning is also
  reported and the request promptly ignored. This switch also suppresses those
  messages as well. For more information on problems connecting, see CONNECTION
  PROBLEMS.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-reachable</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">By default, when a node is found to not be
  reachable, colmux will remove it from its list of hosts and continue
  execution. This switch will tell colmux to exit when all hosts are not
  reachable.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Miscellaneous
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There are 2 switches whose descriptions don't really fit anywhere else:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-colbin path</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">On rare occasions, such as testing a patch to
  collectl in a copy NOT in /usr/bin, you may want to tell colmux to use that
  copy instead of the standard one. Use this switch to point to that copy.
  Naturally that copy must exist in that location on all systems.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-keepalive secs</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Colmux uses ssh to start collectl on each
  remote machine and then communications between collectl and colmux occur over
  a socket. Normally, ssh is configured to timeout after an interval of
  inactivity, such as 30 minutes, which means a long-running colmux session will
  begin to lose connections when this interval is reached. By specifying a
  keepalive interval, you're telling the ssh to send a periodic keepalive to the
  other end so that connection doesn't get dropped.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-retaddr addr</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Tell remote collectls to open a socket on this
  address instead of the preselected one. For more details on this, see
  CONNECTION PROBLEMS.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-timeout secs</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">By default, collectl waits up to 10 seconds
  for remote instances of collectl to connect back. On slower networks or when a
  very large number of instances have been started, they may fail to connect
  back in time. This switch will extend that timeout, but it also requires
  collectl V3.6.4 be used because earlier version do not support this
  feature.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-timerange secs</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">When colmux starts up and checks the
  connectivity to all the machines specified by -addr, it also gets their
  current date/time and using that computes the range of system times across all
  nodes. If that time is found to be more then -timerange seconds, colmux
  generates a warning as this difference could cause reporting probems. One can
  increase the range to get rid of the message (not recommended unless other
  factors are preventing nodes from responding quickly enough to the date
  command) OR suppress the warning with -quiet.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PLAYBACK_MODE_RESTRICTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#PLAYBACK_MODE_RESTRICTIONS">PLAYBACK
  MODE RESTRICTIONS</a></h1>
All logs being played back must have been collected using the same interval as
  colmux only looks at the first file/host to determine the appropriate value.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
It is assumed all clocks are reasonably well synchronized as colmux uses time to
  determine which data is to be displayed as a set.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
All files must be in the same directory on all systems and that directory must
  be included in the playback file specification
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
All files on a remote host must be for that host only
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
Run collectl on 3 nodes, showing CPU, Disk and Network statistics once a second
  and sorted by column 1, which happens to be total cpu.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>colmux -addr abc,def,xyz</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Dynamically display top processes on nodes n1-n10 of a cluster once a second,
  sorted by column 5.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>colmux -addr n[1-10] -command &quot;-sZ :1&quot; -column 5</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Do the same for yesterday, between the hours of 5AM and 6AM, being sure to stall
  for 1/2 second between intervals. Note, if you leave off -addr you could put
  all the logs into /var/log/collectl on the local host and play them back from
  there.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>colmux -addr n[1-10] -command &quot;-sZ -p/var/log/collectl/YESTERDAY -from
  05:00-06:00&quot; -column 5 -delay .5</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Look at the amount of mapped and slab memory consumed on nodes n1-n10 and n15 in
  real-time, every 2 seconds using single-line format. Include totals and
  preface each line with the time. Since memory sizes tend to be rather large,
  divide each by 1024 so we see MB rather than KB. Note that the columns numbers
  are always displayed are ascending order regardless of their order in -cols.
  To be sure, first test the column numbers.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>colmux -addr n[1-10,15] -command &quot;-sm -i2 -oT&quot; -cols 6,7 -coltot
  -colk -test</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>colmux -addr n[1-10,15] -command &quot;-sm -i2 -oT&quot; -cols 6,7 -coltot
  -colk</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Display most active disks, based on KB written, on nodes n1, n4 and n5.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>colmux -addr n1,n4,n5 -command &quot;-sD&quot; -column 6</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Here is a cool trick. Collectl currently lets you look at top processes with the
  --top switch and even choose a sort column by name. However, if you want to
  change the column you need to exit, then rerun collectl with a different sort
  column name. But if you run it like this example, you get the power of colmux
  to dynamically change the sort columns with the arrow keys! You can also use
  this technique to have collectl dynamically sort any local multi-line data
  such as slabs or even detail data like CPU, Disk, Lustre and Networks too!
  Naturally this technique works just as well with playing back data as well.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>colmux -command &quot;-sZ -i:1&quot;</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

colmux requires passwordless ssh between the node it is running on those it is
  monitoring. also be sure the port you are using for communications, the
  default is 2655, if open
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

The way colmux works is to choose an address it wants to communicate over and
  starts up one or more remote copies of collectl, telling them to connect back
  to colmux using that address. The easiest way to see this, is to run colmux
  with -noesc, which tells it NOT to issue any escape sequences and therefore
  not to run in full screen mode. The addional switch of -debug 1 tells it to
  show the remote collectl startup command. When there is a communications
  problem you will typically see 'connection timed out' messages displayed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There are actually a couple of possibilities here, one of which is a firewall is
  preventing connections and the easiest way to test this is run collectl on the
  local machine like this: collectl -Aserver. This tells collectl run as a
  server, listening for connections just like colmux. Then log into a remote
  machine and run /usr/share/collectl/util/client.pl addr-of-server which tells
  client.pl to open a socket to that copy of collectl. It should fail just like
  when it was run via colmux, so try opening the firewall and try it again. If
  it fixes the problem, it was indeed the firewall blocking things and colmux
  should now work just fine.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Sometimes there are multiple interfaces defined on the machine hosting colmux
  and in some cases only some addresses will allow socket connections. Again,
  using client.pl on the remote machine try connecting back to collectl over
  different addresses and when you find one that works, tell colmux to use that
  address for communication via the -retaddr switch.
