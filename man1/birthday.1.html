<p>birthday(1) General Commands Manual birthday(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
birthday - warn about upcoming birthdays and other
events</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
birthday [-w|-c] [-f file] [-W defwarn] [-M maxwarn] [-m
minwarn] [-l lines] [-p weeks] [-d total] [-i width]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The birthday command reads a file, by default ~/.birthdays,
which gives a list of events in the near future (see section
FILE FORMAT for details). It can then produce either a <br>
list of events which are coming up within the next few
weeks, or a text-based calendar with a few lines for each
day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-w Display a list of upcoming events. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Display a calendar, designed
to be piped to lpr(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f file <br>
Read the events from file rather than ~/.birthdays. If file
is a single hyphen, read the events from the standard input
(usually the terminal).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List Options <br>
-W warn <br>
Warn warn days in advance, for entries that have no w flag
(see FILE FORMAT). If this switch is not specified, it
defaults to 21 days.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M max Warn at most max days in
advance. This overrides any flag given in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m min Warn at least min days in
advance. This overrides any flag given in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Calendar Options <br>
-l lines <br>
Print lines lines for every day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p weeks <br>
Print weeks weeks on every page of the calendar. If set to
0, the default, disables page breaks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d days <br>
Print the calendar for up to days days in advance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i width <br>
Print the calendar width characters wide. This affects the
length of the lines separating each day, and the point at
which events will be word-wrapped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE FORMAT <br>
Each line beginning with a hash sign, &lsquo;#&rsquo;, is a
comment and will be ignored. Lines beginning with an
ampersand, &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo;, are directives. Currently
there is only one such directive, <br>
&amp;include file, which reads in a seperate file from your
.birthdays file. file should be given with an absolute path,
which should not use the tilde notation to specify your home
<br>
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other line specifies the
name of a person or event, followed by an equals sign and a
date (DD/MM, DD/MM/YY or DD/MM/YYYY, where the form DD/MM/YY
is assumed to give a date in <br>
the 20th century and is now deprecated), and finally some
extra options. These options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bd This line is a birthday (the
default). The year, if given, should be when the person was
born. A line designated as a birthday will produce output
like Erin has a birthday <br>
in 3 days&rsquo; time or Jemima is 3 in 2 weeks&rsquo;
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ann This line is an anniversary.
The year, if given, should be the year in which the thing
happened, producing output like Pen exploded 3 years ago
tomorrow given a line such <br>
as Pen exploded=12/09/93 ann.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ev This line is an event of some
sort. If a year is given, the text will be displayed in that
year only; otherwise, it will be displayed every year. The
remaining time is <br>
simply appended to the text; for instance, the input
Easter=7/4/1996 ev would give rise to the text Easter in 1
week&rsquo;s time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wn Warn n days in advance of the
date, rather than the default of 21 days or the number given
with the -W flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">todate The event lasts until
date, which should be in the same format as for the date of
the event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fordays <br>
The event lasts for days days.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DATE SPECIFICATION <br>
The file format documented here handles dates in a couple of
slightly non-standard ways. Firstly, the dates are given in
British format of DD/MM/YYYY, as opposed to the more <br>
normal US format MM/DD/YYYY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Secondly, dates with a two-digit
year are assumed to be in the 20th century (19xx), rather
than taking the standard convention of assuming all
two-digit years less than 70 are in <br>
the 21st century. This is for reasons of compatibility with
older data files, since many people have birthdays before
1970, and the program was written before I came across the
<br>
Y2K issues. :-( You should probably avoid this format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Joe Blow=25/04/1974</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.birthdays <br>
Your default birthdays file.</p>

cal(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Both the &quot;features&quot; in the DATE SPECIFICATION
section could be construed as bugs, and are mostly present
for backwards compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The calendar mode should be a
seperate program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program cannot warn more
than one year in advance of anything.</p>
