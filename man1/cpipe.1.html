<p>cpipe(1) Programmer&rsquo;s Manual cpipe(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cpipe - copy stdin to stdout while counting bytes and
reporting progress</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cpipe [-b bsize] [-vt] [-vr] [-vw] [-ngr] [-s speed]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b buffer size in kB, <br>
1 Int value between 1 and oo. <br>
Default: &lsquo;128&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vt show throughput.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vr show read-times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vw show write-times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ngr non-greedy read.
Don&rsquo;t enforce a full buffer on read before starting to
write.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s throughput speed limit in
kB/s, <br>
1 Double value between 1 and oo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Cpipe copies its standard input to its standard output while
measuring the time it takes to read an input buffer and
write an output buffer. If one or more of the -vx options is
<br>
given, statistics of average throughput and the total amount
of bytes copied are printed to the standard error
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non Greedy Read <br>
Normally, cpipe does its best to totally fill its buffer
(option -b) before it starts writing. In some situations
however, e.g. if you talk to an interactive program via
cpipe, <br>
this deadlocks the communication: said program waits for
input which it will never see, because the input is stuck in
cpipe&rsquo;s buffer. But cpipe itself will not see more
input <br>
before the program does not respond.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To get around this, try using
-ngr. When issuing a read call, cpipe is then satisfied as
soon as it gets at least one byte. Instead of filling the
buffer, it stops reading and <br>
writes whatever it got to the output. Note, however, that
the throughput measurements will be less exact if the number
of bytes transferred in one read/write pair becomes small,
<br>
because cpipe will spent relatively more time working on
every byte.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Limiting Throughput <br>
If a throughput limit is specified with option -s, cpipe
calls usleep(3) in between copying buffers, thereby
artificially extending the duration of a read/write-cycle.
Since on <br>
most systems there is a certain minimum time usleep()
sleeps, e.g. 0.01s, it is impossible to reach high limits
with a small buffer size. In this case increasing the buffer
size <br>
(option -b) might help. However, keep in mind that this
limits the throughput only on the average. Every single
buffer is copied as fast as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
The command <br>
tar cCf / - usr | cpipe -vr -vw -vt &gt; /dev/null <br>
results in an output like <br>
... <br>
in: 19.541ms at 6.4MB/s ( 4.7MB/s avg) 2.0MB <br>
out: 0.004ms at 30.5GB/s ( 27.1GB/s avg) 2.0MB <br>
thru: 19.865ms at 6.3MB/s ( 4.6MB/s avg) 2.0MB <br>
... <br>
The first column shows the times it takes to handle one
buffer of data (128kB by default). The read-call took
19.541ms, the write-call to /dev/null took just 0.004ms and
from <br>
the start of the read to the end of write, it took
19.865ms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second column shows the
result of dividing the buffer size (128kB by default) by the
times in the first column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third column contains the
average over all measured values from the start of the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, the last column shows
the total number of bytes transferred, which is of course
the same for reading and writing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
This program uses precious processor cycles. Consequently
the measured times will be different from the transfer rates
possible without it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of just non-greedy
reading, full non-blocking I/O and use of select(2) should
be used to make sure that no deadlocks occur when
communicating with interactive programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CREDITS <br>
Peter Astrand &lt;astrand@lysator.liu.se&gt; recommended the
speed limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ivo De Decker
&lt;ivo@zeus.rug.ac.be&gt; asked for deadlock prevention,
which is (hopefully) sufficiently covered by the non-greedy
read.</p>
