<p>arch-test(1) General Commands Manual arch-test(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
arch-test - detect architectures your kernel can run
binaries of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
arch-test [-n] <br>
enumerates the architectures</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arch-test [-n] &lt;arch&gt; <br>
tests a single arch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
When called without an argument, arch-test outputs the list
of architectures executable by your running kernel, one per
line, using Debian arch names. Libc or other libraries <br>
are neither needed nor checked &acirc; an arch is listed if
its machine code can be executed and the appropriate syscall
ABI is supported by the kernel. This means, you can run
these <br>
architectures in a chroot or a container, execute them using
multiarch, run static binaries, etc. The ability to run
additional architectures can be gained via binfmts on Linux,
<br>
Linux emulation on BSD, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An architecture is considered
runnable only if your kernel can run unmodified binaries,
without extra steps such as recompiling (Raspbian armhf) or
using brandelf on binaries <br>
you&rsquo;d want to run (FreeBSD emulation of Linux). Also,
as Debian requires 686 on i386 as of the stretch release,
686 support is checked for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -n is specified, arch-test
will try to disable known emulators (currently qemu and
wine). Note that a whole-machine emulator appears to be
native as far as the kernel is con&acirc; <br>
cerned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When called with an arch name as
an argument, arch-test tests the specified architecture. A
human-friendly message will be printed, and the exit code
can be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 congratulations, the arch can
be run on your kernel</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 failure</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 cannot check &acirc; arch-test
lacks a helper for this arch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Shell hint: with set -e you
write: ret=0; arch-test $ARCH || ret=$?)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Helper programs <br>
The detection is done by small programs located in
/usr/lib/arch-test/. These programs check whether the
running kernel can execute binaries of a given architecture.
When run, <br>
if successful, each such program prints &quot;ok&quot; on
stdout and returns exit code 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the check fails, these
helper programs may die horribly &acirc; always with a
non-zero exit code. Usually the kernel will notice the
incompatibility and nicely abort the attempt, <br>
but in some near-miss cases the failure is more messy, such
as SIGILL or SIGSEGV. If you want to run the helpers
directly, you&rsquo;d want to redirect stderr to /dev/null
and to dis&acirc; <br>
able core dumps (ulimit -c 0).</p>
