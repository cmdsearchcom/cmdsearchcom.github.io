perlmod - Perl modules (packages and symbol tables)

Perl provides a mechanism for alternative namespaces to protect packages from
  stomping on each other's variables. In fact, there's really no such thing as a
  global variable in Perl. The package statement declares the compilation unit
  as being in the given namespace. The scope of the package declaration is from
  the declaration itself through the end of the enclosing block,
  &quot;eval&quot;, or file, whichever comes first (the same scope as the
  <i>my()</i> and <i>local()</i> operators). Unqualified dynamic identifiers
  will be in this namespace, except for those few identifiers that if
  unqualified, default to the main package instead of the current one as
  described below. A package statement affects only dynamic variables--including
  those you've used <i>local()</i> on--but <i>not</i> lexical variables created
  with <i>my()</i>. Typically it would be the first declaration in a file
  included by the &quot;do&quot;, &quot;require&quot;, or &quot;use&quot;
  operators. You can switch into a package in more than one place; it merely
  influences which symbol table is used by the compiler for the rest of that
  block. You can refer to variables and filehandles in other packages by
  prefixing the identifier with the package name and a double colon:
  $Package::Variable. If the package name is null, the &quot;main&quot; package
  is assumed. That is, $::sail is equivalent to $main::sail.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The old package delimiter was a single quote, but double colon is now the
  preferred delimiter, in part because it's more readable to humans, and in part
  because it's more readable to <b>emacs</b> macros. It also makes C++
  programmers feel like they know what's going on--as opposed to using the
  single quote as separator, which was there to make Ada programmers feel like
  they knew what was going on. Because the old-fashioned syntax is still
  supported for backwards compatibility, if you try to use a string like
  &quot;This is $owner's house&quot;, you'll be accessing $owner::s; that is,
  the $s variable in package &quot;owner&quot;, which is probably not what you
  meant. Use braces to disambiguate, as in &quot;This is ${owner}'s house&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Packages may themselves contain package separators, as in $OUTER::INNER::var.
  This implies nothing about the order of name lookups, however. There are no
  relative packages: all symbols are either local to the current package, or
  must be fully qualified from the outer package name down. For instance, there
  is nowhere within package &quot;OUTER&quot; that $INNER::var refers to
  $OUTER::INNER::var. &quot;INNER&quot; refers to a totally separate global
  package.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Only identifiers starting with letters (or underscore) are stored in a package's
  symbol table. All other symbols are kept in package &quot;main&quot;,
  including all punctuation variables, like $_. In addition, when unqualified,
  the identifiers STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR, ARGV, ARGVOUT, ENV, INC, and SIG are
  forced to be in package &quot;main&quot;, even when used for other purposes
  than their built-in ones. If you have a package called &quot;m&quot;,
  &quot;s&quot;, or &quot;y&quot;, then you can't use the qualified form of an
  identifier because it would be instead interpreted as a pattern match, a
  substitution, or a transliteration.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Variables beginning with underscore used to be forced into package main, but we
  decided it was more useful for package writers to be able to use leading
  underscore to indicate private variables and method names. However, variables
  and functions named with a single &quot;_&quot;, such as $_ and &quot;sub
  _&quot;, are still forced into the package &quot;main&quot;. See also
  &quot;The Syntax of Variable Names&quot; in perlvar.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;eval&quot;ed strings are compiled in the package in which the
  <i>eval()</i> was compiled. (Assignments to $SIG{}, however, assume the signal
  handler specified is in the &quot;main&quot; package. Qualify the signal
  handler name if you wish to have a signal handler in a package.) For an
  example, examine <i>perldb.pl</i> in the Perl library. It initially switches
  to the &quot;DB&quot; package so that the debugger doesn't interfere with
  variables in the program you are trying to debug. At various points, however,
  it temporarily switches back to the &quot;main&quot; package to evaluate
  various expressions in the context of the &quot;main&quot; package (or
  wherever you came from). See perldebug.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The special symbol &quot;__PACKAGE__&quot; contains the current package, but
  cannot (easily) be used to construct variable names.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See perlsub for other scoping issues related to <i>my()</i> and <i>local()</i>,
  and perlref regarding closures.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Symbol_Tables"><a class="selflink" href="#Symbol_Tables">Symbol
  Tables</a></h2>
The symbol table for a package happens to be stored in the hash of that name
  with two colons appended. The main symbol table's name is thus %main::, or %::
  for short. Likewise the symbol table for the nested package mentioned earlier
  is named %OUTER::INNER::.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The value in each entry of the hash is what you are referring to when you use
  the *name typeglob notation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    local *main::foo    = *main::bar;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can use this to print out all the variables in a package, for instance. The
  standard but antiquated <i>dumpvar.pl</i> library and the CPAN module
  Devel::Symdump make use of this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The results of creating new symbol table entries directly or modifying any
  entries that are not already typeglobs are undefined and subject to change
  between releases of perl.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Assignment to a typeglob performs an aliasing operation, i.e.,
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    *dick = *richard;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
causes variables, subroutines, formats, and file and directory handles
  accessible via the identifier &quot;richard&quot; also to be accessible via
  the identifier &quot;dick&quot;. If you want to alias only a particular
  variable or subroutine, assign a reference instead:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    *dick = \$richard;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Which makes $richard and $dick the same variable, but leaves @richard and @dick
  as separate arrays. Tricky, eh?
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is one subtle difference between the following statements:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    *foo = *bar;
    *foo = \$bar;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;*foo = *bar&quot; makes the typeglobs themselves synonymous while
  &quot;*foo = \$bar&quot; makes the SCALAR portions of two distinct typeglobs
  refer to the same scalar value. This means that the following code:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $bar = 1;
    *foo = \$bar;       # Make $foo an alias for $bar
    {
        local $bar = 2; # Restrict changes to block
        print $foo;     # Prints '1'!
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Would print '1', because $foo holds a reference to the <i>original</i> $bar. The
  one that was stuffed away by &quot;local()&quot; and which will be restored
  when the block ends. Because variables are accessed through the typeglob, you
  can use &quot;*foo = *bar&quot; to create an alias which can be localized.
  (But be aware that this means you can't have a separate @foo and @bar, etc.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
What makes all of this important is that the Exporter module uses glob aliasing
  as the import/export mechanism. Whether or not you can properly localize a
  variable that has been exported from a module depends on how it was exported:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    @EXPORT = qw($FOO); # Usual form, can't be localized
    @EXPORT = qw(*FOO); # Can be localized
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can work around the first case by using the fully qualified name
  ($Package::FOO) where you need a local value, or by overriding it by saying
  &quot;*FOO = *Package::FOO&quot; in your script.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;*x = \$y&quot; mechanism may be used to pass and return cheap
  references into or from subroutines if you don't want to copy the whole thing.
  It only works when assigning to dynamic variables, not lexicals.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    %some_hash = ();                    # can't be my()
    *some_hash = fn( \%another_hash );
    sub fn {
        local *hashsym = shift;
        # now use %hashsym normally, and you
        # will affect the caller's %another_hash
        my %nhash = (); # do what you want
        return \%nhash;
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
On return, the reference will overwrite the hash slot in the symbol table
  specified by the *some_hash typeglob. This is a somewhat tricky way of passing
  around references cheaply when you don't want to have to remember to
  dereference variables explicitly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another use of symbol tables is for making &quot;constant&quot; scalars.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    *PI = \3.14159265358979;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now you cannot alter $PI, which is probably a good thing all in all. This isn't
  the same as a constant subroutine, which is subject to optimization at
  compile-time. A constant subroutine is one prototyped to take no arguments and
  to return a constant expression. See perlsub for details on these. The
  &quot;use constant&quot; pragma is a convenient shorthand for these.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can say *foo{PACKAGE} and *foo{NAME} to find out what name and package the
  *foo symbol table entry comes from. This may be useful in a subroutine that
  gets passed typeglobs as arguments:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    sub identify_typeglob {
        my $glob = shift;
        print 'You gave me ', *{$glob}{PACKAGE}, '::', *{$glob}{NAME}, &quot;\n&quot;;
    }
    identify_typeglob *foo;
    identify_typeglob *bar::baz;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This prints
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    You gave me main::foo
    You gave me bar::baz
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The *foo{THING} notation can also be used to obtain references to the individual
  elements of *foo. See perlref.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Subroutine definitions (and declarations, for that matter) need not necessarily
  be situated in the package whose symbol table they occupy. You can define a
  subroutine outside its package by explicitly qualifying the name of the
  subroutine:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    package main;
    sub Some_package::foo { ... }   # &amp;foo defined in Some_package
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is just a shorthand for a typeglob assignment at compile time:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    BEGIN { *Some_package::foo = sub { ... } }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and is <i>not</i> the same as writing:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    {
        package Some_package;
        sub foo { ... }
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the first two versions, the body of the subroutine is lexically in the main
  package, <i>not</i> in Some_package. So something like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    package main;
    $Some_package::name = &quot;fred&quot;;
    $main::name = &quot;barney&quot;;
    sub Some_package::foo {
        print &quot;in &quot;, __PACKAGE__, &quot;: \$name is '$name'\n&quot;;
    }
    Some_package::foo();
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
prints:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    in main: $name is 'barney'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
rather than:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    in Some_package: $name is 'fred'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This also has implications for the use of the SUPER:: qualifier (see perlobj).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="BEGIN,_UNITCHECK,_CHECK,_INIT_and_END"><a class="selflink" href="#BEGIN,_UNITCHECK,_CHECK,_INIT_and_END">BEGIN,
  UNITCHECK, CHECK, INIT and END</a></h2>
Five specially named code blocks are executed at the beginning and at the end of
  a running Perl program. These are the &quot;BEGIN&quot;,
  &quot;UNITCHECK&quot;, &quot;CHECK&quot;, &quot;INIT&quot;, and
  &quot;END&quot; blocks.
<div class="Pp"></div>
These code blocks can be prefixed with &quot;sub&quot; to give the appearance of
  a subroutine (although this is not considered good style). One should note
  that these code blocks don't really exist as named subroutines (despite their
  appearance). The thing that gives this away is the fact that you can have
  <b>more than one</b> of these code blocks in a program, and they will get
  <b>all</b> executed at the appropriate moment. So you can't execute any of
  these code blocks by name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A &quot;BEGIN&quot; code block is executed as soon as possible, that is, the
  moment it is completely defined, even before the rest of the containing file
  (or string) is parsed. You may have multiple &quot;BEGIN&quot; blocks within a
  file (or eval'ed string); they will execute in order of definition. Because a
  &quot;BEGIN&quot; code block executes immediately, it can pull in definitions
  of subroutines and such from other files in time to be visible to the rest of
  the compile and run time. Once a &quot;BEGIN&quot; has run, it is immediately
  undefined and any code it used is returned to Perl's memory pool.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An &quot;END&quot; code block is executed as late as possible, that is, after
  perl has finished running the program and just before the interpreter is being
  exited, even if it is exiting as a result of a <i>die()</i> function. (But not
  if it's morphing into another program via &quot;exec&quot;, or being blown out
  of the water by a signal--you have to trap that yourself (if you can).) You
  may have multiple &quot;END&quot; blocks within a file--they will execute in
  reverse order of definition; that is: last in, first out (LIFO).
  &quot;END&quot; blocks are not executed when you run perl with the
  &quot;-c&quot; switch, or if compilation fails.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that &quot;END&quot; code blocks are <b>not</b> executed at the end of a
  string &quot;eval()&quot;: if any &quot;END&quot; code blocks are created in a
  string &quot;eval()&quot;, they will be executed just as any other
  &quot;END&quot; code block of that package in LIFO order just before the
  interpreter is being exited.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Inside an &quot;END&quot; code block, $? contains the value that the program is
  going to pass to &quot;exit()&quot;. You can modify $? to change the exit
  value of the program. Beware of changing $? by accident (e.g. by running
  something via &quot;system&quot;).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Inside of a &quot;END&quot; block, the value of &quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot;
  will be &quot;END&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;UNITCHECK&quot;, &quot;CHECK&quot; and &quot;INIT&quot; code blocks are
  useful to catch the transition between the compilation phase and the execution
  phase of the main program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;UNITCHECK&quot; blocks are run just after the unit which defined them has
  been compiled. The main program file and each module it loads are compilation
  units, as are string &quot;eval&quot;s, code compiled using the &quot;(?{
  })&quot; construct in a regex, calls to &quot;do FILE&quot;, &quot;require
  FILE&quot;, and code after the &quot;-e&quot; switch on the command line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;BEGIN&quot; and &quot;UNITCHECK&quot; blocks are not directly related to
  the phase of the interpreter. They can be created and executed during any
  phase.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;CHECK&quot; code blocks are run just after the <b>initial</b> Perl compile
  phase ends and before the run time begins, in LIFO order. &quot;CHECK&quot;
  code blocks are used in the Perl compiler suite to save the compiled state of
  the program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Inside of a &quot;CHECK&quot; block, the value of &quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot;
  will be &quot;CHECK&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;INIT&quot; blocks are run just before the Perl runtime begins execution,
  in &quot;first in, first out&quot; (FIFO) order.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Inside of an &quot;INIT&quot; block, the value of &quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot;
  will be &quot;INIT&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;CHECK&quot; and &quot;INIT&quot; blocks in code compiled by
  &quot;require&quot;, string &quot;do&quot;, or string &quot;eval&quot; will
  not be executed if they occur after the end of the main compilation phase;
  that can be a problem in mod_perl and other persistent environments which use
  those functions to load code at runtime.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you use the <b>-n</b> and <b>-p</b> switches to Perl, &quot;BEGIN&quot; and
  &quot;END&quot; work just as they do in <b>awk</b>, as a degenerate case. Both
  &quot;BEGIN&quot; and &quot;CHECK&quot; blocks are run when you use the
  <b>-c</b> switch for a compile-only syntax check, although your main code is
  not.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>begincheck</b> program makes it all clear, eventually:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  #!/usr/bin/perl
  # begincheck
  print         &quot;10. Ordinary code runs at runtime.\n&quot;;
  END { print   &quot;16.   So this is the end of the tale.\n&quot; }
  INIT { print  &quot; 7. INIT blocks run FIFO just before runtime.\n&quot; }
  UNITCHECK {
    print       &quot; 4.   And therefore before any CHECK blocks.\n&quot;
  }
  CHECK { print &quot; 6.   So this is the sixth line.\n&quot; }
  print         &quot;11.   It runs in order, of course.\n&quot;;
  BEGIN { print &quot; 1. BEGIN blocks run FIFO during compilation.\n&quot; }
  END { print   &quot;15.   Read perlmod for the rest of the story.\n&quot; }
  CHECK { print &quot; 5. CHECK blocks run LIFO after all compilation.\n&quot; }
  INIT { print  &quot; 8.   Run this again, using Perl's -c switch.\n&quot; }
  print         &quot;12.   This is anti-obfuscated code.\n&quot;;
  END { print   &quot;14. END blocks run LIFO at quitting time.\n&quot; }
  BEGIN { print &quot; 2.   So this line comes out second.\n&quot; }
  UNITCHECK {
   print &quot; 3. UNITCHECK blocks run LIFO after each file is compiled.\n&quot;
  }
  INIT { print  &quot; 9.   You'll see the difference right away.\n&quot; }
  print         &quot;13.   It merely _looks_ like it should be confusing.\n&quot;;
  __END__
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Perl_Classes"><a class="selflink" href="#Perl_Classes">Perl
  Classes</a></h2>
There is no special class syntax in Perl, but a package may act as a class if it
  provides subroutines to act as methods. Such a package may also derive some of
  its methods from another class (package) by listing the other package name(s)
  in its global @ISA array (which must be a package global, not a lexical).
<div class="Pp"></div>
For more on this, see perlootut and perlobj.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Perl_Modules"><a class="selflink" href="#Perl_Modules">Perl
  Modules</a></h2>
A module is just a set of related functions in a library file, i.e., a Perl
  package with the same name as the file. It is specifically designed to be
  reusable by other modules or programs. It may do this by providing a mechanism
  for exporting some of its symbols into the symbol table of any package using
  it, or it may function as a class definition and make its semantics available
  implicitly through method calls on the class and its objects, without
  explicitly exporting anything. Or it can do a little of both.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, to start a traditional, non-OO module called Some::Module, create a
  file called <i>Some/Module.pm</i> and start with this template:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    package Some::Module;  # assumes Some/Module.pm
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    BEGIN {
        require Exporter;
        # set the version for version checking
        our $VERSION     = 1.00;
        # Inherit from Exporter to export functions and variables
        our @ISA         = qw(Exporter);
        # Functions and variables which are exported by default
        our @EXPORT      = qw(func1 func2);
        # Functions and variables which can be optionally exported
        our @EXPORT_OK   = qw($Var1 %Hashit func3);
    }
    # exported package globals go here
    our $Var1    = '';
    our %Hashit  = ();
    # non-exported package globals go here
    # (they are still accessible as $Some::Module::stuff)
    our @more    = ();
    our $stuff   = '';
    # file-private lexicals go here, before any functions which use them
    my $priv_var    = '';
    my %secret_hash = ();
    # here's a file-private function as a closure,
    # callable as $priv_func-&gt;();
    my $priv_func = sub {
        ...
    };
    # make all your functions, whether exported or not;
    # remember to put something interesting in the {} stubs
    sub func1      { ... }
    sub func2      { ... }
    # this one isn't exported, but could be called directly
    # as Some::Module::func3()
    sub func3      { ... }
    END { ... }       # module clean-up code here (global destructor)
    1;  # don't forget to return a true value from the file
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then go on to declare and use your variables in functions without any
  qualifications. See Exporter and the perlmodlib for details on mechanics and
  style issues in module creation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl modules are included into your program by saying
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use Module;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use Module LIST;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is exactly equivalent to
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    BEGIN { require 'Module.pm'; 'Module'-&gt;import; }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    BEGIN { require 'Module.pm'; 'Module'-&gt;import( LIST ); }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a special case
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use Module ();
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
is exactly equivalent to
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    BEGIN { require 'Module.pm'; }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
All Perl module files have the extension <i>.pm</i>. The &quot;use&quot;
  operator assumes this so you don't have to spell out &quot;
  <i>Module.pm</i>&quot; in quotes. This also helps to differentiate new modules
  from old <i>.pl</i> and <i>.ph</i> files. Module names are also capitalized
  unless they're functioning as pragmas; pragmas are in effect compiler
  directives, and are sometimes called &quot;pragmatic modules&quot; (or even
  &quot;pragmata&quot; if you're a classicist).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The two statements:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    require SomeModule;
    require &quot;SomeModule.pm&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
differ from each other in two ways. In the first case, any double colons in the
  module name, such as &quot;Some::Module&quot;, are translated into your
  system's directory separator, usually &quot;/&quot;. The second case does not,
  and would have to be specified literally. The other difference is that seeing
  the first &quot;require&quot; clues in the compiler that uses of indirect
  object notation involving &quot;SomeModule&quot;, as in &quot;$ob = purge
  SomeModule&quot;, are method calls, not function calls. (Yes, this really can
  make a difference.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Because the &quot;use&quot; statement implies a &quot;BEGIN&quot; block, the
  importing of semantics happens as soon as the &quot;use&quot; statement is
  compiled, before the rest of the file is compiled. This is how it is able to
  function as a pragma mechanism, and also how modules are able to declare
  subroutines that are then visible as list or unary operators for the rest of
  the current file. This will not work if you use &quot;require&quot; instead of
  &quot;use&quot;. With &quot;require&quot; you can get into this problem:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    require Cwd;                # make Cwd:: accessible

In general, &quot;use Module ()&quot; is recommended over &quot;require
  Module&quot;, because it determines module availability at compile time, not
  in the middle of your program's execution. An exception would be if two
  modules each tried to &quot;use&quot; each other, and each also called a
  function from that other module. In that case, it's easy to use
  &quot;require&quot; instead.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl packages may be nested inside other package names, so we can have package
  names containing &quot;::&quot;. But if we used that package name directly as
  a filename it would make for unwieldy or impossible filenames on some systems.
  Therefore, if a module's name is, say, &quot;Text::Soundex&quot;, then its
  definition is actually found in the library file <i>Text/Soundex.pm</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl modules always have a <i>.pm</i> file, but there may also be dynamically
  linked executables (often ending in <i>.so</i>) or autoloaded subroutine
  definitions (often ending in <i>.al</i>) associated with the module. If so,
  these will be entirely transparent to the user of the module. It is the
  responsibility of the <i>.pm</i> file to load (or arrange to autoload) any
  additional functionality. For example, although the POSIX module happens to do
  both dynamic loading and autoloading, the user can say just &quot;use
  POSIX&quot; to get it all.

Since 5.6.0, Perl has had support for a new type of threads called interpreter
  threads (ithreads). These threads can be used explicitly and implicitly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Ithreads work by cloning the data tree so that no data is shared between
  different threads. These threads can be used by using the &quot;threads&quot;
  module or by doing <i>fork()</i> on win32 (fake <i>fork()</i> support). When a
  thread is cloned all Perl data is cloned, however non-Perl data cannot be
  cloned automatically. Perl after 5.7.2 has support for the &quot;CLONE&quot;
  special subroutine. In &quot;CLONE&quot; you can do whatever you need to do,
  like for example handle the cloning of non-Perl data, if necessary.
  &quot;CLONE&quot; will be called once as a class method for every package that
  has it defined (or inherits it). It will be called in the context of the new
  thread, so all modifications are made in the new area. Currently CLONE is
  called with no parameters other than the invocant package name, but code
  should not assume that this will remain unchanged, as it is likely that in
  future extra parameters will be passed in to give more information about the
  state of cloning.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to CLONE all objects you will need to keep track of them per
  package. This is simply done using a hash and <i>Scalar::Util::weaken()</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl after 5.8.7 has support for the &quot;CLONE_SKIP&quot; special subroutine.
  Like &quot;CLONE&quot;, &quot;CLONE_SKIP&quot; is called once per package;
  however, it is called just before cloning starts, and in the context of the
  parent thread. If it returns a true value, then no objects of that class will
  be cloned; or rather, they will be copied as unblessed, undef values. For
  example: if in the parent there are two references to a single blessed hash,
  then in the child there will be two references to a single undefined scalar
  value instead. This provides a simple mechanism for making a module
  threadsafe; just add &quot;sub CLONE_SKIP { 1 }&quot; at the top of the class,
  and &quot;DESTROY()&quot; will now only be called once per object. Of course,
  if the child thread needs to make use of the objects, then a more
  sophisticated approach is needed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Like &quot;CLONE&quot;, &quot;CLONE_SKIP&quot; is currently called with no
  parameters other than the invocant package name, although that may change.
  Similarly, to allow for future expansion, the return value should be a single
  0 or 1 value.
