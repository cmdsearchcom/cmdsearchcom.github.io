<p>PERLMOD(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLMOD(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlmod - Perl modules (packages and symbol tables)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Packages <br>
Perl provides a mechanism for alternative namespaces to
protect packages from stomping on each other&rsquo;s
variables. In fact, there&rsquo;s really no such thing as a
global variable in <br>
Perl. The package statement declares the compilation unit as
being in the given namespace. The scope of the package
declaration is from the declaration itself through the end
<br>
of the enclosing block, &quot;eval&quot;, or file, whichever
comes first (the same scope as the my() and local()
operators). Unqualified dynamic identifiers will be in this
namespace, <br>
except for those few identifiers that if unqualified,
default to the main package instead of the current one as
described below. A package statement affects only dynamic
<br>
variables--including those you&rsquo;ve used local() on--but
not lexical variables created with my(). Typically it would
be the first declaration in a file included by the
&quot;do&quot;, <br>
&quot;require&quot;, or &quot;use&quot; operators. You can
switch into a package in more than one place; it merely
influences which symbol table is used by the compiler for
the rest of that block. <br>
You can refer to variables and filehandles in other packages
by prefixing the identifier with the package name and a
double colon: $Package::Variable. If the package name is
<br>
null, the &quot;main&quot; package is assumed. That is,
$::sail is equivalent to $main::sail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The old package delimiter was a
single quote, but double colon is now the preferred
delimiter, in part because it&rsquo;s more readable to
humans, and in part because it&rsquo;s more <br>
readable to emacs macros. It also makes C++ programmers feel
like they know what&rsquo;s going on--as opposed to using
the single quote as separator, which was there to make Ada
<br>
programmers feel like they knew what was going on. Because
the old-fashioned syntax is still supported for backwards
compatibility, if you try to use a string like &quot;This is
<br>
$owner&rsquo;s house&quot;, you&rsquo;ll be accessing
$owner::s; that is, the $s variable in package
&quot;owner&quot;, which is probably not what you meant. Use
braces to disambiguate, as in &quot;This is <br>
${owner}&rsquo;s house&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Packages may themselves contain
package separators, as in $OUTER::INNER::var. This implies
nothing about the order of name lookups, however. There are
no relative packages: all <br>
symbols are either local to the current package, or must be
fully qualified from the outer package name down. For
instance, there is nowhere within package &quot;OUTER&quot;
that <br>
$INNER::var refers to $OUTER::INNER::var. &quot;INNER&quot;
refers to a totally separate global package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only identifiers starting with
letters (or underscore) are stored in a package&rsquo;s
symbol table. All other symbols are kept in package
&quot;main&quot;, including all punctuation variables, <br>
like $_. In addition, when unqualified, the identifiers
STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR, ARGV, ARGVOUT, ENV, INC, and SIG are
forced to be in package &quot;main&quot;, even when used for
other <br>
purposes than their built-in ones. If you have a package
called &quot;m&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, or &quot;y&quot;, then
you can&rsquo;t use the qualified form of an identifier
because it would be instead interpreted <br>
as a pattern match, a substitution, or a
transliteration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variables beginning with
underscore used to be forced into package main, but we
decided it was more useful for package writers to be able to
use leading underscore to indicate <br>
private variables and method names. However, variables and
functions named with a single &quot;_&quot;, such as $_ and
&quot;sub _&quot;, are still forced into the package
&quot;main&quot;. See also &quot;The <br>
Syntax of Variable Names&quot; in perlvar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;eval&quot;ed strings are
compiled in the package in which the eval() was compiled.
(Assignments to $SIG{}, however, assume the signal handler
specified is in the &quot;main&quot; package. <br>
Qualify the signal handler name if you wish to have a signal
handler in a package.) For an example, examine perldb.pl in
the Perl library. It initially switches to the
&quot;DB&quot; <br>
package so that the debugger doesn&rsquo;t interfere with
variables in the program you are trying to debug. At various
points, however, it temporarily switches back to the
&quot;main&quot; <br>
package to evaluate various expressions in the context of
the &quot;main&quot; package (or wherever you came from).
See perldebug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special symbol
&quot;__PACKAGE__&quot; contains the current package, but
cannot (easily) be used to construct variable names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See perlsub for other scoping
issues related to my() and local(), and perlref regarding
closures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Symbol Tables <br>
The symbol table for a package happens to be stored in the
hash of that name with two colons appended. The main symbol
table&rsquo;s name is thus %main::, or %:: for short.
Likewise <br>
the symbol table for the nested package mentioned earlier is
named %OUTER::INNER::.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value in each entry of the
hash is what you are referring to when you use the *name
typeglob notation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local *main::foo =
*main::bar;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use this to print out
all the variables in a package, for instance. The standard
but antiquated dumpvar.pl library and the CPAN module
Devel::Symdump make use of this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The results of creating new
symbol table entries directly or modifying any entries that
are not already typeglobs are undefined and subject to
change between releases of perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assignment to a typeglob
performs an aliasing operation, i.e.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*dick = *richard;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">causes variables, subroutines,
formats, and file and directory handles accessible via the
identifier &quot;richard&quot; also to be accessible via the
identifier &quot;dick&quot;. If you want to <br>
alias only a particular variable or subroutine, assign a
reference instead:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*dick = ichard;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Which makes $richard and $dick
the same variable, but leaves @richard and @dick as separate
arrays. Tricky, eh?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is one subtle difference
between the following statements:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*foo = *bar; <br>
*foo = ar;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;*foo = *bar&quot; makes
the typeglobs themselves synonymous while &quot;*foo =
ar&quot; makes the SCALAR portions of two distinct typeglobs
refer to the same scalar value. This means that <br>
the following code:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$bar = 1; <br>
*foo = ar; # Make $foo an alias for $bar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ <br>
local $bar = 2; # Restrict changes to block <br>
print $foo; # Prints &rsquo;1&rsquo;! <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Would print &rsquo;1&rsquo;,
because $foo holds a reference to the original $bar. The one
that was stuffed away by &quot;local()&quot; and which will
be restored when the block ends. Because variables <br>
are accessed through the typeglob, you can use &quot;*foo =
*bar&quot; to create an alias which can be localized. (But
be aware that this means you can&rsquo;t have a separate
@foo and @bar, <br>
etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What makes all of this important
is that the Exporter module uses glob aliasing as the
import/export mechanism. Whether or not you can properly
localize a variable that has been <br>
exported from a module depends on how it was exported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@EXPORT = qw($FOO); # Usual
form, can&rsquo;t be localized <br>
@EXPORT = qw(*FOO); # Can be localized</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can work around the first
case by using the fully qualified name ($Package::FOO) where
you need a local value, or by overriding it by saying
&quot;*FOO = *Package::FOO&quot; in your <br>
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;*x = &quot; mechanism
may be used to pass and return cheap references into or from
subroutines if you don&rsquo;t want to copy the whole thing.
It only works when assigning to <br>
dynamic variables, not lexicals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%some_hash = (); # can&rsquo;t
be my() <br>
*some_hash = fn( another_hash ); <br>
sub fn { <br>
local *hashsym = shift; <br>
# now use %hashsym normally, and you <br>
# will affect the caller&rsquo;s %another_hash <br>
my %nhash = (); # do what you want <br>
return nhash; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On return, the reference will
overwrite the hash slot in the symbol table specified by the
*some_hash typeglob. This is a somewhat tricky way of
passing around references <br>
cheaply when you don&rsquo;t want to have to remember to
dereference variables explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another use of symbol tables is
for making &quot;constant&quot; scalars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*PI = 3.14159265358979;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now you cannot alter $PI, which
is probably a good thing all in all. This isn&rsquo;t the
same as a constant subroutine, which is subject to
optimization at compile-time. A constant <br>
subroutine is one prototyped to take no arguments and to
return a constant expression. See perlsub for details on
these. The &quot;use constant&quot; pragma is a convenient
shorthand for <br>
these.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can say *foo{PACKAGE} and
*foo{NAME} to find out what name and package the *foo symbol
table entry comes from. This may be useful in a subroutine
that gets passed typeglobs <br>
as arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub identify_typeglob { <br>
my $glob = shift; <br>
print &rsquo;You gave me &rsquo;, *{$glob}{PACKAGE},
&rsquo;::&rsquo;, *{$glob}{NAME}, &quot;0; <br>
} <br>
identify_typeglob *foo; <br>
identify_typeglob *bar::baz;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This prints</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You gave me main::foo <br>
You gave me bar::baz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The *foo{THING} notation can
also be used to obtain references to the individual elements
of *foo. See perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subroutine definitions (and
declarations, for that matter) need not necessarily be
situated in the package whose symbol table they occupy. You
can define a subroutine outside <br>
its package by explicitly qualifying the name of the
subroutine:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package main; <br>
sub Some_package::foo { ... } # &amp;foo defined in
Some_package</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is just a shorthand for a
typeglob assignment at compile time:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEGIN { *Some_package::foo = sub
{ ... } }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and is not the same as
writing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ <br>
package Some_package; <br>
sub foo { ... } <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the first two versions, the
body of the subroutine is lexically in the main package, not
in Some_package. So something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package main;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$Some_package::name =
&quot;fred&quot;; <br>
$main::name = &quot;barney&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub Some_package::foo { <br>
print &quot;in &quot;, __PACKAGE__, &quot;: ame is
&rsquo;$name&rsquo;0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some_package::foo();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prints:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in main: $name is
&rsquo;barney&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rather than:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in Some_package: $name is
&rsquo;fred&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This also has implications for
the use of the SUPER:: qualifier (see perlobj).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEGIN, UNITCHECK, CHECK, INIT
and END <br>
Five specially named code blocks are executed at the
beginning and at the end of a running Perl program. These
are the &quot;BEGIN&quot;, &quot;UNITCHECK&quot;,
&quot;CHECK&quot;, &quot;INIT&quot;, and &quot;END&quot;
blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These code blocks can be
prefixed with &quot;sub&quot; to give the appearance of a
subroutine (although this is not considered good style). One
should note that these code blocks don&rsquo;t <br>
really exist as named subroutines (despite their
appearance). The thing that gives this away is the fact that
you can have more than one of these code blocks in a
program, and <br>
they will get all executed at the appropriate moment. So you
can&rsquo;t execute any of these code blocks by name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;BEGIN&quot; code block
is executed as soon as possible, that is, the moment it is
completely defined, even before the rest of the containing
file (or string) is parsed. You may <br>
have multiple &quot;BEGIN&quot; blocks within a file (or
eval&rsquo;ed string); they will execute in order of
definition. Because a &quot;BEGIN&quot; code block executes
immediately, it can pull in <br>
definitions of subroutines and such from other files in time
to be visible to the rest of the compile and run time. Once
a &quot;BEGIN&quot; has run, it is immediately undefined and
any <br>
code it used is returned to Perl&rsquo;s memory pool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An &quot;END&quot; code block is
executed as late as possible, that is, after perl has
finished running the program and just before the interpreter
is being exited, even if it is exiting <br>
as a result of a die() function. (But not if it&rsquo;s
morphing into another program via &quot;exec&quot;, or being
blown out of the water by a signal--you have to trap that
yourself (if you <br>
can).) You may have multiple &quot;END&quot; blocks within a
file--they will execute in reverse order of definition; that
is: last in, first out (LIFO). &quot;END&quot; blocks are
not executed <br>
when you run perl with the &quot;-c&quot; switch, or if
compilation fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that &quot;END&quot; code
blocks are not executed at the end of a string
&quot;eval()&quot;: if any &quot;END&quot; code blocks are
created in a string &quot;eval()&quot;, they will be
executed just as any other <br>
&quot;END&quot; code block of that package in LIFO order
just before the interpreter is being exited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inside an &quot;END&quot; code
block, $? contains the value that the program is going to
pass to &quot;exit()&quot;. You can modify $? to change the
exit value of the program. Beware of changing <br>
$? by accident (e.g. by running something via
&quot;system&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inside of a &quot;END&quot;
block, the value of &quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot; will be
&quot;END&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;UNITCHECK&quot;,
&quot;CHECK&quot; and &quot;INIT&quot; code blocks are
useful to catch the transition between the compilation phase
and the execution phase of the main program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;UNITCHECK&quot; blocks are
run just after the unit which defined them has been
compiled. The main program file and each module it loads are
compilation units, as are string &quot;eval&quot;s, <br>
code compiled using the &quot;(?{ })&quot; construct in a
regex, calls to &quot;do FILE&quot;, &quot;require
FILE&quot;, and code after the &quot;-e&quot; switch on the
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;BEGIN&quot; and
&quot;UNITCHECK&quot; blocks are not directly related to the
phase of the interpreter. They can be created and executed
during any phase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;CHECK&quot; code blocks
are run just after the initial Perl compile phase ends and
before the run time begins, in LIFO order. &quot;CHECK&quot;
code blocks are used in the Perl compiler suite <br>
to save the compiled state of the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inside of a &quot;CHECK&quot;
block, the value of &quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot; will be
&quot;CHECK&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;INIT&quot; blocks are run
just before the Perl runtime begins execution, in
&quot;first in, first out&quot; (FIFO) order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inside of an &quot;INIT&quot;
block, the value of &quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot; will be
&quot;INIT&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;CHECK&quot; and
&quot;INIT&quot; blocks in code compiled by
&quot;require&quot;, string &quot;do&quot;, or string
&quot;eval&quot; will not be executed if they occur after
the end of the main compilation phase; that <br>
can be a problem in mod_perl and other persistent
environments which use those functions to load code at
runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you use the -n and -p
switches to Perl, &quot;BEGIN&quot; and &quot;END&quot; work
just as they do in awk, as a degenerate case. Both
&quot;BEGIN&quot; and &quot;CHECK&quot; blocks are run when
you use the -c <br>
switch for a compile-only syntax check, although your main
code is not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The begincheck program makes it
all clear, eventually:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># begincheck</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;10. Ordinary code
runs at runtime.0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">END { print &quot;16. So this is
the end of the tale.0 } <br>
INIT { print &quot; 7. INIT blocks run FIFO just before
runtime.0 } <br>
UNITCHECK { <br>
print &quot; 4. And therefore before any CHECK blocks.0 <br>
} <br>
CHECK { print &quot; 6. So this is the sixth line.0 }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;11. It runs in
order, of course.0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEGIN { print &quot; 1. BEGIN
blocks run FIFO during compilation.0 } <br>
END { print &quot;15. Read perlmod for the rest of the
story.0 } <br>
CHECK { print &quot; 5. CHECK blocks run LIFO after all
compilation.0 } <br>
INIT { print &quot; 8. Run this again, using Perl&rsquo;s -c
switch.0 }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;12. This is
anti-obfuscated code.0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">END { print &quot;14. END blocks
run LIFO at quitting time.0 } <br>
BEGIN { print &quot; 2. So this line comes out second.0 }
<br>
UNITCHECK { <br>
print &quot; 3. UNITCHECK blocks run LIFO after each file is
compiled.0 <br>
} <br>
INIT { print &quot; 9. You&rsquo;ll see the difference right
away.0 }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;13. It merely
_looks_ like it should be confusing.0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">__END__</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl Classes <br>
There is no special class syntax in Perl, but a package may
act as a class if it provides subroutines to act as methods.
Such a package may also derive some of its methods from <br>
another class (package) by listing the other package name(s)
in its global @ISA array (which must be a package global,
not a lexical).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more on this, see perlootut
and perlobj.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl Modules <br>
A module is just a set of related functions in a library
file, i.e., a Perl package with the same name as the file.
It is specifically designed to be reusable by other modules
<br>
or programs. It may do this by providing a mechanism for
exporting some of its symbols into the symbol table of any
package using it, or it may function as a class definition
<br>
and make its semantics available implicitly through method
calls on the class and its objects, without explicitly
exporting anything. Or it can do a little of both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to start a
traditional, non-OO module called Some::Module, create a
file called Some/Module.pm and start with this template:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package Some::Module; # assumes
Some/Module.pm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use strict; <br>
use warnings;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEGIN { <br>
require Exporter;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># set the version for version
checking <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Functions and variables which

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Functions and variables which

our @more = (); <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># file-private lexicals go here,

code here (global destructor)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1; # don&rsquo;t forget to

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then go on to declare and use
your variables in functions without any qualifications. See
Exporter and the perlmodlib for details on mechanics and
style issues in module <br>
creation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl modules are included into
your program by saying</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Module;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Module LIST;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is exactly equivalent
to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEGIN { require
&rsquo;Module.pm&rsquo;; &rsquo;Module&rsquo;-&gt;import;
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEGIN { require
&rsquo;Module.pm&rsquo;; &rsquo;Module&rsquo;-&gt;import(
LIST ); }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special case</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Module ();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is exactly equivalent to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEGIN { require
&rsquo;Module.pm&rsquo;; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All Perl module files have the
extension .pm. The &quot;use&quot; operator assumes this so
you don&rsquo;t have to spell out &quot;Module.pm&quot; in
quotes. This also helps to differentiate new modules <br>
from old .pl and .ph files. Module names are also
capitalized unless they&rsquo;re functioning as pragmas;
pragmas are in effect compiler directives, and are sometimes
called <br>
&quot;pragmatic modules&quot; (or even &quot;pragmata&quot;
if you&rsquo;re a classicist).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The two statements:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require SomeModule; <br>
require &quot;SomeModule.pm&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">differ from each other in two
ways. In the first case, any double colons in the module
name, such as &quot;Some::Module&quot;, are translated into
your system&rsquo;s directory separator, <br>
usually &quot;/&quot;. The second case does not, and would
have to be specified literally. The other difference is that
seeing the first &quot;require&quot; clues in the compiler
that uses of <br>
indirect object notation involving &quot;SomeModule&quot;,
as in &quot;$ob = purge SomeModule&quot;, are method calls,
not function calls. (Yes, this really can make a
difference.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because the &quot;use&quot;
statement implies a &quot;BEGIN&quot; block, the importing
of semantics happens as soon as the &quot;use&quot;
statement is compiled, before the rest of the file is
compiled. This <br>
is how it is able to function as a pragma mechanism, and
also how modules are able to declare subroutines that are
then visible as list or unary operators for the rest of the
<br>
current file. This will not work if you use
&quot;require&quot; instead of &quot;use&quot;. With
&quot;require&quot; you can get into this problem:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require Cwd; # make Cwd::
accessible <br>
$here = Cwd::getcwd();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Cwd; # import names from
Cwd:: <br>
$here = getcwd();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require Cwd; # make Cwd::
accessible <br>
$here = getcwd(); # oops! no main::getcwd()</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, &quot;use Module
()&quot; is recommended over &quot;require Module&quot;,
because it determines module availability at compile time,
not in the middle of your program&rsquo;s execution. An <br>
exception would be if two modules each tried to
&quot;use&quot; each other, and each also called a function
from that other module. In that case, it&rsquo;s easy to use
&quot;require&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl packages may be nested
inside other package names, so we can have package names
containing &quot;::&quot;. But if we used that package name
directly as a filename it would make for <br>
unwieldy or impossible filenames on some systems. Therefore,
if a module&rsquo;s name is, say, &quot;Text::Soundex&quot;,
then its definition is actually found in the library file
<br>
Text/Soundex.pm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl modules always have a .pm
file, but there may also be dynamically linked executables
(often ending in .so) or autoloaded subroutine definitions
(often ending in .al) <br>
associated with the module. If so, these will be entirely
transparent to the user of the module. It is the
responsibility of the .pm file to load (or arrange to
autoload) any <br>
additional functionality. For example, although the POSIX
module happens to do both dynamic loading and autoloading,
the user can say just &quot;use POSIX&quot; to get it
all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Making your module threadsafe
<br>
Since 5.6.0, Perl has had support for a new type of threads
called interpreter threads (ithreads). These threads can be
used explicitly and implicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ithreads work by cloning the
data tree so that no data is shared between different
threads. These threads can be used by using the
&quot;threads&quot; module or by doing fork() on win32 <br>
(fake fork() support). When a thread is cloned all Perl data
is cloned, however non-Perl data cannot be cloned
automatically. Perl after 5.7.2 has support for the
&quot;CLONE&quot; <br>
special subroutine. In &quot;CLONE&quot; you can do whatever
you need to do, like for example handle the cloning of
non-Perl data, if necessary. &quot;CLONE&quot; will be
called once as a class <br>
method for every package that has it defined (or inherits
it). It will be called in the context of the new thread, so
all modifications are made in the new area. Currently <br>
CLONE is called with no parameters other than the invocant
package name, but code should not assume that this will
remain unchanged, as it is likely that in future extra <br>
parameters will be passed in to give more information about
the state of cloning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to CLONE all objects
you will need to keep track of them per package. This is
simply done using a hash and Scalar::Util::weaken().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl after 5.8.7 has support for
the &quot;CLONE_SKIP&quot; special subroutine. Like
&quot;CLONE&quot;, &quot;CLONE_SKIP&quot; is called once per
package; however, it is called just before cloning starts,
<br>
and in the context of the parent thread. If it returns a
true value, then no objects of that class will be cloned; or
rather, they will be copied as unblessed, undef values. For
<br>
example: if in the parent there are two references to a
single blessed hash, then in the child there will be two
references to a single undefined scalar value instead. This
<br>
provides a simple mechanism for making a module threadsafe;
just add &quot;sub CLONE_SKIP { 1 }&quot; at the top of the
class, and &quot;DESTROY()&quot; will now only be called
once per object. Of <br>
course, if the child thread needs to make use of the
objects, then a more sophisticated approach is needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like &quot;CLONE&quot;,
&quot;CLONE_SKIP&quot; is currently called with no
parameters other than the invocant package name, although
that may change. Similarly, to allow for future expansion,
the <br>
return value should be a single 0 or 1 value.</p>
