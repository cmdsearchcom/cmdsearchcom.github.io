<p>JACK(1) General Commands Manual JACK(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Jack - rip and encode CDs with one command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
jack [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Jack transforms your audio-CDs to FLAC, MP3 or Ogg Vorbis
files. It uses several helper programs in order to achieve
functions such as ripping, encoding and, tagging files with
<br>
meta information. Ripping is either done via cdparanoia (in
which case the ripping status is displayed by Jack as well)
or cdda2wav. Jack works with several encoders, namely <br>
oggenc, flac, lame, gogo, bladeenc, l3enc, mp3enc and xing.
Any time during operation (and even when everything is
finished and the original CD lost) you can let Jack look up
<br>
the track names at freedb.org and rename the tracks
accordingly. Tagging of audio files with meta information
about artist, track title, etc. is performed as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no freedb-lookup has been
performed, Jack drops all files in a directory
~/jack/jack-xxxxxxxx, with xxxxxxxx representing the
CD&rsquo;s CDDB/FreeDB disc ID. This directory is <br>
renamed by Jack when the appropriate information is
known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most options like ripper,
encoder, preferred FreeDB-Server, directory and sound file
format, etc. can be user defined by changing the defaults in
/etc/jackrc or by saving them to <br>
~/.jack3rc. Additional rippers, encoders and FreeDB servers
can be defined by users through the help of a plug-in
directory (as defined by the plugin_path option which
defaults <br>
to ~/.jack_plugins).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While Jack is running, these
keyboard commands are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q or Q quit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p or P disable ripping (for
example, if you need the CD drive)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p or P (again) or c or C <br>
resume ripping</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e or E pause/continue all
encoders</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r or R pause/continue all
rippers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? toggle the copyright/help
box</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Different options need different data-types as
arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bool can be &quot;yes&quot; or
&quot;no&quot;, like in --vbr=yes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string can be anything, like in
--rename-fmt &quot;%n.%t&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int an integer number, like in
--bitrate 192 (or --bitrate=192 )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list multiple strings, delimited
by the final &quot;;&quot;. Example: --guess-toc file1.mp3
file2.mp3 ... fileN.mp3 ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Jack understands the following
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--append-year string <br>
append this string to the directory name (useful with %y to
add the year an album was released)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --bitrate int <br>
target bitrate (in kbit/s, default is 160).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--char-filter string <br>
convert file names using a python method</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--charset string <br>
charset of filenames (defaults to your locale).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --check-toc <br>
compare toc-file and cd-toc, then exit. Jack caches the TOC
of a CD in a file (&quot;jack.toc&quot;). If you want to
know if the inserted CD matches the toc-file in the current
<br>
directory, use this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --claim-dir <br>
rename directories even if they were was not created by
Jack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cont-failed-query <br>
continue without FreeDB data if query fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --create-dirs <br>
tells Jack to create sub-directories in which Jack puts all
the files for the current CD. If no FreeDB data is
available, i.e. when not using -Q , these directories will
<br>
be named &quot;jack-xxxxxxxx&quot; where
&quot;xxxxxxxx&quot; stands for the CD&rsquo;s FreeDB ID.
Otherwise dir_template (see above) will be used. This option
is turned on by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--device string <br>
The device-name of your cdrom-drive. The default is
/dev/cdrom</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dir-template string <br>
if directories are renamed, this is the format used (default
&quot;%a/%l&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --dont-work <br>
don&rsquo;t do DAE, encoding, tagging or renaming. This may
be useful if you only want to do a FreeDB query, e.g. while
another jack is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--edit-freedb <br>
open an editor to change the CDDB information which has been
obtained previously (only useful with -Q).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--encoder-name, -E string <br>
use which encoder (default &quot;oggenc&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --encoders int <br>
encode how many files in parallel. If you have a SMP machine
or simply want to stress your system, you can have Jack
encode several files at once (default 1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --exec <br>
run predefined command when finished.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--extt-is-artist <br>
the artist is contained in the EXTT fields. The EXTT fields
are lines in the FreeDB file which contain additional data
for each track. As it&rsquo;s the submitting user&rsquo;s
choice <br>
what to use them for, Jack can&rsquo;t determine by itself
what they were intended for. You have to provide this
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--extt-is-title <br>
the track title is contained in the EXTT fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--extt-is-comment <br>
a track comment is contained in the EXTT fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force <br>
do not ask. Like when deleting incomplete files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --from-tocfile string <br>
rip from a cdrdao created CD image on hd. The specified
toc-file contains the name of the image file. Use -F if jack
can&rsquo;t find the image file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --from-image string <br>
read audio data from image file. Like --from-tocfile, but
the image itself is specified instead of the tocfile. If you
do not have a toc-file (or don&rsquo;t specify a toc- <br>
file), the TOC is read from the CD itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --guess-toc list <br>
make up a TOC from the list of sound file given. The format
is track_01.ogg ... track_nn.ogg ; Note that the trailing
&quot; ; &quot; is only necessary if you want to append more
<br>
options to your command line. You can use it to do a FreeDB
query based on your sound files alone - no need for the CD.
Very useful if you have no idea which CD the songs <br>
are from. The songs must be given in the same order as they
were on their CD. The generated TOC file is similar, but not
identical to the TOC of the CD - do not submit <br>
these!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G, --id3-genre string <br>
set ID3 genre. Use &rsquo;help&rsquo; to get a list of all
known genres. (You can also specify the ID3v1 genre as an
int)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y, --id3-year int <br>
set the year of the album (the term ID3 comes from MP3 but
this option also works with other audio formats, such as OGG
Vorbis and FLAC)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Show summary of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --keep-wavs <br>
do not delete WAVs after encoding them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mail-submit <br>
submit FreeDB entry via e-mail. HTTP submission is
preferred. You will have to enter the category of the
CD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --max-load float <br>
only start new encoders if your system&rsquo;s load is below
the specified value. /proc/loadavg must be readable by you
for this to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--multi-mode <br>
try to query FreeDB for all dirs in searchdirs which have no
FreeDB data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--my-mail string <br>
your e-mail address, needed for FreeDB submissions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --nice int <br>
nice-level with which the encoders are started. Default is
12 which shouldn&rsquo;t hurt your system much.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --overwrite <br>
overwrite existing files, i.e. do not check if already
ripped WAVs or an already encoded file seem to be OK. Use
this if you know something went wrong last time. This is
<br>
off by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --only-dae <br>
only produce WAVs, implies --keep-wavs. This is off by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--otf=bool <br>
On-the-fly operation. Only on some encoders/rippers. Do not
create WAVs, pipe ripper output through the encoder. Default
is no as it&rsquo;s a torture for the CDROM drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quality int <br>
vbr encoding quality. -1 is lowest, 10 highest (default 6).
You can also specify a float.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --query <br>
do FreeDB query when all is done. This is useful if Jack was
previously run without a FreeDB query. If all tracks are
done you don&rsquo;t even have to have a CD inserted as the
<br>
TOC is cached by Jack. After having finished ripping and
encoding, Jack will rename the files and tag them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--query-if-needed=bool <br>
like --query-now, but only if FreeDB data hasn&rsquo;t been
successfully queried before.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q, --query-now <br>
do FreeDB query when starting. Use this if you are connected
to the Internet when starting Jack. Know that the query may
need user-interaction. After having finished rip&acirc; <br>
ping and encoding, Jack will rename the files and tag
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --read-ahead int <br>
read how many WAVs in advance. At most read_ahead +
num_encoders WAVs are ripped before a track has completely
been encoded. Default is 99 which will read the whole CD,
<br>
provided there is enough disk space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remove-files <br>
have Jack remove its temp jack*-files. Be careful -
don&rsquo;t delete them too early!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --rename <br>
rename and tag files according to FreeDB file. On startup,
Jack creates a blank FreeDB entry file (except if
--query-now is used, then the file is queried from your
FreeDB <br>
server). If you have changed its contents (e.g. because the
CD was unknown to FreeDB) and want to rename and tag your
audio files accordingly, use this option. Give all <br>
other needed options too, like -t , -E , ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rename-dir=bool <br>
rename directory as well (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rename-fmt string <br>
format of normal files (default &quot;%n - %t&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rename-fmt-va string <br>
format of Various Artists files (default &quot;%n - %a -
%t&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rename-num string <br>
format of the track number (%n, printf() style) used to
rename the files (default &quot;%02d&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --reorder=bool <br>
optimize track-order for disk space. This can save you some
peak disk space during the encoding process; this may make
it possible to do a CD which would otherwise fail to <br>
be encoded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--replacement-chars list <br>
unusable chars are replaced by the corresponding list item
(default &quot;%&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ripper string <br>
which program to use for extracting the audio data (default
&quot;cdparanoia&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--save save options to
~/.jack3rc file and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--scan-dirs int <br>
Scan this many levels from the current working directory for
a matching toc-file (0 to disable, default 2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--search list <br>
add these directories to the list of directories searched
when looking for the workdir (default &quot;.&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--server string <br>
which FreeDB server to use. Don&rsquo;t forget to set your
HTTP proxy. Currently either &quot;freedb&quot; (default) or
&quot;freedb-de&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--silent-mode=bool <br>
be quiet (no screen output).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --space int <br>
forcibly set usable disk space, in bytes. This option lets
you limit the disk space Jack uses, maybe you need it for
something else? Be careful: if set too high or too <br>
low, ripping and encoding will probably fail. The default is
to look how much is free and to use this value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--submit <br>
submit FreeDB entry via HTTP. You will have to enter the
category of the CD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --swab=bool <br>
swap byte order from image file. As cdrdao momentarily only
outputs &quot;raw&quot; .cdr files, you quite likely want to
swap the byte order. Try this option if your WAVs and <br>
encoded files contain only noise. This is on by default as
cdrdao currently generates .cdr files that are
&quot;wrong&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--todo print what would be done
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --tracks string <br>
limit ripping and encoding to the specified tracks, use
comma to separate tracks. Ranges are also possible; 5-9 is
equivalent to 5,6,7,8,9; 12- is like specifying track <br>
12,...,last_track. The default is to process the whole
CD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --undo-rename <br>
undo file renaming and exit. If you don&rsquo;t like how
Jack renamed your files, use this option to restore the
previous state. Several levels of undo are possible. Note
that <br>
meta information tags are not restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unusable-chars list <br>
characters which can&rsquo;t be used in filenames (default
&quot;/&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--upd-progress <br>
have Jack re-create its temp files. Use this if you deleted
them too early.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--update-freedb, -U <br>
update the FreeDB info and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usage-win=bool <br>
show the help screen while running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --vbr=bool <br>
Generate variable bitrate files, only on encoders which
support this. Default is yes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--various=bool <br>
when parsing FreeDB data, Jack assumes that if the
disc&Acirc;&acute;s artist is set to &quot;Various&quot; the
track titles have the format &quot;[artist] - [title]&quot;.
If the disc title is set to <br>
something else and you still want the above behaviour, use
--various.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--various-swap <br>
exchange artist and title, many FreeDB entries have them
wrong.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--wait=bool <br>
wait for key press before quitting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --workdir string <br>
where to create directories and put the files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--write-id3v1=bool <br>
write a smart id3v1 tag to the encoded file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--write-id3v2=bool <br>
write an id3v2 tag to the encoded file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--write-m3u <br>
create a playlist in .m3u format. This has bugs, don&rsquo;t
rely on it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIG FILE OPTIONS <br>
In addition the the command line options, there are some
options that can only be set directly in the config
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">freedb_dir <br>
all FreeDB queries will be done in this (local) directory;
failed local queries will be done via the network. Example:
/var/spool/freedb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Insert a CD, fire up jack: <br>
jack</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now watch it work. It&rsquo;s
fun for a while. After having finished, you have the
following files on your HD: track_01.mp3, track_02.mp3, ...,
track_nn.mp3 plus jack.toc, jack.freedb, <br>
jack.progress. The last three are used to store the state
jack is in so it can resume work when interrupted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Jack will create a directory
called jack-xxxxxxxx for you, there it stores all the file
for the CD whose id is xxxxxxxx. After a FreeDB query this
directory is renamed to some&acirc; <br>
thing human readable, like &quot;Artist - Title&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When jack is interrupted, call
it again using the same command line as before to resume
work, in this case <br>
jack</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now let&rsquo;s try a FreeDB
query: <br>
jack -q <br>
If the query is successful the files will be renamed to
something more readable and will be tagged accordingly using
ID3 or Vorbis tags. The file jack.freedb will contain the
<br>
queried FreeDB entry, and the original file will be backed
up as jack.freedb.bak.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the --rename-fmt
option in order to specify the format of the name which will
be given to your audio tracks. A list of valid options can
be found below. You may <br>
also want to specify a set of characters which are not
usable and should be replaced. For example, on Unix systems
the slash (/) should most certainly be replaced with
something <br>
else. The VFAT filesystem also does not support double
quotes (&quot;). In order to replace such characters, you
can specify the options unusable_chars together with
replace&acirc; <br>
ment_chars. For example, <br>
jack -Q --rename-fmt &quot;%n-%t&quot; --unusable-chars A I
; --replacement-chars a i ; <br>
will query the FreeDB server, rip and encode all tracks of
the CD and save the files in a format which will contain the
track number and the title. All occurances of the letters
<br>
A and I will be replaced with their lower-case versions.
These options can also be put in one&rsquo;s configuration
file using the following format: <br>
unusable_chars:[&rsquo; &rsquo;, &rsquo;/&rsquo;] <br>
replacement_chars:[&rsquo;_&rsquo;, &rsquo;_&rsquo;] <br>
This will replace whitespace and slashes with underscores.
If you want to convert all characters to lower-case, you
don&rsquo;t have to manually specify all of them but can use
the <br>
following option instead: <br>
char_filter:.lower()</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All in one: query, rip, encode,
cleanup: <br>
jack -Q --remove-files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Editing / normalizing /
stripping the WAV files before encoding: <br>
jack -O -D --remove-files ; gnoise *wav ; jack -g *wav ;
jack <br>
Just replace gnoise by the operation you&rsquo;d like to
perform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLUG-INS <br>
Additional rippers, encoders and FreeDB servers currently
not known by jack can be defined using jack&rsquo;s plug-in
mechanism. Plug-ins have to be put in the ~/.jack_plugins
direc&acirc; <br>
tory (or the path defined by the plugin_path option). The
plug-ins are simple Python scripts which define a hash with
the values for your ripper, encoder or FreeDB server. For
<br>
rippers and encoders, the hash plugin_helpers has to be
defined while additional FreeDB servers are specified in
plugin_freedb_servers. Both expect another hash whose names
cor&acirc; <br>
responds to the entry you want to add (prefixed by plugin_)
and have to define certain values. Two examples are
provided, jack_plugin_cddb.py (to define a new FreeDB
server) and <br>
jack_plugin_lame.py (to show how rippers and encoders can be
defined). After defining plug-ins, you have to manually
select them by specifying the ripper, encoder, or CDDB <br>
server. An example would be: <br>
jack --encoder-name plugin_lame --ripper plugin_foo --server
plugin_cddb <br>
Plug-ins can also be used to define your own rippers and
encoders which uses different options than those used by
default by jack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
There are several environment variables which can be used in
jack&rsquo;s exec hooks:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JACK_BASE_DIR <br>
lists jack&rsquo;s base directory in which files are
stored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JACK_CUR_DIR <br>
lists the current directory of jack in which files of the
current album are put.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JACK_JUST_ENCODED <br>
lists all track names which have just been encoded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JACK_JUST_RIPPED <br>
lists all track names which have just been ripped.</p>
