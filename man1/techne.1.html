<p>TECHNE(1) General Commands Manual TECHNE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
techne - A general purpose, programmable physical simulator
and renderer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
techne [OPTION...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Techne is a general purpose, programmable physical simulator
and renderer. It reads in a set of scripts wherein every
aspect of a physical system is specified and then proceeds
<br>
to simulate and render the system onscreen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h, --help <br>
Display a help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c FILE, --configuration=FILE
<br>
Include FILE into the list of sources that are going to be
executed by Techne at start up. Multiple -c options can be
used to specify any number of source files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O OPTION[=VALUE], --option
OPTION[=VALUE] <br>
This defines an option with name OPTION and value VALUE. The
meaning of the option itself depends on the executed
program, Techne simply defines it. If VALUE is left out <br>
it defaults to &quot;true&quot;. Multiple -O switches can be
specified. If more than one -O switches specify the same
option the value of the option is set to a table of all
spec&acirc; <br>
ified values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --engineering <br>
This instructs Techne to skip the rendering stages of its
loop and only perform simulation which can speed up
execution when the running program is performing unattended
<br>
experiments or other computations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mute <br>
Disable audio rendering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d DEVICE, --device=DEVICE <br>
The index of the audio device to open. To get a list of
valid audio devices and their indices specify list as the
device to open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--name name --class class <br>
Specify the application window&rsquo;s WM_CLASS property.
This options helps the window manager identify which
application name and icon to use for this window. Usually if
the <br>
application&rsquo;s name is Foo and there is a foo.desktop
file installed the name should be set to &lsquo;foo&rsquo;
and class to &lsquo;Foo&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a few options that can
be specified through the -O switch that are interpreted by
Techne itself. Of use to the end user might be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noarrays, nobufferobjects <br>
Don&rsquo;t use vertex arrays or vertex buffer objects
respectively. This is mainly useful if buggy drivers are
giving you trouble with these features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">poweroftwo <br>
Scale all specified textures internally so that they have
power-of-two side lengths. Again this is only useful to
circumvent driver bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCRIPTS <br>
Some scripts are provided in the Techne distribution that
are likely to be of use while programming or using an
application. They&rsquo;re executed like all scripts the
only differ&acirc; <br>
ence being that you don&rsquo;t have to specify a full path.
So far the following scripts are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">base.lua <br>
This is just a basic script that you can use to set up a
useful default configuration for some other script. It is
therefore not of much use on its own and was meant <br>
mainly to facilitate prototyping and as a base on which
example code can be run. So if you&rsquo;ve written a script
called prototype.lua in the current working directory in
<br>
order to try out some neat idea you can run it like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">techne -c base.lua -c
prototype.lua</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will setup the simulator
and renderer with some generic values which your script can
later override at will and also set up some useful key
bindings and options. <br>
Currently you can use q to quit, p to pause and resume
simulation and specify the framerate option to obtain a
frame-rate gauge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export.lua <br>
This script can be used to export media like textures or
geometry meshes back into standard file formats that can be
loaded and edited in existing software. It was writ&acirc;
<br>
ten to facilitate the reuse of the datasets that are bundled
with applications by others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When executing it you need to
provide two options, the input and output files. The input
file can be any mesh, polyhedron, texture or wave script
either compressed (end&acirc; <br>
ing in .lua) or uncompressed (ending in .lc). The output
should be the path to some file name where the exported data
is to be written. The script automatically deter&acirc; <br>
mines what kind of data it is dealing with and exports it
into a form that you can use with existing free software.
Geometry meshes are exported into Wavefront OBJ files, <br>
textures and other imagery are converted into PNG image
files while wave data is output as raw 16-bit unsigned
monophonic samples at the sampling frequency of the input
<br>
data. This frequency is printed at the end of the conversion
process so you can use an external tool (such as SoX) to
play or convert the data into any other form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example you can convert
Aviation&rsquo;s tachometer face texture into a PNG image
file (assuming Aviation is installed in the default
location) with the following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">techne -c export.lua
-Oinput=/usr/share/techne/aviation/imagery/tachometer.lc
-Ooutput=/tmp/foo.png</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOCUMENTATION <br>
Techne currently lacks a proper reference manual. If
you&rsquo;re thinking of using Techne for your own project
please post a message on the techne-users mailing list. If
you need to <br>
hack one of the derivative products direct your messages to
the respective project mailing lists (e.g. billiards-users,
aviation-users, etc.). It can only be hoped that public <br>
interest will motivate the author to allocate more time to
the documentation of Techne.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Please report any bugs you find on the techne-devel mailing
list or use the bug tracker in Techne&rsquo;s project page
&lt;http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/techne&gt;.</p>
