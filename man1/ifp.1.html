<p>IFP(1) General Commands Manual IFP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ifp - access iRiver iFP audio devices</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ifp command [arguments ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ifp lets you manage your music on an iRiver iFP music player
acting in &quot;Manager Mode&quot;. If your player is using
&quot;UMS Mode&quot;, then you don&rsquo;t need this
program; it will appear as new <br>
drive when you plug it in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manual page documents the
version of ifp included as an example application for the
libifp library. The interface is intended to mimic the ifp
binary found in the ifp-line <br>
binary package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifp can upload or download files
or directories, delete or make directories on the device,
format the device, or upgrade your firmware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
ls [directory] <br>
List the files and directories on the device. The root
directory is /. Directories are preceded with
&rsquo;d&rsquo; and other files with &rsquo;f&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">df Display total and free space
on the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upload localfile remotefile <br>
Copy the file named localfile to the iFP device, and name it
remotefile. (This is like cp.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upload localfile remotedir <br>
Copy the file named localfile to the iFP device, into
remotedir. (This is like cp.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upload localdir remotedir <br>
Copy the entire directory localdir to the device, into
remotedir. This copies into a subdirectory, so upload foo /
puts files from the directory foo info /foo on the <br>
device. (This is like cp -R.) This uploads the entire
directory, not just audio files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">put localfile | localdir <br>
Upload the file or directory to the device, with the same
name it has locally. If a directory is given, it is put in
/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">download remotefile
localfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">download remotefile localdir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">download remotedir localdir <br>
Like upload, but copies from the iFP device to your system.
Some proprietary file types may not be downloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get remotefile | remotedir <br>
Like put, but copies files or directories from the device to
your current working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rm [-r] file <br>
Delete (recursively) a file (or directory) on the
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rmdir dir <br>
Delete an empty directory on the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mkdir dir <br>
Create a directory on the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">battery <br>
Display battery status of the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typestring <br>
Display the model number of the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">firmversion <br>
Display the firmware revision currently on the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format Reformat the
device&rsquo;s memory. This will delete all your music.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">firmupdate FIRMWARE.HEX <br>
Upload the file FIRMWARE.HEX as new firmware for the device.
This will not delete your music, but may have many other
detrimental effects. Don&rsquo;t turn the device off or <br>
unplug it while the firmware is updating, and don&rsquo;t
attempt to upload new firmware with a low battery.</p>
