<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pgmtoppm - colorize a PGM (grayscale) image into a PPM
(color) image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pgmtoppm colorspec [pgmfile] pgmtoppm colorspec1-colorspec2
[pgmfile] pgmtoppm -map=mapfile [pgmfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimum unique abbreviation of
option is acceptable. You may use double hyphens instead of
single hyphen to denote options. You may use white space in
place of the equals sign <br>
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pgmtoppm reads a PGM as input
and produces a PPM file as output with a specific color
assigned to each gray value in the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify one color
argument, black in the pgm file stays black and white in the
pgm file turns into the specified color in the ppm file.
Gray values in between are lin&acirc; <br>
early mapped to differing intensities of the specified
color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify two color
arguments (separated by a hyphen), then black gets mapped to
the first color and white gets mapped to the second and gray
values in between get mapped <br>
linearly (across a three dimensional space) to colors in
between.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify the color (color) as
described for the argument of the ppm_parsecolor() library
routine &acirc;&uml;libppm.html#colorname&acirc;&copy; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, you can specify an entire
colormap with the -map option. The mapfile is just a ppm
file; it can be any shape, all that matters is the colors in
it and their order. In <br>
this case, black gets mapped into the first color in the map
file, and white gets mapped to the last and gray values in
between are mapped linearly onto the sequence of colors in
<br>
between. The maxval of the output image is the maxval of the
map image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A more direct way to specify a
particular color to replace each particular gray level is to
use pamlookup. You make an index file that explicitly
associates a color with each <br>
possible gray level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE - MAXVAL <br>
When you don&rsquo;t use -map, the &rsquo;maxval,&rsquo; or
depth, of the output image is the same as that of the input
image. The maxval affects the color resolution, which may
cause quantiza&acirc; <br>
tion errors you don&rsquo;t anticipate in your output. For
example, you have a simple black and white image as a PGM
with maxval 1. Run this image through pgmtoppm 0f/00/00 to
try to <br>
make the image black and faint red. Because the output image
will also have maxval 1, there is no such thing as faint
red. It has to be either full-on red or black. pgmtoppm <br>
rounds the color 0f/00/00 down to black, and you get an
output image that is nothing but black.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fix is easy: Pass the input
through pamdepth on the way into pgmtoppm to increase its
depth to something that would give you the resolution you
need to get your desired <br>
color. In this case, pamdepth 16 would do it. Or spare
yourself the unnecessary thinking and just say pamdepth
255.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PBM input is a special case.
While you might think this would be equivalent to a PGM with
maxval 1 since only two gray levels are necessary to
represent a PBM image, pgmtoppm, <br>
like all Netpbm programs, in fact treats it as a maxval of
255.</p>
