<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The vector digitizer is a wxGUI component intended for
interactive editing and digitizing vector maps (see v.edit
for non-interactive vector editing GRASS capabilities).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that only vector maps
stored or generated in the current mapset can be opened for
editing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The digitizer allows editing of
2D vector features (points, lines, centroids, boundaries,
and areas).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vector features can be selected
by mouse (bounding box or simply by mouse click, see select
threshold in Settings&amp;#8594;General&amp;#8594;Select
threshold), or by query (eg. by line <br>
length, see Settings&amp;#8594;Query Tool).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STARTING THE DIGITIZER <br>
The vector digitizer can be launched from Map Display
toolbar by selecting &quot;Digitize&quot; from Tools
combobox. Vector map is selectable for editing from
Digitizer toolbar (&quot;Select <br>
vector map&quot; combobox, note that only vector maps from
the current layer tree in Layer Manager are listed). The
vector digitizer can alternatively be activated from the
contex&acirc; <br>
tual menu in the Layer Manager by selecting &quot;Start
editing&quot; on selected vector map in the layer tree, or
directly from the Layer Manager toolbar . The vector
digitizer also can <br>
also be launched from the command line as a stand-alone
application g.gui.vdigit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CREATING A NEW VECTOR MAP <br>
A new vector map can be easily created from the digitizer
toolbar by selecting &quot;New vector map&quot; in
&quot;Select vector map&quot; combobox. A new vector map is
created, added to the current <br>
layer tree in Layer Manager and opened for editing.
&quot;Select vector map&quot; combobox in the digitizer
toolbar also allows easily switching between vector maps to
be edited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EDITING AN EXISTING VECTOR MAP
<br>
An existing vector map selected in the digitizer toolbar in
the &quot;Select vector map&quot; combobox. This map is then
opened for editing and added to the current layer tree in
the Layer <br>
Manager. This &quot;Select vector map&quot; combobox in the
digitizer toolbar also allows to easily switch between
vector maps to be edited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING A RASTER BACKGROUND MAP
<br>
In order to digitize from a raster map, simply load the map
into the Map Display using the Layer Manager. Then start
digitizing, see below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING A VECTOR BACKGROUND MAP
<br>
The vector digitizer allows you to select a
&quot;background&quot; vector map. Loading it within the
digitizer is different from simply loading it via Layer
Manager since direct interac&acirc; <br>
tion with single vector features then becomes possible. <br>
Vector features may be copied from the background map by
&quot;Copy features from (background) vector map&quot; tool
from the &quot;Additional tools&quot; of the digitizer
toolbar. Newly digitized <br>
vector features are snapped in the given threshold to the
features from the background map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIGITIZER TOOLBAR <br>
Digitize new point <br>
Add new point to vector map and optionally define its
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Digitize new line <br>
Add new line to vector map and optionally define its
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Digitize new boundary <br>
Add new boundary to vector map and optionally define its
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Digitize new centroid <br>
Add new centroid to vector map and optionally define its
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Digitize new area <br>
Add new area (closed boundary and one centroid inside) to
vector map and optionally define its attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Move vertex <br>
Move selected vertex of linear feature. Thus shape of linear
feature is changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add vertex <br>
Add new vertex to selected linear feature (shape not
changed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove vertex <br>
Remove selected vertex from linear feature. Thus shape of
selected feature can be changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Edit line/boundary <br>
Edit selected linear feature, add new segments or remove
existing segments of linear feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Move feature(s) <br>
Move selected vector features. Selection can be done by
mouse or by query.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete feature(s) <br>
Delete selected vector features (point, line, centroid, or
boundary). Selection can be done by mouse or by query.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete areas(s) <br>
Delete selected vector areas. Selection can be done by mouse
or by query.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display/update categories <br>
Display categories of selected vector feature. Category
settings can be modified, new layer/category pairs added or
already defined pairs removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display/update attributes <br>
Display attributes of selected vector feature (based on its
category settings). Attributes can be also modified. Same
functionality is accessible from Main toolbar &quot;Query
<br>
vector map (editable mode)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional tools</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Break selected
lines/boundaries at intersection <br>
Split given vector line or boundary into two lines on given
position (based on v.clean, tool=break).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Connect two
selected lines/boundaries <br>
Connect selected lines or boundaries, the first given line
is connected to the second one. The second line is broken if
necessary on each intersection. The lines are <br>
connected only if distance between them is not greater than
snapping threshold value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Copy categories
<br>
Copy category settings of selected vector feature to other
vector features. Layer/category pairs of source vector
features are appended to the target feature category <br>
settings. Existing layer/category pairs are not removed from
category settings of the target features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Copy features
from (background) vector map <br>
Make identical copy of selected vector features. If a
background vector map has been selected from the Layer
Manager, copy features from background vector map, not from
<br>
the currently modified vector map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Copy attributes
<br>
Duplicate attributes settings of selected vector feature to
other vector features. New category(ies) is appended to the
target feature category settings and attributes <br>
duplicated based on category settings of source vector
features. Existing layer/category pairs are not removed from
category settings of the target features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Feature type
conversion <br>
Change feature type of selected geometry features. Points
are converted to centroids, centroids to points, lines to
boundaries and boundaries to lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Flip selected
lines/boundaries <br>
Flip direction of selected linear features (lines or
boundaries).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Merge selected
lines/boundaries <br>
Merge (at least two) selected vector lines or boundaries.
The geometry of the merged vector lines can be changed. If
the second line from two selected lines is in oppo&acirc;
<br>
site direction to the first, it will be flipped. See also
module v.build.polylines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Snap selected
lines/boundaries (only to nodes) <br>
Snap vector features in given threshold. See also module
v.clean. Note that this tool supports only snapping to
nodes. Snapping to vector features from background vector
<br>
map is not currently supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Split
line/boundary <br>
Split selected line or boundary on given position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Query tool <br>
Select vector features by defining a threshold for min/max
length value (linear features or dangles).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Z-bulk labeling
of 3D lines <br>
Assign z coordinate values to 3D vector lines in bounding
box. This is useful for labeling contour lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Undo <br>
Undo previous operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Redo <br>
Redo previous operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Settings <br>
Digitizer settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quit digitizing tool <br>
Changes in vector map can be optionally discarded when
digitizing session is quited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Mouse button functions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Left - select or deselect
features</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control+Left - cancel action or
undo vertex when digitizing lines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Right - confirm action</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dead (deleted) features are only
marked as &acirc;dead&acirc; in the geometry file but remain
there and occupy space. Any vector module used afterwards on
this vector map which really reads <br>
and writes vector geometry (so not g.copy) will write only
features which are &acirc;alive&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Added or modified vector
features are snapped to existing vector features
(Settings&amp;#8594;General&amp;#8594;Snapping). To disable
snapping set the snapping threshold to &acirc;0&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the digitizer crashes for
some reason, the changes are automatically saved. Broken
topology can be repaired by running v.build.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRASS GIS uses a topological
vector format, meaning that a common boundary of two
polygons is only stored once. When digitizing polygons it is
thus important to be able to only <br>
draw each boundary once. When drawing a polygon adjacent to
an existing polygon, one has to first split the existing
boundary at the points where the new boundary will be <br>
attached. Snapping should be set to ensure that the new
boundaries are automatically attached to the chosen
points.</p>
