<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dicomscope - DICOM Viewer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dicomscope DICOMFile.dcm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents briefly the dicomscope
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DICOMscope is a free DICOM
viewer which can display uncompressed, monochrome DICOM
images from all modalities and which supports monitor
calibration according to DICOM part 14 as <br>
well as presentation states. DICOMscope offers a print
client (DICOM Basic Grayscale Print Management) which also
implements the optional Presentation LUT SOP Class. The
develop&acirc; <br>
ment of this prototype was commissioned by the
&quot;Committee for the Advancement of DICOM&quot; and
demonstrated at the European Congress of Radiology ECR 1999.
An enhanced version was <br>
developed for the &quot;DICOM Display Consistency
Demonstration&quot; at RSNA InfoRAD 1999. The current
release 3.5.1 has been demonstrated at ECR 2001 and contains
numerous extensions, <br>
including a print server, support for encrypted DICOM
communication, digital signatures and structured
reporting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DICOMscope is not meant as a
competition for commercial DICOM viewers. The application is
rather a feasibility study for DICOM presentation states.
The program is not appropriate <br>
to be used in a clinical environment, e.g. for
reporting.</p>
