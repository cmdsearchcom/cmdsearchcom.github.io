<p>TMAIL(1) General Commands Manual TMAIL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tmail - Mail Delivery Module</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tmail [-b format] [-D] [-f from_name] [-I inbox_specifier]
user[+folder] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tmail delivers mail to a user&rsquo;s INBOX or a designated
folder. tmail may be configured as a drop-in replacement for
binmail(1), mail.local(1) or any program intended for use
for <br>
mail delivery by a mail delivery program such as
sendmail(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tmail is intended to be used for
direct delivery by the mailer daemon; dmail(1) is the
preferred tool for user applications, e.g. a mail delivery
filter such as procmail(1). If <br>
tmail is used for a user application, then the calling
program must be aware of the restrictions noted below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When tmail exits, it returns
exit status values to enable the mail delivery program to
determine whether a message was delivered successfully or
had a temporary (requeue for <br>
later delivery) or permanent (return to sender) failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the +folder extension is
included in the user argument, tmail will attempt to deliver
to the designated folder. If the folder does not exist or
the extension is not included, <br>
the message is delivered to the user&rsquo;s INBOX. If
delivery is to INBOX and no INBOX currently exists, tmail
will create a new INBOX, using the -I or -b flag if
specified. tmail <br>
recognizes the format of an existing INBOX or folder, and
appends the new message in that format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -b flag specifies a format
to create INBOX if INBOX does not already exist. This flag
requires privileges, and can not be used with -I. The
argument is a format name such <br>
as mix, mbx, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -D flag specifies debugging;
this enables additional message telemetry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -f or -r flag is used by the
mail delivery program to specify a Return-Path. The header
<br>
Return-Path: &lt;from_name&gt; <br>
is prepended to the message before delivery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -I flag is used by the mail
delivery program to specify an alternative INBOX name. This
flag requires privileges, and can not be used with -b. This
affects the location and <br>
format of INBOX. If specified, it should be in one of three
forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first form of argument to -I
is the string &quot;INBOX&quot;, which means to write to the
system default inbox using the system default mailbox
format. These system defaults are <br>
defined when the c-client library is built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second form of argument to
-I is a delivery specification, consisting of
&quot;#driver.&quot;, a c-client mailbox format driver name,
&quot;/&quot;, and a file name. This will write to the <br>
specified file in the specified format. For example,
#driver.mbx/INBOX will write to file &quot;INBOX&quot; in
the home directory in mbx format; and
#driver.unix/mail/incoming will write <br>
to file &quot;incoming&quot; in the user&rsquo;s
&quot;mail&quot; subdirectory in unix (default UNIX)
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third form of argument to -I
is any other name. Normally, this will write to the
specified file on the user&rsquo;s home directory in the
specified format. However, certain names <br>
are special. These are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">value equivalant to <br>
----- ------------- <br>
INBOX.MTX #driver.mtx/INBOX.MTX <br>
mbox #driver.unix/mbox <br>
mail.txt #driver.tenex/mail.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -I is not specified, the
default action is -I INBOX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multiple recipients are
specified on the command line, tmail spawns one child
process per recipient to perform actual delivery. This way
of calling tmail is not recommended; <br>
see below under RESTRICTIONS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
If tmail is to be used for mail delivery from the mail
delivery program, it must be installed setuid root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If sendmail is the mail delivery
program, tmail is invoked from sendmail.cf. Look for the
&quot;Mlocal&quot; line, and substitute the path name for
the tmail binary in place of /bin/mail, <br>
/usr/lib/mail.local, etc. You should also add the flag to
invoke tmail with CRLF style newlines; this is usually done
within the Mlocal line. E=</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an example of an Mlocal
line in sendmail version 8:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mlocal, P=/usr/local/etc/tmail,
F=lsDFMAw5:/|@qPrn+,0 T=DNS/RFC822/X-Unix, <br>
S=10/30, R=20/40, E= <br>
A=tmail $u</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If tmail is to be called with
the -I flag, it must be invoked with both real and effective
UID root. Many sendmail configurations invoke the local
mailer as the sending user <br>
when that user is local, which will prevent -b or -I from
working.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS <br>
If tmail is invoked by an ordinary user, the Received:
header line will indicate the name or UID of the user that
invoked it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ordinary users are not permitted
to use the -b or -I flag since otherwise a user could create
any file on another user&rsquo;s directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tmail can deliver mail to home
directories. In addition, tmail can be used to deliver mail
to other mail folders in a home directory or an inferior
directory of a home <br>
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
The calling program should invoke tmail with CRLF newlines,
otherwise tmail will complain in syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Absolute pathnames and ~user
specifications are not permitted in +folder extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ordinary users are not permitted
to use the -I flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMAP4 namespace names are not
yet supported in +folder extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not possible to use tmail
to deliver to mh(1) format mailboxes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If delivery to multiple users is
specified and delivery to any single user fails, the entire
delivery will be reported as having failed, even though
delivery to other users may <br>
have succeeded. If tmail is used for mail delivery from
sendmail(8), a separate tmail invocation should be done for
each user. Otherwise a delivery failure for a single user in
<br>
a message going to multiple users will cause multiple
deliveries to all the other users every time sendmail(8),
retries.</p>
