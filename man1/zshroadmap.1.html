zshroadmap - informal introduction to the zsh manual
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Zsh Manual, like the shell itself, is large and often complicated. This
  section of the manual provides some pointers to areas of the shell that are
  likely to be of particular interest to new users, and indicates where in the
  rest of the manual the documentation is to be found.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WHEN_THE_SHELL_STARTS"><a class="selflink" href="#WHEN_THE_SHELL_STARTS">WHEN
  THE SHELL STARTS</a></h1>
When it starts, the shell reads commands from various files. These can be
  created or edited to customize the shell. See the section Startup/Shutdown
  Files in <i>zsh</i>(1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If no personal initialization files exist for the current user, a function is
  run to help you change some of the most common settings. It won't appear if
  your administrator has disabled the <b>zsh/newuser</b> module. The function is
  designed to be self-explanatory. You can run it by hand with ` <b>autoload -Uz
  zsh-newuser-install; zsh-newuser-install -f</b>'. See also the section User
  Configuration Functions in <i>zshcontrib</i>(1).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INTERACTIVE_USE"><a class="selflink" href="#INTERACTIVE_USE">INTERACTIVE
  USE</a></h1>
Interaction with the shell uses the builtin Zsh Line Editor, ZLE. This is
  described in detail in <i>zshzle</i>(1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first decision a user must make is whether to use the Emacs or Vi editing
  mode as the keys for editing are substantially different. Emacs editing mode
  is probably more natural for beginners and can be selected explicitly with the
  command <b>bindkey -e</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A history mechanism for retrieving previously typed lines (most simply with the
  Up or Down arrow keys) is available; note that, unlike other shells, zsh will
  not save these lines when the shell exits unless you set appropriate
  variables, and the number of history lines retained by default is quite small
  (30 lines). See the description of the shell variables (referred to in the
  documentation as parameters) <b>HISTFILE</b>, <b>HISTSIZE</b> and
  <b>SAVEHIST</b> in <i>zshparam</i>(1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The shell now supports the UTF-8 character set (and also others if supported by
  the operating system). This is (mostly) handled transparently by the shell,
  but the degree of support in terminal emulators is variable. There is some
  discussion of this in the shell FAQ, http://zsh.dotsrc.org/FAQ/ . Note in
  particular that for combining characters to be handled the option
  <b>COMBINING_CHARS</b> needs to be set. Because the shell is now more
  sensitive to the definition of the character set, note that if you are
  upgrading from an older version of the shell you should ensure that the
  appropriate variable, either <b>LANG</b> (to affect all aspects of the shell's
  operation) or <b>LC_CTYPE</b> (to affect only the handling of character sets)
  is set to an appropriate value. This is true even if you are using a
  single-byte character set including extensions of ASCII such as
  <b>ISO-8859-1</b> or <b>ISO-8859-15</b>. See the description of
  <b>LC_CTYPE</b> in <i>zshparam</i>(1).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Completion"><a class="selflink" href="#Completion">Completion</a></h2>
Completion is a feature present in many shells. It allows the user to type only
  a part (usually the prefix) of a word and have the shell fill in the rest. The
  completion system in zsh is programmable. For example, the shell can be set to
  complete email addresses in arguments to the mail command from your
  <b>~/.abook/addressbook</b>; usernames, hostnames, and even remote paths in
  arguments to scp, and so on. Anything that can be written in or glued together
  with zsh can be the source of what the line editor offers as possible
  completions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Zsh has two completion systems, an old, so called <b>compctl</b> completion
  (named after the builtin command that serves as its complete and only user
  interface), and a new one, referred to as <b>compsys</b>, organized as library
  of builtin and user-defined functions. The two systems differ in their
  interface for specifying the completion behavior. The new system is more
  customizable and is supplied with completions for many commonly used commands;
  it is therefore to be preferred.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The completion system must be enabled explicitly when the shell starts. For more
  information see <i>zshcompsys</i>(1).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Extending_the_line_editor"><a class="selflink" href="#Extending_the_line_editor">Extending
  the line editor</a></h2>
Apart from completion, the line editor is highly extensible by means of shell
  functions. Some useful functions are provided with the shell; they provide
  facilities such as:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>insert-composed-char</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">composing characters not found on the keyboard</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>match-words-by-style</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">configuring what the line editor considers a word when
      moving or deleting by word</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>history-beginning-search-backward-end</b>, etc.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">alternative ways of searching the shell history</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>replace-string</b>, <b>replace-pattern</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">functions for replacing strings or patterns globally in the
      command line</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>edit-command-line</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">edit the command line with an external editor.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
See the section `ZLE Functions' in <i>zshcontrib</i>(1) for descriptions of
  these.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The shell has a large number of options for changing its behaviour. These cover
  all aspects of the shell; browsing the full documentation is the only good way
  to become acquainted with the many possibilities. See <i>zshoptions</i>(1).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PATTERN_MATCHING"><a class="selflink" href="#PATTERN_MATCHING">PATTERN
  MATCHING</a></h1>
The shell has a rich set of patterns which are available for file matching
  (described in the documentation as `filename generation' and also known for
  historical reasons as `globbing') and for use when programming. These are
  described in the section `Filename Generation' in <i>zshexpn</i>(1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Of particular interest are the following patterns that are not commonly
  supported by other systems of pattern matching:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>**</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">for matching over multiple directories</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>~</b>, <b>^</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">the ability to exclude patterns from matching when the
      <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b> option is set</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>(</b><i>...</i><b>)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">glob qualifiers, included in parentheses at the end of the
      pattern, which select files by type (such as directories) or attribute
      (such as size).</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GENERAL_COMMENTS_ON_SYNTAX"><a class="selflink" href="#GENERAL_COMMENTS_ON_SYNTAX">GENERAL
  COMMENTS ON SYNTAX</a></h1>
Although the syntax of zsh is in ways similar to the Korn shell, and therefore
  more remotely to the original UNIX shell, the Bourne shell, its default
  behaviour does not entirely correspond to those shells. General shell syntax
  is introduced in the section `Shell Grammar' in <i>zshmisc</i>(1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
One commonly encountered difference is that variables substituted onto the
  command line are not split into words. See the description of the shell option
  <b>SH_WORD_SPLIT</b> in the section `Parameter Expansion' in
  <i>zshexpn</i>(1). In zsh, you can either explicitly request the splitting
  (e.g. <b>${=foo}</b>) or use an array when you want a variable to expand to
  more than one word. See the section `Array Parameters' in <i>zshparam</i>(1).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PROGRAMMING"><a class="selflink" href="#PROGRAMMING">PROGRAMMING</a></h1>
The most convenient way of adding enhancements to the shell is typically by
  writing a shell function and arranging for it to be autoloaded. Functions are
  described in the section `Functions' in <i>zshmisc</i>(1). Users changing from
  the C shell and its relatives should notice that aliases are less used in zsh
  as they don't perform argument substitution, only simple text replacement.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A few general functions, other than those for the line editor described above,
  are provided with the shell and are described in <i>zshcontrib</i>(1).
  Features include:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>promptinit</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">a prompt theme system for changing prompts easily, see the

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>zsh-mime-setup</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">a MIME-handling system which dispatches commands according
      to the suffix of a file as done by graphical file managers</dd>
