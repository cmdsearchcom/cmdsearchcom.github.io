<p>ZSHROADMAP(1) General Commands Manual ZSHROADMAP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
zshroadmap - informal introduction to the zsh manual</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Zsh Manual, like the shell
itself, is large and often complicated. This section of the
manual provides some pointers to areas of the shell that are
likely to be of particu&acirc; <br>
lar interest to new users, and indicates where in the rest
of the manual the documentation is to be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WHEN THE SHELL STARTS <br>
When it starts, the shell reads commands from various files.
These can be created or edited to customize the shell. See
the section Startup/Shutdown Files in zsh(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no personal initialization
files exist for the current user, a function is run to help
you change some of the most common settings. It won&rsquo;t
appear if your administrator has <br>
disabled the zsh/newuser module. The function is designed to
be self-explanatory. You can run it by hand with
&lsquo;autoload -Uz zsh-newuser-install; zsh-newuser-install
-f&rsquo;. See <br>
also the section User Configuration Functions in
zshcontrib(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERACTIVE USE <br>
Interaction with the shell uses the builtin Zsh Line Editor,
ZLE. This is described in detail in zshzle(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first decision a user must
make is whether to use the Emacs or Vi editing mode as the
keys for editing are substantially different. Emacs editing
mode is probably more natu&acirc; <br>
ral for beginners and can be selected explicitly with the
command bindkey -e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A history mechanism for
retrieving previously typed lines (most simply with the Up
or Down arrow keys) is available; note that, unlike other
shells, zsh will not save these lines <br>
when the shell exits unless you set appropriate variables,
and the number of history lines retained by default is quite
small (30 lines). See the description of the shell
vari&acirc; <br>
ables (referred to in the documentation as parameters)
HISTFILE, HISTSIZE and SAVEHIST in zshparam(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shell now supports the UTF-8
character set (and also others if supported by the operating
system). This is (mostly) handled transparently by the
shell, but the degree of <br>
support in terminal emulators is variable. There is some
discussion of this in the shell FAQ,
http://zsh.dotsrc.org/FAQ/ . Note in particular that for
combining characters to <br>
be handled the option COMBINING_CHARS needs to be set.
Because the shell is now more sensitive to the definition of
the character set, note that if you are upgrading from an
<br>
older version of the shell you should ensure that the
appropriate variable, either LANG (to affect all aspects of
the shell&rsquo;s operation) or LC_CTYPE (to affect only the
handling <br>
of character sets) is set to an appropriate value. This is
true even if you are using a single-byte character set
including extensions of ASCII such as ISO-8859-1 or <br>
ISO-8859-15. See the description of LC_CTYPE in
zshparam(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Completion <br>
Completion is a feature present in many shells. It allows
the user to type only a part (usually the prefix) of a word
and have the shell fill in the rest. The completion system
<br>
in zsh is programmable. For example, the shell can be set to
complete email addresses in arguments to the mail command
from your ~/.abook/addressbook; usernames, hostnames, and
<br>
even remote paths in arguments to scp, and so on. Anything
that can be written in or glued together with zsh can be the
source of what the line editor offers as possible
comple&acirc; <br>
tions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zsh has two completion systems,
an old, so called compctl completion (named after the
builtin command that serves as its complete and only user
interface), and a new one, <br>
referred to as compsys, organized as library of builtin and
user-defined functions. The two systems differ in their
interface for specifying the completion behavior. The new
<br>
system is more customizable and is supplied with completions
for many commonly used commands; it is therefore to be
preferred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The completion system must be
enabled explicitly when the shell starts. For more
information see zshcompsys(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extending the line editor <br>
Apart from completion, the line editor is highly extensible
by means of shell functions. Some useful functions are
provided with the shell; they provide facilities such
as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">insert-composed-char <br>
composing characters not found on the keyboard</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">match-words-by-style <br>
configuring what the line editor considers a word when
moving or deleting by word</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">history-beginning-search-backward-end,
etc. <br>
alternative ways of searching the shell history</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">replace-string, replace-pattern
<br>
functions for replacing strings or patterns globally in the
command line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">edit-command-line <br>
edit the command line with an external editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the section &lsquo;ZLE
Functions&rsquo; in zshcontrib(1) for descriptions of
these.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The shell has a large number of options for changing its
behaviour. These cover all aspects of the shell; browsing
the full documentation is the only good way to become <br>
acquainted with the many possibilities. See
zshoptions(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATTERN MATCHING <br>
The shell has a rich set of patterns which are available for
file matching (described in the documentation as
&lsquo;filename generation&rsquo; and also known for
historical reasons as <br>
&lsquo;globbing&rsquo;) and for use when programming. These
are described in the section &lsquo;Filename
Generation&rsquo; in zshexpn(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of particular interest are the
following patterns that are not commonly supported by other
systems of pattern matching:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">** for matching over multiple
directories</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~, ^ the ability to exclude
patterns from matching when the EXTENDED_GLOB option is
set</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(...) glob qualifiers, included
in parentheses at the end of the pattern, which select files
by type (such as directories) or attribute (such as
size).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL COMMENTS ON SYNTAX <br>
Although the syntax of zsh is in ways similar to the Korn
shell, and therefore more remotely to the original UNIX
shell, the Bourne shell, its default behaviour does not
entirely <br>
correspond to those shells. General shell syntax is
introduced in the section &lsquo;Shell Grammar&rsquo; in
zshmisc(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One commonly encountered
difference is that variables substituted onto the command
line are not split into words. See the description of the
shell option SH_WORD_SPLIT in the <br>
section &lsquo;Parameter Expansion&rsquo; in zshexpn(1). In
zsh, you can either explicitly request the splitting (e.g.
${=foo}) or use an array when you want a variable to expand
to more <br>
than one word. See the section &lsquo;Array
Parameters&rsquo; in zshparam(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROGRAMMING <br>
The most convenient way of adding enhancements to the shell
is typically by writing a shell function and arranging for
it to be autoloaded. Functions are described in the
sec&acirc; <br>
tion &lsquo;Functions&rsquo; in zshmisc(1). Users changing
from the C shell and its relatives should notice that
aliases are less used in zsh as they don&rsquo;t perform
argument substitution, <br>
only simple text replacement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A few general functions, other
than those for the line editor described above, are provided
with the shell and are described in zshcontrib(1). Features
include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">promptinit <br>
a prompt theme system for changing prompts easily, see the
section &lsquo;Prompt Themes&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zsh-mime-setup <br>
a MIME-handling system which dispatches commands according
to the suffix of a file as done by graphical file
managers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zcalc a calculator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zargs a version of xargs that
makes the find command redundant</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zmv a command for renaming files
by means of shell patterns.</p>
