<p>LOCKMAIL(1) Double Precision, Inc. LOCKMAIL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lockmail - create mail lock files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lockmail [-r] [-t timeout] {lockfile} {program}
[argument...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
lockmail is a helper utility for working with mailbox files.
Mailbox files must be locked to prevent other applications
from modifying the mailbox at the same time. Different <br>
system use different locking conventions. lockmail uses two
of the most common locking mechanisms in use, which should
work reliably on most systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lockfile is the pathname to an
existing mailbox file. By default, lockmail tries to lock
the mailbox every five seconds (if the mailbox is already
locked), and will give up after <br>
three minutes. After the mailbox is successfully locked,
lockmail runs program as a child process, with any optional
arguments. When program terminates, lockmail removes the
<br>
mailbox lock, and terminates itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-r <br>
If a regular lock fails, try a read-only lock. Use this
option to lock mailbox files in a read-only directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t timeout <br>
If the lock attempt fails, try again for up to timeout
seconds. The actual timeout is rounded up to the next five
second interval (a lock attempt is tried every five <br>
seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This section briefly describes the locking mechanism used by
lockmail. lockmail uses three different locking conventions
in order to maximize compatibility with other mail <br>
software: C-Client folder locks, dot-locks, and file
locks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-Client folder locks <br>
Mail software based on the C-Client library creates lock
files named /tmp/.dddddd.iiiiii. Here, dddddd and iiiiii are
the device number and the inode number of the mailbox file
<br>
(the st_dev and st_ino fields in the inode), in hexadecimal.
If the process ID saved in the C-Client folder lock file is
not valid, lockmail concludes that it&rsquo;s a stale lock
<br>
file, and will remove it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
A race condition exists where a C-Client process is killed
after it creates a lock file, but before saving its process
ID in the lock file. The race window is very small, but <br>
it exists. The C-Client library does not appear to ever
clear out the lock file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lockmail attempts to resolve
this race condition by deleting zero-length lock files that
are at least five minutes old.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dot-locks <br>
lockmail also creates, and honors dot-lock files. Dot-lock
files are first created as temporary files, then linked to
lockfile.lock. The link operation fails if the dot-lock file
<br>
already exists. lockmail uses an enhanced method of
dot-locking, where its process ID, and the name of the
server where lockmail is running is also saved in its
dot-lock file. <br>
If the operation fails due to an existing dot-lock file that
was created by another lockmail process on the same server,
and the process ID no longer exists, this stale dot-lock
<br>
file is removed immediately. In all other situations a
dot-lock file older than five minutes is considered stale,
and removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
A failure to create a dot-lock file is silently ignored if
the reason for the failure is because lockmail does not have
the write permission in the dot-lock file&rsquo;s directory.
<br>
The incoming mail spool directory (usually /var/mail)
typically does not have global write permissions, so the
attempt to create the dot-lock file in the spool directory
will <br>
fail, and lockmail will be content with using file-locking
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File locks <br>
The final locking mechanism lockmail uses is the operating
system&rsquo;s file locking facility. If lockmail fails to
obtain all three locks, lockmail will sleep for five seconds
and <br>
try again. The only exception is a failure to create a
dot-lock because of no write access to the dot-lock
file&rsquo;s directory, which is ignored. If lockmail still
fails to obtain <br>
all required locks in the amount of time specified by the -t
option (or its default value), lockmail will terminate with
the EX_TEMPFAIL exit code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lockmail runs program after
obtaining the last file lock, waits until program
terminates, and releases all locks. program must terminate
before any of the locks obtained by <br>
lockmail expire, and are considered stale. lockmail will
then terminate with the same exit code as program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
lockmail terminates with the same exit status as
programlockmail terminates with the EX_TEMPFAIL exit status
if it was unable to obtain a lock, or if program was killed
by a <br>
signal.</p>
