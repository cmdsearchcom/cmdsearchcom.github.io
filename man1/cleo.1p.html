<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cleo - Play back shell commands for live demonstrations</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cleo COMMAND_FILE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
&quot;cleo&quot; is a utility for playing back pre-recorded
shell commands in a live demonstration. &quot;cleo&quot;
displays the commands as if you had actually typed them and
then executes them <br>
interactively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is probably an easy way to
do this with &quot;expect&quot; or a similar tool. But I
couldn&rsquo;t figure it out, so I built this. Your mileage
may vary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLAYBACK <br>
&quot;cleo&quot; always pauses and waits for a keypress
before displaying a command and before executing it.
Pressing any key besides those listed below will advance the
playback:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key Action <br>

------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
s skip the current command <br>
r redo the current command <br>
p redo the previous command <br>
q quit playback</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
&quot;cleo&quot; reads commands from a file. Each line is
treated as one command. Blank lines and those starting with
&quot;#&quot; will be ignored. The commands themselves can
be anything that <br>
you would type into an interactive shell. You can also add a
few special tokens that &quot;cleo&quot; recognizes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;!!!&quot; <br>
Commands starting with &quot;!!!&quot; (three exclamation
points) are not displayed and will be executed immediately.
This is useful for running setup commands at the beginning
of your <br>
demonstration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%%%&quot; <br>
Within a command, &quot;%%%&quot; (three percent signs) will
cause &quot;cleo&quot; to pause and wait for a keypress
before displaying the rest of the command. This is useful if
you want to <br>
stop in the middle of a command to give some
explanation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, &quot;cleo&quot;
displays and executes the commands verbatim. Note that some
interactive commands like &quot;vim&quot; are picky about
STDOUT and STDIN. To make them work properly with <br>
&quot;cleo&quot;, you may need to force them to attach to
the terminal like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(exec &lt; /dev/tty vim)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
I use this for giving demonstrations of pinto, such as the
one seen at
&lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-JkFXm8Xgk&gt; (the
live demonstration part starts around 10:47).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command file that I use for
that presentation is included inside this distribution at
examples/pinto.demo. This file is for illustration only, so
don&rsquo;t expect it to actually <br>
work for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
&quot;cleo&quot; only works on Unix-like platforms. It may
work on Windows if you use Cygwin. Personally, I have only
used &quot;cleo&quot; on Mac OS X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TODO <br>
Jump to arbitrary command number <br>
Support backspacing in recorded command <br>
Support multi-line recorded commands <br>
Write unit tests</p>
