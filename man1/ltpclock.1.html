<p>LTPCLOCK(1) LTP executables LTPCLOCK(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ltpclock - LTP daemon task for managing scheduled events</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ltpclock</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ltpclock is a background &quot;daemon&quot; task that
periodically performs scheduled LTP activities. It is
spawned automatically by ltpadmin in response to the
&rsquo;s&rsquo; command that starts <br>
operation of the LTP protocol, and it is terminated by
ltpadmin in response to an &rsquo;x&rsquo; (STOP)
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once per second, ltpclock takes
the following action:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First it manages the current
state of all links (&quot;spans&quot;). In particular, it
checks the age of the currently buffered session block for
each span and, if that age exceeds <br>
the span&rsquo;s configured aggregation time limit, gives
the &quot;buffer full&quot; semaphore for that span to
initiate block segmentation and transmission by
ltpmeter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In so doing, it also infers link
state changes (&quot;link cues&quot;) from data rate changes
as noted in the RFX database by rfxclock:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the rate of transmission to a
neighbor was zero but is now non-zero, then transmission to
that neighbor is unblocked. The applicable &quot;buffer
empty&quot; semaphore is given <br>
if no outbound block is being constructed (enabling start of
a new transmission session) and the &quot;segments
ready&quot; semaphore is given if the outbound segment queue
is non- <br>
empty (enabling transmission of segments by the link service
output task).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the rate of transmission to a
neighbor was non-zero but is now zero, then transmission to
that neighbor is blocked -- i.e., the semaphores triggering
transmission will <br>
no longer be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the imputed rate of
transmission from a neighbor was non-zero but is now zero,
then all timers affecting segment retransmission to that
neighbor are suspended. This <br>
has the effect of extending the interval of each affected
timer by the length of time that the timers remain
suspended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the imputed rate of
transmission from a neighbor was zero but is now non-zero,
then all timers affecting segment retransmission to that
neighbor are resumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then ltpclock retransmits all
unacknowledged checkpoint segments, report segments, and
cancellation segments whose computed timeout intervals have
expired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
&quot;0&quot; ltpclock terminated, for reasons noted in the
ion.log file. If this termination was not commanded,
investigate and solve the problem identified in the log file
and use <br>
ltpadmin to restart ltpclock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;1&quot; ltpclock was
unable to attach to LTP protocol operations, probably
because ltpadmin has not yet been run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
No configuration files are needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
No environment variables apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The following diagnostics may be issued to the ion.log log
file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ltpclock can&rsquo;t initialize
LTP. <br>
ltpadmin has not yet initialized LTP protocol
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t dispatch events.
<br>
An unrecoverable database error was encountered. ltpclock
terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t manage links. <br>
An unrecoverable database error was encountered. ltpclock
terminates.</p>
