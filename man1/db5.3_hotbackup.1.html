<p>DB5.3_HOTBACKUP(1) General Commands Manual
DB5.3_HOTBACKUP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
db5.3_hotbackup - Create &quot;hot backup&quot; or &quot;hot
failover&quot; snapshots</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
db5.3_hotbackup [-cDuVv] [-d data_dir ...] [-h home] [-l
log_dir] [-P password] -b backup_dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The db5.3_hotbackup utility creates &quot;hot backup&quot;
or &quot;hot failover&quot; snapshots of Berkeley DB
database environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_hotbackup utility
performs the following steps:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If the -c option is
specified, checkpoint the source home database environment,
and remove any unnecessary log files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If the target directory for
the backup does not exist, it is created with mode
read-write-execute for the owner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the target directory for the
backup does exist and the -u option was specified, all log
files in the target directory are removed; if the -u option
was not spec&acirc; <br>
ified, all files in the target directory are removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If the -u option was not
specified, copy application-specific files found in the
database environment home directory, or any directory
specified using the -d <br>
option, into the target directory for the backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Copy all log files found in
the directory specified by the -l option (or in the database
environment home directory, if no -l option was specified),
into the target <br>
directory for the backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Perform catastrophic recovery
on the hot backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Remove any unnecessary log
files from the hot backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_hotbackup utility does
not resolve pending transactions that are in the prepared
state. Applications that use DB_TXN-&gt;prepare should
specify DB_RECOVER_FATAL when open&acirc; <br>
ing the environment, and run DB_ENV-&gt;txn_recover to
resolve any pending transactions, when failing over to the
hot backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b Specify the target directory for the backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Before performing the
snapshot, checkpoint the source database environment and
remove any log files that are no longer required in that
environment. To avoid making cata&acirc; <br>
strophic failure impossible, log file removal must be
integrated with log file archival.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Specify one or more source
directories that contain databases; if none is specified,
the database environment home directory will be searched for
database files. As data&acirc; <br>
base files are copied into a single backup directory, files
named the same, stored in different source directories,
could overwrite each other when copied into the backup <br>
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Specify the source directory
for the backup, that is, the database environment home
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Specify a source directory
that contains log files; if none is specified, the database
environment home directory will be searched for log
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Specify an environment
password. Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite password
strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a window
of vulnerability on systems <br>
where unprivileged users can see command-line arguments or
where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
containing the command-line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Update a pre-existing hot
backup snapshot by copying in new log files. If the -u
option is specified, no databases will be copied into the
target directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Write the library version
number to the standard output, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Run in verbose mode, listing
operations as they are done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Use the data directories
listed in the DB_CONFIG configuration file in the source
directory. This option has three effects: First, if they do
not already exist, the <br>
specified data directories will be created relative to the
target directory (with mode read-write-execute owner).
Second, all files in the source data directories will be
<br>
copied to the target data directories. If the DB_CONFIG file
specifies one or more absolute pathnames, files in those
source directories will be copied to the top-level <br>
target directory. Third, the DB_CONFIG configuration file
will be copied from the +source directory to the target
directory, and subsequently used for configuration if <br>
recovery is run in the target directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Care should be taken with the -D
option and data directories which are named relative to the
source directory but are not subdirectories (that is, the
name includes the element <br>
&quot;..&quot;) Specifically, the constructed target
directory names must be meaningful and distinct from the
source directory names, otherwise running recovery in the
target directory <br>
might corrupt the source data files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is an error to use absolute
pathnames for data directories or the log directory in this
mode, as the DB_CONFIG configuration file copied into the
target directory would then <br>
point at the source directories and running recovery would
corrupt the source data files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_hotbackup utility uses
a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the -h option,
the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the utility was
run in a directory con&acirc; <br>
taining a Berkeley DB environment). In order to avoid
environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment,
db5.3_hotbackup should always be given the chance to detach
<br>
from the environment and exit gracefully. To cause
db5.3_hotbackup to release all environment resources and
exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_hotbackup utility
exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DB_HOME <br>
If the -h option is not specified and the environment
variable DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the
database home, as described in DB_ENV-&gt;open.</p>
