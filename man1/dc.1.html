<p>dc(1) General Commands Manual dc(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dc - an arbitrary precision calculator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dc [-V] [--version] [-h] [--help] <br>
[-e scriptexpression] [--expression=scriptexpression] <br>
[-f scriptfile] [--file=scriptfile] <br>
[file ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dc is a reverse-polish desk calculator which supports
unlimited precision arithmetic. It also allows you to define
and call macros. Normally dc reads from the standard input;
<br>
if any command arguments are given to it, they are
filenames, and dc reads and executes the contents of the
files before reading from standard input. All normal output
is to <br>
standard output; all error output is to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A reverse-polish calculator
stores numbers on a stack. Entering a number pushes it on
the stack. Arithmetic operations pop arguments off the stack
and push the results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To enter a number in dc, type
the digits (using upper case letters A through F as
&quot;digits&quot; when working with input bases greater
than ten), with an optional decimal point. Expo&acirc; <br>
nential notation is not supported. To enter a negative
number, begin the number with &lsquo;&lsquo;_&rsquo;&rsquo;.
&lsquo;&lsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo; cannot be used for this, as it
is a binary operator for subtraction instead. <br>
To enter two numbers in succession, separate them with
spaces or newlines. These have no meaning as commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
dc may be invoked with the following command-line
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print out the version of dc that is being run and a
copyright notice, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Print a usage message
briefly summarizing these command-line options and the
bug-reporting address, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e script</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--expression=script <br>
Add the commands in script to the set of commands to be run
while processing the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f script-file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--file=script-file <br>
Add the commands contained in the file script-file to the
set of commands to be run while processing the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any command-line parameters
remain after processing the above, these parameters are
interpreted as the names of input files to be processed. A
file name of - refers to the <br>
standard input stream. The standard input will processed if
no script files or expressions are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Printing Commands <br>
p Prints the value on the top of the stack, without altering
the stack. A newline is printed after the value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Prints the value on the top of
the stack, popping it off, and does not print a newline
after.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P Pops off the value on top of
the stack. If it it a string, it is simply printed without a
trailing newline. Otherwise it is a number, and the integer
portion of its <br>
absolute value is printed out as a &quot;base
(UCHAR_MAX+1)&quot; byte stream. Assuming that (UCHAR_MAX+1)
is 256 (as it is on most machines with 8-bit bytes), the
sequence <br>
KSK0k1/_1Ss [ls*]Sxd0&gt;x
[256~Ssd0&lt;x]dsxxsx[q]Sq[Lsd0&gt;qaPlxx]
dsxxsx0sqLqsxLxLK+k could also accomplish this function.
(Much of the complexity of the above native-dc code <br>
is due to the ~ computing the characters backwards, and the
desire to ensure that all registers wind up back in their
original states.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f Prints the entire contents of
the stack without altering anything. This is a good command
to use if you are lost or want to figure out what the effect
of some command has <br>
been.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arithmetic <br>
+ Pops two values off the stack, adds them, and pushes the
result. The precision of the result is determined only by
the values of the arguments, and is enough to be exact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Pops two values, subtracts the
first one popped from the second one popped, and pushes the
result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Pops two values, multiplies
them, and pushes the result. The number of fraction digits
in the result depends on the current precision value and the
number of fraction <br>
digits in the two arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/ Pops two values, divides the
second one popped from the first one popped, and pushes the
result. The number of fraction digits is specified by the
precision value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% Pops two values, computes the
remainder of the division that the / command would do, and
pushes that. The value computed is the same as that computed
by the sequence Sd <br>
dld/ Ld*- .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~ Pops two values, divides the
second one popped from the first one popped. The quotient is
pushed first, and the remainder is pushed next. The number
of fraction digits <br>
used in the division is specified by the precision value.
(The sequence SdSn lnld/ LnLd% could also accomplish this
function, with slightly different error checking.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^ Pops two values and
exponentiates, using the first value popped as the exponent
and the second popped as the base. The fraction part of the
exponent is ignored. The pre&acirc; <br>
cision value specifies the number of fraction digits in the
result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">| Pops three values and computes
a modular exponentiation. The first value popped is used as
the reduction modulus; this value must be a non-zero number,
and should be an <br>
integer. The second popped is used as the exponent; this
value must be a non-negative number, and any fractional part
of this exponent will be ignored. The third value <br>
popped is the base which gets exponentiated, which should be
an integer. For small integers this is like the sequence
Sm^Lm%, but, unlike ^, this command will work with <br>
arbitrarily large exponents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v Pops one value, computes its
square root, and pushes that. The precision value specifies
the number of fraction digits in the result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most arithmetic operations are
affected by the &lsquo;&lsquo;precision value&rsquo;&rsquo;,
which you can set with the k command. The default precision
value is zero, which means that all arithmetic <br>
except for addition and subtraction produces integer
results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stack Control <br>
c Clears the stack, rendering it empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Duplicates the value on the
top of the stack, pushing another copy of it. Thus,
&lsquo;&lsquo;4d*p&rsquo;&rsquo; computes 4 squared and
prints it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Reverses the order of (swaps)
the top two values on the stack. (This can also be
accomplished with the sequence SaSbLaLb.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Registers <br>
dc provides at least 256 memory registers, each named by a
single character. You can store a number or a string in a
register and retrieve it later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sr Pop the value off the top of
the stack and store it into register r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lr Copy the value in register r
and push it onto the stack. This does not alter the contents
of r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each register also contains its
own stack. The current register value is the top of the
register&rsquo;s stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sr Pop the value off the top of
the (main) stack and push it onto the stack of register r.
The previous value of the register becomes inaccessible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lr Pop the value off the top of
register r&rsquo;s stack and push it onto the main stack.
The previous value in register r&rsquo;s stack, if any, is
now accessible via the lr command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parameters <br>
dc has three parameters that control its operation: the
precision, the input radix, and the output radix. The
precision specifies the number of fraction digits to keep in
the <br>
result of most arithmetic operations. The input radix
controls the interpretation of numbers typed in; all numbers
typed in use this radix. The output radix is used for
print&acirc; <br>
ing numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The input and output radices are
separate parameters; you can make them unequal, which can be
useful or confusing. The input radix must be between 2 and
16 inclusive. The out&acirc; <br>
put radix must be at least 2. The precision must be zero or
greater. The precision is always measured in decimal digits,
regardless of the current input or output radix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i Pops the value off the top of
the stack and uses it to set the input radix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Pops the value off the top of
the stack and uses it to set the output radix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">k Pops the value off the top of
the stack and uses it to set the precision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I Pushes the current input radix
on the stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">O Pushes the current output
radix on the stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">K Pushes the current precision
on the stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Strings <br>
dc has a limited ability to operate on strings as well as on
numbers; the only things you can do with strings are print
them and execute them as macros (which means that the
con&acirc; <br>
tents of the string are processed as dc commands). All
registers and the stack can hold strings, and dc always
knows whether any given object is a string or a number. Some
com&acirc; <br>
mands such as arithmetic operations demand numbers as
arguments and print errors if given strings. Other commands
can accept either a number or a string; for example, the p
com&acirc; <br>
mand can accept either and prints the object according to
its type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[characters] <br>
Makes a string containing characters (contained between
balanced [ and ] characters), and pushes it on the stack.
For example, [foo]P prints the characters foo (with no <br>
newline).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a The top-of-stack is popped. If
it was a number, then the low-order byte of this number is
converted into a string and pushed onto the stack. Otherwise
the top-of-stack <br>
was a string, and the first character of that string is
pushed back.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x Pops a value off the stack and
executes it as a macro. Normally it should be a string; if
it is a number, it is simply pushed back onto the stack. For
example, [1p]x <br>
executes the macro 1p which pushes 1 on the stack and prints
1 on a separate line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Macros are most often stored in
registers; [1p]sa stores a macro to print 1 into register a,
and lax invokes this macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;r Pops two values off the
stack and compares them assuming they are numbers, executing
the contents of register r as a macro if the original
top-of-stack is greater. Thus, <br>
1 2&gt;a will invoke register a&rsquo;s contents and 2
1&gt;a will not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!&gt;r Similar but invokes the
macro if the original top-of-stack is not greater than (less
than or equal to) what was the second-to-top.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;r Similar but invokes the
macro if the original top-of-stack is less.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!&lt;r Similar but invokes the
macro if the original top-of-stack is not less than (greater
than or equal to) what was the second-to-top.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=r Similar but invokes the macro
if the two numbers popped are equal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!=r Similar but invokes the
macro if the two numbers popped are not equal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Reads a line from the terminal
and executes it. This command allows a macro to request
input from the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q exits from a macro and also
from the macro which invoked it. If called from the top
level, or from a macro which was called directly from the
top level, the q command <br>
will cause dc to exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q Pops a value off the stack and
uses it as a count of levels of macro execution to be
exited. Thus, 3Q exits three levels. The Q command will
never cause dc to exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Status Inquiry <br>
Z Pops a value off the stack, calculates the number of
digits it has (or number of characters, if it is a string)
and pushes that number. The digit count for a number does
<br>
not include any leading zeros, even if those appear to the
right of the radix point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X Pops a value off the stack,
calculates the number of fraction digits it has, and pushes
that number. For a string, the value pushed is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">z Pushes the current stack
depth: the number of objects on the stack before the
execution of the z command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous <br>
! Will run the rest of the line as a system command. Note
that parsing of the !&lt;, !=, and !&gt; commands take
precedence, so if you want to run a command starting with
&lt;, =, <br>
or &gt; you will need to add a space after the !.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Will interpret the rest of the
line as a comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:r Will pop the top two values
off of the stack. The old second-to-top value will be stored
in the array r, indexed by the old top-of-stack value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">;r Pops the top-of-stack and
uses it as an index into the array r. The selected value is
then pushed onto the stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that each stacked instance
of a register has its own array associated with it. Thus 1
0:a 0Sa 2 0:a La 0;ap will print 1, because the 2 was stored
in an instance of 0:a <br>
that was later popped.</p>
