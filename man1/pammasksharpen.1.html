<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pammasksharpen - Sharpen an image via an unsharp mask</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pammasksharpen [-sharpness=realnum] [-threshold=realnum]
maskfile [inputfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options can be abbreviated
to their shortest unique prefix. You may use two hyphens
instead of one. You may separate an option name and its
value with white space instead <br>
of an equals sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>

pnmconvol -nooffset gauss.pgm myimage.ppm &gt;blurred.ppm
<br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pammasksharpen reads a Netpbm
image as input and produces a sharpened version of it, in
the same format, as output. It does this via an unsharp
mask, which you supply as another <br>
Netpbm image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An unsharp mask is generally a
blurred version of the original image. The sharpening
computation is this: Calculate the &rsquo;edgeness&rsquo; of
a sample in the input image as the signed <br>
difference between the sample value and the corresponding
sample in the unsharp mask. This tells how different the
pixel is from its neighbors. Add a multiple of the edgeness
<br>
to the original sample to get the corresponding output
sample. Clip as necessary. This causes pixels that are
brighter than their neighbors to get even brighter, while
pixels <br>
that are dimmer than their neighbors get even dimmer. This
makes edges -- places where pixel values change quickly in
space -- stand out more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The unsharp mask must be the
same dimensions and have the same maxval as the input
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Unsharp Mask <br>
You usually create the unsharp mask as a Gaussian blur of
the original image, which you can do using pamgauss and
pnmconvol as in the example above. The convolution kernel
you <br>
use with pnmconvol is normally a square with side length an
odd number of pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you create an unsharp mask
like this, you will have to choose the side length of the
convolution kernel. That length implements the parameter of
unsharp mask sharpening <br>
usually known as &rsquo;radius.&rsquo; In particular, a
radius of R pixels corresponds to a convolution kernel 2R+1
pixels on a side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Radius is a very important
parameter; you can ruin an image with a radius too large.
You can safely use the highest radius with an inanimate
object, while a human face demands <br>
the least. Landscapes fall in between. But it really depends
on the size of the details. Fine detail needs a smaller
radius, or else you may obliterate tiny detail of the same
<br>
size as the Radius width. A large image often has larger
detail (more pixels involved), so can use a larger radius.
Radius and sharpness (see -sharpness option) interact: <br>
reducing one allows you to increase the other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-sharpness=realnum <br>
This specifies the magnitude of the sharpening. It is the
multiple of edgeness that gets added to each sample as
described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">realnum is a nonnegative real
decimal number. Zero means no sharpening at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This parameter is known as
&rsquo;amount&rsquo; in ImageMagick.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is 1.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.30 (October 2005). Before that, the sharpness was always
1.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-threshold=realnum <br>
This minimum amount of edgeness that will be considered
edgeness at all. i.e. if the magnitude of the edgeness is
less than this, pammasksharpen will treat the edgeness <br>
as zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A nonzero value may be necessary
here to avoid speckling in smooth areas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a fraction of the maxval
(so it is in the range [0, 1.0]).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.34 (June 2006).</p>
