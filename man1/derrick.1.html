<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
derrick -- a simple network stream recorder</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
derrick [-mvVh] [-i interface] [-r file] [-f expression] [-l
file] [-b bytes] [-t lines]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
derrick is a simple tool for recording data streams of TCP
and UDP traffic. It shares similarities with other network
recorders, such as tcpflow and wireshark, where it is more
<br>
advanced than the first and clearly inferior to the
latter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">derrick has been specifically
designed to monitor application-layer communication. In
contrast to other tools the application data is logged in a
line-based text format. Common <br>
UNIX tools, such as grep, sed &amp; awk, can be directly
applied. Even replay of recorded communication is straight
forward using netcat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">derrick supports on-the-fly
compression and rotation of log files. Payloads of TCP
sessions are re-assembled using libnids and can be merged or
truncated. UDP payloads are <br>
logged as-is. Details of lower network layers are
omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FORMAT <br>
derrick outputs the monitored network traffic in a
line-based text format, where each line corresponds to one
recorded TCP or UDP payload. Note that TCP payloads are
re-assembled <br>
and thus not necessary match the corresponding TCP
datagrams.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each line of the output has the
following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;TIME&gt; &lt;FLAG&gt;
&lt;SRC&gt; &lt;DST&gt; &lt;PAYLOAD&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The different fields of the
output are defined as follows</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;TIME&gt; This field
specifies the time at which the payload has been monitored.
The time is given as standard UNIX time and encoded as a
floating-point number of seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;FLAG&gt; This field
indicates the type of payload that has been recorded. U
refers to a UDP payload and T refers to a TCP payload.
Additionally, the beginning and end of TCP <br>
streams are marked by T+ and T-, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;SRC&gt; This field specifies
the source of the payload. It is a tuple of an IP address
and a port number in form of IP:PORT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;DST&gt; This field specifies
the destination of the payload. It is a tuple of an IP
address and a port number in form of IP:PORT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;PAYLOAD&gt; The last field
is the monitored payload. Non-printable characters are
escaped using standard URI encoding. Each non-printable
characters is replaced by %XX where XX is <br>
the character&rsquo;s hexadecimal ASCII number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example output of derrick
looks as follows</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">05.80 T 10.100.163.103:58445
91.198.174.233:80 GET /index.html ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The line shows a TCP payload
recorded at time 05.80, that is, 5.8 seconds after new
year&rsquo;s eve of 1970 ;). The payload is directed to port
80 (HTTP) and shows the beginning of a <br>
typical HTTP GET request. Note that whitespaces are not
escaped in the payload and thus each line may seemingly have
more than 5 fields. However, starting from the 5th field all
<br>
following white-spaces are part of the payload.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
derrick supports the following command-line options which
can be used to control the recording of network traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i interface Record network
traffic from this interface. On Linux systems with 2.2 or
later kernels, an interface argument of &quot;any&quot; can
be used to capture packets from all <br>
interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r file Read network traffic
from a dump file in pcap format. Dump files can be created
using tcpdump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f expression Filter network
traffic using a filter expression. Only packets that match
the expression will be recorded. Consult the man page of
tcpdump for a description of <br>
filter expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l file Write output to a
compressed log file instead of stdout. This option can be
used when derrick runs in the background. The log file will
be rotated if a certain <br>
number of lines have been logged, see -t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b bytes Record only the first
bytes of each TCP stream. The number of bytes is computed
from incoming and outgoing TCP payloads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Merge consecutive TCP
payloads in the same direction. This options comes handy if
protocol messages are split over multiple TCP payloads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t lines Rotate the log file
after the given number of lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Increase the verbosity of
derrick during recording.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print a brief help
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print a version and copyright
string.</p>
