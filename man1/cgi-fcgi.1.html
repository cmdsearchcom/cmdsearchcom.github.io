<p>cgi-fcgi(1) General Commands Manual cgi-fcgi(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cgi-fcgi - bridge from CGI to FastCGI</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cgi-fcgi -f cmdPath <br>
cgi-fcgi -bind -connect connName <br>
cgi-fcgi -start -connect connName appPath [nServers] <br>
cgi-fcgi -connect connName appPath [nServers]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cgi-fcgi is a CGI/1.1 program that communicates with an
already-running FastCGI application in order to respond to
an HTTP request. cgi-fcgi is also capable of starting a <br>
FastCGI application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you invoke cgi-fcgi as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cgi-fcgi -f cmdPath</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then cgi-fcgi opens the file at
cmdPath and reads its arguments from that file. cgi-fcgi
will skip lines that begin with the comment character #. The
first non-comment line <br>
should contain valid arguments in one of the other three
forms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -f form of cgi-fcgi is
designed for Unix systems whose exec(2) family of system
calls supports the execution of command interpreter files.
For instance, if a file with exe&acirc; <br>
cute permission contains the text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#! /bin/cgi-fcgi -f <br>
-connect /httpd/root/sock/app /httpd/root/bin/app</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the effect is the same as
executing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/bin/cgi-fcgi -connect
/httpd/root/sock/app /httpd/root/bin/app</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you invoke cgi-fcgi as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cgi-fcgi -bind -connect
connName</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the connName argument is either
the path name of a Unix domain listening socket or a
host:port pair. If connName contains a colon, it is assumed
to be host:port. cgi-fcgi per&acirc; <br>
forms a connect(2) using connName. If the connect succeeds,
cgi-fcgi forwards the CGI environment variables and stdin
data to the FastCGI application, and forwards the stdout
<br>
and stderr data from the application to cgi-fcgi&rsquo;s
stdout (most likely connected to a Web server). When the
FastCGI application signals the end of its response,
cgi-fcgi flushes <br>
its buffers and exits, and the Web server completes the http
response.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you invoke cgi-fcgi as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cgi-fcgi -start -connect
connName appPath [nServers]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then cgi-fcgi performs the
function of starting one or more FastCGI application
processes. The connName argument specifies either the path
name of the Unix domain listening <br>
socket that cgi-fcgi will create, or is
&quot;localhost:NNN&quot; where NNN is the port number of
the TCP/IP listening socket that cgi-fcgi will create on the
local machine. (cgi-fcgi <br>
will not create processes on remote machines.) After
cgi-fcgi creates the listening socket, it forks nServers
copies of a process running the executable file appPath. If
<br>
nServers is omitted, the effect is as if the value
&quot;1&quot; had been specified. The processes share the
single listening socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you invoke cgi-fcgi as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cgi-fcgi -connect connName
appPath [nServers]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cgi-fcgi performs -bind and
then, if necssary, performs -start and repeats the -bind.
That is, cgi-fcgi first operates as if the command had
been</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cgi-fcgi -bind -connect
connName</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the connect fails, cgi-fcgi
tries</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cgi-fcgi -start -connect
connName appPath [nServers]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and finally retries</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cgi-fcgi -bind -connect
connName</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this form, cgi-fcgi does not
support TCP/IP connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The usual CGI ones, but they are not interpreted by
cgi-fcgi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
FGCI_accept(3). <br>
(in Debian, /usr/share/doc/libfcgi?/*)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
cgi-fcgi doesn&rsquo;t generate useful HTTP responses in
case of error, and it generates no response at all when run
as start-fcgi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Digital UNIX 3.0 systems the
implementation of Unix Domain sockets does not work when
such sockets are stored on NFS file systems. Symptom:
cgi-fcgi may core dump or may exit <br>
with status 38. Work-around: store sockets in local file
systems (/tmp often works) or use TCP/IP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On AIX systems the
implementation of listening sockets does not support socket
sharing, and the standard FastCGI application libraries
can&rsquo;t synchronize access to AIX listening <br>
sockets. Work-around: Don&rsquo;t use the nServers argument
on AIX.</p>
