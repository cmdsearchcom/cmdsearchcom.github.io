cgi-fcgi is a CGI/1.1 program that communicates with an already-running FastCGI
  application in order to respond to an HTTP request. cgi-fcgi is also capable
  of starting a FastCGI application.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you invoke cgi-fcgi as
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>cgi-fcgi</b> -f cmdPath</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
then cgi-fcgi opens the file at cmdPath and reads its arguments from that file.
  cgi-fcgi will skip lines that begin with the comment character #. The first
  non-comment line should contain valid arguments in one of the other three
  forms.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The -f form of cgi-fcgi is designed for Unix systems whose exec(2) family of
  system calls supports the execution of command interpreter files. For
  instance, if a file with execute permission contains the text
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">#! /bin/cgi-fcgi -f
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    -connect /httpd/root/sock/app /httpd/root/bin/app</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
the effect is the same as executing
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">/usr/bin/cgi-fcgi -connect /httpd/root/sock/app
      /httpd/root/bin/app</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you invoke cgi-fcgi as
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">cgi-fcgi -bind -connect connName</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
the connName argument is either the path name of a Unix domain listening socket
  or a host:port pair. If connName contains a colon, it is assumed to be
  host:port. cgi-fcgi performs a connect(2) using connName. If the connect
  succeeds, cgi-fcgi forwards the CGI environment variables and stdin data to
  the FastCGI application, and forwards the stdout and stderr data from the
  application to cgi-fcgi's stdout (most likely connected to a Web server). When
  the FastCGI application signals the end of its response, cgi-fcgi flushes its
  buffers and exits, and the Web server completes the http response.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you invoke cgi-fcgi as
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">cgi-fcgi -start -connect connName appPath [nServers]</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
then cgi-fcgi performs the function of starting one or more FastCGI application
  processes. The connName argument specifies either the path name of the Unix
  domain listening socket that cgi-fcgi will create, or is
  &quot;localhost:NNN&quot; where NNN is the port number of the TCP/IP listening
  socket that cgi-fcgi will create on the local machine. (cgi-fcgi will not
  create processes on remote machines.) After cgi-fcgi creates the listening
  socket, it forks nServers copies of a process running the executable file
  appPath. If nServers is omitted, the effect is as if the value &quot;1&quot;
  had been specified. The processes share the single listening socket.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you invoke cgi-fcgi as
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">cgi-fcgi -connect connName appPath [nServers]</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
cgi-fcgi performs -bind and then, if necssary, performs -start and repeats the
  -bind. That is, cgi-fcgi first operates as if the command had been
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">cgi-fcgi -bind -connect connName</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the connect fails, cgi-fcgi tries
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">cgi-fcgi -start -connect connName appPath [nServers]</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and finally retries
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">cgi-fcgi -bind -connect connName</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In this form, cgi-fcgi does not support TCP/IP connections.

cgi-fcgi doesn't generate useful HTTP responses in case of error, and it
  generates no response at all when run as start-fcgi.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On Digital UNIX 3.0 systems the implementation of Unix Domain sockets does not
  work when such sockets are stored on NFS file systems. Symptom: cgi-fcgi may
  core dump or may exit with status 38. Work-around: store sockets in local file
  systems (/tmp often works) or use TCP/IP.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On AIX systems the implementation of listening sockets does not support socket
  sharing, and the standard FastCGI application libraries can't synchronize
  access to AIX listening sockets. Work-around: Don't use the nServers argument
  on AIX.
