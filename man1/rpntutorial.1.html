rpntutorial - Reading RRDtool RPN Expressions by Steve Rader
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This tutorial should help you get to grips with RRDtool RPN expressions as seen
  in CDEF arguments of RRDtool graph.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Reading_Comparison_Operators"><a class="selflink" href="#Reading_Comparison_Operators">Reading
  Comparison Operators</a></h1>
The LT, LE, GT, GE and EQ RPN logic operators are not as tricky as they appear.
  These operators act on the two values on the stack preceding them (to the
  left). Read these two values on the stack from left to right inserting the
  operator in the middle. If the resulting statement is true, then replace the
  three values from the stack with &quot;1&quot;. If the statement if false,
  replace the three values with &quot;0&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, think about &quot;2,1,GT&quot;. This RPN expression could be read
  as &quot;is two greater than one?&quot; The answer to that question is
  &quot;true&quot;. So the three values should be replaced with &quot;1&quot;.
  Thus the RPN expression 2,1,GT evaluates to 1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now consider &quot;2,1,LE&quot;. This RPN expression could be read as &quot;is
  two less than or equal to one?&quot;. The natural response is &quot;no&quot;
  and thus the RPN expression 2,1,LE evaluates to 0.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Reading_the_IF_Operator"><a class="selflink" href="#Reading_the_IF_Operator">Reading
  the IF Operator</a></h1>
The IF RPN logic operator can be straightforward also. The key to reading IF
  operators is to understand that the condition part of the traditional &quot;if
  X than Y else Z&quot; notation has *already* been evaluated. So the IF
  operator acts on only one value on the stack: the third value to the left of
  the IF value. The second value to the left of the IF corresponds to the true
  (&quot;Y&quot;) branch. And the first value to the left of the IF corresponds
  to the false (&quot;Z&quot;) branch. Read the RPN expression
  &quot;X,Y,Z,IF&quot; from left to right like so: &quot;if X then Y else
  Z&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, consider &quot;1,10,100,IF&quot;. It looks bizarre to me. But when
  I read &quot;if 1 then 10 else 100&quot; it's crystal clear: 1 is true so the
  answer is 10. Note that only zero is false; all other values are true.
  &quot;2,20,200,IF&quot; (&quot;if 2 then 20 else 200&quot;) evaluates to 20.
  And &quot;0,1,2,IF&quot; (&quot;if 0 then 1 else 2) evaluates to 2.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Notice that none of the above examples really simulate the whole &quot;if X then
  Y else Z&quot; statement. This is because computer programmers read this
  statement as &quot;if Some Condition then Y else Z&quot;. So it's important to
  be able to read IF operators along with the LT, LE, GT, GE and EQ operators.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Some_Examples"><a class="selflink" href="#Some_Examples">Some
  Examples</a></h1>
While compound expressions can look overly complex, they can be considered
  elegantly simple. To quickly comprehend RPN expressions, you must know the
  algorithm for evaluating RPN expressions: iterate searches from the left to
  the right looking for an operator. When it's found, apply that operator by
  popping the operator and some number of values (and by definition, not
  operators) off the stack.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, the stack &quot;1,2,3,+,+&quot; gets &quot;2,3,+&quot; evaluated
  (as &quot;2+3&quot;) during the first iteration and is replaced by 5. This
  results in the stack &quot;1,5,+&quot;. Finally, &quot;1,5,+&quot; is
  evaluated resulting in the answer 6. For convenience, it's useful to write
  this set of operations as:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 1) 1,2,3,+,+    eval is 2,3,+ = 5    result is 1,5,+
 2) 1,5,+        eval is 1,5,+ = 6    result is 6
 3) 6
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Let's use that notation to conveniently solve some complex RPN expressions with
  multiple logic operators:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 1) 20,10,GT,10,20,IF  eval is 20,10,GT = 1     result is 1,10,20,IF
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
read the eval as pop &quot;20 is greater than 10&quot; so push 1
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 2) 1,10,20,IF         eval is 1,10,20,IF = 10  result is 10
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
read pop &quot;if 1 then 10 else 20&quot; so push 10. Only 10 is left so 10 is
  the answer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Let's read a complex RPN expression that also has the traditional multiplication
  operator:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 1) 128,8,*,7000,GT,7000,128,8,*,IF  eval 128,8,*       result is 1024
 2) 1024   ,7000,GT,7000,128,8,*,IF  eval 1024,7000,GT  result is 0
 3) 0,              7000,128,8,*,IF  eval 128,8,*       result is 1024
 4) 0,              7000,1024,   IF                     result is 1024
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now let's go back to the first example of multiple logic operators, but replace
  the value 20 with the variable &quot;input&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 1) input,10,GT,10,input,IF  eval is input,10,GT  ( lets call this A )
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Read eval as &quot;if input &gt; 10 then true&quot; and replace
  &quot;input,10,GT&quot; with &quot;A&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 2) A,10,input,IF            eval is A,10,input,IF
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
read &quot;if A then 10 else input&quot;. Now replace A with it's verbose
  description again and--voila!--you have an easily readable description of the
  expression:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 if input &gt; 10 then 10 else input
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, let's go back to the first most complex example and replace the value
  128 with &quot;input&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 1) input,8,*,7000,GT,7000,input,8,*,IF  eval input,8,*     result is A
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where A is &quot;input * 8&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 2) A,7000,GT,7000,input,8,*,IF          eval is A,7000,GT  result is B
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where B is &quot;if ((input * 8) &gt; 7000) then true&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 3) B,7000,input,8,*,IF                  eval is input,8,*  result is C
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where C is &quot;input * 8&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 4) B,7000,C,IF
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
At last we have a readable decoding of the complex RPN expression with a
  variable:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 if ((input * 8) &gt; 7000) then 7000 else (input * 8)
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Exercises"><a class="selflink" href="#Exercises">Exercises</a></h1>
Exercise 1:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Compute &quot;3,2,*,1,+ and &quot;3,2,1,+,*&quot; by hand. Rewrite them in
  traditional notation. Explain why they have different answers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Answer 1:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    3*2+1 = 7 and 3*(2+1) = 9.  These expressions have
    different answers because the altering of the plus and
    times operators alter the order of their evaluation.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Exercise 2:
<div class="Pp"></div>
One may be tempted to shorten the expression
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 input,8,*,56000,GT,56000,input,*,8,IF
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
by removing the redundant use of &quot;input,8,*&quot; like so:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 input,56000,GT,56000,input,IF,8,*
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Use traditional notation to show these expressions are not the same. Write an
  expression that's equivalent to the first expression, but uses the LE and DIV
  operators.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Answer 2:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    if (input &lt;= 56000/8 ) { input*8 } else { 56000 }
    input,56000,8,DIV,LE,input,8,*,56000,IF
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Exercise 3:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Briefly explain why traditional mathematic notation requires the use of
  parentheses. Explain why RPN notation does not require the use of parentheses.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Answer 3:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    Traditional mathematic expressions are evaluated by
    doing multiplication and division first, then addition and
    subtraction.  Parentheses are used to force the evaluation of
    addition before multiplication (etc).  RPN does not require
    parentheses because the ordering of objects on the stack
    can force the evaluation of addition before multiplication.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Exercise 4:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Explain why it was desirable for the RRDtool developers to implement RPN
  notation instead of traditional mathematical notation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Answer 4:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    The algorithm that implements traditional mathematical
    notation is more complex then algorithm used for RPN.
    So implementing RPN allowed Tobias Oetiker to write less
    code!  (The code is also less complex and therefore less
    likely to have bugs.)
