<p>BIBLE(1) General Commands Manual BIBLE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bible - Lookup words and verses in the Bible (King James
version)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bible [-f] [-l columns] [-m memlimit] [-p path-list] [-d
datafile-name] [verse-reference(s)]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Bible writes the text of specified Bible verses to stdout.
The text used is the Authorized (King James) version.
Commands may be given either on the command line, or
interac&acirc; <br>
tively. Bible also supports instant searches for verses
containing a particular word, or combination of words. The
program uses a specially-compressed form of the text that
<br>
allows for rapid random access, while still compressing the
original 4.4 Mbyte text into less than 1.8 Mbytes (plus the
&quot;concordance&quot; data file, which requires nearly 900
<br>
Kbytes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
The options to bible are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Toggles special output
formatting (pretty-printing). By default, pretty-printing is
on (a change from earlier versions). When pretty-printing is
off, bible pre&acirc; <br>
cedes each verse with its book/chapter/verse reference. When
pretty-printing is on, the book name and chapter are printed
on a line by themselves, and only when <br>
the chapter or book changes. The start of each verse is
indented and preceded by the verse number. The book and
chapter names are separated from the text by <br>
blank lines to facilitate post-processing by other tools
such as adjust. Pretty-printing activates automatic line
breaks ( -l)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l columns When pretty-printing
is off, bible prints one verse per line, even though the
text may be much longer than will fit on a single line of a
display. This is very <br>
handy when the output will be processed by other programs,
but it doesn&rsquo;t look very nice. The -l option sets a
limit on the length of an output line, causing <br>
bible to break lines (only between words) to fit. The
columns argument is optional; if it is not specified, bible
will use the value of the COLUMNS environment <br>
variable minus one. If COLUMNS is not set a default value of
79 is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m memlimit Bible normally
allocates up to 1 megabyte for buffers to store uncompressed
text. If the -m option is present, bible will set the limit
to memlimit kilobytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p path-list Bible normally
searches for the text data file first in the current
directory, and then in /usr/lib. The -p option may be used
to change the search path. Path- <br>
list should be a list of directories, each separated by a
space (be sure to escape them from the shell).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d filename Bible normally
expects to find the text data in a file named bible.data,
and the concordance data in bible.data.conc. If the -d
option is present, bible will look <br>
for a text data file named filename, and a concordance data
file named filename.conc instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verse References <br>
Bible accepts verse references in a variety of forms,
including single verses and verse ranges. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Jn3:16, john3:16,17 ps1:1-6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most recognizable abbreviations
are allowed, and spelling errors are ignored if the book can
be made out in the first few characters. No distinction is
made between upper and <br>
lower case. Multiple references may be provided on an input
line, delimited by spaces or commas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verse and chapter will be
silently coerced into a realistic range, e.g.
&quot;Ps1:87&quot; will be treated as Psalm 1:6 since there
are only six verses in Psalm 1, and &quot;Rev99:99&quot;
will be <br>
treated as Revelation 22:21 (the last verse in the Bible). A
book name by itself is assumed to be a reference to chapter
1, verse 1 of that book, i.e. &quot;Acts&quot; is the same
as <br>
&quot;Acts1:1&quot;. Similarly, a book and chapter without a
verse is assumed to refer to verse one of that chapter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A range of verses may be printed
by giving a starting and ending reference, separated by a
hyphen (&quot;-&quot;). For example,
&quot;Gen1:1-Rev22:21&quot; will dump the entire text (about
4.4 MB).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bible keeps track of your
current context and will attempt to interpret references in
that context. For example if you request
&quot;John1:1&quot;, followed by &quot;3:16&quot;, and then
&quot;17&quot;, the <br>
second reference is assumed to be within the book of John,
and the third is assumed to be within chapter 3 of that
book. An empty reference, e.g. a blank line on the input,
will <br>
show the next verse following the last one displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More examples of legal verse
references:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">psalms1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Psalms</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Romans3:23 5:8 6:23</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5:1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1-22</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Concordance (Word Searches) <br>
Bible includes a concordance, with which you can immediately
find all the verses in which a word appears. The ??word
command will select all the references that include word.
<br>
Bible will display the number of matching references, if
any, but since the number could be quite large, it
won&rsquo;t actually list the references until you ask.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to list the references
from a word search, the ?list (or ?l) command is used.
Likewise, to print the full text of the verses selected by a
word search, use the ?view <br>
(or ?v) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The lists for multiple words may
be combined using the ?and word and ?or word commands. First
create a reference list using the ?? command. For
example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">??faith</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will find 231 references to the
word &quot;faith&quot;. To narrow the list further, the
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?and love</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will inform you that, while
there were 281 references to &quot;love&quot;, only 16 of
them were also in the previous reference list (i.e.
contained both words). The &quot;combined list&quot; of 16
<br>
references produced by the ?and word command is the
intersection of the two lists, and replaces the original
reference list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ?list and ?view commands
will now apply to the combined list. You can continue to
apply the ?and command to the combined list. For
example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?and hope</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will further narrow the combined
list to only two references. Typing ?view then displays the
full text:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Thessalonians 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Remembering without ceasing
your work of faith, and labour of <br>
love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the
<br>
sight of God and our Father;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Thessalonians 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8 But let us, who are of the
day, be sober, putting on the <br>
breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope
of salvation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ?or word command is similar
to ?and, but it produces a combined reference list that is
the union of the two lists. In other words, the list
includes those verses in which <br>
either of the words appears. For example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">??angels <br>
?or angel</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will find all 283 verses in wich
either word is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, reference lists
cover the entire Bible. But for those times when it is
useful to limit them to a particular section of the text,
bible provides the ?in verse range <br>
command. For example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?in mt1:1-rev22:21</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will limit future reference
lists to the New Testament. If you have a current reference
list, references that fall outside the limits will be
dropped. Note that only a contigu&acirc; <br>
ous range of verses may be used. To reset the limits so that
the whole text is searched, the command is ?in all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interactive Use <br>
For interactive use, invoke bible without any verse
references on the command line. You should see a prompt
displayed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bible(KJV) [Gen1:1]&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typing ? will print a command
summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program accepts three types
of interactive command input:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Bible verse
references, as described above. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Concordance (word search) commands, also
described above. These commands are: ??, ?list, ?view, ?and,
?or, and ?in. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Miscellaneous program control commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?, ?h, ?help Prints help text.
<br>
?f Toggles output formatting modes. <br>
?wfile Begin writing program output to a file. If file
exists, output is appended to what&rsquo;s there already.
<br>
?w Stop writing to a file. <br>
&gt;, &lt; Toggle the direction (forward or backward) in
which bible will move through the text when a blank line is
entered. <br>
q, ?bye, ?exit, ?quit, ?q <br>
End the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
References to the one-chapter books of Philemon and 3 John
are non-standard in that they require a dummy chapter
number. For example, use Phm1:5 instead of Phm5 to get verse
5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The possessive form &rsquo;s is
handled strangely by the Concordance. The apostrophe has
been removed and the s has been treated as if it were a
separate word. So, for example, if <br>
you wanted to find all references to
&quot;refiner&rsquo;s&quot; you would have to first search
for &quot;refiner&quot; (using the command ??refiner) and
then combine it with a search for &quot;s&quot; (?and
s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The convention for handling
partial verse specifications can be clumsy. A book name by
itself, e.g. &quot;Matthew&quot; is taken as a reference to
verse 1:1 of that book. So ?in matt <br>
results in a range limit of a single verse (Mt1:1) instead
of the whole book as one might hope. Similarly, ?in mt-rev
results in a range of Matthew 1:1 to Revelation 1:1, <br>
instead of extending all the way to Revelation 22:21.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
Chip Chapin, Hewlett Packard Company (chip@cup.hp.com).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current version uses
Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression on the data file, though I
modified the &quot;compress&quot; program to emit
checkpoints at known intervals to facilitate random <br>
access to the data. I call this simple technique
&quot;windowed compression&quot;, and it could be used for
any similar application. The data file can still be
uncompressed using the <br>
standard &quot;compress&quot; utility if my file header is
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I would like to gratefully
acknowledge the contribution of the authors of the compress
program, which I modified for use in the text storage
component of bible. As listed in the <br>
compress sources they are: Spencer W. Thomas, Jim McKie,
Steve Davies, Ken Turkowski, James A. Woods, Joe Orost.</p>
