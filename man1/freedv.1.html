<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
freedv - Digital Voice for HF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
FreeDV is a GUI application that allows any SSB radio to be
used for low bit rate digital voice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Speech is compressed down to
1400 bit/s then modulated onto a 1100 Hz wide QPSK signal
which is sent to the Mic input of a SSB radio. On receive,
the signal is received by the <br>
SSB radio, then demodulated and decoded by FreeDV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FreeDV was built by an
international team of Radio Amateurs working together on
coding, design, user interface and testing. FreeDV is open
source software, released under the GNU <br>
Public License version 2.1. The FDMDV modem and Codec 2
Speech codec used in FreeDV are also open source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Upgrade as of March 2013
<br>
The new version 0.96 provides a 1600 bit-per-second mode
that communicates at much lower signal levels than
previously. Communications should be readable down to 2 dB
SNR, and <br>
long distance contacts are reported using 1 to 2 watts
power. A compatibility mode for communication with the older
0.91 version is included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Why FreeDV? <br>
Amateur Radio is transitioning from analog to digital, much
as it transitioned from AM to SSB in the 1950s and 1960s.
How would you feel if one or two companies owned the patents
<br>
for SSB, then forced you to use their technology, made it
illegal to experiment with or even understand the
technology, and insisted you stay locked to it for the next
100 <br>
years?? That is exactly what was happening with digital
voice. But now, hams are in control of their technology
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FreeDV is unique as it uses 100
percent Open Source Software, including the audio codec. No
secrets, nothing proprietary FreeDV represents a path for
21st century Amateur Radio <br>
where Hams are free to experiment and innovate, rather than
a future locked into a single manufacturers closed
technology.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is what you need:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A SSB receiver or transceiver
<br>
FreeDV software <br>
A computer with one (receive only) or two sound cards. <br>
Cables to connect your computer to your SSB radio.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Test your Transmitter Frequency
Response <br>
When you play this 10 second 1 kHz to 2 kHz sweep .wav
file(external link) through your transmitter, the power
level should remain constant. If not, look for filtering and
pro&acirc; <br>
cessing to turn off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Connecting Your Radio <br>
If you are lucky enough to have a &quot;9600&quot; input and
output on your radio, this is the best connection for every
digital mode, even 1200 packet, and your audio box should be
con&acirc; <br>
figured for 9600 or &quot;no pre-emphasis/de-emphasis&quot;
if it has that setting. If the radio&rsquo;s configuration
menu has a 1200/9600 setting, leave it permanently on
9600.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;9600&quot; and
&quot;1200&quot; settings are misnamed. &quot;9600&quot;
should really be called &quot;direct connection&quot;, and
&quot;1200&quot; should be called &quot;processed&quot;. The
audio processing in your radio does <br>
not help any digital mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuring Your Radio <br>
Turn off as much processing as possible. In general noise
blankers, DSP band limit filtering, and narrow bandpass
filters are likely to hurt rather than help. Compression,
DSP <br>
noise and carrier elimination, and voice processing are
definitely wrong for Digital modes. FreeDV&rsquo;s FDM modem
does its own DSP, and in general this is true for other
digital <br>
programs as well. The only things that we would expect to
hurt the signal are intrusion of the opposite sideband,
images of out-of-passband signals, and intermodulation
distor&acirc; <br>
tion. You can see the effect of different settings in the
S/N display of FreeDV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Drive your transmitter and
amplifier so that it emits 10%% to 20%% of its rated power
continuously. There is a 12 dB peak-to-average power ratio
in the FDM modem, and peak clip&acirc; <br>
ping in your amplifier will reduce the received S/N. Modern
transmitters and amplifiers are only as linear, and only
have as much headroom, as is necessary for voice SSB. Ask
<br>
manufacturers and reviewers to start rating linearity and
headroom for digital modes.</p>
