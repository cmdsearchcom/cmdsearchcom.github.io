freedv - Digital Voice for HF
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
FreeDV is a GUI application that allows any SSB radio to be used for low bit
  rate digital voice.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Speech is compressed down to 1400 bit/s then modulated onto a 1100 Hz wide QPSK
  signal which is sent to the Mic input of a SSB radio. On receive, the signal
  is received by the SSB radio, then demodulated and decoded by FreeDV.
<div class="Pp"></div>
FreeDV was built by an international team of Radio Amateurs working together on
  coding, design, user interface and testing. FreeDV is open source software,
  released under the GNU Public License version 2.1. The FDMDV modem and Codec 2
  Speech codec used in FreeDV are also open source.

  Upgrade as of March 2013</a></h1>
The new version 0.96 provides a 1600 bit-per-second mode that communicates at
  much lower signal levels than previously. Communications should be readable
  down to 2 dB SNR, and long distance contacts are reported using 1 to 2 watts
  power. A compatibility mode for communication with the older 0.91 version is
  included.

  FreeDV?</a></h1>
Amateur Radio is transitioning from analog to digital, much as it transitioned
  from AM to SSB in the 1950s and 1960s. How would you feel if one or two
  companies owned the patents for SSB, then forced you to use their technology,
  made it illegal to experiment with or even understand the technology, and
  insisted you stay locked to it for the next 100 years?? That is exactly what
  was happening with digital voice. But now, hams are in control of their
  technology again.
<div class="Pp"></div>
FreeDV is unique as it uses 100 percent Open Source Software, including the
  audio codec. No secrets, nothing proprietary! FreeDV represents a path for
  21st century Amateur Radio where Hams are free to experiment and innovate,
  rather than a future locked into a single manufacturers closed technology.

Here is what you need:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 A SSB receiver or transceiver
<br/>
 FreeDV software
<br/>
 A computer with one (receive only) or two sound cards.
<br/>
 Cables to connect your computer to your SSB radio.

When you play this 10 second 1 kHz to 2 kHz sweep .wav file(external link)
  through your transmitter, the power level should remain constant. If not, look
  for filtering and processing to turn off.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Connecting_Your_Radio"><a class="selflink" href="#Connecting_Your_Radio">Connecting
  Your Radio</a></h1>
If you are lucky enough to have a &quot;9600&quot; input and output on your
  radio, this is the best connection for every digital mode, even 1200 packet,
  and your audio box should be configured for 9600 or &quot;no
  pre-emphasis/de-emphasis&quot; if it has that setting. If the radio's
  configuration menu has a 1200/9600 setting, leave it permanently on 9600.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;9600&quot; and &quot;1200&quot; settings are misnamed.
  &quot;9600&quot; should really be called &quot;direct connection&quot;, and
  &quot;1200&quot; should be called &quot;processed&quot;. The audio processing
  in your radio does not help any digital mode.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Configuring_Your_Radio"><a class="selflink" href="#Configuring_Your_Radio">Configuring
  Your Radio</a></h1>
Turn off as much processing as possible. In general noise blankers, DSP band
  limit filtering, and narrow bandpass filters are likely to hurt rather than
  help. Compression, DSP noise and carrier elimination, and voice processing are
  definitely wrong for Digital modes. FreeDV's FDM modem does its own DSP, and
  in general this is true for other digital programs as well. The only things
  that we would expect to hurt the signal are intrusion of the opposite
  sideband, images of out-of-passband signals, and intermodulation distortion.
  You can see the effect of different settings in the S/N display of FreeDV.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Drive your transmitter and amplifier so that it emits 10%% to 20%% of its rated
  power continuously. There is a 12 dB peak-to-average power ratio in the FDM
  modem, and peak clipping in your amplifier will reduce the received S/N.
  Modern transmitters and amplifiers are only as linear, and only have as much
  headroom, as is necessary for voice SSB. Ask manufacturers and reviewers to
  start rating linearity and headroom for digital modes.
