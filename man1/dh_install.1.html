<p>DH_INSTALL(1) Debhelper DH_INSTALL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dh_install - install files into package build
directories</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dh_install [-Xitem] [--autodest] [--sourcedir=dir]
[debhelper&Acirc;&nbsp;options]
[file|dir&Acirc;&nbsp;...&Acirc;&nbsp;destdir]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dh_install is a debhelper program that handles installing
files into package build directories. There are many
dh_install* commands that handle installing specific types
of files <br>
such as documentation, examples, man pages, and so on, and
they should be used when possible as they often have extra
intelligence for those particular tasks. dh_install, then,
<br>
is useful for installing everything else, for which no
particular intelligence is needed. It is a replacement for
the old dh_movefiles command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program may be used in one
of two ways. If you just have a file or two that the
upstream Makefile does not install for you, you can run
dh_install on them to move them into <br>
place. On the other hand, maybe you have a large package
that builds multiple binary packages. You can use the
upstream Makefile to install it all into debian/tmp, and
then use <br>
dh_install to copy directories and files from there into the
proper package build directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From debhelper compatibility
level 7 on, dh_install will fall back to looking in
debian/tmp for files, if it doesn&rsquo;t find them in the
current directory (or wherever you&rsquo;ve told <br>
it to look using --sourcedir).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
debian/package.install <br>
List the files to install into each package and the
directory they should be installed to. The format is a set
of lines, where each line lists a file or files to install,
and <br>
at the end of the line tells the directory it should be
installed in. The name of the files (or directories) to
install should be given relative to the current directory,
<br>
while the installation directory is given relative to the
package build directory. You may use wildcards in the names
of the files to install (in v3 mode and above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if you list exactly
one filename or wildcard-pattern on a line by itself, with
no explicit destination, then dh_install will automatically
guess the destination to <br>
use, the same as if the --autodest option were used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debian/not-installed <br>
List the files that are deliberately not installed in any
binary package. Paths listed in this file are (only) ignored
by the check done via --list-missing (or <br>
--fail-missing). However, it is not a method to exclude
files from being installed. Please use --exclude for
that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please keep in mind that
dh_install will not expand wildcards in this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--list-missing <br>
This option makes dh_install keep track of the files it
installs, and then at the end, compare that list with the
files in the source directory. If any of the files (and <br>
symlinks) in the source directory were not installed to
somewhere, it will warn on stderr about that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This may be useful if you have a
large package and want to make sure that you don&rsquo;t
miss installing newly added files in new upstream
releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that files that are
excluded from being moved via the -X option are not warned
about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fail-missing <br>
This option is like --list-missing, except if a file was
missed, it will not only list the missing files, but also
fail with a nonzero exit code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xitem, --exclude=item <br>
Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename
from being installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sourcedir=dir <br>
Look in the specified directory for files to be
installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this is not the same
as the --sourcedirectory option used by the dh_auto_*
commands. You rarely need to use this option, since
dh_install automatically looks for <br>
files in debian/tmp in debhelper compatibility level 7 and
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--autodest <br>
Guess as the destination directory to install things to. If
this is specified, you should not list destination
directories in debian/package.install files or on the
command <br>
line. Instead, dh_install will guess as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Strip off debian/tmp (or the
sourcedir if one is given) from the front of the filename,
if it is present, and install into the dirname of the
filename. So if the filename is <br>
debian/tmp/usr/bin, then that directory will be copied to
debian/package/usr/. If the filename is
debian/tmp/etc/passwd, it will be copied to
debian/package/etc/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file|dir ... destdir <br>
Lists files (or directories) to install and where to install
them to. The files will be installed into the first package
dh_install acts on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
dh_install cannot rename files or directories, it can only
install them with the names they already have into wherever
you want in the package build tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, renaming can be
achieved by using dh-exec with compatibility level 9 or
later. An example debian/package.install file using dh-exec
could look like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/dh-exec <br>
debian/default.conf =&gt; /etc/my-package/start.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please remember the following
three things:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The package must
be using compatibility level 9 or later (see
debhelper(7))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The package will
need a build-dependency on dh-exec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The install file
must be marked as executable.</p>
