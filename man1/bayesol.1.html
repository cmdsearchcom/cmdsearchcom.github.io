<p style="margin-top: 1em">BAYESOL(1) BAYESOL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bayesol - a Bayes solution calculator for use with
dbacl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bayesol [-DVNniv] -c riskspec [FILE]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bayesol -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
bayesol is a Bayes solution calculator designed to combine
the output of dbacl(1) with a prior distribution and a risk
specification, and calculate the optimal Bayesian decision
<br>
(which minimizes the posterior risk).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The risk specification is read
from the text file riskspec and must be written in a simple
format described below. The dbacl(1) output can either be
read from FILE or from STDIN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
On success, bayesol returns a positive integer corresponding
to the category with the lowest risk. In case of a problem,
bayesol returns zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c Classify using riskspec. See the section RISK
SPECIFICATION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Fully internationalized mode.
Forces the use of wide characters internally, which is
necessary in some locales. This incurs a noticeable
performance penalty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Print risk scores for each
category. Each score is (approximately) the logarithm of the
expected risk under that category. The lowest score (ie
closest to -infinity) is <br>
best, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Print recursive risk scores
for each category. Each score is (approximately) the
logarithm of the best score based on the remaining
categories, after the previously best <br>
scoring categories have been removed, and a normalizing
factor was added. A full description is given in the
technical report listed at the end of this manpange. The
<br>
largest score (ie closest to +infinity) is best, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose mode. Prints to
STDOUT the category with minimum posterior risk. In case
several categories are possible, prints the first category
in the order in which they <br>
appear in the categories section of riskpspec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Print debug output. Do not
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print the program version
number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RISK SPECIFICATION <br>
bayesol needs to read a text file riskspec containing a risk
specification. The format of this text file is as
follows</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">categories { cat1, cat2,...,
catN} <br>
prior { p1, p2,..., pN} <br>
loss_matrix { <br>
&quot;regex1&quot; c1 [ formula11, formula12,..., formula1N]
<br>
&quot;regex2&quot; c2 [ formula21, formula22,..., formula2N]
<br>
. <br>
. <br>
&quot;regexM&quot; cM [ formulaM1, formulaM2,..., formulaMN]
<br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the above, cat1, cat2,...,
catN, are category names, p1, p2,..., pN, are non-negative
numbers, regex1, regex2,..., regexM, are (possibly empty)
regular expression strings, c1, <br>
c2,..., cM, are instances of the category names cat1,
cat2,..., catN, and the formulas are numbers or mathematical
expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every category which appears in
the categories section must appear at least once in the
loss_matrix section, with an empty &quot;&quot; regular
expression. To construct the actual loss <br>
matrix used in the decision calculations, bayesol selects,
for each category appearing in the categories section, the
first row whose regular expression is matched within FILE or
<br>
STDIN, or the first row with empty regular expression if
there are no matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each formula can be either a
single number, or an algebraic combination of the operators
exp(), log(), +, -, *, /, ^ and parentheses (). The string
&quot;inf&quot; is parsed as the value <br>
infinity. Also, the string &quot;complexity&quot; is
recognized, and converted to the complexity for that
category as reported by dbacl(1). Finally, if the
corresponding regular expres&acirc; <br>
sion contains submatches delimited by parentheses, their
numerical values can be used inside the formulas as the
special variables $1, ..., $9. Note that submatches which
aren&rsquo;t <br>
numerical are converted to the value zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Case is important. Spaces and
newlines can be liberally inserted. Comments must start with
a # and extend to the end of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
Typically, bayesol is used together with dbacl(1). An
invocation looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% dbacl -c one -c two -c three
sample.txt -vna | bayesol -c toy.risk -v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See
/usr/share/doc/dbacl/costs.ps for a description of the
algorithm used. See also /usr/share/doc/dbacl/tutorial.html
for a more detailed overview.</p>
