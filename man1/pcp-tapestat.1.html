pcp-tapestat - performance metrics i/o tape statistics

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pcp-tapestat reports I/O statistics for tape devices By
default pcp-tapestat reports live data for the local host
but can also report for a remote host (-h) or from a
previously <br>
captured PCP archive (-a).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -S, -T, -O and -A options
may be used to define a time window to restrict the samples
retrieved, set an initial origin within the time window, or
specify a &lsquo;&lsquo;natural&rsquo;&rsquo; align&acirc;
<br>
ment of the sample times; refer to PCPIntro(1) for a
complete description of these options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other options which control
the source, timing and layout of the information reported by
pcp-tapestat are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Performance metric values are
retrieved from the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive log
files identified by the argument archive, which is a
comma-separated list of names, <br>
each of which may be the base name of an archive or the name
of a directory containing one or more archives. See also
-u.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Specifies that statistics for
device names matching the regular expression specified with
the -R regex option should be aggregated according to
method. Note this is aggre&acirc; <br>
gation based on matching device names (not temporal
aggregation). When -G is used, the device name column is
reported as method(regex), e.g. if -G sum -R
&rsquo;st(0|1)$&rsquo; is <br>
specified, the device column will be sum(st(0|1)$) and
summed statistics for st0 and st1 will be reported in the
remaining columns. If -G is specified but -R is not
speci&acirc; <br>
fied, then the default regex is .*, i.e. matching all device
names. If method is sum then the statistics are summed. If
method is avg then the statistics are summed and <br>
then averaged by dividing by the number of matching device
names. If method is min or max, the minimum or maximum
statistics for matching devices are reported, respect&acirc;
<br>
fully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Current performance metric
values are retrieved from the nominated host machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s The argument samples defines
the number of samples to be retrieved and reported. If
samples is 0 or -s is not specified, pcp-tapestat will
sample and report continuously <br>
(in real time mode) or until the end of the set of PCP
archives (in archive mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t The default update interval
may be set to something other than the default 1 second. The
interval argument follows the syntax described in
PCPIntro(1), and in the simplest <br>
form may be an unsigned integer (the implied units in this
case are seconds). The -t option is particularly useful when
replaying large sets of archives (-a option) that <br>
span several hours or even days. In this case specifying a
large interval (e.g. 1h for 1 hour) will reduce the volume
of data reported and the tape i/o statistics will be <br>
averaged (interpolated) over the reporting interval (unless
the -u option is specified, see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R This restricts the report to
device names matching regex. The regex pattern is searched
as a perl style regular expression, and will match any
portion of a device name. <br>
e.g. &rsquo;^st[0-9]+&rsquo; will match all device names
starting with &rsquo;st&rsquo; followed by one or more
numbers. e.g. &rsquo;^st(0|1)$&rsquo; will only match
&rsquo;st0&rsquo; and &rsquo;st1&rsquo;. e.g.
&rsquo;st0$&rsquo; will match <br>
&rsquo;st0&rsquo; but not &rsquo;st1&rsquo;. See also the -G
option for aggregation options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P This indicates the number of
decimals to print. The default precision N may be set to
something other than the default 2 decimals. Note that the
avgrq-sz and avgqu-sz <br>
fields are always reported with N+1 decimals of precision.
These fields typically have values less than 1.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u When replaying a set of
archives, by default values are reported according to the
selected sample interval (-t option), not according to the
actual record intervals in the <br>
set of archives. To this effect PCP interpolates the values
to be reported based on the records in the set of archives,
and is particularly useful when the -t option is <br>
used to replay a set of archives with a longer sampling
interval than the underlying interval the set of archives
was originally recorded with. With the -u option,
uninter&acirc; <br>
polated reporting is enabled - every value is reported
according to the native recording interval in the set of
archives. When the -u option is specified, the -t option
<br>
makes no sense and is incompatible because the replay
interval is always the same as the recording interval in the
set of archive. In addition, -u only makes sense when <br>
replaying a set of archives, see -a above, and so if -u is
specified then -a must also be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z By default, pcp-tapestat
reports the time of day according to the local timezone on
the system where pcp-tapestat is run. The -Z option changes
the timezone to timezone in <br>
the format of the environment variable TZ as described in
environ(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Change the reporting timezone
to the local timezone at the host that is the source of the
performance metrics, as identified via either the -h or -a
options. When replaying <br>
a PCP archive that was captured in a foreign timezone, the
-z option would almost always be used (the default reporting
timezone is the local timezone, which may not be the <br>
same as the timezone of the PCP archive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Specifies a comma separated
list of one or more extended reporting options as follows:
<br>
t - prefix every line in the report with a timestamp in
ctime(3) format, <br>
h - omit the heading, which is otherwise reported every 24
samples, <br>
noidle - Do not display statistics for idle devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORT <br>
The columns in the pcp-tapestat report have the following
interpretation :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Timestamp <br>
When the -x t option is specified, this column is the
timestamp in ctime(3) format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Device Specifies the tape device
name When -G is specified, this is replaced by the
aggregation method and regular expression - see the -G and
-R options above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r/s The number of reads issued
expressed as the number per second averaged over the
interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w/s The number of writes issued
expressed as the number per second averaged over the
interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kb_r/s The amount of data read
expressed in kilobytes per second averaged over the
interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kb_w/s The amount of data
written expressed in kilobytes per second averaged over the
interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r_pct Read percentage wait - The
percentage of time over the interval spent waiting for read
requests to complete. The time is measured from when the
request is dispatched to <br>
the SCSI mid-layer until it signals that it completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w_pct Write percentage wait -
The percentage of time over the interval spent waiting for
write requests to complete. The time is measured from when
the request is dispatched to <br>
the SCSI mid-layer until it signals that it completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o_pct Overall percentage wait -
The percentage of time over the interval spent waiting for
any I/O request to complete (read, write, and other).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rs/s The number of I/Os,
expressed as the number per second averaged over the
interval, where a non-zero residual value was
encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o_cnt The number of I/Os,
expressed as the number per second averaged over the
interval, that were included as &quot;other&quot;. Other I/O
includes ioctl calls made to the tape driver <br>
and implicit operations performed by the tape driver such as
rewind on close (for tape devices that implement rewind on
close). It does not include any I/O performed <br>
using methods outside of the tape driver (e.g. via sg
ioctls).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/* <br>
default PMNS specification files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
All are generated on standard error and are intended to be
self-explanatory.</p>
