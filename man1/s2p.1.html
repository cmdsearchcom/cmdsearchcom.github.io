<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
psed - a stream editor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
psed [-an] script [file ...] <br>
psed [-an] [-e script] [-f script-file] [file ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s2p [-an] [-e script] [-f
script-file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
A stream editor reads the input stream consisting of the
specified files (or standard input, if none are given),
processes is line by line by applying a script consisting of
edit <br>
commands, and writes resulting lines to standard output. The
filename &rsquo;&quot;-&quot;&rsquo; may be used to read
standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The edit script is composed from
arguments of -e options and script-files, in the given
order. A single script argument may be specified as the
first parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this program is invoked with
the name s2p, it will act as a sed-to-Perl translator. See
&quot;SED SCRIPT TRANSLATION&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sed returns an exit code of 0 on
success or &gt;0 if an error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a A file specified as argument to the w edit command is by
default opened before input processing starts. Using -a,
opening of such files is delayed until the first line is
<br>
actually written to the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e script <br>
The editing commands defined by script are appended to the
script. Multiple commands must be separated by newlines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f script-file <br>
Editing commands from the specified script-file are read and
appended to the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n By default, a line is written
to standard output after the editing script has been applied
to it. The -n option suppresses automatic printing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
sed command syntax is defined as</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">[address[,address]][!]function[argument]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">with whitespace being permitted
before or after addresses, and between the function
character and the argument. The addresses and the address
inverter (&quot;!&quot;) are used to restrict <br>
the application of a command to the selected line(s) of
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each command must be on a line
of its own, except where noted in the synopses below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The edit cycle performed on each
input line consist of reading the line (without its trailing
newline character) into the pattern space, applying the
applicable commands of the <br>
edit script, writing the final contents of the pattern space
and a newline to the standard output. A hold space is
provided for saving the contents of the pattern space for
<br>
later use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Addresses <br>
A sed address is either a line number or a pattern, which
may be combined arbitrarily to construct ranges. Lines are
numbered across all input files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any address may be followed by
an exclamation mark (&rsquo;&quot;!&quot;&rsquo;), selecting
all lines not matching that address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">number <br>
The line with the given number is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ A dollar sign (&quot;$&quot;)
is the line number of the last line of the input stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/regular expression/ <br>
A pattern address is a basic regular expression (see
&quot;BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS&quot;), between the
delimiting character &quot;/&quot;. Any other character
except &quot; <br>
used to delimit a pattern address when the initial delimiter
is prefixed with a backslash (&rsquo;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no address is given, the
command selects every line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one address is given, it
selects the line (or lines) matching the address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two addresses select a range
that begins whenever the first address matches, and ends
(including that line) when the second address matches. If
the first (second) address is a <br>
matching pattern, the second address is not applied to the
very same line to determine the end of the range. Likewise,
if the second address is a matching pattern, the first <br>
address is not applied to the very same line to determine
the begin of another range. If both addresses are line
numbers, and the second line number is less than the first
line <br>
number, then only the first line is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Functions <br>
The maximum permitted number of addresses is indicated with
each function synopsis below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument text consists of
one or more lines following the command. Embedded newlines
in text must be preceded with a backslash. Other backslashes
in text are deleted and <br>
the following character is taken literally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[1addr]a&nbsp;text <br>
Write text (which must start on the line following the
command) to standard output immediately before reading the
next line of input, either by executing the N function or by
<br>
beginning a new cycle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]b [label] <br>
Branch to the : function with the specified label. If no
label is given, branch to the end of the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]c&nbsp;text <br>
The line, or range of lines, selected by the address is
deleted. The text (which must start on the line following
the command) is written to standard output. With an address
<br>
range, this occurs at the end of the range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]d <br>
Deletes the pattern space and starts the next cycle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]D <br>
Deletes the pattern space through the first embedded newline
or to the end. If the pattern space becomes empty, a new
cycle is started, otherwise execution of the script is <br>
restarted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]g <br>
Replace the contents of the pattern space with the hold
space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]G <br>
Append a newline and the contents of the hold space to the
pattern space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]h <br>
Replace the contents of the hold space with the pattern
space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]H <br>
Append a newline and the contents of the pattern space to
the hold space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[1addr]i&nbsp;text <br>
Write the text (which must start on the line following the
command) to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]l <br>
Print the contents of the pattern space: non-printable
characters are shown in C-style escaped form; long lines are
split and have a trailing ^&rsquo;&quot; <br>
split; the true end of a line is marked with a
&rsquo;&quot;$&quot;&rsquo;.&rsquo;, &rsquo;\&rsquo; for
BEL, HT, LF, FF, CR, ESC, Escapes are: &rsquo;&rsquo;,
&rsquo;&rsquo;, &rsquo;0, &rsquo;, &rsquo; respectively, and
&rsquo;&acute; followed by a three- <br>
digit octal number for all other non-printable
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]n <br>
If automatic printing is enabled, write the pattern space to
the standard output. Replace the pattern space with the next
line of input. If there is no more input, processing <br>
is terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]N <br>
Append a newline and the next line of input to the pattern
space. If there is no more input, processing is
terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]p <br>
Print the pattern space to the standard output. (Use the -n
option to suppress automatic printing at the end of a cycle
if you want to avoid double printing of lines.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]P <br>
Prints the pattern space through the first embedded newline
or to the end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[1addr]q <br>
Branch to the end of the script and quit without starting a
new cycle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[1addr]r file <br>
Copy the contents of the file to standard output immediately
before the next attempt to read a line of input. Any error
encountered while reading file is silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]s/regular
expression/replacement/flags <br>
Substitute the replacement string for the first substring in
the pattern space that matches the regular expression. Any
character other than backslash or newline can be used <br>
instead of a slash to delimit the regular expression and the
replacement. To use the delimiter as a literal character
within the regular expression and the replacement, <br>
precede the character by a backslash (&rsquo;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Literal newlines may be embedded
in the replacement string by preceding a newline with a
backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Within the replacement, an
ampersand (&rsquo;&quot;&amp;&quot;&rsquo;) is replaced by
the string matching the regular expression. The strings
&rsquo;&quot;1&quot;&rsquo; through
&rsquo;&quot;9&quot;&rsquo; are replaced by the
corresponding <br>
subpattern (see &quot;BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS&quot;). To
get a literal &rsquo;&quot;&amp;&quot;&rsquo; or
&rsquo;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following flags modify the
behaviour of the s command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g The replacement is performed
for all matching, non-overlapping substrings of the pattern
space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1..9 Replace only the n-th
matching substring of the pattern space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p If the substitution was made,
print the new value of the pattern space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w file If the substitution was
made, write the new value of the pattern space to the
specified file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]t [label] <br>
Branch to the : function with the specified label if any s
substitutions have been made since the most recent reading
of an input line or execution of a t function. If no <br>
label is given, branch to the end of the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]w file <br>
The contents of the pattern space are written to the
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]x <br>
Swap the contents of the pattern space and the hold
space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]y/string1/string2/ <br>
In the pattern space, replace all characters occurring in
string1 by the character at the corresponding position in
string2. It is possible to use any character (other than a
<br>
backslash or newline) instead of a slash to delimit the
strings. Within string1 and string2, a backslash followed by
any character other than a newline is that literal <br>
character, and a backslash followed by an &rsquo;n&rsquo; is
replaced by a newline character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[1addr]= <br>
Prints the current line number on the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[0addr]: [label] <br>
The command specifies the position of the label. It has no
other effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2addr]{ [command] <br>
[0addr]} <br>
These two commands begin and end a command list. The first
command may be given on the same line as the opening {
command. The commands within the list are jointly selected
<br>
by the address(es) given on the { command (but may still
have individual addresses).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[0addr]# [comment] <br>
The entire line is ignored (treated as a comment). If,
however, the first two characters in the script are
&rsquo;&quot;#n&quot;&rsquo;, automatic printing of output
is suppressed, as if the -n <br>
option were given on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS <br>
A Basic Regular Expression (BRE), as defined in POSIX
1003.2, consists of atoms, for matching parts of a string,
and bounds, specifying repetitions of a preceding atom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Atoms <br>
The possible atoms of a BRE are: ., matching any single
character; ^ and $, matching the null string at the
beginning or end of a string, respectively; a bracket
expressions, <br>
enclosed in [ and ] (see below); and any single character
with no other significance (matching that character). A
&nbsp;before one of: ., ^, $, [, *, matching the character
after <br>
the backslash. A sequence of atoms enclosed in and becomes
an atom and establishes the target for a backreference,
consisting of the substring that actually matches the <br>
enclosed atoms. Finally, &nbsp;followed by one of the digits
0 through 9 is a backreference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A ^ that is not first, or a $
that is not last does not have a special significance and
need not be preceded by a backslash to become literal. The
same is true for a ], that does <br>
not terminate a bracket expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An unescaped backslash cannot be
last in a BRE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bounds <br>
The BRE bounds are: *, specifying 0 or more matches of the
preceding atom; count, specifying that many repetitions;
minimum,, giving a lower limit; and <br>
minimum,maximum finally defines a lower and upper bound.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A bound appearing as the first
item in a BRE is taken literally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bracket Expressions <br>
A bracket expression is a list of characters, character
ranges and character classes enclosed in [ and ] and matches
any single character from the represented set of
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A character range is written as
two characters separated by - and represents all characters
(according to the character collating sequence) that are not
less than the first and <br>
not greater than the second. (Ranges are very
collating-sequence-dependent, and portable programs should
avoid relying on them.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A character class is one of the
class names</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alnum digit punct <br>
alpha graph space <br>
blank lower upper <br>
cntrl print xdigit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enclosed in [: and :] and
represents the set of characters as defined in ctype(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the first character after [
is ^, the sense of matching is inverted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To include a literal
&rsquo;&quot;^&quot;&rsquo;, place it anywhere else but
first. To include a literal &rsquo;&quot;]&quot;&rsquo;
place it first or immediately after an initial ^. To include
a literal &rsquo;&quot;-&quot;&rsquo; make it the <br>
first (or second after ^) or last character, or the second
endpoint of a range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special bracket expression
constructs &quot;[[:&lt;:]]&quot; and &quot;[[:&gt;:]]&quot;
match the null string at the beginning and end of a word
respectively. (Note that neither is identical to a t o <br>
Perl&rsquo;s &rsquo;m . )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional Atoms <br>
Since some sed implementations provide additional regular
expression atoms (not defined in POSIX 1003.2), psed is
capable of translating the following backslash escapes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt; This is the same as
&quot;[[:&gt;:]]&quot;. <br>
&gt; This is the same as &quot;[[:&lt;:]]&quot;. <br>
96is an abbreviation for &quot;[[:alnum:]_]&quot;. <br>
W This is an abbreviation for &quot;[^[:alnum:]_]&quot;.
<br>
y Match the empty string at a word boundary. <br>
0Match the empty string between any two either word or
non-word characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To enable this feature, the
environment variable PSEDEXTBRE must be set to a string
containing the requested characters, e.g.:
&quot;PSEDEXTBRE=&rsquo;&lt;&gt;wW&rsquo;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The environment variable &quot;PSEDEXTBRE&quot; may be set
to extend BREs. See &quot;Additional Atoms&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
ambiguous translation for character &rsquo;%s&rsquo; in
&rsquo;y&rsquo; command <br>
The indicated character appears twice, with different
translations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;[&rsquo; cannot be last
in pattern <br>
A &rsquo;[&rsquo; in a BRE indicates the beginning of a
bracket expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;&acute; cannot be last in
pattern <br>
A &rsquo;&acute; in a BRE is used to make the subsequent
character literal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;&acute; cannot be last in
substitution <br>
A &rsquo;&acute; in a substitution string is used to make
the subsequent character literal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">conflicting flags
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; <br>
In an s command, either the &rsquo;g&rsquo; flag and an n-th
occurrence flag, or multiple n-th occurrence flags are
specified. Note that only the digits ^&rsquo;1&rsquo;
through &rsquo;9&rsquo; are permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">duplicate label %s (first
defined at %s) <br>
excess address(es) <br>
The command has more than the permitted number of
addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extra characters after command
(%s) <br>
illegal option &rsquo;%s&rsquo; <br>
improper delimiter in s command <br>
The BRE and substitution may not be delimited with
&rsquo;&acute; or newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invalid address after
&rsquo;,&rsquo; <br>
invalid backreference (%s) <br>
The specified backreference number exceeds the number of
backreferences in the BRE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invalid repeat clause
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; <br>
The repeat clause does not contain a valid integer value, or
pair of values.</p>

and piping the output into &quot;sort -u&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SED SCRIPT TRANSLATION <br>
If this program is invoked with the name s2p it will act as
a sed-to-Perl translator. After option processing (all other
arguments are ignored), a Perl program is printed on <br>
standard output, which will process the input stream (as
read from all arguments) in the way defined by the sed
script and the option setting used for the translation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
perl(1), re_format(7)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The l command will show escape characters (ESC) as
&rsquo;&quot;\&quot;&rsquo;, but a vertical tab (VT) in
octal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trailing spaces are truncated
from labels in :, t and b commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The meaning of an empty regular
expression (&rsquo;&quot;//&quot;&rsquo;), as defined by
sed, is &quot;the last pattern used, at run time&quot;. This
deviates from the Perl interpretation, which will re-use the
<br>
&quot;last last successfully executed regular
expression&quot;. Since keeping track of pattern usage would
create terribly cluttered code, and differences would only
appear in obscure <br>
context (where other sed implementations appear to deviate,
too), the Perl semantics was adopted. Note that common usage
of this feature, such as in &quot;/abc/s//xyz/&quot;, will
work as <br>
expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Collating elements (of bracket
expressions in BREs) are not implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARDS <br>
This sed implementation conforms to the IEEE Std1003.2-1992
(&quot;POSIX.2&quot;) definition of sed, and is compatible
