<p>IMWheel(1) General Commands Manual IMWheel(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
imwheel - a mouse wheel and button interpreter for X
Windows</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
imwheel [ options ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
IMWheel is a universal mouse wheel and button translator for
the X Windows System. Utilizing the input from X Windows,
imwheel translates mouse wheel and mouse button actions <br>
into keyboard events using the XTest extension to X. Use
xdpyinfo for information on the supported extensions in your
X server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
Available command line options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4, --flip-buttons <br>
Flips the mouse buttons so that 4 is 5 and 5 is 4, reversing
the Up and Down actions. This would make 4 buttons somewhat
useful! This is the similar to using &rsquo;-b &quot;5 4 6
<br>
7 8&quot;&rsquo;; see the -b option. See also
xmodmap(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --buttons button-spec <br>
Remap buttons in button-spec to interpreted wheel/button
input. Also limits the button grab to the specified buttons.
The button-spec must be surrounded by quotes. Each <br>
button number must be separated by a space. The button-spec
is decoded in the following order for wheel input:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Index Interpreted As Button
Number Name in imwheelrc <br>
1 Wheel Up 4 Up <br>
2 Wheel Down 5 Down <br>
3 Wheel Left 6 Left <br>
4 Wheel Right 7 Right <br>
5 Thumb Button 1 8 Thumb1 <br>
6 Thumb Button 2 9 Thumb2 <br>
7 Extra Button 1 10 ExtBt7 <br>
8 Extra Button 2 11 ExtBt8 <br>
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A button-spec of &quot;4 5&quot;
will limit the grabbed buttons to only wheel up and down.
<br>
A button-spec of &quot;0&quot; turns off any defined
mapping, thus allowing for skips in the button-spec for
something that doesn&rsquo;t exist on your mouse. <br>
A button-spec of &quot;4 5 0 0 8&quot; may be for normal
wheel up/down and a thumb button 1, but no horizontal wheel
axis. <br>
The default button-spec is &quot;4 5 6 7 8 9&quot;, but you
may want or need to customize this yourself. If you want to
ignore the mouse wheel on regular mice, make sure to start
<br>
the button-spec with &quot;0 0 0 0 ...&quot;, thereby
skipping over the vertical and horizontal axes of the wheel
(whether or not the horizontal axis exists or is used). <br>
See also xmodmap(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --config <br>
Popup to configuration helper window imediately. <br>
See also CONFIGURATION HELPER</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --debug <br>
Show all possible debug info while running. This spits out
alot and I also suggest using the -d option to prevent
imwheel from detaching from the controlling terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --detach <br>
Actually this does the opposite of its name, it prevents
detachment from the controlling terminal (no daemon).
Control-C stops, etc...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --focus <br>
Forces the X event subwindow to be used instead of the
original hack that would replace the subwindow in the X
event with a probed focus query (XGetInputFocus). This <br>
should fix some compatability problems with some window
managers, such as window maker, and perhaps enlightenment.
If nothing seems to be working right, try toggling this <br>
on or off...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --focus-events <br>
Disable the use of focus events for button grabs. If your
@Excluded windows are not regrabbing the mouse buttons when
exited, try toggling this on or off...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Short help on options plus version/author info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --kill <br>
Attempts to kill old imwheel. Process IDs are tested using
/proc/${pid}/status Name: field ?= imwheel. If /proc is not
mounted then this fails everytime! Otherwise, <br>
this ensures that the wrong process is not killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quit <br>
Quit imwheel before entering event loop. <br>
Example: &lsquo;imwheel -k -q&rsquo; = kill and quit (option
order doesn&rsquo;t matter)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X, --display display <br>
Use XServer at a specified display in standard X form. Using
this option is usful for multiple displays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X WINDOWS <br>
Use multiple imwheels by either setting the DISPLAY
environment variable before running each imwheel, or use the
-X or --display options to specify a different display for
each <br>
imwheel. Running multiple imwheels on the same display is
not recommended, but is allowed, and may cause strange
things to happen while using the wheel or buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Edit your xorg.conf, and ensure
that in the &quot;InputDevice&quot; section, your mouse
Protocol is set to &quot;ExplorerPS/2&quot; for a modern
PS/2 or USB mouse, or if not then &quot;IMPS/2&quot;. For
<br>
serial mice set it to &quot;IntelliMouse&quot; or
&quot;Auto&quot;. This is for IntelliMouse compatible mice;
other protocols may be required for other mice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
The @Exclude command must be used for clients that either
use the ZAxis for themselves and have no keyboard
translations to cause the same desired effect. The @Exclude
command <br>
must also be added for any client requiring mouse and/or
mouse button grabs and that don&rsquo;t specify specific
buttons to grab. These clients fail when they try to grab
the mouse <br>
because the buttons 4 and 5 are already grabbed by imwheel.
XV is an example of a client that requires these types of
grabs to succeed. KDE clients use the ZAxis for their own
<br>
purposes. The supplied imwheelrc includes an exclusion for
XV already. See the IMWheelRC section for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMWHEELRC <br>
IMWheel uses, optionally, two configuration files. One,
/etc/X11/imwheel/imwheelrc, is usable by everybody. The
other is $HOME/.imwheelrc, used only by one user. One is
sup&acirc; <br>
plied and should have been installed automatically in
/etc/X11/imwheel. All whitespace is ignored in the files
except for within the window names&rsquo; double quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration file consists
of window names and event translations and/or imwheel
commands that begin with an &lsquo;@&rsquo; (at) symbol.
Each window name starts a section that is its <br>
configuration. The window names are priortized as first come
first served, so more generic matches should always occur
later in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comments are started with a
pound (#) and extend to the end of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMWHEELRC WINDOW SECTION HEADERS
<br>
Window name section headers are actually one of four
things:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Window Title <br>
Window Class Name <br>
Window Resource Name <br>
(null) which matches &quot;ll&quot; in the imwheelrc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of these are probeable
using fvwm2&rsquo;s FvwmIdent module or the configurator
(see the CONFIGURATION HELPER section). Other window
managers may have their own method of identi&acirc; <br>
fying windows&rsquo; attributes. <br>
Each window name is matched as a regex string. Thus any
window is matched using the regex pattern &quot;.*&quot; as
a window name. This pattern should be the last section in
your config&acirc; <br>
uration file, or it will override the other window
configurations in the file for matched wheel/button actions.
<br>
There is one special header noted as &quot;(null)&quot;
which matches windows that have a null string in the three
attributes. This makes it possible to assign actions to even
Quake3, <br>
which has no info for its window. Just make sure that you
realize that the keys used should not be keys that may
conflict with other key actions in the game or application
you <br>
are aiming to make work! The included imwheelrc file has a
&quot;(null)&quot; section included to demonstrate, and it
should work with Quake3. <br>
Each window/class/resource name must be enclosed in double
quotes (&quot;) on a line by itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inside each window section is
any number of translation definitions or commands. Each
translation definition or command must be on a line by
itself. The window section doesn&rsquo;t <br>
have to be terminated, as it is terminated by either
starting another window section or the end of the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMWHEELRC TRANSLATION
DEFINITIONS <br>
Mouse wheel/button translations each take up a line after a
window section has been started. Each argument is seperated
by commas(,); whitespace is ignored. KeySyms are used to
<br>
specify the keyboard input and outputs. Pipes (|) are used
to join multiple keys into one input/output. The format is
as follows...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIRED <br>
The following arguments a required to make a minimum
translation definition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key Modifiers Input <br>
X KeySyms joined by pipes that indicate the required keys
pressed when the mouse action is made in order for this
translation to be used. Alt, Meta, Control, and Shift <br>
keys are typical modifiers, but are stated slightly
different than just &lsquo;Shift&rsquo; but rather
&lsquo;Shift_L&rsquo; or &lsquo;Shift_R&rsquo;,
differentiating between left and right shift keys. See <br>
the KeySyms section for more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;None&rsquo; is a special
KeySym used by imwheel, it is used to indicate no modifiers.
A blank entry is also acceptable in this case, but less
descriptive of what is going on! <br>
If &lsquo;None&rsquo; is used then there can be no modifiers
in use during the wheel action. If the field is blank then
any modifier will match, so put these last in their window
<br>
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse Action Input <br>
This is the input from the mouse wheel or button. It is one
of the following and only one:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Up <br>
Down <br>
Left <br>
Right <br>
Thumb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are self explanatory. If
you have trouble use the configurator!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key Action Output <br>
Out KeySyms are placed here. See KeySyms section for more on
all available KeySyms. Join KeySyms using pipes. Output keys
are pressed in order and released, in reverse <br>
order, only after all have been pressed, likely making them
all combined as in &lsquo;Control_L|C&rsquo; which would be
a &lsquo;^C&rsquo; (control-c) keypress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONAL <br>
The following options are optional, but to use one you must
fill in all the preceding arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output Repetitions <br>
How many times should the Output KeySyms be pressed in a
row.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delay Before KeyUp Event <br>
How long in microseconds until we release all the Output
KeySyms in one Output Repetition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delay Before Next KeyPress Event
<br>
How long in microseconds until we press the next the Output
KeySyms. Ths delay occurs after the Output KeySyms are
released.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMWHEELRC COMMANDS <br>
Commands start with the &lsquo;@&rsquo; character. Commands
are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@Exclude <br>
Exclude this window from imwheel grabing mouse events.
IMWheel will ungrab the mouse when these windows are entered
and not regrab the mouse until focus is changed to a <br>
non-excluded window. This allows the ZAxis button events to
pass through normally and mouse grabs to succeed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@Priority=priority <br>
Using this is allowed in each window/class/resource section.
Higher priority values take precedence over lower ones.
Equal priorities on sections make the imwheelrc file <br>
parsed from top to bottom to find the first match. Thus
@Priority can be used to make the file search for matches
out of order, then you dont have to keep the entries in <br>
order if you so please. The supplied imwheelrc file contains
extensive comments and examples of the @Priority function.
<br>
The default priority for any new section is 0. The last
@Priority command in a section overrides all previous
priorities for that section. Thus each section has only one
<br>
priority setting in the end. Priorities are kept as an int,
thus range from INT_MAX to INT_MIN. (See
/usr/include/limits.h for these values on your system.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION HELPER <br>
IMWheel contains a semi-hidden configuration helper which
can be brought up by rolling up and down a few times in the
root window of the X server. Inside this window you can <br>
find out possible window names to use in your imwheelrc
file. Press on the mini-screen capture to grab another
window, including the root window (whole screen).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse wheel and button actions
can be grabbed along with active modifier keys on the
keyboard. The mouse wheel/button action is displayed and the
X KeySyms are displayed beneath <br>
it. All this information can be directly entered into an
imwheelrc as desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMWheel can be restarted to read
in a changed imwheelrc file or the configurator can be
canceled causing imwheel to resume oprations without reading
the configuration file. To <br>
restart, imwheel execs itself as called by the user in the
first place but adding the -R option to indicate to itself
that this is a restarted imwheel. The -R is not for use by
<br>
the user, as it bypasses some configuration of imwheel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEYSYMS <br>
The program expects combinations of keysyms to be used by
using pipe(|) characters to combine them together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: <br>
Alt_R|Shift_R</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Means right alt and right shift
together, not just either one or the other! And not one
after the other, they are both pressed at the same time
essentially.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Common Modifier Keysym names
used in X: <br>
Shift_L Shift_R <br>
Control_L Control_R <br>
Alt_L Alt_R</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are probably not currently
assigned any keys, unless you xmodmap them in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Meta_L Meta_R (Actually, Sun
keyboards have this...) <br>
Super_L Super_R <br>
Hyper_L Hyper_R</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And here&rsquo;s some that you
may use, and they are somewhere on your keyboard.
Here&rsquo;s where they were on my keyboard, again, this is
not universal. Use the xev program to test your <br>
own keys on your keyboard!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caps_Lock = The Caps Lock key!
<br>
(This still turns on and off caps lock!) <br>
Num_Lock = The Num Lock key! <br>
(This is not good to use... <br>
for the same reasons as Caps_Lock) <br>
Multi_key = The Scroll Lock key! <br>
(Go figure!) <br>
Mode_switch = Right Alt...for me anyways. <br>
(This mean I cannot use Alt_R)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The windows keys may not be
assigned any KeySyms, but they will have numbers. xmodmap
can be used to assign them to a real KeySym.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To find keysym names for any
keys available see the /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h file,
and for any define in that file remove the &quot;XK_&quot;
for the usable KeySym name in the configu&acirc; <br>
ration file. The path to this file may differ for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remember, there&rsquo;s always
the configurator. And xev will also help here too!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WHEEL AS MIDDLE BUTTON IN X <br>
Configure the XF86Config without &quot;Emulate3Buttons&quot;
and increase &quot;Buttons&quot; if it is 2 in the Ponter or
InputDevice section. The wheel will act as a real middle
button and the <br>
outer two buttons will act as separate buttons (1 and 3),
even when pressed together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course if your wheel keeps
clicking middle button while you&rsquo;re trying to use the
wheel you may want to activate the Emulate3Buttons option to
disable the wheel button! And <br>
don&rsquo;t forget to reduce the Buttons argument to 2!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LEFTY BUTTON MAPPING IN X
WINDOWS <br>
For those lefties out there, this command may help you get
the buttons set up correctly in XWindows for both left
handed and imwheel use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xmodmap -e &quot;pointer = 3 2 1
4 5&quot; <br>
or <br>
xmodmap -e &quot;pointer = 3 2 1 4 5 6 7&quot; <br>
etc... <br>
xmodmap -e &quot;pointer = 3 2 1 4 5 6 7 8 9&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: most of these are NOT
going to work, because of all the limits in X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add more numbers to the end of
this line if you have more buttons!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Of course...but most of the time it&rsquo;s just that you
haven&rsquo;t read everything I&rsquo;ve written here and in
the files of the distribution itself. Even then, you may be
giving up too <br>
easily. Keep trying, it&rsquo;s not that hard. I am always
working to reduce strange behavior. This is still a beta, as
indicated by the leading 0 in the version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Real Bugs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">imwheel doesn&rsquo;t get along
with itself on the same X display. This will always be your
fault :-/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stick mice are still a pain in
the butt to use. - This is the manufacturer&rsquo;s fault.
Or X Windows&rsquo; fault, for not having a method to easily
use such devices in all applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keyboard focus isn&rsquo;t
changed automatically to input keys into Window mouse is
over. This only occurs with Click-to-Focus type focus
managment in window managers. I use sloppy <br>
focus in fvwm2, which always works for me. - Whose fault is
this? (Switch focus modes and/or window managers, or try the
-f option on imwheel)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration file is not
validated for correctness nicely... although it does get
preparsed before the main program starts, thus stopping you
before you run with an invalid con&acirc; <br>
figuration file. I just have never made a bad configuration
file, so I guess I&rsquo;ll have to try and do that to see
what happens. Just don&rsquo;t make any mistakes and
you&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
