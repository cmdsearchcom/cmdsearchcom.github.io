<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<i>IMWheel</i> is a universal mouse wheel and button translator for the X
  Windows System. Utilizing the input from X Windows, imwheel translates mouse
  wheel and mouse button actions into keyboard events using the XTest extension
  to X. Use <i>xdpyinfo</i> for information on the supported extensions in your
  X server.

A <i>button-spec</i> of &quot;4 5&quot; will limit the grabbed buttons to only
  wheel up and down.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
A <i>button-spec</i> of &quot;0&quot; turns off any defined mapping, thus
  allowing for skips in the <i>button-spec</i> for something that doesn't exist
  on your mouse.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
A <i>button-spec</i> of &quot;4 5 0 0 8&quot; may be for normal wheel up/down
  and a thumb button 1, but no horizontal wheel axis.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The default <i>button-spec</i> is &quot;4 5 6 7 8 9&quot;, but you may want or
  need to customize this yourself. If you want to ignore the mouse wheel on
  regular mice, make sure to start the <i>button-spec</i> with &quot;0 0 0 0
  ...&quot;, thereby skipping over the vertical and horizontal axes of the wheel
  (whether or not the horizontal axis exists or is used).

Use multiple imwheels by either setting the DISPLAY environment variable before
  running each imwheel, or use the <b>-X</b> or <b>--display</b> options to
  specify a different display for each imwheel. Running multiple imwheels on the
  same display is not recommended, but is allowed, and may cause strange things
  to happen while using the wheel or buttons.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Edit your xorg.conf, and ensure that in the &quot;InputDevice&quot; section,
  your mouse Protocol is set to &quot;ExplorerPS/2&quot; for a modern PS/2 or
  USB mouse, or if not then &quot;IMPS/2&quot;. For serial mice set it to
  &quot;IntelliMouse&quot; or &quot;Auto&quot;. This is for IntelliMouse
  compatible mice; other protocols may be required for other mice.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>NOTE</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>@Exclude</b> command must be used for clients that either use the ZAxis
  for themselves and have no keyboard translations to cause the same desired
  effect. The <b>@Exclude</b> command must also be added for any client
  requiring mouse and/or mouse button grabs and that don't specify specific
  buttons to grab. These clients fail when they try to grab the mouse because
  the buttons 4 and 5 are already grabbed by imwheel. XV is an example of a
  client that requires these types of grabs to succeed. KDE clients use the
  ZAxis for their own purposes. The supplied imwheelrc includes an exclusion for
  XV already. See the IMWheelRC section for more information.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="IMWHEELRC"><a class="selflink" href="#IMWHEELRC">IMWHEELRC</a></h1>
IMWheel uses, optionally, two configuration files. One,
  /etc/X11/imwheel/imwheelrc, is usable by everybody. The other is
  $HOME/.imwheelrc, used only by one user. One is supplied and should have been
  installed automatically in /etc/X11/imwheel. All whitespace is ignored in the
  files except for within the window names' double quotes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The configuration file consists of window names and event translations and/or
  imwheel commands that begin with an `@' (at) symbol. Each window name starts a
  section that is its configuration. The window names are priortized as first
  come first served, so more generic matches should always occur later in the
  configuration file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Comments are started with a pound (#) and extend to the end of the line.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="IMWHEELRC_WINDOW_SECTION_HEADERS"><a class="selflink" href="#IMWHEELRC_WINDOW_SECTION_HEADERS">IMWHEELRC
  WINDOW SECTION HEADERS</a></h1>
Window name section headers are actually one of four things:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
Window Title
Window Class Name
Window Resource Name
(null) which matches &quot;\(null\)&quot; in the imwheelrc
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most of these are probeable using fvwm2's FvwmIdent module or the configurator
  (see the <b>CONFIGURATION HELPER</b> section). Other window managers may have
  their own method of identifying windows' attributes.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Each window name is matched as a regex string. Thus any window is matched using
  the regex pattern &quot;.*&quot; as a window name. This pattern should be the
  last section in your configuration file, or it will override the other window
  configurations in the file for matched wheel/button actions.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
There is one special header noted as &quot;(null)&quot; which matches windows
  that have a null string in the three attributes. This makes it possible to
  assign actions to even Quake3, which has no info for its window. Just make
  sure that you realize that the keys used should not be keys that may conflict
  with other key actions in the game or application you are aiming to make work!
  The included imwheelrc file has a &quot;(null)&quot; section included to
  demonstrate, and it should work with Quake3.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Each window/class/resource name <i>must</i> be enclosed in double quotes
  (&quot;) on a line by itself.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Inside each window section is any number of translation definitions or commands.
  Each translation definition or command must be on a line by itself. The window
  section doesn't have to be terminated, as it is terminated by either starting
  another window section or the end of the configuration file.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="IMWHEELRC_TRANSLATION_DEFINITIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#IMWHEELRC_TRANSLATION_DEFINITIONS">IMWHEELRC
  TRANSLATION DEFINITIONS</a></h1>
Mouse wheel/button translations each take up a line after a window section has
  been started. Each argument is seperated by commas(,); whitespace is ignored.
  KeySyms are used to specify the keyboard input and outputs. Pipes (|) are used
  to join multiple keys into one input/output. The format is as follows...
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>REQUIRED</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The following arguments a required to make a minimum translation definition.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>Key Modifiers Input</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">X KeySyms joined by pipes that indicate the required keys
      pressed when the mouse action is made in order for this translation to be
      used. Alt, Meta, Control, and Shift keys are typical modifiers, but are
      stated slightly different than just `Shift' but rather `Shift_L' or
      `Shift_R', differentiating between left and right shift keys. See the
      KeySyms section for more.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    ` <b>None</b>' is a special KeySym used by imwheel, it is used to indicate
      no modifiers. A blank entry is also acceptable in this case, but less
      descriptive of what is going on! If ` <b>None</b>' is used then there can
      be no modifiers in use during the wheel action. If the field is blank then
      <i>any</i> modifier will match, so put these last in their window
    section.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>Mouse Action Input</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is the input from the mouse wheel or button. It is one
      of the following and <i>only</i> one:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
Up
Down
Left
Right
Thumb
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    These are self explanatory. If you have trouble use the configurator!</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>Key Action Output</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Out KeySyms are placed here. See KeySyms section for more
      on all available KeySyms. Join KeySyms using pipes. Output keys are
      pressed in order and released, in reverse order, only after all have been
      pressed, likely making them all combined as in `Control_L|C' which would
      be a `^C' (control-c) keypress.</dd>

</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="IMWHEELRC_COMMANDS"><a class="selflink" href="#IMWHEELRC_COMMANDS">IMWHEELRC
  COMMANDS</a></h1>
Commands start with the `@' character. Commands are as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>@Exclude</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Exclude this window from imwheel grabing mouse events.
      IMWheel will ungrab the mouse when these windows are entered and not
      regrab the mouse until focus is changed to a non-excluded window. This
      allows the ZAxis button events to pass through normally and mouse grabs to
      succeed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>@Priority</b>=<i>priority</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Using this is allowed in each window/class/resource
      section. Higher <i>priority</i> values take precedence over lower ones.
      Equal priorities on sections make the imwheelrc file parsed from top to
      bottom to find the first match. Thus <b>@Priority</b> can be used to make
      the file search for matches out of order, then you dont have to keep the
      entries in order if you so please. The supplied imwheelrc file contains
      extensive comments and examples of the <b>@Priority</b> function.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    The default <i>priority</i> for any new section is 0. The last
      <b>@Priority</b> command in a section overrides all previous priorities
      for that section. Thus each section has only one <i>priority</i> setting
      in the end. Priorities are kept as an int, thus range from INT_MAX to
      INT_MIN. (See /usr/include/limits.h for these values on your system.)</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_HELPER"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION_HELPER">CONFIGURATION
  HELPER</a></h1>
IMWheel contains a semi-hidden configuration helper which can be brought up by
  rolling up and down a few times in the root window of the X server. Inside
  this window you can find out possible window names to use in your imwheelrc
  file. Press on the mini-screen capture to grab another window, including the
  root window (whole screen).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mouse wheel and button actions can be grabbed along with active modifier keys on
  the keyboard. The mouse wheel/button action is displayed and the X KeySyms are
  displayed beneath it. All this information can be directly entered into an
  imwheelrc as desired.
<div class="Pp"></div>
IMWheel can be restarted to read in a changed imwheelrc file or the configurator
  can be canceled causing imwheel to resume oprations without reading the
  configuration file. To restart, imwheel execs itself as called by the user in
  the first place but adding the <b>-R</b> option to indicate to itself that
  this is a restarted imwheel. The <b>-R</b> is not for use by the user, as it
  bypasses some configuration of imwheel.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="KEYSYMS"><a class="selflink" href="#KEYSYMS">KEYSYMS</a></h1>
The program expects combinations of keysyms to be used by using pipe(|)
  characters to combine them together.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
Alt_R|Shift_R
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
Means right alt <i>and</i> right shift together, not just either one or the
  other! And not one after the other, they are both pressed at the same time
  essentially.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Common Modifier Keysym names used in X:
<pre>
Shift_L     Shift_R
Control_L   Control_R
Alt_L       Alt_R
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
These are probably not currently assigned any keys, unless you <i>xmodmap</i>
  them in:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
Meta_L      Meta_R      (Actually, Sun keyboards have this...)
Super_L     Super_R
Hyper_L     Hyper_R
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And here's some that you may use, and they are <i>somewhere</i> on your
  keyboard. Here's where they were on my keyboard, again, this is not universal.
  Use the <i>xev</i> program to test your own keys on your keyboard!
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
Caps_Lock   = The Caps Lock key!
              (This still turns on and off caps lock!)
Num_Lock    = The Num Lock key!
              (This is not good to use...
               for the same reasons as Caps_Lock)
Multi_key   = The Scroll Lock key!
              (Go figure!)
Mode_switch = Right Alt...for me anyways.
              (This mean I cannot use Alt_R)
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The windows keys may not be assigned any KeySyms, but they will have numbers.
  <i>xmodmap</i> can be used to assign them to a real KeySym.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To find keysym names for any keys available see the
  <b>/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h</b> file, and for any define in that file
  remove the &quot;XK_&quot; for the usable KeySym name in the configuration
  file. The path to this file may differ for you.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Remember, there's always the configurator. And <b>xev</b> will also help here
  too!
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WHEEL_AS_MIDDLE_BUTTON_IN_X"><a class="selflink" href="#WHEEL_AS_MIDDLE_BUTTON_IN_X">WHEEL
  AS MIDDLE BUTTON IN X</a></h1>
Configure the XF86Config without &quot;Emulate3Buttons&quot; and increase
  &quot;Buttons&quot; if it is 2 in the Ponter or InputDevice section. The wheel
  will act as a real middle button and the outer two buttons will act as
  separate buttons (1 and 3), even when pressed together.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Of course if your wheel keeps clicking middle button while you're trying to use
  the wheel you may want to activate the Emulate3Buttons option to disable the
  wheel button! And don't forget to reduce the Buttons argument to 2!

<div class="Pp"></div>
NOTE: most of these are NOT going to work, because of all the limits in X.

<div class="Pp"></div>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Of course...but most of the time it's just that you haven't read everything I've
  written here and in the files of the distribution itself. Even then, you may
  be giving up too easily. Keep trying, it's not that hard. I am always working
  to reduce strange behavior. This is still a beta, as indicated by the leading
  0 in the version number.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Real Bugs</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
imwheel doesn't get along with itself on the same X display. This will always be
  your fault :-/
<div class="Pp"></div>
Stick mice are still a pain in the butt to use. - This is the manufacturer's
  fault. Or X Windows' fault, for not having a method to easily use such devices
  in all applications.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Keyboard focus isn't changed automatically to input keys into Window mouse is
  over. This only occurs with Click-to-Focus type focus managment in window
  managers. I use sloppy focus in fvwm2, which always works for me. - Whose
  fault <i>is</i> this? (Switch focus modes and/or window managers, or try the
  <b>-f</b> option on imwheel)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Configuration file is not validated for correctness nicely... although it does
  get preparsed before the main program starts, thus stopping you before you run
  with an invalid configuration file. I just have never made a bad configuration
  file, so I guess I'll have to try and do that to see what happens. Just don't
  make any mistakes and you'll be fine.
