cvsconvert - perform a Git conversion and test against the CVS original

<b>cvsconvert</b> [-v] [-n] [-p] [-k expandspec] [repo | repo/module]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
cvsconvert performs a conversion of a CVS repository to Git and checks the tree
  contents at all branch tips and tags to verify that the histories are the
  same.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
(An exception: synthetic gitspace branches enamed *-UNNAMED-BRANCH created to
  collect homeless CVS commits are not checked. You will see a warning when one
  of these is skipped.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The single argument must be a path to a directory containing a a CVS repository
  or module. If it is a CVS top-level directory and there is only one module
  beneath the module need not be specified.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The Git conversion is left in a directory named after the repo argument, with a
  suffix of &quot;-git&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Normal behavior is for the program to report on each branch and tag, saying
  &quot;trees match as expected&quot;. There are two kinds of problem report:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>&quot;file manifests don&#x2019;t match&quot;</b>: Indicates that the CVS and
  Git versions of this revision in the history contain some filenames that
  don&#x2019;t pair up with each other. (Git and CVS ignore-pattern files are
  ignored and will not trigger this message.) When this message occurs, files in
  common are still checked for equality.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>&quot;%s and %s are different&quot;</b>: Two corresponding CVS and Git files
  do not compare equal. A diff listing will follow.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TROUBLESHOOTING"><a class="selflink" href="#TROUBLESHOOTING">TROUBLESHOOTING</a></h1>
There are two kinds of non-serious conversion glitches: file content mismatches
  due to expanded keyword fields in masters, and files deleted in CVS that occur
  only in the gitspace manifests associated with tags.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can spot content mismatches due to keyword expansion easily. They will
  produce single-line diffs of lines containing dollar signs surrounding keyword
  text. Because binary files can be corrupted by keyword expansion, by default
  cvs-fast-export behaves like cvs -kb mode and does no keyword expansion of its
  own. Thus, you should <b>never see such mismatches</b> unless you have passed
  in a -k option.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
However, you might want to pass in -k k if (a) you believe the CVS masters might
  contain expanded keyword fields but don&#x2019;t want to clean them up by
  hand, and (b) you are confident your repository contains no binary files that
  might false-match an RCS/CVS keyword. If you are wrong about assumption (b)
  you will receive warning messages about content mismatches in the binary
  files.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Manifest mismatches on tags are most likely to occur on files which were deleted
  in CVS but persist under later tags in the Git conversion. You can bet this is
  what&#x2019;s going on if, when you search for the pathname in the CVS
  repository, you find it in an attic directory.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
These spurious reports happens because CVS does not always retain enough
  information to track deletions reliably and is somewhat flaky in its handling
  of &quot;dead&quot;-state revisions. To make your CVS and git repos match
  perfectly, you may need to use add delete fileops to the conversion - or, more
  likely, move existing ones back along their branches to commits that predate
  the gitspace tag - using reposurgeon(1).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Manifest mismatches in the other direction (present in CVS, absent in gitspace)
  should never occur. If one does, submit a bug report.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Any other kind of content or manifest match - but especially any on the master
  branch - is bad news and indicates either a severe repository malformation or
  a bug in cvs-fast-export (or possibly both). Any such situation should be
  reported as a bug.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Conversion bugs are disproportionately likely to occur on older, branches or
  tags from before CVS had reliable commitids. Often the most efficient remedy
  is simply to delete junk branches and tags; reposurgeon(1) makes this easy to
  do.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you need to file a bug, please visit the project website to learn about the
  bug-reporting procedure. There are specific things you can do when preparing
  the report to make a rapid resolution of the problem more likely.

Warning: As of September 2016, stock CVS is known buggy in ways which may affect
  checking the correctness of conversions. For best results, use a CVS version
  with the MirOS patches. These are carried by Debian Linux and derivatives; you
  can check by Looking for &quot;MirDebian&quot; in the output of cvs --version.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This program does not cope gracefully if CVS tagnames that are not legal for Git
  had to be sanitized during conversion.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Because of the way this program works around CVS&#x2019;s requirement for a
  CVSROOT directory, it will require directory write permission on the
  repository directory in that case - otherwise it will abort after a CVS
  message &quot;failed to obtain dir lock in repository&quot;. The repository
  contents are not modified.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The program needs the cvs -R option to access the repository read-only. It will
  therefore fail with versions of GNU CVS older than 1.12.1 (2005) that do not
  have this option.
