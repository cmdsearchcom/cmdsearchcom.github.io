<p>CVSCONVERT(1) CVSCONVERT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cvsconvert - perform a Git conversion and test against the
CVS original</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cvsconvert [-v] [-n] [-p] [-k expandspec] [repo |
repo/module]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cvsconvert performs a conversion of a CVS repository to Git
and checks the tree contents at all branch tips and tags to
verify that the histories are the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(An exception: synthetic
gitspace branches enamed *-UNNAMED-BRANCH created to collect
homeless CVS commits are not checked. You will see a warning
when one of these is skipped.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The single argument must be a
path to a directory containing a a CVS repository or module.
If it is a CVS top-level directory and there is only one
module beneath the module need <br>
not be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Git conversion is left in a
directory named after the repo argument, with a suffix of
&quot;-git&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normal behavior is for the
program to report on each branch and tag, saying &quot;trees
match as expected&quot;. There are two kinds of problem
report:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;file manifests don&acirc;t
match&quot;: Indicates that the CVS and Git versions of this
revision in the history contain some filenames that
don&acirc;t pair up with each other. (Git and CVS <br>
ignore-pattern files are ignored and will not trigger this
message.) When this message occurs, files in common are
still checked for equality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s and %s are
different&quot;: Two corresponding CVS and Git files do not
compare equal. A diff listing will follow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TROUBLESHOOTING <br>
There are two kinds of non-serious conversion glitches: file
content mismatches due to expanded keyword fields in
masters, and files deleted in CVS that occur only in the
<br>
gitspace manifests associated with tags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can spot content mismatches
due to keyword expansion easily. They will produce
single-line diffs of lines containing dollar signs
surrounding keyword text. Because binary <br>
files can be corrupted by keyword expansion, by default
cvs-fast-export behaves like cvs -kb mode and does no
keyword expansion of its own. Thus, you should never see
such <br>
mismatches unless you have passed in a -k option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, you might want to pass
in -k k if (a) you believe the CVS masters might contain
expanded keyword fields but don&acirc;t want to clean them
up by hand, and (b) you are <br>
confident your repository contains no binary files that
might false-match an RCS/CVS keyword. If you are wrong about
assumption (b) you will receive warning messages about <br>
content mismatches in the binary files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Manifest mismatches on tags are
most likely to occur on files which were deleted in CVS but
persist under later tags in the Git conversion. You can bet
this is what&acirc;s going on <br>
if, when you search for the pathname in the CVS repository,
you find it in an attic directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These spurious reports happens
because CVS does not always retain enough information to
track deletions reliably and is somewhat flaky in its
handling of &quot;dead&quot;-state revisions. <br>
To make your CVS and git repos match perfectly, you may need
to use add delete fileops to the conversion - or, more
likely, move existing ones back along their branches to <br>
commits that predate the gitspace tag - using
reposurgeon(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Manifest mismatches in the other
direction (present in CVS, absent in gitspace) should never
occur. If one does, submit a bug report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other kind of content or
manifest match - but especially any on the master branch -
is bad news and indicates either a severe repository
malformation or a bug in <br>
cvs-fast-export (or possibly both). Any such situation
should be reported as a bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conversion bugs are
disproportionately likely to occur on older, branches or
tags from before CVS had reliable commitids. Often the most
efficient remedy is simply to delete junk <br>
branches and tags; reposurgeon(1) makes this easy to do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need to file a bug,
please visit the project website to learn about the
bug-reporting procedure. There are specific things you can
do when preparing the report to make a <br>
rapid resolution of the problem more likely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-p <br>
Enable progress reports from cvs-fast-export as it runs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k <br>
Pass a keyword-expansion specification to cvs-fast-export(1)
and cvs(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n <br>
Test only, do not keep the Git conversion after emitting
diagnostics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
Verbose. Show subcommands as they are being executed, and
various debugging messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q <br>
Tell cvs-fast-export to run quietly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
Warning: As of September 2016, stock CVS is known buggy in
ways which may affect checking the correctness of
conversions. For best results, use a CVS version with the
MirOS <br>
patches. These are carried by Debian Linux and derivatives;
you can check by Looking for &quot;MirDebian&quot; in the
output of cvs --version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program does not cope
gracefully if CVS tagnames that are not legal for Git had to
be sanitized during conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because of the way this program
works around CVS&acirc;s requirement for a CVSROOT
directory, it will require directory write permission on the
repository directory in that case - <br>
otherwise it will abort after a CVS message &quot;failed to
obtain dir lock in repository&quot;. The repository contents
are not modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program needs the cvs -R
option to access the repository read-only. It will therefore
fail with versions of GNU CVS older than 1.12.1 (2005) that
do not have this option.</p>
