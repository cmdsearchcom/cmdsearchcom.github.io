<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-annex-sync - synchronize local repository with
remotes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git annex sync [remote ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Use this command when you want to synchronize the local
repository with one or more of its remotes. You can specify
the remotes (or remote groups) to sync with by name; the
<br>
default if none are specified is to sync with all
remotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sync process involves first
committing any local changes to files that have previously
been added to the repository, then fetching and merging the
synced/master and the git- <br>
annex branch from the remote repositories, and finally
pushing the changes back to those branches on the remote
repositories. You can use standard git commands to do each
of <br>
those steps by hand, or if you don&rsquo;t want to worry
about the details, you can use sync.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The content of annexed objects
is not synced by default, but the --content option (see
below) can make that also be synchronized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Merge conflicts are
automatically handled by sync. When two conflicting versions
of a file have been committed, both will be added to the
tree, under different filenames. For <br>
example, file &quot;foo&quot; would be replaced with
&quot;foo.somekey&quot; and &quot;foo.otherkey&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that syncing with a remote
will not update the remote&rsquo;s working tree with changes
made to the local repository. However, those changes are
pushed to the remote, so they can <br>
be merged into its working tree by running &quot;git annex
sync&quot; on the remote.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--fast</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only sync with the remotes with
the lowest annex-cost value configured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--commit, --no-commit <br>
A commit is done by default. Use --no-commit to avoid
committing local changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--message=msg <br>
Use this option to specify a commit message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pull, --no-pull <br>
By default, git pulls from remotes. Use --no-pull to
disable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--push, --no-push <br>
By default, git pushes to remotes. Use --no-push to
disable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--content, --no-content <br>
Normally, syncing does not transfer the contents of annexed
files. The --content option causes the content of files in
the work tree to also be uploaded and downloaded as <br>
necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally this tries to get each
annexed file in the work tree that the local repository does
not yet have, and then copies each file in the work tree to
every remote that <br>
it is syncing with. This behavior can be overridden by
configuring the preferred content of a repository. See
git-annex-preferred-content(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--all This option, when combined
with --content, makes all available versions of all files be
synced, when preferred content settings allow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that preferred content
settings that use include= or exclude= will only match the
version of files currently in the work tree, but not past
versions of files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--jobs=N -JN <br>
Enables parallel syncing with up to the specified number of
jobs running at once. For example: -J10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When there are multiple git
remotes, pushes will be made to them in parallel. Pulls are
not done in parallel because that tends to be less
efficient. When --content is <br>
synced, the files are processed in parallel as well.</p>
