Dalvik Debug Monitor Service (DDMS) provides port-forwarding services, screen
  capture on the device, thread and heap information on the device, logcat,
  process, and radio state information, incoming call and SMS spoofing, location
  data spoofing, and more. This page provides a modest discussion of DDMS
  features; it is not an exhaustive exploration of all the features and
  capabilities.
<div class="Pp"></div>
DDMS will work with both the emulator and a connected device. If both are
  connected and running simultaneously, DDMS defaults to the emulator.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_DDMS_works"><a class="selflink" href="#How_DDMS_works">How
  DDMS works</a></h2>
DDMS acts as a middleman to connect the IDE to the applications running on the
  device. On Android, every application runs in its own process, each of which
  hosts its own virtual machine (VM). And each process listens for a debugger on
  a different port.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When it starts, DDMS connects to adb and starts a device monitoring service
  between the two, which will notify DDMS when a device is connected or
  disconnected. When a device is connected, a VM monitoring service is created
  between adb and DDMS, which will notify DDMS when a VM on the device is
  started or terminated. Once a VM is running, DDMS retrieves the the VM's
  process ID (pid), via adb, and opens a connection to the VM's debugger,
  through the adb daemon (adbd) on the device. DDMS can now talk to the VM using
  a custom wire protocol.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For each VM on the device, DDMS opens a port upon which it will listen for a
  debugger. For the first VM, DDMS listens for a debugger on port 8600, the next
  on 8601, and so on. When a debugger connects to one of these ports, all
  traffic is forwarded between the debugger and the associated VM. Debugging can
  then process like any remote debugging session.
<div class="Pp"></div>
DDMS also opens another local port, the DDMS &quot;base port&quot; (8700, by
  default), upon which it also listens for a debugger. When a debugger connects
  to this base port, all traffic is forwarded to the VM currently selected in
  DDMS, so this is typically where you debugger should connect.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Tip: You can set a number of DDMS preferences in File &gt; Preferences.
  Preferences are saved to &quot;$HOME/.ddmsrc&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Known debugging issues with Dalvik</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Debugging an application in the Dalvik VM should work the same as it does in
  other VMs. However, when single-stepping out of synchronized code, the
  &quot;current line&quot; cursor may jump to the last line in the method for
  one step.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Left_Pane"><a class="selflink" href="#Left_Pane">Left
  Pane</a></h2>
The left side of the Debug Monitor shows each emulator/device currently found,
  with a list of all the VMs currently running within each. VMs are identified
  by the package name of the application it hosts.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Use this list to find and attach to the VM running the activity(ies) that you
  want to debug. Next to each VM in the list is a &quot;debugger
  pass-through&quot; port (in the right-most column). If you connect your
  debugger to one of the the ports listed, you will be connected to the
  corresponding VM on the device. However, when using DDMS, you need only
  connect to port 8700, as DDMS forwards all traffic here to the currently
  selected VM. (Notice, as you select a VM in the list, the listed port includes
  8700.) This way, there's no need to reconfigure the debugger's port each time
  you switch between VMs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When an application running on the device calls <i>waitForDebugger()</i> (or you
  select this option in the developer options), a red icon will be shown next to
  the client name, while it waits for the debugger to attach to the VM. When a
  debugger is connected, the icon will turn green.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you see a crossed-out bug icon, this means that the DDMS was unable to
  complete a connection between the debugger and the VM because it was unable to
  open the VM's local port. If you see this for all VMs on the device, it is
  likely because you have another instance of DDMS running (this includes the
  Eclipse plugin).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you see a question mark in place of an application package, this means that,
  once DDMS received the application pid from adb, it somehow failed to make a
  successful handshake with the VM process. Try restarting DDMS.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Right_pane"><a class="selflink" href="#Right_pane">Right
  pane</a></h2>
On the right side, the Debug Monitor provides tabs that display useful
  information and some useful tools.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Info"><a class="selflink" href="#Info">Info</a></h2>
This view shows some general information about the selected VM, including the
  process ID, package name, and VM version.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Threads"><a class="selflink" href="#Threads">Threads</a></h2>
The threads view has a list of threads running in the process of the target VM.
  To reduce the amount of data sent over the wire, the thread updates are only
  sent when explicitly enabled by toggling the &quot;threads&quot; button in the
  toolbar. This toggle is maintained per VM. This tab includes the following
  information:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ID</b> a VM-assigned unique thread ID. In Dalvik, these are odd numbers
  starting from 3.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Tid</b> the Linux thread ID. For the main thread in a process, this will
  match the process ID.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Status</b> the VM thread status. Daemon threads are shown with an asterisk
  (*). This will be one of the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    running  - executing application code
    sleeping - called Thread.sleep()
    monitor  - waiting to acquire a monitor lock
    wait     - in Object.wait()
    native   - executing native code
    vmwait   - waiting on a VM resource
    zombie   - thread is in the process of dying
    init     - thread is initializing (you shouldn't see this)
    starting - thread is about to start (you shouldn't see this either)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>utime</b> cumulative time spent executing user code, in &quot;jiffies&quot;
  (usually 10ms). Only available under Linux.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>stime</b> cumulative time spent executing system code, in &quot;jiffies&quot;
  (usually 10ms).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Name</b> the name of the thread
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;ID&quot; and &quot;Name&quot; are set when the thread is started. The
  remaining fields are updated periodically (default is every 4 seconds).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="VM_Heap"><a class="selflink" href="#VM_Heap">VM
  Heap</a></h2>
Displays some heap stats, updated during garbage collection. If, when a VM is
  selected, the VM Heap view says that heap updates are not enabled, click the
  &quot;Show heap updates&quot; button, located in the top-left toolbar. Back in
  the VM Heap view, click Cause GC to perform garbage collection and update the
  heap stats.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Allocation_Tracker"><a class="selflink" href="#Allocation_Tracker">Allocation
  Tracker</a></h2>
In this view, you can track the memory allocation of each virtual machine. With
  a VM selected in the left pane, click Start Tracking, then Get Allocations to
  view all allocations since tracking started. The table below will be filled
  with all the relevant data. Click it again to refresh the list.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Emulator_Control"><a class="selflink" href="#Emulator_Control">Emulator
  Control</a></h2>
With these controls, you can simulate special device states and activities.
  Features include:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Telephony Status</b> change the state of the phone's Voice and Data plans
  (home, roaming, searching, etc.), and simulate different kinds of network
  Speed and Latency (GPRS, EDGE, UTMS, etc.).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Telephony Actions</b> perform simulated phone calls and SMS messages to the
  emulator.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Location Controls</b> send mock location data to the emulator so that you can
  perform location-aware operations like GPS mapping.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To use the Location Controls, launch your application in the Android emulator
  and open DDMS. Click the Emulator Controls tab and scroll down to Location
  Controls. From here, you can:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Manually send individual longitude/latitude coordinates to
      the device.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Click Manual, select the coordinate format, fill in the fields and click
      Send.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use a GPX file describing a route for playback to the
      device.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Click GPX and load the file. Once loaded, click the play button to playback
      the route for your location-aware application.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When performing playback from GPX, you can adjust the speed of playback from
      the DDMS panel and control playback with the pause and skip buttons. DDMS
      will parse both the waypoints (&lt;wpt&gt;, in the first table), and the
      tracks (&lt;trk&gt;, in the second table, with support for multiple
      segments, &lt;trkseg&gt;, although they are simply concatenated). Only the
      tracks can be played. Clicking a waypoint in the first list simply sends
      its coordinate to the device, while selecting a track lets you play
    it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use a KML file describing individual placemarks for
      sequenced playback to the device.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Click KML and load the file. Once loaded, click the play button to send the
      coordinates to your location-aware application.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When using a KML file, it is parsed for a &lt;coordinates&gt; element. The
      value of which should be a single set of longitude, latitude and altitude
      figures. For example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &lt;coordinates&gt;-122.084143,37.421972,4&lt;/coordinates&gt;
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In your file, you may include multiple &lt;Placemark&gt; elements, each
      containing a &lt;coordinates&gt; element. When you do so, the collection
      of placemarks will be added as tracks. DDMS will send one placemark per
      second to the device.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>Note:</b> DDMS does not support routes created with the
      &lt;MultiGeometry&gt;&lt;LineString&gt;lat1, long1, lat2, long2,
      ...&lt;/LineString&gt;&lt;/MultiGeometry&gt; methods. There is also
      currently no support for the &lt;TimeStamp&gt; node inside the
      &lt;Placemark&gt;. Future releases may support timed placement and routes
      within a single coordinate element.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="File_Explorer"><a class="selflink" href="#File_Explorer">File
  Explorer</a></h2>
With the File Explorer, you can view the device file system and perform basic
  management, like pushing and pulling files. This circumvents using the adb
  push and pull commands, with a GUI experience.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With DDMS open, select Device &gt; File Explorer... to open the File Explorer
  window. You can drag-and-drop into the device directories, but cannot drag out
  of them. To copy files from the device, select the file and click the Pull
  File from Device button in the toolbar. To delete files, use the Delete button
  in the toolbar.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you're interested in using an SD card image on the emulator, you're still
  required to use the mksdcard command to create an image, and then mount it
  during emulator bootup. For example, from the /tools directory, execute:
<div class="Pp"></div>
$ mksdcard 1024M ./img $ emulator -sdcard ./img
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now, when the emulator is running, the DDMS File Explorer will be able to read
  and write to the sdcard directory. However, your files may not appear
  automatically. For example, if you add an MP3 file to the sdcard, the media
  player won't see them until you restart the emulator. (When restarting the
  emulator from command line, be sure to mount the sdcard again.)
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Screen_Capture"><a class="selflink" href="#Screen_Capture">Screen
  Capture</a></h2>
You can capture screen images on the device or emulator by selecting Device &gt;
  Screen capture... in the menu bar, or press CTRL-S.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Exploring_Processes"><a class="selflink" href="#Exploring_Processes">Exploring
  Processes</a></h2>
You can see the output of ps -x for a specific VM by selecting Device &gt; Show
  process status... in the menu bar.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Cause_a_GC_to_Occur"><a class="selflink" href="#Cause_a_GC_to_Occur">Cause
  a GC to Occur</a></h2>
Cause garbage collection to occury by pressing the trash can button on the
  toolbar.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Running_Dumpsys_and_Dumpstate_on_the_Device_(logcat)"><a class="selflink" href="#Running_Dumpsys_and_Dumpstate_on_the_Device_(logcat)">Running
  Dumpsys and Dumpstate on the Device (logcat)</a></h2>
To run dumpsys (logcat) from Dalvik, select Device &gt; Run logcat... in the
  menu bar.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To run dumpstate from Dalvik, select Device &gt; Dump device state... in the
  menu bar.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Examine_Radio_State"><a class="selflink" href="#Examine_Radio_State">Examine
  Radio State</a></h2>
By default, radio state is not output during a standard logcat (it is a lot of
  information). To see radio information, either click Device &gt; Dump radio
  state... or run logcat as described in Logging Radio Information.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Stop_a_Virtual_Machine"><a class="selflink" href="#Stop_a_Virtual_Machine">Stop
  a Virtual Machine</a></h2>
You can stop a virtual machine by selecting Actions &gt; Halt VM. Pressing this
  button causes the VM to call <i>System.exit</i>(1).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="KNOWN_ISSUES"><a class="selflink" href="#KNOWN_ISSUES">KNOWN
  ISSUES</a></h1>
If you connect and disconnect a debugger, ddms drops and reconnects the client
  so the VM realizes that the debugger has gone away. This will be fixed
  eventually.
