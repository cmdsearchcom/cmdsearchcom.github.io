<p>DDMS(1) Android SDK Tools DDMS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ddms - a graphical debugging tool for Android</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ddms</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Dalvik Debug Monitor Service (DDMS) provides port-forwarding
services, screen capture on the device, thread and heap
information on the device, logcat, process, and radio state
<br>
information, incoming call and SMS spoofing, location data
spoofing, and more. This page provides a modest discussion
of DDMS features; it is not an exhaustive exploration of all
<br>
the features and capabilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DDMS will work with both the
emulator and a connected device. If both are connected and
running simultaneously, DDMS defaults to the emulator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How DDMS works <br>
DDMS acts as a middleman to connect the IDE to the
applications running on the device. On Android, every
application runs in its own process, each of which hosts its
own virtual <br>
machine (VM). And each process listens for a debugger on a
different port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When it starts, DDMS connects to
adb and starts a device monitoring service between the two,
which will notify DDMS when a device is connected or
disconnected. When a device is <br>
connected, a VM monitoring service is created between adb
and DDMS, which will notify DDMS when a VM on the device is
started or terminated. Once a VM is running, DDMS retrieves
<br>
the the VM&rsquo;s process ID (pid), via adb, and opens a
connection to the VM&rsquo;s debugger, through the adb
daemon (adbd) on the device. DDMS can now talk to the VM
using a custom wire <br>
protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each VM on the device, DDMS
opens a port upon which it will listen for a debugger. For
the first VM, DDMS listens for a debugger on port 8600, the
next on 8601, and so on. <br>
When a debugger connects to one of these ports, all traffic
is forwarded between the debugger and the associated VM.
Debugging can then process like any remote debugging
session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DDMS also opens another local
port, the DDMS &quot;base port&quot; (8700, by default),
upon which it also listens for a debugger. When a debugger
connects to this base port, all traffic is <br>
forwarded to the VM currently selected in DDMS, so this is
typically where you debugger should connect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tip: You can set a number of
DDMS preferences in File &gt; Preferences. Preferences are
saved to &quot;$HOME/.ddmsrc&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known debugging issues with
Dalvik</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debugging an application in the
Dalvik VM should work the same as it does in other VMs.
However, when single-stepping out of synchronized code, the
&quot;current line&quot; cursor may jump <br>
to the last line in the method for one step.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Left Pane <br>
The left side of the Debug Monitor shows each
emulator/device currently found, with a list of all the VMs
currently running within each. VMs are identified by the
package name of <br>
the application it hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this list to find and attach
to the VM running the activity(ies) that you want to debug.
Next to each VM in the list is a &quot;debugger
pass-through&quot; port (in the right-most <br>
column). If you connect your debugger to one of the the
ports listed, you will be connected to the corresponding VM
on the device. However, when using DDMS, you need only
connect <br>
to port 8700, as DDMS forwards all traffic here to the
currently selected VM. (Notice, as you select a VM in the
list, the listed port includes 8700.) This way,
there&rsquo;s no need <br>
to reconfigure the debugger&rsquo;s port each time you
switch between VMs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an application running on
the device calls waitForDebugger() (or you select this
option in the developer options), a red icon will be shown
next to the client name, while it <br>
waits for the debugger to attach to the VM. When a debugger
is connected, the icon will turn green.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you see a crossed-out bug
icon, this means that the DDMS was unable to complete a
connection between the debugger and the VM because it was
unable to open the VM&rsquo;s local port. <br>
If you see this for all VMs on the device, it is likely
because you have another instance of DDMS running (this
includes the Eclipse plugin).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you see a question mark in
place of an application package, this means that, once DDMS
received the application pid from adb, it somehow failed to
make a successful handshake <br>
with the VM process. Try restarting DDMS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Right pane <br>
On the right side, the Debug Monitor provides tabs that
display useful information and some useful tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Info <br>
This view shows some general information about the selected
VM, including the process ID, package name, and VM
version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Threads <br>
The threads view has a list of threads running in the
process of the target VM. To reduce the amount of data sent
over the wire, the thread updates are only sent when
explicitly <br>
enabled by toggling the &quot;threads&quot; button in the
toolbar. This toggle is maintained per VM. This tab includes
the following information:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ID a VM-assigned unique thread
ID. In Dalvik, these are odd numbers starting from 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tid the Linux thread ID. For the
main thread in a process, this will match the process
ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Status the VM thread status.
Daemon threads are shown with an asterisk (*). This will be
one of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">running - executing application
code <br>
sleeping - called Thread.sleep() <br>
monitor - waiting to acquire a monitor lock <br>
wait - in Object.wait() <br>
native - executing native code <br>
vmwait - waiting on a VM resource <br>
zombie - thread is in the process of dying <br>
init - thread is initializing (you shouldn&rsquo;t see this)
<br>
starting - thread is about to start (you shouldn&rsquo;t see
this either)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utime cumulative time spent
executing user code, in &quot;jiffies&quot; (usually 10ms).
Only available under Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stime cumulative time spent
executing system code, in &quot;jiffies&quot; (usually
10ms).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name the name of the thread</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ID&quot; and
&quot;Name&quot; are set when the thread is started. The
remaining fields are updated periodically (default is every
4 seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VM Heap <br>
Displays some heap stats, updated during garbage collection.
If, when a VM is selected, the VM Heap view says that heap
updates are not enabled, click the &quot;Show heap
updates&quot; <br>
button, located in the top-left toolbar. Back in the VM Heap
view, click Cause GC to perform garbage collection and
update the heap stats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allocation Tracker <br>
In this view, you can track the memory allocation of each
virtual machine. With a VM selected in the left pane, click
Start Tracking, then Get Allocations to view all allocations
<br>
since tracking started. The table below will be filled with
all the relevant data. Click it again to refresh the
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Emulator Control <br>
With these controls, you can simulate special device states
and activities. Features include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Telephony Status change the
state of the phone&rsquo;s Voice and Data plans (home,
roaming, searching, etc.), and simulate different kinds of
network Speed and Latency (GPRS, EDGE, <br>
UTMS, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Telephony Actions perform
simulated phone calls and SMS messages to the emulator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Location Controls send mock
location data to the emulator so that you can perform
location-aware operations like GPS mapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use the Location Controls,
launch your application in the Android emulator and open
DDMS. Click the Emulator Controls tab and scroll down to
Location Controls. From here, you <br>
can:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Manually send individual
longitude/latitude coordinates to the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Click Manual, select the
coordinate format, fill in the fields and click Send.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Use a GPX file describing a
route for playback to the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Click GPX and load the file.
Once loaded, click the play button to playback the route for
your location-aware application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When performing playback from
GPX, you can adjust the speed of playback from the DDMS
panel and control playback with the pause and skip buttons.
DDMS will parse both the <br>
waypoints (&lt;wpt&gt;, in the first table), and the tracks
(&lt;trk&gt;, in the second table, with support for multiple
segments, &lt;trkseg&gt;, although they are simply
concatenated). Only <br>
the tracks can be played. Clicking a waypoint in the first
list simply sends its coordinate to the device, while
selecting a track lets you play it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Use a KML file describing
individual placemarks for sequenced playback to the
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Click KML and load the file.
Once loaded, click the play button to send the coordinates
to your location-aware application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using a KML file, it is
parsed for a &lt;coordinates&gt; element. The value of which
should be a single set of longitude, latitude and altitude
figures. For example:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;coordinates&gt;-122.084143,37.421972,4&lt;/coordinates&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In your file, you may include
multiple &lt;Placemark&gt; elements, each containing a
&lt;coordinates&gt; element. When you do so, the collection
of placemarks will be added as tracks. <br>
DDMS will send one placemark per second to the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: DDMS does not support
routes created with the
&lt;MultiGeometry&gt;&lt;LineString&gt;lat1, long1, lat2,
long2, ...&lt;/LineString&gt;&lt;/MultiGeometry&gt; methods.
There is also currently no <br>
support for the &lt;TimeStamp&gt; node inside the
&lt;Placemark&gt;. Future releases may support timed
placement and routes within a single coordinate element.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File Explorer <br>
With the File Explorer, you can view the device file system
and perform basic management, like pushing and pulling
files. This circumvents using the adb push and pull
commands, <br>
with a GUI experience.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With DDMS open, select Device
&gt; File Explorer... to open the File Explorer window. You
can drag-and-drop into the device directories, but cannot
drag out of them. To copy files <br>
from the device, select the file and click the Pull File
from Device button in the toolbar. To delete files, use the
Delete button in the toolbar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re interested in
using an SD card image on the emulator, you&rsquo;re still
required to use the mksdcard command to create an image, and
then mount it during emulator bootup. <br>
For example, from the /tools directory, execute:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ mksdcard 1024M ./img $
emulator -sdcard ./img</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, when the emulator is
running, the DDMS File Explorer will be able to read and
write to the sdcard directory. However, your files may not
appear automatically. For example, <br>
if you add an MP3 file to the sdcard, the media player
won&rsquo;t see them until you restart the emulator. (When
restarting the emulator from command line, be sure to mount
the sdcard <br>
again.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Screen Capture <br>
You can capture screen images on the device or emulator by
selecting Device &gt; Screen capture... in the menu bar, or
press CTRL-S.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exploring Processes <br>
You can see the output of ps -x for a specific VM by
selecting Device &gt; Show process status... in the menu
bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cause a GC to Occur <br>
Cause garbage collection to occury by pressing the trash can
button on the toolbar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running Dumpsys and Dumpstate on
the Device (logcat) <br>
To run dumpsys (logcat) from Dalvik, select Device &gt; Run
logcat... in the menu bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To run dumpstate from Dalvik,
select Device &gt; Dump device state... in the menu bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examine Radio State <br>
By default, radio state is not output during a standard
logcat (it is a lot of information). To see radio
information, either click Device &gt; Dump radio state... or
run logcat as <br>
described in Logging Radio Information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stop a Virtual Machine <br>
You can stop a virtual machine by selecting Actions &gt;
Halt VM. Pressing this button causes the VM to call
System.exit(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN ISSUES <br>
If you connect and disconnect a debugger, ddms drops and
reconnects the client so the VM realizes that the debugger
has gone away. This will be fixed eventually.</p>
