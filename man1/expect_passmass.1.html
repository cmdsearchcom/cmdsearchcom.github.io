<p>PASSMASS(1) General Commands Manual PASSMASS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
passmass - change password on multiple machines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
passmass [ host1 host2 host3 ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION <br>
Passmass changes a password on multiple machines. If you
have accounts on several machines that do not share password
databases, Passmass can help you keep them all in sync. <br>
This, in turn, will make it easier to change them more
frequently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When Passmass runs, it asks you
for the old and new passwords. (If you are changing root
passwords and have equivalencing, the old password is not
used and may be omitted.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Passmass understands the
&quot;usual&quot; conventions. Additional arguments may be
used for tuning. They affect all hosts which follow until
another argument overrides it. For example, <br>
if you are known as &quot;libes&quot; on host1 and host2,
but &quot;don&quot; on host3, you would say:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">passmass host1 host2 -user don
host3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-user <br>
User whose password will be changed. By default, the current
user is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rlogin <br>
Use rlogin to access host. (default)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-slogin <br>
Use slogin to access host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ssh <br>
Use ssh to access host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-telnet <br>
Use telnet to access host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next argument is a program to
run to set the password. Default is &quot;passwd&quot;.
Other common choices are &quot;yppasswd&quot; and &quot;set
passwd&quot; (e.g., VMS hosts). A program name <br>
such as &quot;password fred&quot; can be used to create
entries for new accounts (when run as root).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-prompt <br>
Next argument is a prompt suffix pattern. This allows the
script to know when the shell is prompting. The default is
&quot;# &quot; for root and &quot;% &quot; for non-root
accounts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-timeout <br>
Next argument is the number of seconds to wait for
responses. Default is 30 but some systems can be much slower
logging in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-su</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next argument is 1 or 0. If 1,
you are additionally prompted for a root password which is
used to su after logging in. root&rsquo;s password is
changed rather than the <br>
user&rsquo;s. This is useful for hosts which do not allow
root to log in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW TO USE <br>
The best way to run Passmass is to put the command in a
one-line shell script or alias. Whenever you get a new
account on a new machine, add the appropriate arguments to
the <br>
command. Then run it whenever you want to change your
passwords on all the hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
Using the same password on multiple hosts carries risks. In
particular, if the password can be stolen, then all of your
accounts are at risk. Thus, you should not use Passmass <br>
in situations where your password is visible, such as across
a network which hackers are known to eavesdrop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the other hand, if you have
enough accounts with different passwords, you may end up
writing them down somewhere - and that can be a security
problem. Funny story: my college <br>
roommate had an 11&quot;x13&quot; piece of paper on which he
had listed accounts and passwords all across the Internet.
This was several years worth of careful work and he carried
it with <br>
him everywhere he went. Well one day, he forgot to remove it
from his jeans, and we found a perfectly blank sheet of
paper when we took out the wash the following day!</p>
