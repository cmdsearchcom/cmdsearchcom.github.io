<p>TOUCH(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
TOUCH(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
touch &acirc; change file access and modification times</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
touch [&acirc;acm] [&acirc;r ref_file|&acirc;t time|&acirc;d
date_time] file...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The touch utility shall change the last data modification
timestamps, the last data access timestamps, or both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The time used can be specified
by the &acirc;t time option-argument, the corresponding time
fields of the file referenced by the &acirc;r ref_file
option-argument, or the &acirc;d date_time <br>
option-argument, as specified in the following sections. If
none of these are specified, touch shall use the current
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each file operand, touch
shall perform actions equivalent to the following functions
defined in the System Interfaces volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If file does not exist:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. The creat() function is
called with the following arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- The file operand is used as
the path argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- The value of the
bitwise-inclusive OR of S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP,
S_IROTH, and S_IWOTH is used as the mode argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. The futimens() function is
called with the following arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- The file descriptor opened in
step 1a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- The access time and the
modification time, set as described in the OPTIONS section,
are used as the first and second elements of the times array
argument, respec&acirc; <br>
tively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If file exists, the
utimensat() function is called with the following
arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. The AT_FDCWD special value is
used as the fd argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. The file operand is used as
the path argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c. The access time and the
modification time, set as described in the OPTIONS section,
are used as the first and second elements of the times array
argument, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d. The flag argument is set to
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The touch utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;a Change the access time
of file. Do not change the modification time unless &acirc;m
is also specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;c Do not create a
specified file if it does not exist. Do not write any
diagnostic messages concerning this condition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;d date_time <br>
Use the specified date_time instead of the current time. The
option-argument shall be a string of the form:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">YYYY&acirc;MM&acirc;DDThh:mm:SS[.frac][tz]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">YYYY&acirc;MM&acirc;DDThh:mm:SS[,frac][tz]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* YYYY are at least four decimal
digits giving the year.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* MM, DD, hh, mm, and SS are as
with &acirc;t time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* T is the time designator, and
can be replaced by a single &lt;space&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* [.frac] and [,frac] are either
empty, or a &lt;period&gt; (&rsquo;.&rsquo;) or a
&lt;comma&gt; (&rsquo;,&rsquo;) respectively, followed by
one or more decimal digits, specifying a fractional
second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* [tz] is either empty,
signifying local time, or the letter &rsquo;Z&rsquo;,
signifying UTC. If [tz] is empty, the resulting time shall
be affected by the value of the TZ envi&acirc; <br>
ronment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the resulting time precedes
the Epoch, the behavior is implementation-defined. If the
time cannot be represented as the file&rsquo;s timestamp,
touch shall exit immedi&acirc; <br>
ately with an error status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;m Change the modification
time of file. Do not change the access time unless &acirc;a
is also specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;r ref_file <br>
Use the corresponding time of the file named by the pathname
ref_file instead of the current time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;t time Use the specified
time instead of the current time. The option-argument shall
be a decimal number of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where each two digits represents
the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MM The month of the year
[01,12].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DD The day of the month
[01,31].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hh The hour of the day
[00,23].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mm The minute of the hour
[00,59].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CC The first two digits of the
year (the century).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YY The second two digits of the
year.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SS The second of the minute
[00,60].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both CC and YY shall be
optional. If neither is given, the current year shall be
assumed. If YY is specified, but CC is not, CC shall be
derived as follows:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&not;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;
<br>
&acirc;If YY is: &acirc; CC becomes: &acirc; <br>

&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&frac14;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&curren;
<br>
&acirc; [69,99] &acirc; 19 &acirc; <br>
&acirc; [00,68] &acirc; 20 &acirc; <br>

&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acute;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;
<br>
Note: It is expected that in a future version of this
standard the default century inferred from a 2-digit year
will change. (This would apply to all commands <br>
accepting a 2-digit year as input.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The resulting time shall be
affected by the value of the TZ environment variable. If the
resulting time value precedes the Epoch, the behavior is
implementation- <br>
defined. If the time is out of range for the file&rsquo;s
timestamp, touch shall exit immediately with an error
status. The range of valid times past the Epoch is
implementa&acirc; <br>
tion-defined, but it shall extend to at least the time 0
hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds, January 1, 2038, Coordinated
Universal Time. Some implementations may not be able <br>
to represent dates beyond January 18, 2038, because they use
signed int as a time holder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The range for SS is [00,60]
rather than [00,59] because of leap seconds. If SS is 60,
and the resulting time, as affected by the TZ environment
variable, does not refer <br>
to a leap second, the resulting time shall be one second
after a time where SS is 59. If SS is not given a value, it
is assumed to be zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither the &acirc;a nor
&acirc;m options were specified, touch shall behave as if
both the &acirc;a and &acirc;m options were specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of a file whose
times shall be modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of touch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in argu&acirc; <br>
ments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TZ Determine the timezone to be
used for interpreting the time option-argument. If TZ is
unset or null, an unspecified default timezone shall be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 The utility executed
successfully and all requested changes were made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The interpretation of time is taken to be seconds since the
Epoch (see the Base Definitions volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 4.15, Seconds Since the Epoch).
It should be noted <br>
that implementations conforming to the System Interfaces
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 do not take leap seconds into
account when computing seconds since the Epoch. When SS=60
is used, <br>
the resulting time always refers to 1 plus seconds since the
Epoch for a time when SS=59.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although the &acirc;t time
option-argument specifies values in 1969, the access time
and modification time fields are defined in terms of seconds
since the Epoch (00:00:00 on 1 January <br>
1970 UTC). Therefore, depending on the value of TZ when
touch is run, there is never more than a few valid hours in
1969 and there need not be any valid times in 1969.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One ambiguous situation occurs
if &acirc;t time is not specified, &acirc;r ref_file is not
specified, and the first operand is an eight or ten-digit
decimal number. A portable script can <br>
avoid this problem by using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">touch &acirc;&acirc; file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">touch ./file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the T time designator is
replaced by a &lt;space&gt; for the &acirc;d date_time
option-argument, the &lt;space&gt; must be quoted to prevent
the shell from splitting the argument.</p>

mark instead of the current time. If <br>
the file exists, the last data modification time is not

<p style="margin-top: 1em">touch &acirc;a &acirc;r mark
eggert</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The functionality of touch is described almost entirely
through references to functions in the System Interfaces
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008. In this way, there is no
duplication of <br>
effort required for describing such side-effects as the
relationship of user IDs to the user database, permissions,
and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are some significant
differences between the touch utility in this volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 and those in System V and BSD systems.
They are upwards-compatible for historical <br>
applications from both implementations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. In System V, an ambiguity
exists when a pathname that is a decimal number leads the
operands; it is treated as a time value. In BSD, no time
value is allowed; files may only <br>
be touched to the current time. The &acirc;t time construct
solves these problems for future conforming applications
(note that the &acirc;t option is not historical
practice).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The inclusion of the century
digits, CC, is also new. Note that a ten-digit time value is
treated as if YY, and not CC, were specified. The caveat
about the range of dates <br>
following the Epoch was included as recognition that some
implementations are not able to represent dates beyond 18
January 2038 because they use signed int as a time
holder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;r option was added
because several comments requested this capability. This
option was named &acirc;f in an early proposal, but was
changed because the &acirc;f option is used in the <br>
BSD version of touch with a different meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At least one historical
implementation of touch incremented the exit code if
&acirc;c was specified and the file did not exist. This
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 requires exit status zero if
<br>
no errors occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In previous version of the
standard, if at least two operands are specified, and the
first operand is an eight or ten-digit decimal integer, the
first operand was assumed to be a <br>
date_time operand. This usage was removed in this version of
the standard since it had been marked obsolescent
previously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;d date_time format is
an ISO 8601:2004 standard complete representation of date
and time extended format with an optional decimal point or
&lt;comma&gt; followed by a string of <br>
digits following the seconds portion to specify fractions of
a second. It is not necessary to recognize
&quot;[+/-]hh:mm&quot; and &quot;[+/-]hh&quot; to specify
timezones other than local time and <br>
UTC. The T time designator in the ISO 8601:2004 standard
extended format may be replaced by &lt;space&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
