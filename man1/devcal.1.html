<b>devcal</b> is a utility that is used to calibrate the input and output sound
  levels (deviation) on an FM SvxLink system. The idea is that it should be
  possible to calibrate multiple parts of a SvxLink system to the exact same
  sound levels. This will ensure that a system using multiple receivers have the
  same sound level for all receivers and for a repeater it means that the audio
  being retransmitted is at the same level as the received audio. For an
  EchoLink system it will guarantee that audio received by the local node will
  be at a proper level to be retransmitted on remote EchoLink nodes, and the
  other way around.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
An RTL2832U based DVB-T USB dongle can be used to measure deviation and the
  devcal utility can also be used to calibrate the receiving frequency
  correction for such a dongle.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Deviation calibration can be done both with and without a DVB-T USB dongle. Both
  methods are described below.

      The default is 6dB which mean that SvxLink can handle twice the specified
      maximum deviation. If both maxdev and headroom are left at their default
      this will mean that SvxLink can handle 10kHz deviation without distorsion.

    Changing the headroom cause a lot of different effects so don't do that
      unless you are prepared to deal with the problems. For example, increasing
      the headroom will cause the TX level to get lower and the RX level to get
      higher, which then must be compensated. The announcement levels will get
      lower so they also need to be compensated. The EchoLink RX/TX levels will
      get unbalanced and at the moment there is no way to fix that.</dd>

  AN RTL2832U BASED DVB-T USB DONGLE</a></h1>
All RTL2832U based DVB-T USB dongles requires calibration so that the specified
  receiving frequency is correct. Most dongles are way off in frequency.
  50-60ppm is not uncommon which translates to more than 20kHz on 434MHz.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Most dongles are sensitive to temperature change so start by plugging the dongle
  into the computer and let it warm up for like 15 minutes before doing the
  calibration.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Devcal need a receiver configuration file to work so such a file must be created
  before this utility can be used. Read the Ddr Receiver Section and the
  Wideband Receiver Section in the <b>svxlink.conf</b>(5) manual page for
  information on how to set it up.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A first coarse calibration should be done in wideband mode so that the
  calibration carrier is easy to find. You can use any FM carrier to calibrate
  on that you know is correct in frequency. It does not matter if the carrier is
  modulated or not. Use your own transceiver or a repeater for example. If the
  frequency calibration is unknown for the transmitter being used it may be wise
  to test with multiple transmitters. The command line may look like this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 devcal -Mw /path/to/svxlink.conf RxRtl
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The utility will print, among other things, the carrier frequency error. It may
  look something like:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Tone dev=7.30 Full bw dev=39198.90 Carrier freq err=-27713.53(-64ppm)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
We ignore the first two values for now and concentrate on the carrier frequency
  error. The -64ppm mean that the dongle is receiving the transmitted carrier
  about 27kHz below the set frequency. To compensate for this, set the FQ_CORR
  configuration variable in the wideband receiver configuration section to 64.
  Do another measurement to verify that the received carrier frequency is now
  closer to the expected one.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Now we can do the final calibration in narrow band mode. Remove the
  &quot;w&quot; command line option from the command above and do another
  measurement. Adjust FQ_CORR until a value around 0ppm is shown.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CALIBRATING_THE_TRANSMITTER"><a class="selflink" href="#CALIBRATING_THE_TRANSMITTER">CALIBRATING
  THE TRANSMITTER</a></h1>
In order to calibrate the transmitted deviation we need a way to measure it.
  There are multiple methods to do that. If you have a deviation meter you're in
  luck but most people does not own one of those. Fortuantely there are other
  ways.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
One way is to use a RTL2832U based DVB-T dongle with the devcal utility. First
  calibrate the DVB-T dongle according to the instructions in the previous
  section. The devcal utility can then be used in measurement mode to measure
  the transmitted FM deviation. The measurement mode is activated using the
  &quot;-M&quot; command line option. Use the &quot;-f&quot; command line option
  to specify the audio frequency to calibrate at if the default of 1000Hz need
  to be changed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Another way to measure FM deviation without a deviation meter is to use the
  Bessel null method. It makes use of the fact that the FM carrier will go down
  to zero power for certain combinations of modulation frequency and deviation.
  The deviation divided by the modulation frequency give something called the
  modulation index. Bessel nulls occur at specific modulation indexes where the
  first one is at 2.4048. So, if we choose the deviation to 2404.8Hz and the
  modulation frequency to 1000Hz we should get a Bessel null when the
  transmitter is calibrated. These are the default modulation parameters in
  devcal.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
So how can we detect when the carrier power goes down to zero? If you own some
  form of spectrum analyzer the spectrum can be watched to see when the carrier
  falls down to zero. If you own a CW receiver that covers the frequency of
  interest you can use that to listen to the carrier. Start devcal in
  transmitter calibration mode using a command looking like the one below.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 devcal -t /path/to/svxlink.conf Tx1
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In another window, start the alsamixer utility or some other utility to adjust
  the audio output level. Set the output level to zero. Go back to the devcal
  window and press 0 to set MASTER_GAIN to zero. Press T to start transmitting.
  Since we set the sound output level to zero only a carrier will be
  transmitted. Adjust the CW receiver to center on the carrier. Use the
  narrowest filter that the receiver support. Now start increasing the audio
  output level in alsamixer. Listen to the tone to find the first minimum. Use
  the +/- keys in deval to fine tune the output level to a minimum. You have now
  found the calibration values for the transmitter. The printed value of
  MASTER_GAIN should be entered into the configuration section for the
  transmitter.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CALIBRATING_THE_RECEIVER"><a class="selflink" href="#CALIBRATING_THE_RECEIVER">CALIBRATING
  THE RECEIVER</a></h1>
To calibrate the receiver we need a transmitter with a known calibration. If
  possible, the transmitter that was calibrated above can be used. If it's not
  possible, another transmitter can be calibrated in the same way to be used as
  a calibration transmitter. Start the devcal utility something like this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 devcal -r /path/to/svxlink.conf Rx1
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Start alsamixer in another window and adjust the input level to get as close as
  possible to the expected deviation. Use the 0, + and - keys to adjust PREAMP
  to fine tune the deviation that is shown. When satisfied, enter the PREAMP
  value into the configuration file in the receiver section.

  CALIBRATING USING A DVB-T USB DONGLE</a></h1>
This is an example of how the calibration procedure may be performed using a
  DVB-T USB dongle and an arbitrary transmitter, like a handie tranceiver.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The calibration transmitter, a handie transmitter for example, must be able to
  send some form of modulated tone for this procedure to work. The 1750Hz tone
  burst that many transmitters are equipped with is a good one to use. It is
  also possible to use a DTMF tone but the results is not as good as when using
  a single tone, it seems. If using DTMF, try using the code &quot;A&quot;
  (1633Hz) or &quot;3&quot; (1477Hz). In this example, the use of 1750Hz tone
  burst is described.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Use the DVB-T dongle to measure the deviation of the 1750Hz tone.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 devcal -M -f1750 /path/to/svxlink.conf RxRtl
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Start transmitting with the calibration transmitter and wait for the values to
  stablilize. Take a note of the value for &quot;tone dev&quot;. It may be
  something like 3200Hz, which is used in the example below. Leave deval running
  since we will need it later on.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
On the system being calibrated, start the receiver calibration.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 devcal -r -f1750 /path/to/svxlink.conf Rx1
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Transmit using the calibration transmitter and adjust the input level using
  alsamixer and PREAMP to the correct level for &quot;tone dev&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Make sure that devcal is started in measurement mode like when the deviation on
  the calibration transmitter was measured above. Then, on the system being
  calibrated, start the transmitter calibration.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 devcal -t -f1750 -d3200 /path/to/svxlink.conf RxRtl
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The value of 3200 was the one we measured in the first step. Adjust it to match
  your own measurements. Adjust the output level using alsamixer and MASTER_GAIN
  to get the correct reading for &quot;tone dev&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To check the calibration, use devcal in measurement mode to measure the
  deviation on the transmitter when retransmitting a received signal. For a
  repeater that is easily achieved by transmitting on the receive frequency
  using the calibration transmitter. The deviation measurement should show the
  correct value being retransmitted. For a simplex link the parrot can be used
  to achieve the same thing.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
NOTE: The retransmitted deviation may not be exactly the same for some
  transceivers. This is an issue that remains to find the cause of.
