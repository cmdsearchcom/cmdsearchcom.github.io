devcal - An FM deviation calibration utility for the SvxLink
system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
devcal [-?|--help] [-h|--usage] [-f|--modfqs=frequencies in
Hz] [-d|--caldev=deviation in Hz] [-m|--maxdev=deviation in
Hz] [-H|--headroom=Headroom in dB] [-r|--rxcal] <br>

[-a|--audiodev=type:dev] &lt;config file&gt; &lt;config
section&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
devcal is a utility that is used to calibrate the input and
output sound levels (deviation) on an FM SvxLink system. The
idea is that it should be possible to calibrate multiple
<br>
parts of a SvxLink system to the exact same sound levels.
This will ensure that a system using multiple receivers have
the same sound level for all receivers and for a repeater
<br>
it means that the audio being retransmitted is at the same
level as the received audio. For an EchoLink system it will
guarantee that audio received by the local node will be at
<br>
a proper level to be retransmitted on remote EchoLink nodes,
and the other way around.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An RTL2832U based DVB-T USB
dongle can be used to measure deviation and the devcal
utility can also be used to calibrate the receiving
frequency correction for such a dongle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deviation calibration can be
done both with and without a DVB-T USB dongle. Both methods
are described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-?|--help <br>
Print a help message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h|--usage <br>
Display a brief help message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f|--modfqsfrequencies in Hz
<br>
Use this command line option to set at what frequencies you
want to calibrate the deviation. Separate multiple
frequencies using commas. The default frequency is
1000Hz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d|--caldev=deviation in Hz <br>
The deviation value at where to perform the calibration. The
default value of 2404,8Hz may seem strange but it will be
explained below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m|--maxdev=deviation in Hz <br>
The maximum deviation used on the channel. This is the
deviation value where transmitters start to limit the
deviation so as not to cause interference in neighbouring
<br>
channels. The default value is 5000Hz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H|--headroom=headroom in dB
<br>
The headroom is the margin to add above the maximum
deviation level. Adding a headroom will allow SvxLink to
handle levels above the maximum deviation level without
caus&acirc; <br>
ing immediate distorsion. The default is 6dB which mean that
SvxLink can handle twice the specified maximum deviation. If
both maxdev and headroom are left at their <br>
default this will mean that SvxLink can handle 10kHz
deviation without distorsion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changing the headroom cause a
lot of different effects so don&rsquo;t do that unless you
are prepared to deal with the problems. For example,
increasing the headroom will cause <br>
the TX level to get lower and the RX level to get higher,
which then must be compensated. The announcement levels will
get lower so they also need to be compensated. The <br>
EchoLink RX/TX levels will get unbalanced and at the moment
there is no way to fix that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r|--rxcal <br>
Specify this command line option to perform receiver
calibration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t|--txcal <br>
Specify this command line option to perform transmitter
calibration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F|--flat <br>
Perform calibration on a transmitter or receiver that has a
flat frequency response (no pre- or de-emphasis). If the
transceiver has flat frequency responce but you have <br>
enabled pre-/de-emphasis in SvxLink, this option should NOT
be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M|--measure <br>
The measurement mode requires the use of a RTL2832U based
DVB-T USB dongle and will measure the received
deviation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w|--wide <br>
Use wide FM (broadcast) instead of narrow band FM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a|--audiodev=type:dev <br>
Use this command line option to set an audio device to use
for playing back the received audio. The default is to use
&quot;alsa:default&quot;. Disable audio output by setting
the <br>
audio device to the empty string (i.e.
--audiodev=&quot;&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CALIBRATING AN RTL2832U BASED
DVB-T USB DONGLE <br>
All RTL2832U based DVB-T USB dongles requires calibration so
that the specified receiving frequency is correct. Most
dongles are way off in frequency. 50-60ppm is not uncommon
<br>
which translates to more than 20kHz on 434MHz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most dongles are sensitive to
temperature change so start by plugging the dongle into the
computer and let it warm up for like 15 minutes before doing
the calibration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Devcal need a receiver
configuration file to work so such a file must be created
before this utility can be used. Read the Ddr Receiver
Section and the Wideband Receiver Section <br>
in the svxlink.conf(5) manual page for information on how to
set it up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A first coarse calibration
should be done in wideband mode so that the calibration
carrier is easy to find. You can use any FM carrier to
calibrate on that you know is correct in <br>
frequency. It does not matter if the carrier is modulated or
not. Use your own transceiver or a repeater for example. If
the frequency calibration is unknown for the transmitter
<br>
being used it may be wise to test with multiple
transmitters. The command line may look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">devcal -Mw /path/to/svxlink.conf
RxRtl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The utility will print, among
other things, the carrier frequency error. It may look
something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tone dev=7.30 Full bw
dev=39198.90 Carrier freq err=-27713.53(-64ppm)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We ignore the first two values
for now and concentrate on the carrier frequency error. The
-64ppm mean that the dongle is receiving the transmitted
carrier about 27kHz below the <br>
set frequency. To compensate for this, set the FQ_CORR
configuration variable in the wideband receiver
configuration section to 64. Do another measurement to
verify that the <br>
received carrier frequency is now closer to the expected
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now we can do the final
calibration in narrow band mode. Remove the &quot;w&quot;
command line option from the command above and do another
measurement. Adjust FQ_CORR until a value around <br>
0ppm is shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CALIBRATING THE TRANSMITTER <br>
In order to calibrate the transmitted deviation we need a
way to measure it. There are multiple methods to do that. If
you have a deviation meter you&rsquo;re in luck but most
people <br>
does not own one of those. Fortuantely there are other
ways.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One way is to use a RTL2832U
based DVB-T dongle with the devcal utility. First calibrate
the DVB-T dongle according to the instructions in the
previous section. The devcal util&acirc; <br>
ity can then be used in measurement mode to measure the
transmitted FM deviation. The measurement mode is activated
using the &quot;-M&quot; command line option. Use the
&quot;-f&quot; command line <br>
option to specify the audio frequency to calibrate at if the
default of 1000Hz need to be changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another way to measure FM
deviation without a deviation meter is to use the Bessel
null method. It makes use of the fact that the FM carrier
will go down to zero power for cer&acirc; <br>
tain combinations of modulation frequency and deviation. The
deviation divided by the modulation frequency give something
called the modulation index. Bessel nulls occur at
spe&acirc; <br>
cific modulation indexes where the first one is at 2.4048.
So, if we choose the deviation to 2404.8Hz and the
modulation frequency to 1000Hz we should get a Bessel null
when the <br>
transmitter is calibrated. These are the default modulation
parameters in devcal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So how can we detect when the
carrier power goes down to zero? If you own some form of
spectrum analyzer the spectrum can be watched to see when
the carrier falls down to zero. <br>
If you own a CW receiver that covers the frequency of
interest you can use that to listen to the carrier. Start
devcal in transmitter calibration mode using a command
looking <br>
like the one below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">devcal -t /path/to/svxlink.conf
Tx1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In another window, start the
alsamixer utility or some other utility to adjust the audio
output level. Set the output level to zero. Go back to the
devcal window and press 0 to <br>
set MASTER_GAIN to zero. Press T to start transmitting.
Since we set the sound output level to zero only a carrier
will be transmitted. Adjust the CW receiver to center on the
<br>
carrier. Use the narrowest filter that the receiver support.
Now start increasing the audio output level in alsamixer.
Listen to the tone to find the first minimum. Use the +/-
<br>
keys in deval to fine tune the output level to a minimum.
You have now found the calibration values for the
transmitter. The printed value of MASTER_GAIN should be
entered into <br>
the configuration section for the transmitter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CALIBRATING THE RECEIVER <br>
To calibrate the receiver we need a transmitter with a known
calibration. If possible, the transmitter that was
calibrated above can be used. If it&rsquo;s not possible,
another trans&acirc; <br>
mitter can be calibrated in the same way to be used as a
calibration transmitter. Start the devcal utility something
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">devcal -r /path/to/svxlink.conf
Rx1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Start alsamixer in another
window and adjust the input level to get as close as
possible to the expected deviation. Use the 0, + and - keys
to adjust PREAMP to fine tune the <br>
deviation that is shown. When satisfied, enter the PREAMP
value into the configuration file in the receiver
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE: CALIBRATING USING A
DVB-T USB DONGLE <br>
This is an example of how the calibration procedure may be
performed using a DVB-T USB dongle and an arbitrary
transmitter, like a handie tranceiver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The calibration transmitter, a
handie transmitter for example, must be able to send some
form of modulated tone for this procedure to work. The
1750Hz tone burst that many trans&acirc; <br>
mitters are equipped with is a good one to use. It is also
possible to use a DTMF tone but the results is not as good
as when using a single tone, it seems. If using DTMF, try
<br>
using the code &quot;A&quot; (1633Hz) or &quot;3&quot;
(1477Hz). In this example, the use of 1750Hz tone burst is
described.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the DVB-T dongle to measure
the deviation of the 1750Hz tone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">devcal -M -f1750
/path/to/svxlink.conf RxRtl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Start transmitting with the
calibration transmitter and wait for the values to
stablilize. Take a note of the value for &quot;tone
dev&quot;. It may be something like 3200Hz, which is used
<br>
in the example below. Leave deval running since we will need
it later on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the system being calibrated,
start the receiver calibration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">devcal -r -f1750
/path/to/svxlink.conf Rx1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transmit using the calibration
transmitter and adjust the input level using alsamixer and
PREAMP to the correct level for &quot;tone dev&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make sure that devcal is started
in measurement mode like when the deviation on the
calibration transmitter was measured above. Then, on the
system being calibrated, start the <br>
transmitter calibration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">devcal -t -f1750 -d3200
/path/to/svxlink.conf RxRtl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of 3200 was the one we
measured in the first step. Adjust it to match your own
measurements. Adjust the output level using alsamixer and
MASTER_GAIN to get the correct <br>
reading for &quot;tone dev&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To check the calibration, use
devcal in measurement mode to measure the deviation on the
transmitter when retransmitting a received signal. For a
repeater that is easily achieved <br>
by transmitting on the receive frequency using the
calibration transmitter. The deviation measurement should
show the correct value being retransmitted. For a simplex
link the <br>
parrot can be used to achieve the same thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: The retransmitted
deviation may not be exactly the same for some transceivers.
This is an issue that remains to find the cause of.</p>
