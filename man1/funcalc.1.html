<b>funcalc</b> is a calculator program that allows arbitrary expressions to be
  constructed, compiled, and executed on columns in a Funtools table (FITS
  binary table or raw event file). It works by integrating user-supplied
  expression(s) into a template C program, then compiling and executing the
  program. <b>funcalc</b> expressions are C statements, although some important
  simplifications (such as automatic declaration of variables) are supported.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>funcalc</b> expressions can be specified in three ways: on the command line
  using the <b>-e [expression]</b> switch, in a file using the <b>-f [file]</b>
  switch, or from stdin (if neither <b>-e</b> nor <b>-f</b> is specified). Of
  course a file containing <b>funcalc</b> expressions can be read from stdin.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each invocation of <b>funcalc</b> requires an input Funtools table file to be
  specified as the first command line argument. The output Funtools table file
  is the second optional argument. It is needed only if an output FITS file is
  being created (i.e., in cases where the <b>funcalc</b> expression only prints
  values, no output file is needed). If input and output file are both
  specified, a third optional argument can specify the list of columns to
  activate (using <i>FunColumnActivate()</i>). Note that <b>funcalc</b>
  determines whether or not to generate code for writing an output file based on
  the presence or absence of an output file argument.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A <b>funcalc</b> expression executes on each row of a table and consists of one
  or more C statements that operate on the columns of that row (possibly using
  temporary variables). Within an expression, reference is made to a column of
  the <b>current</b> row using the C struct syntax <b>cur-</b>[colname]&gt;,
  e.g. cur-&gt;x, cur-&gt;pha, etc. Local scalar variables can be defined using
  C declarations at very the beginning of the expression, or else they can be
  defined automatically by <b>funcalc</b> (to be of type double). Thus, for
  example, a swap of columns x and y in a table can be performed using either of
  the following equivalent <b>funcalc</b> expressions:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  double temp;
  temp = cur-&gt;x;
  cur-&gt;x = cur-&gt;y;
  cur-&gt;y = temp;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  temp = cur-&gt;x;
  cur-&gt;x = cur-&gt;y;
  cur-&gt;y = temp;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When this expression is executed using a command such as:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  funcalc -f swap.expr itest.ev otest.ev
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
the resulting file will have values of the x and y columns swapped.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, the data type of the variable for a column is the same as the data
  type of the column as stored in the file. This can be changed by appending
  &quot;:[dtype]&quot; to the first reference to that column. In the example
  above, to force x and y to be output as doubles, specify the type 'D'
  explicitly:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  temp = cur-&gt;x:D;
  cur-&gt;x = cur-&gt;y:D;
  cur-&gt;y = temp;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Data type specifiers follow standard FITS table syntax for defining columns
  using TFORM:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A: ASCII characters</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">B: unsigned 8-bit char</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">I: signed 16-bit int</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">U: unsigned 16-bit int (not standard FITS)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">J: signed 32-bit int</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">V: unsigned 32-bit int (not standard FITS)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">E: 32-bit float</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">D: 64-bit float</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">X: bits (treated as an array of chars)</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that only the first reference to a column should contain the explicit data
  type specifier.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Of course, it is important to handle the data type of the columns correctly. One
  of the most frequent cause of error in <b>funcalc</b> programming is the
  implicit use of the wrong data type for a column in expression. For example,
  the calculation:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  dx = (cur-&gt;x - cur-&gt;y)/(cur-&gt;x + cur-&gt;y);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
usually needs to be performed using floating point arithmetic. In cases where
  the x and y columns are integers, this can be done by reading the columns as
  doubles using an explicit type specification:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  dx = (cur-&gt;x:D - cur-&gt;y:D)/(cur-&gt;x + cur-&gt;y);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Alternatively, it can be done using C type-casting in the expression:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  dx = ((double)cur-&gt;x - (double)cur-&gt;y)/((double)cur-&gt;x + (double)cur-&gt;y);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition to accessing columns in the current row, reference also can be made
  to the <b>previous</b> row using <b>prev-</b>[colname]&gt;, and to the
  <b>next</b> row using <b>next-</b>[colname]&gt;. Note that if
  <b>prev-</b>[colname]&gt; is specified in the <b>funcalc</b> expression, the
  very first row is not processed. If <b>next-</b>[colname]&gt; is specified in
  the <b>funcalc</b> expression, the very last row is not processed. In this
  way, <b>prev</b> and <b>next</b> are guaranteed always to point to valid rows.
  For example, to print out the values of the current x column and the previous
  y column, use the C fprintf function in a <b>funcalc</b> expression:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  fprintf(stdout, &quot;%d %d\n&quot;, cur-&gt;x, prev-&gt;y);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
New columns can be specified using the same <b>cur-</b>[colname]&gt; syntax by
  appending the column type (and optional tlmin/tlmax/binsiz specifiers),
  separated by colons. For example, cur-&gt;avg:D will define a new column of
  type double. Type specifiers are the same those used above to specify new data
  types for existing columns.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, to create and output a new column that is the average value of the
  x and y columns, a new &quot;avg&quot; column can be defined:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  cur-&gt;avg:D = (cur-&gt;x + cur-&gt;y)/2.0
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the final ';' is not required for single-line expressions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As with FITS TFORM data type specification, the column data type specifier can
  be preceded by a numeric count to define an array, e.g., &quot;10I&quot; means
  a vector of 10 short ints, &quot;2E&quot; means two single precision floats,
  etc. A new column only needs to be defined once in a <b>funcalc</b>
  expression, after which it can be used without re-specifying the type. This
  includes reference to elements of a column array:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  cur-&gt;avg[0]:2D = (cur-&gt;x + cur-&gt;y)/2.0;
  cur-&gt;avg[1] = (cur-&gt;x - cur-&gt;y)/2.0;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'X' (bits) data type is treated as a char array of dimension
  (numeric_count/8), i.e., 16X is processed as a 2-byte char array. Each 8-bit
  array element is accessed separately:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  cur-&gt;stat[0]:16X  = 1;
  cur-&gt;stat[1]      = 2;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here, a 16-bit column is created with the MSB is set to 1 and the LSB set to 2.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, all processed rows are written to the specified output file. If you
  want to skip writing certain rows, simply execute the C &quot;continue&quot;
  statement at the end of the <b>funcalc</b> expression, since the writing of
  the row is performed immediately after the expression is executed. For
  example, to skip writing rows whose average is the same as the current x
  value:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  cur-&gt;avg[0]:2D = (cur-&gt;x + cur-&gt;y)/2.0;
  cur-&gt;avg[1] = (cur-&gt;x - cur-&gt;y)/2.0;
  if( cur-&gt;avg[0] == cur-&gt;x )
    continue;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If no output file argument is specified on the <b>funcalc</b> command line, no
  output file is opened and no rows are written. This is useful in expressions
  that simply print output results instead of generating a new file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  fpv = (cur-&gt;av3:D-cur-&gt;av1:D)/(cur-&gt;av1+cur-&gt;av2:D+cur-&gt;av3);
  fbv =  cur-&gt;av2/(cur-&gt;av1+cur-&gt;av2+cur-&gt;av3);
  fpu = ((double)cur-&gt;au3-cur-&gt;au1)/((double)cur-&gt;au1+cur-&gt;au2+cur-&gt;au3);
  fbu =  cur-&gt;au2/(double)(cur-&gt;au1+cur-&gt;au2+cur-&gt;au3);
  fprintf(stdout, &quot;%f\t%f\t%f\t%f\n&quot;, fpv, fbv, fpu, fbu);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the above example, we use both explicit type specification (for
  &quot;av&quot; columns) and type casting (for &quot;au&quot; columns) to
  ensure that all operations are performed in double precision.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When an output file is specified, the selected input table is processed and
  output rows are copied to the output file. Note that the output file can be
  specified as &quot;stdout&quot; in order to write the output rows to the
  standard output. If the output file argument is passed, an optional third
  argument also can be passed to specify which columns to process.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In a FITS binary table, it sometimes is desirable to copy all of the other FITS
  extensions to the output file as well. This can be done by appending a '+'
  sign to the name of the extension in the input file name. See <b>funtable</b>
  for a related example.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>funcalc</b> works by integrating the user-specified expression into a
  template C program called tabcalc.c. The completed program then is compiled
  and executed. Variable declarations that begin the <b>funcalc</b> expression
  are placed in the local declaration section of the template main program. All
  other lines are placed in the template main program's inner processing loop.
  Other details of program generation are handled automatically. For example,
  column specifiers are analyzed to build a C struct for processing rows, which
  is passed to <i>FunColumnSelect()</i> and used in <i>FunTableRowGet()</i>. If
  an unknown variable is used in the expression, resulting in a compilation
  error, the program build is retried after defining the unknown variable to be
  of type double.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally, <b>funcalc</b> expression code is added to <b>funcalc</b> row
  processing loop. It is possible to add code to other parts of the program by
  placing this code inside special directives of the form:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  [directive name]
    ... code goes here ...
  end
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The directives are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>global</b> add code and declarations in global space,
      before the main routine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>local</b> add declarations (and code) just after the
      local declarations in main</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>before</b> add code just before entering the main row
      processing loop</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>after</b> add code just after exiting the main row
      processing loop</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Thus, the following <b>funcalc</b> expression will declare global variables and
  make subroutine calls just before and just after the main processing loop:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  global
    double v1, v2;
    double init(void);
    double finish(double v);
  end
  before
    v1  = init();
  end
  ... process rows, with calculations using v1 ...
  after
    v2 = finish(v1);
    if( v2 &lt; 0.0 ){
      fprintf(stderr, &quot;processing failed %g -&gt; %g\n&quot;, v1, v2);
      exit(1);
    }
  end
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Routines such as <i>init()</i> and <i>finish()</i> above are passed to the
  generated program for linking using the <b>-l [link directives ...]</b>
  switch. The string specified by this switch will be added to the link line
  used to build the program (before the funtools library). For example, assuming
  that <i>init()</i> and <i>finish()</i> are in the library libmysubs.a in the
  /opt/special/lib directory, use:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  funcalc  -l &quot;-L/opt/special/lib -lmysubs&quot; ...
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
User arguments can be passed to a compiled funcalc program using a string
  argument to the &quot;-a&quot; switch. The string should contain all of the
  user arguments. For example, to pass the integers 1 and 2, use:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  funcalc -a &quot;1 2&quot; ...
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The arguments are stored in an internal array and are accessed as strings via
  the ARGV(n) macro. For example, consider the following expression:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  local
    int pmin, pmax;
  end
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  before
    pmin=atoi(ARGV(0));
    pmax=atoi(ARGV(1));
  end
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  if( (cur-&gt;pha &gt;= pmin) &amp;&amp; (cur-&gt;pha &lt;= pmax) )
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;%d %d %d\n&quot;, cur-&gt;x, cur-&gt;y, cur-&gt;pha);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This expression will print out x, y, and pha values for all rows in which the
  pha value is between the two user-input values:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  funcalc -a '1 12' -f foo snr.ev'[cir 512 512 .1]'
  512 512 6
  512 512 8
  512 512 5
  512 512 5
  512 512 8
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  funcalc -a '5 6' -f foo snr.ev'[cir 512 512 .1]'
  512 512 6
  512 512 5
  512 512 5
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that it is the user's responsibility to ensure that the correct number of
  arguments are passed. The ARGV(n) macro returns a NULL if a requested argument
  is outside the limits of the actual number of args, usually resulting in a
  SEGV if processed blindly. To check the argument count, use the ARGC macro:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  local
    long int seed=1;
    double limit=0.8;
  end
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  before
    if( ARGC &gt;= 1 ) seed = atol(ARGV(0));
    if( ARGC &gt;= 2 ) limit = atof(ARGV(1));
    srand48(seed);
  end
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  if ( drand48() &gt; limit ) continue;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The macro WRITE_ROW expands to the <i>FunTableRowPut()</i> call that writes the
  current row. It can be used to write the row more than once. In addition, the
  macro NROW expands to the row number currently being processed. Use of these
  two macros is shown in the following example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  if( cur-&gt;pha:I == cur-&gt;pi:I ) continue;
  a = cur-&gt;pha;
  cur-&gt;pha = cur-&gt;pi;
  cur-&gt;pi = a;
  cur-&gt;AVG:E  = (cur-&gt;pha+cur-&gt;pi)/2.0;
  cur-&gt;NR:I = NROW;
  if( NROW &lt; 10 ) WRITE_ROW;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>-p [prog]</b> switch is specified, the expression is not executed.
  Rather, the generated executable is saved with the specified program name for
  later use.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>-n</b> switch is specified, the expression is not executed. Rather,
  the generated code is written to stdout. This is especially useful if you want
  to generate a skeleton file and add your own code, or if you need to check
  compilation errors. Note that the comment at the start of the output gives the
  compiler command needed to build the program on that platform. (The command
  can change from platform to platform because of the use of different
  libraries, compiler switches, etc.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
As mentioned previously, <b>funcalc</b> will declare a scalar variable
  automatically (as a double) if that variable has been used but not declared.
  This facility is implemented using a sed script named funcalc.sed, which
  processes the compiler output to sense an undeclared variable error. This
  script has been seeded with the appropriate error information for gcc, and for
  cc on Solaris, DecAlpha, and SGI platforms. If you find that automatic
  declaration of scalars is not working on your platform, check this sed script;
  it might be necessary to add to or edit some of the error messages it senses.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to keep the lexical analysis of <b>funcalc</b> expressions (reasonably)
  simple, we chose to accept some limitations on how accurately C comments,
  spaces, and new-lines are placed in the generated program. In particular,
  comments associated with local variables declared at the beginning of an
  expression (i.e., not in a <b>local...end</b> block) will usually end up in
  the inner loop, not with the local declarations:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  /* this comment will end up in the wrong place (i.e, inner loop) */
  double a; /* also in wrong place */
  /* this will be in the the right place (inner loop) */
  if( cur-&gt;x:D == cur-&gt;y:D ) continue; /* also in right place */
  a = cur-&gt;x;
  cur-&gt;x = cur-&gt;y;
  cur-&gt;y = a;
  cur-&gt;avg:E  = (cur-&gt;x+cur-&gt;y)/2.0;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Similarly, spaces and new-lines sometimes are omitted or added in a seemingly
  arbitrary manner. Of course, none of these stylistic blemishes affect the
  correctness of the generated code.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Because <b>funcalc</b> must analyze the user expression using the data file(s)
  passed on the command line, the input file(s) must be opened and read twice:
  once during program generation and once during execution. As a result, it is
  not possible to use stdin for the input file: <b>funcalc</b> cannot be used as
  a filter. We will consider removing this restriction at a later time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Along with C comments, <b>funcalc</b> expressions can have one-line internal
  comments that are not passed on to the generated C program. These internal
  comment start with the <b>#</b> character and continue up to the new-line:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  double a; # this is not passed to the generated C file
  # nor is this
  a = cur-&gt;x;
  cur-&gt;x = cur-&gt;y;
  cur-&gt;y = a;
  /* this comment is passed to the C file */
  cur-&gt;avg:E  = (cur-&gt;x+cur-&gt;y)/2.0;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As previously mentioned, input columns normally are identified by their being
  used within the inner event loop. There are rare cases where you might want to
  read a column and process it outside the main loop. For example, qsort might
  use a column in its sort comparison routine that is not processed inside the
  inner loop (and therefore not implicitly specified as a column to be read). To
  ensure that such a column is read by the event loop, use the <b>explicit</b>
  keyword. The arguments to this keyword specify columns that should be read
  into the input record structure even though they are not mentioned in the
  inner loop. For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  explicit pi pha
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
will ensure that the pi and pha columns are read for each row, even if they are
  not processed in the inner event loop. The <b>explicit</b> statement can be
  placed anywhere.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, note that <b>funcalc</b> currently works on expressions involving FITS
  binary tables and raw event files. We will consider adding support for image
  expressions at a later point, if there is demand for such support from the
  community.
