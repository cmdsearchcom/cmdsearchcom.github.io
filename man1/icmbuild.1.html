<p>icmbuild(1) Icmake&acirc;s generic program maintenance
facility icmbuild(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
icmbuild - A generic, C++/C program maintenance facility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
icmbuild [-h] [-c] args</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Icmbuild is a small C program calling icmake(1) to do
program maintenance as defined in the icmbuild script
that&acirc;s (commonly) found in /usr/lib/icmake.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Icmbuild&acirc;s actions are
tailored through a configuration file (icmconf) which must
be present in the directory where program maintenance is
requested. This file is automatically <br>
installed by icmstart(1). Refer to icmconf(7)&acirc;s
man-page for details about this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Icmbuild assumes that your
sources exist in and below the current working directory.
The file icmconf in icmake(1)&acirc;s distribution provides
an example of an icmconf file that can <br>
be used by icmbuild. In that example icmconf file it is
assumed that C++ sources are maintained, but program
maintenance for, e.g., C sources can easily be configured.
If icm&acirc; <br>
build is called, but icmconf is not available it displays a
usage-summary after which icm() ends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Icmbuild() handles the
maintenance for all sources in each of the subdirectories
named in the file CLASSES, and in addition the maintenance
of all sources in the current working <br>
directory. &lsquo;Maintenance&acirc; involves compiling all
as yet uncompiled source files, recompilation of modified
source files, and optionally library maintenance and the
pre-compilation <br>
of header files, which commonly results in a marked
reduction of source compilation times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When source files are compiled
object modules are produced which may be stored in a
library, against which the object module of the
program&acirc;s main function is linked. It is also <br>
possible to specify additional libraries against which the
program must be linked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a library is constructed it
is kept up to date by icmbuild. When a source is
successfully compiled its new object module replaces the old
one that is found in the library. At <br>
that point the separate object files are no longer required
and are removed by icmbuild.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Up to icmake version 9.01.00
icmbuild was installed as an executable icmake script in
(commonly) /usr/bin. The dependency of this script on the
file icmconf made it difficult to <br>
provide usage information if icmconf was absent. Since
version 9.02.00 the icmbuild script has been moved to
(commonly) /usr/lib/icmake, and icmbuild now is a little C
program <br>
providing the usage information when necessary or requested,
but otherwise executes icmake to process the icmbuild
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KICK-STARTING ICMBUILD <br>
To use icmbuild do as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Install icmbuild in your path
(icmake&acirc;s installation procedure should already have
taken care of that);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Copy icmconf (and probably a
file CLASSES) to your project&acirc;s base directory (i.e.,
the directory in which and where below the project&acirc;s
sources are found). Usually this <br>
has already been taken care of by the icmstart script;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Modify the #defines in the
file icmconf to taste;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Enter the names of
subdirectories containing sources on separate lines in the
file CLASSES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the order of the
classes mentioned in CLASSES is relevant in that new class
(subdirectory) names can always be added at the end of the
file CLASSES, but reorder&acirc; <br>
ing the lines in the CLASSES file should be avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If reordering is necessary, then
first run the command icmbuild clean to remove all files
that were thus far created by icmbuild. Recompilation is
necessary as the names <br>
of the object files contain class order-numbers for
identification. These class-order numbers prevent file-name
collisions (e.g., two classes might use a file data.cc) <br>
and because of the number-prefixes replacement of a file x.o
from class A by file x.o from class B is prevented;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Start icmbuild.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next section covers
icmbuild&acirc;s modes of operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Icmbuild supports two options, at most one should be
specified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o -h: Display a usage summary
(also automatically shown when the current directory does
not contain a file icmconf);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o -c: Clear the screen (using
tput clear) before starting the maintenance process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next (after optionally
specifying -c) icmbuild can be provided with the following
arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o No arguments at all: if
icmconf contains the line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define DEFCOM
&quot;program&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then this is quivalent to the
command icmbuild program; <br>
if icmconf contains the line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define DEFCOM
&quot;strip&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then this is quivalent to the
command icmbuild strip; <br>
if if icmconf contains the line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define DEFCOM
&quot;library&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then this is quivalent to the
command icmbuild library. <br>
(these commands are further elaborated in this section.)
DEFCOM specifications are ignored when an explicit argument
is passed to icmbuild.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o clean <br>
clean up remnants of previous actions;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o install program &lt;path&gt;
<br>
install the constructed program in the specified
&lt;path&gt; (to be used after issuing icmbuild program, see
below). Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">icmbuild install
~/bin/program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This installs the constructed
binary program in the user&acirc;s bin direcotry with the
name program;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o install static &lt;path&gt;
<br>
install the constructed static library in the specified path
(to be used after issuing icmbuild library, see below).
Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">icmbuild static /usr/lib/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This installs the constructed
static library (e.g. libspecial.a) in /usr/lib as
/usr/lib/libspecial.a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o install shared path install
the constructed shared library in the specified path (to be
used after issuing icmbuild library), when icmconf defines
SHARED (cf. icmconf(7)). <br>
Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">icmbuild shared /usr/lib/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This installs the constructed
binary shared library (e.g. libspecial.so) in /usr/lib as
/usr/lib/libspecial.so. In addition, the soft-links</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">libspecial.so -&gt;
libspecial.so.X <br>
libspecial.so.X -&gt; libspecial.so.X.Y.Y.Z</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">are defined in /usr/lib, where
X.Y.Z are the major, minor and subminor versions defined in
the file VERSION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o library <br>
do library maintenance (builds a static and optionally (if
icmconf defines SHARED) a shared (dynamic) library);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o program <br>
do program maintenance (builds a program from the sources in
the current working directory and from the sources in the
directories specified in the file CLASSES);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o program strip <br>
same as program, but the final program is stripped (using
the linker&acirc;s -s option);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ICM-DEP <br>
Class dependencies are handled by icmake&acirc;s support
program icm-dep. It can be called from icmake by passing it
the option -d. All options and arguments following -d are
forwared <br>
to icm-dep.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program icm-dep is
automatically called by icmbuild to handle class
dependencies. Consider two classes Options and Process. If
Process uses Options and if precompiled header <br>
files are used, then in addition to Option&acirc;s header
file, Process&acirc;s header must also be precompiled if
Option&acirc;s header file changes. Likewise, if
Option&acirc;s data organization is <br>
changed and Option defines inline members used by Process or
Process defines an Option data member then, in addition to
Option&acirc;s sources sources Process&acirc;s sources must
also be <br>
compiled. For the latter case icmconf uses the USE_ALL
specification: if a &lsquo;USE_ALL&acirc; file exists in a
directory, then all sources of that directory are
recompiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program icm_dep determines
all such class dependencies, and will recompile class header
files of all classes depending on classes whose header files
must be recompiled. Fur&acirc; <br>
thermore, if a &lsquo;USE_ALL&acirc; file exists in a
directory then all sources of classes depending on that
directory&acirc;s class are also recompiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Icm-dep&acirc;s options are
described in icmake(1)&acirc;s man-page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start its work, icm_dep needs
one command-line argument: go. Any other argument results in
icm_dep performing a &lsquo;dry run&acirc;: it will perform
all its duties (and verbose messages <br>
are displayed as if go had been specified), but no files
(precompiled headers or USE_ALL files) will be touched or
removed. If neither options nor arguments are specified
icm_dep <br>
writes its usage summary to the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default icmbuild calls icmake
-d -V go: icm_dep is called to perform its duties and to
show its actions on the standard output stream. By
specifying a #define ICM_DEP parame&acirc; <br>
ter in the icmconf file this default can be overruled (cf.
icmconf(7)).</p>
