<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-checkout - Checkout a branch or paths to the working
tree</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git checkout [-q] [-f] [-m] [&lt;branch&gt;] <br>
git checkout [-q] [-f] [-m] [--detach] [&lt;commit&gt;] <br>
git checkout [-q] [-f] [-m] [[-b|-B|--orphan]
&lt;new_branch&gt;] [&lt;start_point&gt;] <br>
git checkout
[-f|--ours|--theirs|-m|--conflict=&lt;style&gt;]
[&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [--] &lt;paths&gt;... <br>
git checkout [-p|--patch] [&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [--]
[&lt;paths&gt;...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Updates files in the working tree to match the version in
the index or the specified tree. If no paths are given, git
checkout will also update HEAD to set the specified branch
<br>
as the current branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git checkout &lt;branch&gt; <br>
To prepare for working on &lt;branch&gt;, switch to it by
updating the index and the files in the working tree, and by
pointing HEAD at the branch. Local modifications to the
files <br>
in the working tree are kept, so that they can be committed
to the &lt;branch&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &lt;branch&gt; is not found
but there does exist a tracking branch in exactly one remote
(call it &lt;remote&gt;) with a matching name, treat as
equivalent to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout -b &lt;branch&gt;
--track &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You could omit &lt;branch&gt;,
in which case the command degenerates to &quot;check out the
current branch&quot;, which is a glorified no-op with a
rather expensive side-effects to show only <br>
the tracking information, if exists, for the current
branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git checkout -b|-B
&lt;new_branch&gt; [&lt;start point&gt;] <br>
Specifying -b causes a new branch to be created as if
git-branch(1) were called and then checked out. In this case
you can use the --track or --no-track options, which will
<br>
be passed to git branch. As a convenience, --track without
-b implies branch creation; see the description of --track
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -B is given,
&lt;new_branch&gt; is created if it doesn&acirc;t exist;
otherwise, it is reset. This is the transactional equivalent
of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git branch -f &lt;branch&gt;
[&lt;start point&gt;] <br>
$ git checkout &lt;branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">that is to say, the branch is
not reset/created unless &quot;git checkout&quot; is
successful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git checkout --detach
[&lt;branch&gt;], git checkout &lt;commit&gt; <br>
Prepare to work on top of &lt;commit&gt;, by detaching HEAD
at it (see &quot;DETACHED HEAD&quot; section), and updating
the index and the files in the working tree. Local
modifications to <br>
the files in the working tree are kept, so that the
resulting working tree will be the state recorded in the
commit plus the local modifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Passing --detach forces this
behavior in the case of a &lt;branch&gt; (without the
option, giving a branch name to the command would check out
the branch, instead of detaching HEAD <br>
at it), or the current commit, if no &lt;branch&gt; is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git checkout [-p|--patch]
[&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [--] &lt;pathspec&gt;... <br>
When &lt;paths&gt; or --patch are given, git checkout does
not switch branches. It updates the named paths in the
working tree from the index file or from a named
&lt;tree-ish&gt; (most <br>
often a commit). In this case, the -b and --track options
are meaningless and giving either of them results in an
error. The &lt;tree-ish&gt; argument can be used to specify
a <br>
specific tree-ish (i.e. commit, tag or tree) to update the
index for the given paths before updating the working
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The index may contain unmerged
entries because of a previous failed merge. By default, if
you try to check out such an entry from the index, the
checkout operation will fail <br>
and nothing will be checked out. Using -f will ignore these
unmerged entries. The contents from a specific side of the
merge can be checked out of the index by using --ours <br>
or --theirs. With -m, changes made to the working tree file
can be discarded to re-create the original conflicted merge
result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-q, --quiet <br>
Quiet, suppress feedback messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
When switching branches, proceed even if the index or the
working tree differs from HEAD. This is used to throw away
local changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When checking out paths from the
index, do not fail upon unmerged entries; instead, unmerged
entries are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ours, --theirs <br>
When checking out paths from the index, check out stage #2
(ours) or #3 (theirs) for unmerged paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b &lt;new_branch&gt; <br>
Create a new branch named &lt;new_branch&gt; and start it at
&lt;start_point&gt;; see git-branch(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B &lt;new_branch&gt; <br>
Creates the branch &lt;new_branch&gt; and start it at
&lt;start_point&gt;; if it already exists, then reset it to
&lt;start_point&gt;. This is equivalent to running &quot;git
branch&quot; with &quot;-f&quot;; see <br>
git-branch(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --track <br>
When creating a new branch, set up &quot;upstream&quot;
configuration. See &quot;--track&quot; in git-branch(1) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no -b option is given, the
name of the new branch will be derived from the
remote-tracking branch. If &quot;remotes/&quot; or
&quot;refs/remotes/&quot; is prefixed it is stripped away,
and <br>
then the part up to the next slash (which would be the
nickname of the remote) is removed. This would tell us to
use &quot;hack&quot; as the local branch when branching off
of <br>
&quot;origin/hack&quot; (or &quot;remotes/origin/hack&quot;,
or even &quot;refs/remotes/origin/hack&quot;). If the given
name has no slash, or the above guessing results in an empty
name, the guessing is <br>
aborted. You can explicitly give a name with -b in such a
case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-track <br>
Do not set up &quot;upstream&quot; configuration, even if
the branch.autosetupmerge configuration variable is
true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l <br>
Create the new branch&acirc;s reflog; see git-branch(1) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--detach <br>
Rather than checking out a branch to work on it, check out a
commit for inspection and discardable experiments. This is
the default behavior of &quot;git checkout
&lt;commit&gt;&quot; when <br>
&lt;commit&gt; is not a branch name. See the &quot;DETACHED
HEAD&quot; section below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--orphan &lt;new_branch&gt; <br>
Create a new orphan branch, named &lt;new_branch&gt;,
started from &lt;start_point&gt; and switch to it. The first
commit made on this new branch will have no parents and it
will be the <br>
root of a new history totally disconnected from all the
other branches and commits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The index and the working tree
are adjusted as if you had previously run &quot;git checkout
&lt;start_point&gt;&quot;. This allows you to start a new
history that records a set of paths <br>
similar to &lt;start_point&gt; by easily running &quot;git
commit -a&quot; to make the root commit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be useful when you want
to publish the tree from a commit without exposing its full
history. You might want to do this to publish an open source
branch of a project <br>
whose current tree is &quot;clean&quot;, but whose full
history contains proprietary or otherwise encumbered bits of
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to start a
disconnected history that records a set of paths that is
totally different from the one of &lt;start_point&gt;, then
you should clear the index and the <br>
working tree right after creating the orphan branch by
running &quot;git rm -rf .&quot; from the top level of the
working tree. Afterwards you will be ready to prepare your
new files, <br>
repopulating the working tree, by copying them from
elsewhere, extracting a tarball, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-skip-worktree-bits <br>
In sparse checkout mode, git checkout -- &lt;paths&gt; would
update only entries matched by &lt;paths&gt; and sparse
patterns in $GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout. This option
ignores the <br>
sparse patterns and adds back any files in
&lt;paths&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --merge <br>
When switching branches, if you have local modifications to
one or more files that are different between the current
branch and the branch to which you are switching, the <br>
command refuses to switch branches in order to preserve your
modifications in context. However, with this option, a
three-way merge between the current branch, your working
<br>
tree contents, and the new branch is done, and you will be
on the new branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a merge conflict happens,
the index entries for conflicting paths are left unmerged,
and you need to resolve the conflicts and mark the resolved
paths with git add (or <br>
git rm if the merge should result in deletion of the
path).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When checking out paths from the
index, this option lets you recreate the conflicted merge in
the specified paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--conflict=&lt;style&gt; <br>
The same as --merge option above, but changes the way the
conflicting hunks are presented, overriding the
merge.conflictstyle configuration variable. Possible values
are <br>
&quot;merge&quot; (default) and &quot;diff3&quot; (in
addition to what is shown by &quot;merge&quot; style, shows
the original contents).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --patch <br>
Interactively select hunks in the difference between the
&lt;tree-ish&gt; (or the index, if unspecified) and the
working tree. The chosen hunks are then applied in reverse
to the <br>
working tree (and if a &lt;tree-ish&gt; was specified, the
index).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that you can use git
checkout -p to selectively discard edits from your current
working tree. See the &acirc;Interactive Mode&acirc; section
of git-add(1) to learn how to <br>
operate the --patch mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;branch&gt; <br>
Branch to checkout; if it refers to a branch (i.e., a name
that, when prepended with &quot;refs/heads/&quot;, is a
valid ref), then that branch is checked out. Otherwise, if
it refers <br>
to a valid commit, your HEAD becomes &quot;detached&quot;
and you are no longer on any branch (see below for
details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special case, the
&quot;@{-N}&quot; syntax for the N-th last branch checks out
the branch (instead of detaching). You may also specify -
which is synonymous with &quot;@{-1}&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a further special case, you
may use &quot;A...B&quot; as a shortcut for the merge base
of A and B if there is exactly one merge base. You can leave
out at most one of A and B, in <br>
which case it defaults to HEAD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;new_branch&gt; <br>
Name for the new branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;start_point&gt; <br>
The name of a commit at which to start the new branch; see
git-branch(1) for details. Defaults to HEAD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;tree-ish&gt; <br>
Tree to checkout from (when paths are given). If not
specified, the index will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DETACHED HEAD <br>
HEAD normally refers to a named branch (e.g. master).
Meanwhile, each branch refers to a specific commit.
Let&acirc;s look at a repo with three commits, one of them
tagged, and with <br>
branch master checked out:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HEAD (refers to branch
&rsquo;master&rsquo;) <br>
| <br>
v <br>
a---b---c branch &rsquo;master&rsquo; (refers to commit
&rsquo;c&rsquo;) <br>
^ <br>
| <br>
tag &rsquo;v2.0&rsquo; (refers to commit
&rsquo;b&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a commit is created in this
state, the branch is updated to refer to the new commit.
Specifically, git commit creates a new commit d, whose
parent is commit c, and then <br>
updates branch master to refer to new commit d. HEAD still
refers to branch master and so indirectly now refers to
commit d:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ edit; git add; git commit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HEAD (refers to branch
&rsquo;master&rsquo;) <br>
| <br>
v <br>
a---b---c---d branch &rsquo;master&rsquo; (refers to commit
&rsquo;d&rsquo;) <br>
^ <br>
| <br>
tag &rsquo;v2.0&rsquo; (refers to commit
&rsquo;b&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is sometimes useful to be
able to checkout a commit that is not at the tip of any
named branch, or even to create a new commit that is not
referenced by a named branch. Let&acirc;s <br>
look at what happens when we checkout commit b (here we show
two ways this may be done):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout v2.0 # or <br>
$ git checkout master^^</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HEAD (refers to commit
&rsquo;b&rsquo;) <br>
| <br>
v <br>
a---b---c---d branch &rsquo;master&rsquo; (refers to commit
&rsquo;d&rsquo;) <br>
^ <br>
| <br>
tag &rsquo;v2.0&rsquo; (refers to commit
&rsquo;b&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice that regardless of which
checkout command we use, HEAD now refers directly to commit
b. This is known as being in detached HEAD state. It means
simply that HEAD refers to <br>
a specific commit, as opposed to referring to a named
branch. Let&acirc;s see what happens when we create a
commit:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ edit; git add; git commit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HEAD (refers to commit
&rsquo;e&rsquo;) <br>
| <br>
v <br>
e <br>
/ <br>
a---b---c---d branch &rsquo;master&rsquo; (refers to commit
&rsquo;d&rsquo;) <br>
^ <br>
| <br>
tag &rsquo;v2.0&rsquo; (refers to commit
&rsquo;b&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is now a new commit e, but
it is referenced only by HEAD. We can of course add yet
another commit in this state:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ edit; git add; git commit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HEAD (refers to commit
&rsquo;f&rsquo;) <br>
| <br>
v <br>
e---f <br>
/ <br>
a---b---c---d branch &rsquo;master&rsquo; (refers to commit
&rsquo;d&rsquo;) <br>
^ <br>
| <br>
tag &rsquo;v2.0&rsquo; (refers to commit
&rsquo;b&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In fact, we can perform all the
normal Git operations. But, let&acirc;s look at what happens
when we then checkout master:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HEAD (refers to branch
&rsquo;master&rsquo;) <br>
e---f | <br>
/ v <br>
a---b---c---d branch &rsquo;master&rsquo; (refers to commit
&rsquo;d&rsquo;) <br>
^ <br>
| <br>
tag &rsquo;v2.0&rsquo; (refers to commit
&rsquo;b&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important to realize that
at this point nothing refers to commit f. Eventually commit
f (and by extension commit e) will be deleted by the routine
Git garbage collection <br>
process, unless we create a reference before that happens.
If we have not yet moved away from commit f, any of these
will create a reference to it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout -b foo (1) <br>
$ git branch foo (2) <br>
$ git tag foo (3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. creates a new branch foo,
which refers to commit f, and then updates HEAD to refer to
branch foo. In other words, we&acirc;ll no longer be in
detached HEAD state after this command. <br>
2. similarly creates a new branch foo, which refers to
commit f, but leaves HEAD detached. <br>
3. creates a new tag foo, which refers to commit f, leaving
HEAD detached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If we have moved away from
commit f, then we must first recover its object name
(typically by using git reflog), and then we can create a
reference to it. For example, to see the <br>
last two commits to which HEAD referred, we can use either
of these commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git reflog -2 HEAD # or <br>
$ git log -g -2 HEAD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. The following sequence checks out the master branch,
reverts the Makefile to two revisions back, deletes hello.c
by mistake, and gets it back from the index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout master (1) <br>
$ git checkout master~2 Makefile (2) <br>
$ rm -f hello.c <br>
$ git checkout hello.c (3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. switch branch <br>
2. take a file out of another commit <br>
3. restore hello.c from the index</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to check out all C
source files out of the index, you can say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout --
&rsquo;*.c&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note the quotes around *.c. The
file hello.c will also be checked out, even though it is no
longer in the working tree, because the file globbing is
used to match entries in <br>
the index (not in the working tree by the shell).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have an unfortunate
branch that is named hello.c, this step would be confused as
an instruction to switch to that branch. You should instead
write:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout -- hello.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. After working in the wrong
branch, switching to the correct branch would be done
using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout mytopic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, your &quot;wrong&quot;
branch and correct &quot;mytopic&quot; branch may differ in
files that you have modified locally, in which case the
above checkout would fail like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout mytopic <br>
error: You have local changes to &rsquo;frotz&rsquo;; not
switching branches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can give the -m flag to the
command, which would try a three-way merge:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout -m mytopic <br>
Auto-merging frotz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After this three-way merge, the
local modifications are not registered in your index file,
so git diff would show you what changes you made since the
tip of the new branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. When a merge conflict happens
during switching branches with the -m option, you would see
something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout -m mytopic <br>
Auto-merging frotz <br>
ERROR: Merge conflict in frotz <br>
fatal: merge program failed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At this point, git diff shows
the changes cleanly merged as in the previous example, as
well as the changes in the conflicted files. Edit and
resolve the conflict and mark it <br>
resolved with git add as usual:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ edit frotz <br>
$ git add frotz</p>
