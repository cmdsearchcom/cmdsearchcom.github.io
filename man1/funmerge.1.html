<b>funmerge</b> merges FITS data from one or more FITS Binary Table files or raw
  event files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first argument to the program specifies the first input FITS table or raw
  event file. If &quot;stdin&quot; is specified, data are read from the standard
  input. Use Funtools Bracket Notation to specify FITS extensions and row
  filters. Subsequent arguments specify additional event files and tables to
  merge. (NB: Stdin cannot not be used for any of these additional input file
  arguments.) The last argument is the output FITS file. The columns in each
  input table must be identical.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If an input file begins with the '@' character, it is processed as an include
  file, i.e., as a text file containing event file names (as well as blank lines
  and/or comment lines starting with the '#' sign). If standard input is
  specified as an include file ('@stdin'), then file names are read from the
  standard input until EOF (^D). Event files and include files can be mixed on a
  command line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Rows from each table are written sequentially to the output file. If the switch
  <b>-f [colname]</b> is specified on the command line, an additional column is
  added to each row containing the number of the file from which that row was
  taken (starting from one). In this case, the corresponding file names are
  stored in the header parameters having the prefix <b>FUNFIL</b>, i.e.,
  FUNFIL01, FUNFIL02, etc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Using the <b>-w</b> switch (or <b>-x</b> switch as described below),
  <b>funmerge</b> also can adjust the position column values using the WCS
  information in each file. (By position columns, we mean the columns that the
  table is binned on, i.e., those columns defined by the <b>bincols=</b> switch,
  or (X,Y) by default.) To perform WCS alignment, the WCS of the first file is
  taken as the base WCS. Each position in subsequent files is adjusted by first
  converting it to the sky coordinate in its own WCS coordinate system, then by
  converting this sky position to the sky position of the base WCS, and finally
  converting back to a pixel position in the base system. Note that in order to
  perform WCS alignment, the appropriate WCS and TLMIN/TLMAX keywords must
  already exist in each FITS file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When performing WCS alignment, you can save the original positions in the output
  file by using the <b>-x</b> (for &quot;xtra&quot;) switch instead of the
  <b>-w</b> switch (i.e., using this switch also implies using <b>-w</b>) The
  old positions are saved in columns having the same name as the original
  positional columns, with the added prefix &quot;OLD_&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Examples:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Merge two tables, and preserve the originating file number for each row in the
  column called &quot;FILE&quot; (along with the corresponding file name in the
  header):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  [sh] funmerge -f &quot;FILE&quot; test.ev test2.ev merge.ev
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Merge two tables with WCS alignment, saving the old position values in 2
  additional columns:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  [sh] funmerge -x test.ev test2.ev merge.ev
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This program only works on raw event files and binary tables. We have not yet
  implemented image and array merging.
