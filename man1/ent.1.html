<i>ent</i> performs a variety of tests on the stream of bytes in <i>file</i> (or
  standard input if no <i>file</i> is specified) and produces output on standard
  output; for example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
Entropy = 7.980627 bits per character.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 51768 character file by 0 percent.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Chi square distribution for 51768 samples is 1542.26, and randomly
would exceed this value 0.01 percent of the times.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 125.93 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.169834647 (error 0.90 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.004249 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The values calculated are as follows:

The information density of the contents of the file, expressed as a number of
  bits per character. The results above, which resulted from processing an image
  file compressed with JPEG, indicate that the file is extremely dense in
  information&#x2014;essentially random. Hence, compression of the file is
  unlikely to reduce its size. By contrast, the C source code of the program has
  entropy of about 4.9 bits per character, indicating that optimal compression
  of the file would reduce its size by 38%. [Hamming, pp. 104-108]
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="CHI-SQUARE_TEST"><a class="selflink" href="#CHI-SQUARE_TEST">CHI-SQUARE
  TEST</a></h2>
The chi-square test is the most commonly used test for the randomness of data,
  and is extremely sensitive to errors in pseudorandom sequence generators. The
  chi-square distribution is calculated for the stream of bytes in the file and
  expressed as an absolute number and a percentage which indicates how
  frequently a truly random sequence would exceed the value calculated. We
  interpret the percentage as the degree to which the sequence tested is
  suspected of being non-random. If the percentage is greater than 99% or less
  than 1%, the sequence is almost certainly not random. If the percentage is
  between 99% and 95% or between 1% and 5%, the sequence is suspect. Percentages
  between 90% and 95% and 5% and 10% indicate the sequence is &quot;almost
  suspect&quot;. Note that our JPEG file, while very dense in information, is
  far from random as revealed by the chi-square test.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Applying this test to the output of various pseudorandom sequence generators is
  interesting. The low-order 8 bits returned by the standard Unix rand(1)
  function, for example, yields:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
Chi square distribution for 500000 samples is 0.01, and randomly
would exceed this value 99.99 percent of the times.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
While an improved generator [Park &amp; Miller] reports:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
Chi square distribution for 500000 samples is 212.53, and randomly
would exceed this value 95.00 percent of the times.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Thus, the standard Unix generator (or at least the low-order bytes it returns)
  is unacceptably non-random, while the improved generator is much better but
  still sufficiently non-random to cause concern for demanding applications.
  Contrast both of these software generators with the chi-square result of a
  genuine random sequence created by timing radioactive decay events[1]:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
Chi square distribution for 32768 samples is 237.05, and randomly
would exceed this value 75.00 percent of the times.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
See [Knuth, pp. 35-40] for more information on the chi-square test. An
  interactive chi-square calculator[2] is available at this site.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="ARITHMETIC_MEAN"><a class="selflink" href="#ARITHMETIC_MEAN">ARITHMETIC
  MEAN</a></h2>
This is simply the result of summing all the bytes (bits if the <i>-b</i> option
  is specified) in the file and dividing by the file length. If the data are
  close to random, this should be about 127.5 (0.5 for <i>-b</i> option output).
  If the mean departs from this value, the values are consistently high or low.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="MONTE_CARLO_VALUE_FOR_PI"><a class="selflink" href="#MONTE_CARLO_VALUE_FOR_PI">MONTE
  CARLO VALUE FOR PI</a></h2>
Each successive sequence of six bytes is used as 24 bit X and Y coordinates
  within a square. If the distance of the randomly-generated point is less than
  the radius of a circle inscribed within the square, the six-byte sequence is
  considered a &quot;hit&quot;. The percentage of hits can be used to calculate
  the value of Pi. For very large streams (this approximation converges very
  slowly), the value will approach the correct value of Pi if the sequence is
  close to random. A 32768 byte file created by radioactive decay yielded:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.139648438 (error 0.06 percent).
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="SERIAL_CORRELATION_COEFFICIENT"><a class="selflink" href="#SERIAL_CORRELATION_COEFFICIENT">SERIAL
  CORRELATION COEFFICIENT</a></h2>
This quantity measures the extent to which each byte in the file depends upon
  the previous byte. For random sequences, this value (which can be positive or
  negative) will, of course, be close to zero. A non-random byte stream such as
  a C program will yield a serial correlation coefficient on the order of 0.5.
  Wildly predictable data such as uncompressed bitmaps will exhibit serial
  correlation coefficients approaching 1. See [Knuth, pp. 64-65] for more
  details.

If no <i>file</i> is specified, <i>ent</i> obtains its input from standard
  input. Output is always written to standard output.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TERSE_MODE"><a class="selflink" href="#TERSE_MODE">TERSE
  MODE</a></h1>
Terse mode is selected by specifying the <i>-t</i> option on the command line.
  Terse mode output is written in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format, which can
  be directly loaded into most spreadsheet programs and is easily read by any
  programming language. Each record in the CSV file begins with a record type
  field, which identifies the content of the following fields. If the <i>-c</i>
  option is not specified, the terse mode output will consist of two records, as
  follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
0,File-bytes,Entropy,Chi-square,Mean,Monte-Carlo-Pi,Serial-Correlation
1,file_length,entropy,chi_square,mean,Pi_value,correlation
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where the italicised values in the type 1 record are the numerical values for
  the quantities named in the type 0 column title record. If the_ -b_ option is
  specified, the second field of the type 0 record will be
  &quot;File-bits&quot;, and the file_length field in type 1 record will be
  given in bits instead of bytes. If the <i>-c</i> option is specified,
  additional records are appended to the terse mode output which contain the
  character counts:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
2,Value,Occurrences,Fraction
3,v,count,fraction
...
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <i>-b</i> option is specified, only two type 3 records will appear for
  the two bit values v=0 and v=1. Otherwise, 256 type 3 records are included,
  one for each possible byte value. The second field of a type 3 record
  indicates how many bytes (or bits) of value v appear in the input, and
  fraction gives the decimal fraction of the file which has value v (which is
  equal to the count value of this record divided by the file_length field in
  the type 1 record).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Note that the &quot;optimal compression&quot; shown for the file is computed
  from the byte- or bit-stream entropy and thus reflects compressibility based
  on a reading frame of the chosen width (8-bit bytes or individual bits if the
  <i>-b</i> option is specified). Algorithms which use a larger reading frame,
  such as the Lempel-Ziv [Lempel &amp; Ziv] algorithm, may achieve greater
  compression if the file contains repeated sequences of multiple bytes.
