<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
db5.3_printlog - Dumps Berkeley DB log files in a
human-readable format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
db5.3_printlog [-NrV] [-b start-LSN] [-e stop-LSN] [-h home]
[-P password]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The db5.3_printlog utility is a debugging utility that dumps
Berkeley DB log files in a human-readable format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b Display log records starting at log sequence number (LSN)
start-LSN; start-LSN is specified as a file number, followed
by a slash (/) character, followed by an offset num&acirc;
<br>
ber, with no intervening whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Stop displaying log records
at log sequence number (LSN) stop-LSN; stop-LSN is specified
as a file number, followed by a slash (/) character,
followed by an offset number, <br>
with no intervening whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Specify a home directory for
the database environment; by default, the current working
directory is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Do not acquire shared region
mutexes while running. Other problems, such as potentially
fatal errors in Berkeley DB, will be ignored as well. This
option is intended <br>
only for debugging errors, and should not be used under any
other circumstances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Specify an environment
password. Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite password
strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a window
of vulnerability on systems <br>
where unprivileged users can see command-line arguments or
where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
containing the command-line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Read the log files in reverse
order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Write the library version
number to the standard output, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_printlog utility uses
a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the -h option,
the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the utility was
run in a directory con&acirc; <br>
taining a Berkeley DB environment). In order to avoid
environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment,
db5.3_printlog should always be given the chance to detach
<br>
from the environment and exit gracefully. To cause
db5.3_printlog to release all environment resources and exit
cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_printlog utility exits
0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DB_HOME <br>
If the -h option is not specified and the environment
variable DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the
database home, as described in DB_ENV-&gt;open.</p>
