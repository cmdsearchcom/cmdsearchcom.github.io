<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cmscan - search sequence(s) against a covariance model
database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cmscan [options] &lt;cmdb&gt; &lt;seqfile&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cmscan is used to search sequences against collections of
covariance models. For each sequence in &lt;seqfile&gt;, use
that query sequence to search the target database of CMs in
<br>
&lt;cmdb&gt;, and output ranked lists of the CMs with the
most significant matches to the sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;seqfile&gt; may contain
more than one query sequence. It can be in FASTA format, or
several other common sequence file formats (genbank, embl,
and among others), or in align&acirc; <br>
ment file formats (stockholm, aligned fasta, and others).
See the --qformat option for a complete list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;cmdb&gt; needs to be
press&rsquo;ed using cmpress before it can be searched with
cmscan. This creates four binary files, suffixed .i1{fimp}.
Additionally, &lt;cmdb&gt; must have been <br>
calibrated for E-values with cmcalibrate before being
press&rsquo;ed with cmpress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The query &lt;seqfile&gt; may be
&rsquo;-&rsquo; (a dash character), in which case the query
sequences are read from a &lt;stdin&gt; pipe instead of from
a file. The &lt;cmdb&gt; cannot be read from a <br>
&lt;stdin&gt; stream, because it needs to have those four
auxiliary binary files generated by cmpress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output format is designed to
be human-readable, but is often so voluminous that reading
it is impractical, and parsing it is a pain. The --tblout
option saves output in a <br>
simple tabular format that is concise and easier to parse.
The --fmt 2 option modifies the format of the tabular output
by adding several fields, including markup of overlapping
<br>
hits, as described in section 6 of the Infernal user guide.
The -o option allows redirecting the main output, including
throwing it away in /dev/null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cmscan reexamines the 5&rsquo;
and 3&rsquo; termini of target sequences using specialized
algorithms for detection of truncated hits, in which part of
the 5&rsquo; and/or 3&rsquo; end of the actual full <br>
length homologous sequence is missing in the target sequence
file. These types of hits will be most common in sequence
files consisting of unassembled sequencing reads. By <br>
default, any 5&rsquo; truncated hit is required to include
the first residue of the target sequence it derives from in
&lt;seqfile&gt;, and any 3&rsquo; truncated hit is required
to include the <br>
final residue of the target sequence it derives from. Any
5&rsquo; and 3&rsquo; truncated hit must include the first
and final residue of the target sequence it derives from.
The --anytrunc <br>
option will relax the requirements for hit inclusion of
sequence endpoints, and truncated hits are allowed to start
and stop at any positions of target sequences. Importantly
<br>
though, with --anytrunc, hit E-values will be less accurate
because model calibration does not consider the possibility
of truncated hits, so use it with caution. The --notrunc
<br>
option can be used to turn off truncated hit detection.
--notrunc will reduce the running time of cmscan, most
significantly for target &lt;seqfile&gt; files that include
many short <br>
sequences. Truncated hit detection is automatically turned
off when the --max, --nohmm, --qdb, or --nonbanded options
are used because it relies on the use of an accelerated HMM
<br>
banded alignment strategy that is turned off by any of those
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and
all available options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Turn on the glocal alignment
algorithm, global with respect to the query model and local
with respect to the target database. By default, the local
alignment algorithm is <br>
used which is local with respect to both the target sequence
and the model. In local mode, the alignment to span two or
more subsequences if necessary (e.g. if the struc&acirc;
<br>
tures of the query model and target sequence are only
partially shared), allowing certain large insertions and
deletions in the structure to be penalized differently than
<br>
normal indels. Local mode performs better on empirical
benchmarks and is significantly more sensitive for remote
homology detection. Empirically, glocal searches return <br>
many fewer hits than local searches, so glocal may be
desired for some applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z &lt;x&gt; Calculate E-values
as if the search space size was &lt;x&gt; megabases (Mb).
Without the use of this option, the search space size
changes for each query sequence, it is defined <br>
as the length of the current query sequence times 2 (because
both strands of the sequence will be searched) times the
number of CMs in &lt;cmdb&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--devhelp <br>
Print help, as with -h , but also include expert options
that are not displayed with -h . These expert options are
not expected to be relevant for the vast majority of <br>
users and so are not described in the manual page. The only
resources for understanding what they actually do are the
brief one-line descriptions output when --devhelp is <br>
enabled, and the source code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS FOR CONTROLLING OUTPUT
<br>
-o &lt;f&gt; Direct the main human-readable output to a file
&lt;f&gt; instead of the default stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tblout &lt;f&gt; <br>
Save a simple tabular (space-delimited) file summarizing the
hits found, with one data line per hit. The format of this
file is described in section 6 of the Infernal <br>
user guide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fmt &lt;n&gt; <br>
specify the format of the tabular output file specified with
--tblout &lt;f&gt; be in format &lt;n&gt;. Possible values
for &lt;n&gt; are 1 or 2. By default &lt;n&gt; is 1 when
--tblout is used <br>
without --fmt. With --fmt 2 nine additional fields are added
to the tabular output file, most of which pertain to the
annotation of overlapping hits. See section 6 the <br>
Infernal user guide for a description of both formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--acc Use accessions instead of
names in the main output, where available for profiles
and/or sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noali <br>
Omit the alignment section from the main output. This can
greatly reduce the output volume.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--notextw <br>
Unlimit the length of each line in the main output. The
default is a limit of 120 characters per line, which helps
in displaying the output cleanly on terminals and in <br>
editors, but can truncate target profile description
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--textw &lt;n&gt; <br>
Set the main output&rsquo;s line length limit to &lt;n&gt;
characters per line. The default is 120.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose <br>
Include extra search pipeline statistics in the main output,
including filter survival statistics for truncated hit
detection and number of envelopes discarded due to <br>
matrix size overflows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS CONTROLLING REPORTING
THRESHOLDS <br>
Reporting thresholds control which hits are reported in
output files (the main output and --tblout) Hits are ranked
by statistical significance (E-value). By default, all hits
<br>
with an E-value &lt;= 10 are reported. The following options
allow you to change the default E-value reporting
thresholds, or to use bit score thresholds instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E &lt;x&gt; In the per-target
output, report target sequences with an E-value of &lt;=
&lt;x&gt;. The default is 10.0, meaning that on average,
about 10 false positives will be reported per <br>
query, so you can see the top of the noise and decide for
yourself if it&rsquo;s really noise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T &lt;x&gt; Instead of
thresholding per-CM output on E-value, report target
sequences with a bit score of &gt;= &lt;x&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS FOR INCLUSION THRESHOLDS
<br>
Inclusion thresholds are stricter than reporting thresholds.
Inclusion thresholds control which hits are considered to be
reliable enough to be included in a possible subsequent <br>
search round, or marked as significant (&quot;!&quot;) as
opposed to questionable (&quot;?&quot;) in hit output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--incE &lt;x&gt; <br>
Use an E-value of &lt;= &lt;x&gt; as the hit inclusion
threshold. The default is 0.01, meaning that on average,
about 1 false positive would be expected in every 100
searches with <br>
different query sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--incT &lt;x&gt; <br>
Instead of using E-values for setting the inclusion
threshold, instead use a bit score of &gt;= &lt;x&gt; as the
hit inclusion threshold. By default this option is
unset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS FOR MODEL-SPECIFIC SCORE
THRESHOLDING <br>
Curated CM databases may define specific bit score
thresholds for each CM, superseding any thresholding based
on statistical significance alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use these options, the
profile must contain the appropriate (GA, TC, and/or NC)
optional score threshold annotation; this is picked up by
cmbuild from Stockholm format align&acirc; <br>
ment files. Each thresholding option has a score of
&lt;x&gt; bits, and acts as if -T &lt;x&gt; --incT &lt;x&gt;
has been applied specifically using each model&rsquo;s
curated thresholds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cut_ga <br>
Use the GA (gathering) bit scores in the model to set hit
reporting and inclusion thresholds. GA thresholds are
generally considered to be the reliable curated thresholds
<br>
defining family membership; for example, in Rfam, these
thresholds define what gets included in Rfam Full alignments
based on searches with Rfam Seed models.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cut_nc <br>
Use the NC (noise cutoff) bit score thresholds in the model
to set hit reporting and inclusion thresholds. NC thresholds
are generally considered to be the score of the <br>
highest-scoring known false positive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cut_tc <br>
Use the TC (trusted cutoff) bit score thresholds in the
model to set hit reporting and inclusion thresholds. TC
thresholds are generally considered to be the score of the
<br>
lowest-scoring known true positive that is above all known
false positives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS CONTROLLING THE
ACCELERATION PIPELINE <br>
Infernal searches are accelerated in a six-stage filter
pipeline. The first five stages use a profile HMM to define
envelopes that are passed to the stage six CM CYK filter.
Any <br>
envelopes that survive all filters are assigned final scores
using the the CM Inside algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The profile HMM filter is built
by the cmbuild program and is stored in &lt;cmfile&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each successive filter is slower
than the previous one, but better than it at disciminating
between subsequences that may contain high-scoring CM hits
and those that do not. The <br>
first three HMM filter stages are the same as those used in
HMMER3. Stage 1 (F1) is the local HMM SSV filter modified
for long sequences. Stage 2 (F2) is the local HMM Viterbi
<br>
filter. Stage 3 (F3) is the local HMM Forward filter. Each
of the first three stages uses the profile HMM in local
mode, which allows a target subsequence to align to any
region <br>
of the HMM. Stage 4 (F4) is a glocal HMM filter, which
requires a target subsequence to align to the full-length
profile HMM. Stage 5 (F5) is the glocal HMM envelope
definition <br>
filter, which uses HMMER3&rsquo;s domain identification
heursitics to define envelope boundaries. After each stage
from 2 to 5 a bias filter step (F2b, F3b, F4b, and F5b) is
used to <br>
remove sequences that appear to have passed the filter due
to biased composition alone. Any envelopes that survive
stages F1 through F5b are then passed with the local CM CYK
<br>
filter. The CYK filter uses constraints (bands) derived from
an HMM alignment of the envelope to reduce the number of
required calculations and save time. Any envelopes that <br>
pass CYK are scored with the local CM Inside algorithm,
again using HMM bands for acceleration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default filter thresholds
that define the minimum score required for a subsequence to
survive each stage are defined based on the size of the
search space (Z), which is <br>
defined as the length of the current query sequence times 2
(because both strands will be searched) times the number of
profiles in &lt;cmdb&gt;. However, if either the -Z
&lt;x&gt; or --FZ <br>
&lt;x&gt; options are used then the search space will be
considered to be &lt;x&gt; for purposes of defining the
filter thresholds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For larger databases, the
filters are more strict leading to more acceleration but
potentially a greater loss of sensitivity. The rationale is
that for larger databases, hits <br>
must have higher scores to achieve statistical significance,
so stricter filtering that removes lower scoring
insignificant hits is acceptable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The P-value thresholds for all
possible search space sizes and all filter stages are listed
next. (A P-value threshold of 0.01 means that roughly 1% of
the highest scoring nonho&acirc; <br>
mologous subsequence are expected to pass the filter.) Z is
defined as the number of nucleotides in the complete target
sequence file times 2 because both strands will be <br>
searched with each model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Z is less than 2 Mb: F1 is
0.35; F2 and F2b are off; F3, F3b, F4, F4b and F5 are 0.02;
F6 is 0.0001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Z is between 2 Mb and 20 Mb:
F1 is 0.35; F2 and F2b are off; F3, F3b, F4, F4b and F5 are
0.005; F6 is 0.0001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Z is between 20 Mb and 200
Mb: F1 is 0.35; F2 and F2b are 0.15; F3, F3b, F4, F4b and F5
are 0.003; F6 is 0.0001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Z is between 200 Mb and 2 Gb:
F1 is 0.15; F2 and F2b are 0.15; F3, F3b, F4, F4b, F5, and
F5b are 0.0008; and F6 is 0.0001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Z is between 2 Gb and 20 Gb:
F1 is 0.15; F2 and F2b are 0.15; F3, F3b, F4, F4b, F5, and
F5b are 0.0002; and F6 is 0.0001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Z is more than 20 Gb: F1 is
0.06; F2 and F2b are 0.02; F3, F3b, F4, F4b, F5, and F5b are
0.0002; and F6 is 0.0001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These thresholds were chosen
based on performance on an internal benchmark testing many
different possible settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are five options for
controlling the general filtering level. These options are,
in order from least strict (slowest but most sensitive) to
most strict (fastest but least <br>
sensitive): --max, --nohmm, --mid, --default, (this is the
default setting) --rfam. and --hmmonly. With --default the
filter thresholds will be database-size dependent. See the
<br>
explanation of each of these individual options below for
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, an expert user can
precisely control each filter stage score threshold with the
--F1, --F1b, --F2, --F2b, --F3, --F3b, --F4, --F4b, --F5,
--F5b, and --F6 options. <br>
As well as turn each stage on or off with the --noF1,
--doF1b, --noF2, --noF2b, --noF3, --noF3b, --noF4, --noF4b,
--noF5, and --noF6. options. These options are only
displayed <br>
if the --devhelp option is used to keep the number of
displayed options with -h reasonable, and because they are
only expected to be useful to a small minority of users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special case, for any
models in &lt;cmfile&gt; which have zero basepairs, profile
HMM searches are run instead of CM searches. HMM algorithms
are more efficient than CM algo&acirc; <br>
rithms, and the benefit of CM algorithms is lost for models
with no secondary structure (zero basepairs). These profile
HMM searches will run significantly faster than the CM <br>
searches. You can force HMM-only searches with the --hmmonly
option. For more information on HMM-only searches see the
user guide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max Turn off all filters, and
run non-banded Inside on every full-length target sequence.
This increases sensitivity somewhat, at an extremely large
cost in speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nohmm <br>
Turn off all HMM filter stages (F1 through F5b). The CYK
filter, using QDBs, will be run on every full-length target
sequence and will enforce a P-value threshold of <br>
0.0001. Each subsequence that survives CYK will be passed to
Inside, which will also use QDBs (but a looser set). This
increases sensitivity somewhat, at a very large cost <br>
in speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mid Turn off the HMM SSV and
Viterbi filter stages (F1 through F2b). Set remaining HMM
filter thresholds (F3 through F5b) to 0.02 by default, but
changeable to &lt;x&gt; with <br>
--Fmid &lt;x&gt; sequence. This may increase sensitivity, at
a significant cost in speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default <br>
Use the default filtering strategy. This option is on by
default. The filter thresholds are determined based on the
database size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rfam Use a strict filtering
strategy devised for large databases (more than 20 Gb). This
will accelerate the search at a potential cost to
sensitivity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hmmonly <br>
Only use the filter profile HMM for searches, do not use the
CM. Only filter stages F1 through F3 will be executed, using
strict P-value thresholds (0.02 for F1, 0.001 <br>
for F2 and 0.00001 for F3). Additionally a bias composition
filter is used after the F1 stage (with P=0.02 survival
threshold). Any hit that survives all stages and has <br>
an HMM E-value or bit score above the reporting threshold
will be output. The user can change the HMM-only filter
thresholds and options with --hmmF1, --hmmF2, --hmmF3, <br>
--hmmnobias, --hmmnonull2, and --hmmmax. By default,
searches for any model with zero basepairs will be run in
HMM-only mode. This can be turned off, forcing CM searches
<br>
for these models with the --nohmmonly option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--FZ &lt;x&gt; <br>
Set filter thresholds as the defaults used if the database
were &lt;x&gt; megabases (Mb). If used with &lt;x&gt;
greater than 20000 (20 Gb) this option has the same effect
as --rfam.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--Fmid &lt;x&gt; <br>
With the --mid option set the HMM filter thresholds (F3
through F5b) to &lt;x&gt;. By default, &lt;x&gt; is
0.02.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER OPTIONS <br>
--notrunc <br>
Turn off truncated hit detection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--anytrunc <br>
Allow truncated hits to begin and end at any position in a
target sequence. By default, 5&rsquo; truncated hits must
include the first residue of their target sequence and
3&rsquo; <br>
truncated hits must include the final residue of their
target sequence. With this option you may observe fewer full
length hits that extend to the beginning and end of the <br>
query CM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nonull3 <br>
Turn off the null3 CM score corrections for biased
composition. This correction is not used during the HMM
filter stages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mxsize &lt;x&gt; <br>
Set the maximum allowable CM DP matrix size to &lt;x&gt;
megabytes. By default this size is 128 Mb. This should be
large enough for the vast majority of searches, especially
<br>
with smaller models. If cmscan encounters an envelope in the
CYK or Inside stage that requires a larger matrix, the
envelope will be discounted from consideration. This <br>
behavior is like an additional filter that prevents
expensive (slow) CM DP calculations, but at a potential cost
to sensitivity. Note that if cmscan is being run in
&lt;n&gt; <br>
multiple threads on a multicore machine then each thread may
have an allocated matrix of up to size &lt;x&gt; Mb at any
given time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--smxsize &lt;x&gt; <br>
Set the maximum allowable CM search DP matrix size to
&lt;x&gt; megabytes. By default this size is 128 Mb. This
option is only relevant if the CM will not use HMM banded
matri&acirc; <br>
ces, i.e. if the --max, --nohmm, --qdb, --fqdb, --nonbanded,
or --fnonbanded options are also used. Note that if cmsearch
is being run in &lt;n&gt; multiple threads on a multi&acirc;
<br>
core machine then each thread may have an allocated matrix
of up to size &lt;x&gt; Mb at any given time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cyk Use the CYK algorithm, not
Inside, to determine the final score of all hits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--acyk Use the CYK algorithm to
align hits. By default, the Durbin/Holmes optimal accuracy
algorithm is used, which finds the alignment that maximizes
the expected accuracy of <br>
all aligned residues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--wcx &lt;x&gt; <br>
For each CM, set the W parameter, the expected maximum
length of a hit, to &lt;x&gt; times the consensus length of
the model. By default, the W parameter is read from the CM
<br>
file and was calculated based on the transition
probabilities of the model by cmbuild. You can find out what
the default W is for a model using cmstat. This option <br>
should be used with caution as it impacts the filtering
pipeline at several different stages in nonobvious ways. It
is only recommended for expert users searching for hits <br>
that are much longer than any of the homologs used to build
the model in cmbuild, e.g. ones with large introns or other
large insertions. It cannot be used in combination <br>
with the --nohmm, --fqdb or --qdb options because in those
cases W is limited by query-dependent bands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--toponly <br>
Only search the top (Watson) strand of target sequences in
&lt;seqfile&gt;. By default, both strands are searched. This
will halve the search space size (Z).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bottomonly <br>
Only search the bottom (Crick) strand of target sequences in
&lt;seqfile&gt;. By default, both strands are searched. This
will halve the search space size (Z).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--qformat &lt;s&gt; <br>
Assert that the query sequence database file is in format
&lt;s&gt;. Accepted formats include fasta, embl, genbank,
ddbj, stockholm, pfam, a2m, afa, clustal, and phylip The
<br>
default is to autodetect the format of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--glist &lt;f&gt; <br>
Configure a subset of models from &lt;cmfile&gt; in glocal
alignment mode, instead of local mode, namely the models
listed in file &lt;f&gt;. Configure all other models (those
not <br>
listed in &lt;f&gt;) in local mode. This option is
incompatible with -g. File &lt;f&gt; must list valid names
of models from &lt;cmfile&gt;, each separated by any
whitespace character <br>
(e.g. a newline character).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--clanin &lt;f&gt; <br>
Read clan information on the models in &lt;cmfile&gt; from
file &lt;f&gt;. Not all models in &lt;cmfile&gt; need to be
a member of a clan. This option must be used in combination
with <br>
--fmt 2 and --tblout because clan annotation is only output
in format 2 of the tabular output file. See section 9 of the
Infernal user guide for specifications on the <br>
format of the clan input file &lt;f&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--oclan <br>
Only mark overlaps between models in the same clan. This
option must be used in combination with --fmt 2 , --tblout
and --clanin because clan annotation is only output in <br>
format 2 of the tabular output file, and clan information
can only be input using the --clanin option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--oskip &lt;f&gt; <br>
Omit any hit h from the tabular output file that satisifies
the following: another hit h2 overlaps with h and the
E-value of h2 is lower than that of h. Hit h will not <br>
appear in the tabular output file, although it will still
exist in the standard output. This option must be used in
combination with --fmt 2 --tblout because overlap <br>
annotation is only output in format 2 of the tabular output
file. When used in combination with --oclan only hits h that
satisfy the following are omitted: another hit h2 <br>
overlaps with h, the E-value of h2 is lower than that of h,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cpu &lt;n&gt; <br>
Set the number of parallel worker threads to &lt;n&gt;. By
default, Infernal sets this to the number of CPU cores it
detects in your machine - that is, it tries to maximize the
<br>
use of your available processor cores. Setting &lt;n&gt;
higher than the number of available cores is of little if
any value, but you may want to set it to something less. You
<br>
can also control this number by setting an environment
variable, INFERNAL_NCPU. This option is only available if
Infernal was compiled with POSIX threads support. This is
<br>
the default, but it may have been turned off at compile-time
for your site or machine for some reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stall <br>
For debugging the MPI master/worker version: pause after
start, to enable the developer to attach debuggers to the
running master and worker(s) processes. Send SIGCONT <br>
signal to release the pause. (Under gdb: (gdb) signal
SIGCONT) (Only available if optional MPI support was enabled
at compile-time.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mpi Run in MPI master/worker
mode, using mpirun. (Only available if optional MPI support
was enabled at compile-time.)</p>
