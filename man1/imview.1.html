<p>IMVIEW(1) IMVIEW(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
imview - displays and interactively analyses images</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
imview [ options ] [ image ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where image is an image file in
one of the supported formats, e.g: TIFF, JPEG, GIF, PNG,
BMP, XPM, PNM, etc...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Imview is an X11 and Windows GDI GUI application for
displaying images on screen. It has advanced capabilities
for interactive image analysis (getting information out of
images) <br>
and can be easily controlled through a socket connection for
embedding in image analysis systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Imview supports a large number
of popular and scientific image file formats, in part
through the use of the ImageMagick library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Here is the complete list of optional arguments for
imview.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Reads an image from the
standard input stream. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Reads and appends to an
existing pointfile (see option -p).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C &lt;lutname&gt; <br>
Specifies &lt;lutname&gt; as the default look-up tables for
all the images on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c &lt;lutname&gt; <br>
Applies the look-up table &lt;lutname&gt; to the preceding
image on the command line (see example section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-debug Starts a debugging GUI
console where debugging messages can be seen (there are lots
of them!). Under Unix messages are also appended to the file
/tmp/imbugs.txt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-delete <br>
Any image given to imview on the command line will be
deleted after imview exits. This is useful when imview is
started from an interpreter with a temporary image as
argu&acirc; <br>
ment. For safety only images with paths beginning with /tmp,
/usr/tmp or under the standard environment
variable-controlled TMPDIR directory are effectively
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-disable_io_keys <br>
This option disables some I/O shortcut that are not
menu-dependent, such as c that closes an image. This is
useful in conjunction with options -hide_menubar and
-dis&acirc; <br>
able_menubar for limiting the user&rsquo;s interaction with
the application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-disable_menubar <br>
This option completely disables the menu bar (but does not
hide it, see -hide_menubar for that). Both hiding and
disabling the menubar at the same time can be useful for
<br>
producing a viewer that users cannot control other than
through some other means than the menu (if imview is
embedded in another application for example).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-disable_quit <br>
This option disables the shortcut ways of quitting the
imview application, such as the Escape key, clicking the
windows manager &lsquo;close window&rsquo; button, etc. This
is useful <br>
to restrict the user&rsquo;s control over imview.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fork Sends imview to the
background (works on all platforms including windows). It is
better to use this option rather than the shell semantics
(adding &amp; at the end of the com&acirc; <br>
mand under Unix) when the server is ran in conjunction with
-server, because imview will synchonize the foreground and
background processes so that the foreground process <br>
can know the server port number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gamma &lt;value&gt; <br>
Sets the default gamma for all the images. A gamma between 0
and 1.0 will darken the displayed image while a gamma
greater than 1.0 will brighten them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Prints an abbreviated list of
options and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hide_menubar <br>
Hides the main menubar. The menu items are still accessible
via shortcuts. For example try Alt+f to get the
file-&gt;open menu. From there you can use the keyboard
arrow keys <br>
to select a menu item for example. This is useful if you
have little screen real estate, but confusing for the
beginner!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_dblbuf <br>
Do not use double buffering at certain zoom factors. This is
a hack you might want to experiment with if you find that
imview does not redraw some parts of images after <br>
closing and re-opening images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-locked <br>
Equivalent to all the following options used together:
-hide_menubar, -disable_menubar, -disable_iokeys and
-disable_quit. If run with this option, imview can only be
con&acirc; <br>
trolled via a socket in server mode. This is useful for
embedding imview in another application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mag &lt;zoom facto&gt; <br>
Magnifies all images by &lt;zoom factors&gt;. Any positive
value is legal. Values between 0 and 1.0 will reduce the
size of the images while values greater than 1.0 will expand
<br>
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_magick <br>
Disables the use of the ImageMagick library. This library is
very useful for reading and writing a large number of file
formats but tries to do too much sometimes, such as <br>
converting text files to images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p &lt;pointfile&gt; <br>
Specifies the point file name. A pointfile is a regular text
file in which point (pixel) information can be recorded. The
default point file name is pointfile. This option <br>
simply changes that default, no other action is taken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-portfile &lt;file&gt; <br>
This option is only useful in combination with -server.
Imview&rsquo;s server binds to a port in the range
7600-7700. Because it is often useful to have more than one
image <br>
server at the same time and because of the interactive
nature of imview, the precise port number is impossible to
predict, so when the server is started it prints the port
<br>
it decided to bind against on the command line, or
alternatively in a file, specified by this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: If you are planning to
send imview to the background, for this command to work as
expected, you must also use the -fork option, otherwise the
file might still be <br>
empty when the command returns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-server <br>
Starts the imview server. In server mode imview performs as
a TCP/IP server on which images can be uploaded and commands
can be run. The aim is to make imview completely <br>
remote-controllable: every command accessible via the menu
can also be made available through the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Imview uses its own text-based
protocol. For simple commands a standard telnet session is
enough to communicate with imview. However for uploading
images into imview a <br>
protocol similar to FTP has been implemented. A simple
imview client is shipped in source form with the imview
distribution. For a specification of the imview protocol see
<br>
the full documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Imview&rsquo;s server port
number is in the range 7600-7700 which allows up to 50
different imview server to be run on the same machine (each
server uses up two ports: one for <br>
commands and the other for binary data exchange, such as
uploading images).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stopdebug <br>
Used in conjunction with -debug, will stop the program after
each debugging message. To continue the user must type
&lt;Enter&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Prints the version and build
numbers, the date of build, the configuration options and
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wt &lt;title&gt; <br>
Changes the title of the main window. The default is
Imview.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
In the following examples &lsquo;%&rsquo; indicate the shell
prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIMPLE USAGE <br>
% imview</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simply starts imview displaying
the splash screen. An image can then be loaded using the
menus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% imview myimage.tiff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Will display image
myimage.tiff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% imview
/home/talbot/images/astro/*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Will display all images in the
directory /home/talbot/images/astro/. Use &lt;spacebar&gt;
to switch from one image to the next.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADVANCED USAGE <br>
% imview aGreyLevelImage.tif -c heat.lut</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Will display image
aGreyLevelImage.tif. Assuming this image only contains
grey-level information (a black and white photograph for
example), the false colours defined in heat.lut <br>
will be applied to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SERVER USAGE <br>
% imview -server -fork <br>
Port: 7600</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will start imview in server
mode. The only difference with the normal mode is that
imview can now be &quot;remote-controlled&quot; via a TCP/IP
connection. The port imview is bound to <br>
is printed on the command line when the server starts. To
save it to a file use the -portfile option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A simple telnet session can be
used to remote-control imview, as follows. See the full
documentation for more details:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% telnet localhost 7600 <br>
user talbot <br>
Welcome, talbot /tmp/fileBlabla 000 OK <br>
load &quot;/home/talbot/images/astro/neptune.tiff&quot; <br>
000 OK <br>
zoom factor 2 <br>
000 OK <br>
end <br>
Connection closed by foreign host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">imclient is shipped with the
source distribution as an implementation of a sample client
that can upload images into imview, as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% imclient -p 7600
/home/talbot/images/astro/jupiter.tiff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
See the TODO file in the source distribution or the web site
for an updated list of known bugs. Here is a list of the
most significant ones:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; resize still a
problem sometimes. Imview gets itself into a weird state
with incorrect limits and partial redraws. Specifying a
complete redraw should clear everything but <br>
doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Move to the
middle of the screen. Sometimes for no apparent reason
Imview moves to the middle of the screen. This seems to be
happening if the main window resises.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; last line and
last column of image often missing when scrollbar are
present.</p>
