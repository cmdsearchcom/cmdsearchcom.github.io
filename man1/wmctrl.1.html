<p>WMCTRL(1) General Commands Manual WMCTRL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
wmctrl - interact with a EWMH/NetWM compatible X Window
Manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
wmctrl [ options | actions ]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
wmctrl is a command that can be used to interact with an X
Window manager that is compatible with the EWMH/NetWM
specification. wmctrl can query the window manager for
informa&acirc; <br>
tion, and it can request that certain window management
actions be taken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wmctrl is controlled entirely by
its command line arguments. The command line arguments are
used to specify the action to be performed (with options
that modify behavior) and any <br>
arguments that might be needed to perform the actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections define
the supported actions and options. Arguments to the actions
and options are written in the form &lt;ARGNAME&gt; in the
descriptions below. The detailed <br>
syntax for writing arguments are in a single section
dedicated to that purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACTIONS <br>
The following command line arguments can be specified to
invoke a wmctrl action. Only one action can be executed with
the invocation of the wmctrl command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a &lt;WIN&gt; <br>
Switch to the desktop containing the window &lt;WIN&gt;,
raise the window, and give it focus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b ( add | remove |
toggle),prop1 [,prop2 ] <br>
Add, remove, or toggle up to two window properties
simultaneously. The window that is being modified must be
identified with a -r action. The property change is achived
by <br>
using the EWMH _NET_WM_STATE request. The supported property
names (for prop1 and prop2) are modal, sticky,
maximized_vert, maximized_horz, shaded, skip_taskbar, <br>
skip_pager, hidden, fullscreen, above and below. Two
properties are supported to allow operations like maximizing
a window to full screen mode. Note that this action is <br>
made up of exactly two shell command line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c &lt;WIN&gt; <br>
Close the window &lt;WIN&gt; gracefully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d List all desktops managed by
the window manager. One line is output for each desktop,
with the line broken up into space separated columns. The
first column contains an <br>
integer desktop number. The second column contains a
&rsquo;*&rsquo; character for the current desktop, otherwise
it contains a &rsquo;-&rsquo; character. The next two
columns contain the fixed <br>
string DG: and then the desktop geometry as
&rsquo;&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;&rsquo; (e.g.
&rsquo;1280x1024&rsquo;). The following two columns contain
the fixed string VP: and then the viewport position in <br>
the format &rsquo;&lt;y&gt;,&lt;y&gt;&rsquo; (e.g.
&rsquo;0,0&rsquo;). The next three columns after this
contains the fixed string WA: and then two columns with the
workarea geometry as &rsquo;X,Y and WxH&rsquo; (e.g. <br>
&rsquo;0,0 1280x998&rsquo;). The rest of the line contains
the name of the desktop (possibly containing multiple
spaces).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e &lt;MVARG&gt; <br>
Resize and move a window that has been specified with a -r
action according to the &lt;MVARG&gt; argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g w,h Change the geometry
(common size) of all desktops so they are w pixels wide and
h pixels high. w and h must be positive integers. A window
manager may ignore this request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print help text about program
usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I name <br>
Set the icon name (short title) of the window specified by a
-r action to name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k ( on | off ) <br>
Turn on or off the window manager&rsquo;s &quot;show the
desktop&quot; mode (if the window manager implements this
feature).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l List the windows being
managed by the window manager. One line is output for each
window, with the line broken up into space separated
columns. The first column always <br>
contains the window identity as a hexadecimal integer, and
the second column always contains the desktop number (a -1
is used to identify a sticky window). If the -p <br>
option is specified the next column will contain the PID for
the window as a decimal integer. If the -G option is
specified then four integer columns will follow: x- <br>
offset, y-offset, width and height. The next column always
contains the client machine name. The remainder of the line
contains the window title (possibly with multiple <br>
spaces in the title).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Display information about the
window manager and the environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n N Change the number of
desktops to N (a non-negative integer).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N name <br>
Set the name (long title) of the window specified by a -r
action to name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o x,y Change the viewport for
the current desktop. The values x and y are numeric offsets
that specify the position of the top left corner of the
viewport. A window manager may <br>
ignore this request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r &lt;WIN&gt; <br>
Specify a target window for an action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R &lt;WIN&gt; <br>
Move the window &lt;WIN&gt; to the current desktop, raise
the window, and give it focus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s &lt;DESK&gt; <br>
Switch to the desktop &lt;DESK&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t &lt;DESK&gt; <br>
Move a window that has been specified with the -r action to
the desktop &lt;DESK&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T name <br>
Set the both the name (long title) and icon name (short
title) of the window specified by a -r action to name. This
action is like using the -N and -I actions at the same <br>
time (which would otherwise be impossible since wmctrl can
execute only one action at a time).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options modify the default actions, or they
modify the interpretation of arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Window name arguments
(&lt;WIN&gt;) are to be treated as exact window titles that
are case sensitive. Without this options window titles are
considered to be case insensitive <br>
substrings of the full window title.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Include geometry information
in the output of the -l action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Interpret window arguments
(&lt;WIN&gt;) as a numeric value rather than a string name
for the window. If the numeric value starts with the prefix
&rsquo;0x&rsquo; it is assumed to be a <br>
hexadecimal number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Include PIDs in the window
list printed by the -l action. Prints a PID of
&rsquo;0&rsquo; if the application owning the window does
not support it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Override auto-detection and
force UTF-8 mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Provide verbose output. This
is really useful when debugging wmctrl itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w [
&lt;WORKAROUND&gt;[,&lt;WORKAROUND&gt;]... ] <br>
Use workarounds specified in the argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Include WM_CLASS in the
window list or interpret &lt;WIN&gt; as the WM_CLASS
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
&lt;DESK&gt; A Desktop is always specified by an integer
which represents the desktop numbers. Desktop numbers start
at 0. Use -1 to pin to all desktops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;MVARG&gt; <br>
A move and resize argument has the format
&rsquo;g,x,y,w,h&rsquo;. All five components are integers.
The first value, g, is the gravity of the window, with 0
being the most common <br>
value (the default value for the window). Please see the
EWMH specification for other values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The four remaining values are a
standard geometry specification: x,y is the position of the
top left corner of the window, and w,h is the width and
height of the window, <br>
with the exception that the value of -1 in any position is
interpreted to mean that the current geometry value should
not be modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;WIN&gt; This argument
specifies a window that is the target of an action. By
default the argument is treated as if were a string, and
windows are examined until one is found with <br>
a title the contains the specified string as a substring.
The substring matching is done in a case insensitive manner.
The -F option may be used to force exact, case <br>
sensitive title matching. The option -i may be used to
interpret the window target as a numeric window identity
instead of a string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The window name string :SELECT:
is treated specially. If this window name is used then
wmctrl waits for the user to select the target window by
clicking on it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The window name string :ACTIVE:
may be used to instruct wmctrl to use the currently active
window for the action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;WORKAROUND&gt; <br>
There is only one work around currently implemeted. It is
specified by using the string DESKTOP_TITLES_INVALID_UTF8
and it causes the printing of non-ASCII desktop tiles <br>
correctly when using Window Maker.</p>
