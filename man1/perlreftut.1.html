<p>PERLREFTUT(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLREFTUT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlreftut - Mark&rsquo;s very short tutorial about
references</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
One of the most important new features in Perl 5 was the
capability to manage complicated data structures like
multidimensional arrays and nested hashes. To enable these,
Perl 5 <br>
introduced a feature called &rsquo;references&rsquo;, and
using references is the key to managing complicated,
structured data in Perl. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s a lot
of funny syntax to <br>
learn, and the main manual page can be hard to follow. The
manual is quite complete, and sometimes people find that a
problem, because it can be hard to tell what is important
<br>
and what isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fortunately, you only need to
know 10% of what&rsquo;s in the main page to get 90% of the
benefit. This page will show you that 10%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Who Needs Complicated Data
Structures? <br>
One problem that came up all the time in Perl 4 was how to
represent a hash whose values were lists. Perl 4 had hashes,
of course, but the values had to be scalars; they <br>
couldn&rsquo;t be lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Why would you want a hash of
lists? Let&rsquo;s take a simple example: You have a file of
city and country names, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Chicago, USA <br>
Frankfurt, Germany <br>
Berlin, Germany <br>
Washington, USA <br>
Helsinki, Finland <br>
New York, USA</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and you want to produce an
output like this, with each country mentioned once, and then
an alphabetical list of the cities in that country:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finland: Helsinki. <br>
Germany: Berlin, Frankfurt. <br>
USA: Chicago, New York, Washington.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The natural way to do this is to
have a hash whose keys are country names. Associated with
each country name key is a list of the cities in that
country. Each time you read a <br>
line of input, split it into a country and a city, look up
the list of cities already known to be in that country, and
append the new city to the list. When you&rsquo;re done
reading <br>
the input, iterate over the hash as usual, sorting each list
of cities before you print it out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If hash values can&rsquo;t be
lists, you lose. In Perl 4, hash values can&rsquo;t be
lists; they can only be strings. You lose. You&rsquo;d
probably have to combine all the cities into a single <br>
string somehow, and then when time came to write the output,
you&rsquo;d have to break the string into a list, sort the
list, and turn it back into a string. This is messy and
error- <br>
prone. And it&rsquo;s frustrating, because Perl already has
perfectly good lists that would solve the problem if only
you could use them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Solution <br>
By the time Perl 5 rolled around, we were already stuck with
this design: Hash values must be scalars. The solution to
this is references.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A reference is a scalar value
that refers to an entire array or an entire hash (or to just
about anything else). Names are one kind of reference that
you&rsquo;re already familiar <br>
with. Think of the President of the United States: a messy,
inconvenient bag of blood and bones. But to talk about him,
or to represent him in a computer program, all you need <br>
is the easy, convenient scalar string &quot;Barack
Obama&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">References in Perl are like
names for arrays and hashes. They&rsquo;re Perl&rsquo;s
private, internal names, so you can be sure they&rsquo;re
unambiguous. Unlike &quot;Barack Obama&quot;, a reference
only <br>
refers to one thing, and you always know what it refers to.
If you have a reference to an array, you can recover the
entire array from it. If you have a reference to a hash,
<br>
you can recover the entire hash. But the reference is still
an easy, compact scalar value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can&rsquo;t have a hash
whose values are arrays; hash values can only be scalars.
We&rsquo;re stuck with that. But a single reference can
refer to an entire array, and references are <br>
scalars, so you can have a hash of references to arrays, and
it&rsquo;ll act a lot like a hash of arrays, and it&rsquo;ll
be just as useful as a hash of arrays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We&rsquo;ll come back to this
city-country problem later, after we&rsquo;ve seen some
syntax for managing references.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Syntax <br>
There are just two ways to make a reference, and just two
ways to use it once you have it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Making References <br>
Make Rule 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you put a &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$aref = @array; # $aref now
holds a reference to @array <br>
$href = hash; # $href now holds a reference to %hash <br>
$sref = calar; # $sref now holds a reference to $scalar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once the reference is stored in
a variable like $aref or $href, you can copy it or store it
just the same as any other scalar value:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$xy = $aref; # $xy now holds a
reference to @array <br>
$p[3] = $href; # $p[3] now holds a reference to %hash <br>
$z = $p[3]; # $z now holds a reference to %hash</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These examples show how to make
references to variables with names. Sometimes you want to
make an array or a hash that doesn&rsquo;t have a name. This
is analogous to the way you <br>
like to be able to use the string &quot;0 or the number 80
without having to store it in a named variable first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make Rule 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;[ ITEMS ]&quot; makes a
new, anonymous array, and returns a reference to that array.
&quot;{ ITEMS }&quot; makes a new, anonymous hash, and
returns a reference to that hash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$aref = [ 1, &quot;foo&quot;,
undef, 13 ]; <br>
# $aref now holds a reference to an array</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$href = { APR =&gt; 4, AUG =&gt;
8 }; <br>
# $href now holds a reference to a hash</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The references you get from rule
2 are the same kind of references that you get from rule
1:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># This: <br>
$aref = [ 1, 2, 3 ];</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Does the same as this: <br>
@array = (1, 2, 3); <br>
$aref = @array;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first line is an
abbreviation for the following two lines, except that it
doesn&rsquo;t create the superfluous array variable
@array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you write just
&quot;[]&quot;, you get a new, empty anonymous array. If you
write just &quot;{}&quot;, you get a new, empty anonymous
hash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using References <br>
What can you do with a reference once you have it?
It&rsquo;s a scalar value, and we&rsquo;ve seen that you can
store it as a scalar and get it back again just like any
scalar. There are <br>
just two more ways to use it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use Rule 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can always use an array
reference, in curly braces, in place of the name of an
array. For example, &quot;@{$aref}&quot; instead of
@array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are some examples of
that:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arrays:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@a @{$aref} An array <br>
reverse @a reverse @{$aref} Reverse the array <br>
$a[3] ${$aref}[3] An element of the array <br>
$a[3] = 17; ${$aref}[3] = 17 Assigning an element</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On each line are two expressions
that do the same thing. The left-hand versions operate on
the array @a. The right-hand versions operate on the array
that is referred to by <br>
$aref. Once they find the array they&rsquo;re operating on,
both versions do the same things to the arrays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using a hash reference is
exactly the same:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%h %{$href} A hash <br>
keys %h keys %{$href} Get the keys from the hash <br>
$h{&rsquo;red&rsquo;} ${$href}{&rsquo;red&rsquo;} An element
of the hash <br>
$h{&rsquo;red&rsquo;} = 17 ${$href}{&rsquo;red&rsquo;} = 17
Assigning an element</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whatever you want to do with a
reference, Use Rule 1 tells you how to do it. You just write
the Perl code that you would have written for doing the same
thing to a regular array <br>
or hash, and then replace the array or hash name with
&quot;{$reference}&quot;. &quot;How do I loop over an array
when all I have is a reference?&quot; Well, to loop over an
array, you would write</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for my $element (@array) { <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">so replace the array name,
@array, with the reference:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for my $element (@{$aref}) {
<br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;How do I print out the
contents of a hash when all I have is a reference?&quot;
First write the code for printing out a hash:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for my $key (keys %hash) { <br>
print &quot;$key =&gt; $hash{$key}0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And then replace the hash name
with the reference:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for my $key (keys %{$href}) {
<br>
print &quot;$key =&gt; ${$href}{$key}0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use Rule 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use Rule 1 is all you really
need, because it tells you how to do absolutely everything
you ever need to do with references. But the most common
thing to do with an array or a <br>
hash is to extract a single element, and the Use Rule 1
notation is cumbersome. So there is an abbreviation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;${$aref}[3]&quot; is too
hard to read, so you can write &quot;$aref-&gt;[3]&quot;
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;${$href}{red}&quot; is too
hard to read, so you can write &quot;$href-&gt;{red}&quot;
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If $aref holds a reference to an
array, then &quot;$aref-&gt;[3]&quot; is the fourth element
of the array. Don&rsquo;t confuse this with $aref[3], which
is the fourth element of a totally <br>
different array, one deceptively named @aref. $aref and
@aref are unrelated the same way that $item and @item
are.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly,
&quot;$href-&gt;{&rsquo;red&rsquo;}&quot; is part of the
hash referred to by the scalar variable $href, perhaps even
one with no name. $href{&rsquo;red&rsquo;} is part of the
deceptively named %href <br>
hash. It&rsquo;s easy to forget to leave out the
&quot;-&gt;&quot;, and if you do, you&rsquo;ll get bizarre
results when your program gets array and hash elements out
of totally unexpected hashes and <br>
arrays that weren&rsquo;t the ones you wanted to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An Example <br>
Let&rsquo;s see a quick example of how all this is
useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, remember that &quot;[1,
2, 3]&quot; makes an anonymous array containing &quot;(1, 2,
3)&quot;, and gives you a reference to that array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now think about</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@a = ( [1, 2, 3], <br>
[4, 5, 6], <br>
[7, 8, 9] <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@a is an array with three
elements, and each one is a reference to another array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$a[1] is one of these
references. It refers to an array, the array containing
&quot;(4, 5, 6)&quot;, and because it is a reference to an
array, Use Rule 2 says that we can write <br>
$a[1]-&gt;[2] to get the third element from that array.
$a[1]-&gt;[2] is the 6. Similarly, $a[0]-&gt;[1] is the 2.
What we have here is like a two-dimensional array; you can
write <br>
$a[ROW]-&gt;[COLUMN] to get or set the element in any row
and any column of the array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The notation still looks a
little cumbersome, so there&rsquo;s one more
abbreviation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arrow Rule <br>
In between two subscripts, the arrow is optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of $a[1]-&gt;[2], we can
write $a[1][2]; it means the same thing. Instead of
&quot;$a[0]-&gt;[1] = 23&quot;, we can write &quot;$a[0][1]
= 23&quot;; it means the same thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now it really looks like
two-dimensional arrays!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can see why the arrows are
important. Without them, we would have had to write
&quot;${$a[1]}[2]&quot; instead of $a[1][2]. For
three-dimensional arrays, they let us write <br>
$x[2][3][5] instead of the unreadable
&quot;${${$x[2]}[3]}[5]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solution <br>
Here&rsquo;s the answer to the problem I posed earlier, of
reformatting a file of city and country names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 my %table;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 while (&lt;&gt;) { <br>
3 chomp; <br>
4 my ($city, $country) = split /, /; <br>
5 $table{$country} = [] unless exists $table{$country}; <br>
6 push @{$table{$country}}, $city; <br>
7 }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8 foreach $country (sort keys
%table) { <br>
9 print &quot;$country: &quot;; <br>
10 my @cities = @{$table{$country}}; <br>
11 print join &rsquo;, &rsquo;, sort @cities; <br>
12 print &quot;.0; <br>
13 }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program has two pieces:
Lines 2--7 read the input and build a data structure, and
lines 8-13 analyze the data and print out the report.
We&rsquo;re going to have a hash, %table, <br>
whose keys are country names, and whose values are
references to arrays of city names. The data structure will
look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%table <br>
+-------+---+ <br>
| | | +-----------+--------+ <br>
|Germany| *----&gt;| Frankfurt | Berlin | <br>
| | | +-----------+--------+ <br>
+-------+---+ <br>
| | | +----------+ <br>
|Finland| *----&gt;| Helsinki | <br>
| | | +----------+ <br>
+-------+---+ <br>
| | | +---------+------------+----------+ <br>
| USA | *----&gt;| Chicago | Washington | New York | <br>
| | | +---------+------------+----------+ <br>
+-------+---+</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We&rsquo;ll look at output
first. Supposing we already have this structure, how do we
print it out?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8 foreach $country (sort keys
%table) { <br>
9 print &quot;$country: &quot;; <br>
10 my @cities = @{$table{$country}}; <br>
11 print join &rsquo;, &rsquo;, sort @cities; <br>
12 print &quot;.0; <br>
13 }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%table is an ordinary hash, and
we get a list of keys from it, sort the keys, and loop over
the keys as usual. The only use of references is in line 10.
$table{$country} looks <br>
up the key $country in the hash and gets the value, which is
a reference to an array of cities in that country. Use Rule
1 says that we can recover the array by saying <br>
&quot;@{$table{$country}}&quot;. Line 10 is just like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@cities = @array;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">except that the name
&quot;array&quot; has been replaced by the reference
&quot;{$table{$country}}&quot;. The &quot;@&quot; tells Perl
to get the entire array. Having gotten the list of cities,
we sort it, <br>
join it, and print it out as usual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lines 2-7 are responsible for
building the structure in the first place. Here they are
again:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 while (&lt;&gt;) { <br>
3 chomp; <br>
4 my ($city, $country) = split /, /; <br>
5 $table{$country} = [] unless exists $table{$country}; <br>
6 push @{$table{$country}}, $city; <br>
7 }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lines 2-4 acquire a city and
country name. Line 5 looks to see if the country is already
present as a key in the hash. If it&rsquo;s not, the program
uses the &quot;[]&quot; notation (Make <br>
Rule 2) to manufacture a new, empty anonymous array of
cities, and installs a reference to it into the hash under
the appropriate key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Line 6 installs the city name
into the appropriate array. $table{$country} now holds a
reference to the array of cities seen in that country so
far. Line 6 is exactly like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">push @array, $city;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">except that the name
&quot;array&quot; has been replaced by the reference
&quot;{$table{$country}}&quot;. The &quot;push&quot; adds a
city name to the end of the referred-to array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There&rsquo;s one fine point I
skipped. Line 5 is unnecessary, and we can get rid of
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 while (&lt;&gt;) { <br>
3 chomp; <br>
4 my ($city, $country) = split /, /; <br>
5 #### $table{$country} = [] unless exists $table{$country};
<br>
6 push @{$table{$country}}, $city; <br>
7 }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there&rsquo;s already an
entry in %table for the current $country, then nothing is
different. Line 6 will locate the value in $table{$country},
which is a reference to an array, <br>
and push $city into the array. But what does it do when
$country holds a key, say &quot;Greece&quot;, that is not
yet in %table?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is Perl, so it does the
exact right thing. It sees that you want to push
&quot;Athens&quot; onto an array that doesn&rsquo;t exist,
so it helpfully makes a new, empty, anonymous array for <br>
you, installs it into %table, and then pushes
&quot;Athens&quot; onto it. This is called
&rsquo;autovivification&rsquo;--bringing things to life
automatically. Perl saw that they key wasn&rsquo;t in the
<br>
hash, so it created a new hash entry automatically. Perl saw
that you wanted to use the hash value as an array, so it
created a new empty array and installed a reference to it in
<br>
the hash automatically. And as usual, Perl made the array
one element longer to hold the new city name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Rest <br>
I promised to give you 90% of the benefit with 10% of the
details, and that means I left out 90% of the details. Now
that you have an overview of the important parts, it should
<br>
be easier to read the perlref manual page, which discusses
100% of the details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of the highlights of
perlref:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You can make
references to anything, including scalars, functions, and
other references.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In Use Rule 1,
you can omit the curly brackets whenever the thing inside
them is an atomic scalar variable like $aref. For example,
@$aref is the same as &quot;@{$aref}&quot;, and <br>
$$aref[1] is the same as &quot;${$aref}[1]&quot;. If
you&rsquo;re just starting out, you may want to adopt the
habit of always including the curly brackets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; This
doesn&rsquo;t copy the underlying array:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$aref2 = $aref1;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You get two references to the
same array. If you modify &quot;$aref1-&gt;[23]&quot; and
then look at &quot;$aref2-&gt;[23]&quot; you&rsquo;ll see
the change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To copy the array, use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$aref2 = [@{$aref1}];</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This uses &quot;[...]&quot;
notation to create a new anonymous array, and $aref2 is
assigned a reference to the new array. The new array is
initialized with the contents of the array <br>
referred to by $aref1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, to copy an anonymous
hash, you can use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$href2 = {%{$href1}};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; To see if a
variable contains a reference, use the &quot;ref&quot;
function. It returns true if its argument is a reference.
Actually it&rsquo;s a little better than that: It returns
<br>
&quot;HASH&quot; for hash references and &quot;ARRAY&quot;
for array references.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you try to
use a reference like a string, you get strings like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARRAY(0x80f5dec) or
HASH(0x826afc0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you ever see a string that
looks like this, you&rsquo;ll know you printed out a
reference by mistake.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A side effect of this
representation is that you can use &quot;eq&quot; to see if
two references refer to the same thing. (But you should
usually use &quot;==&quot; instead because it&rsquo;s much
<br>
faster.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You can use a
string as if it were a reference. If you use the string
&quot;foo&quot; as an array reference, it&rsquo;s taken to
be a reference to the array @foo. This is called a soft <br>
reference or symbolic reference. The declaration &quot;use
strict &rsquo;refs&rsquo;&quot; disables this feature, which
can cause all sorts of trouble if you use it by
accident.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You might prefer to go on to
perllol instead of perlref; it discusses lists of lists and
multidimensional arrays in detail. After that, you should
move on to perldsc; it&rsquo;s a <br>
Data Structure Cookbook that shows recipes for using and
printing out arrays of hashes, hashes of arrays, and other
kinds of data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Summary <br>
Everyone needs compound data structures, and in Perl the way
you get them is with references. There are four important
rules for managing references: Two for making references
<br>
and two for using them. Once you know these rules you can do
most of the important things you need to do with
references.</p>
