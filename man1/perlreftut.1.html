perlreftut - Mark's very short tutorial about references
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
One of the most important new features in Perl 5 was the capability to manage
  complicated data structures like multidimensional arrays and nested hashes. To
  enable these, Perl 5 introduced a feature called 'references', and using
  references is the key to managing complicated, structured data in Perl.
  Unfortunately, there's a lot of funny syntax to learn, and the main manual
  page can be hard to follow. The manual is quite complete, and sometimes people
  find that a problem, because it can be hard to tell what is important and what
  isn't.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Fortunately, you only need to know 10% of what's in the main page to get 90% of
  the benefit. This page will show you that 10%.

One problem that came up all the time in Perl 4 was how to represent a hash
  whose values were lists. Perl 4 had hashes, of course, but the values had to
  be scalars; they couldn't be lists.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Why would you want a hash of lists? Let's take a simple example: You have a file
  of city and country names, like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        Chicago, USA
        Frankfurt, Germany
        Berlin, Germany
        Washington, USA
        Helsinki, Finland
        New York, USA
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and you want to produce an output like this, with each country mentioned once,
  and then an alphabetical list of the cities in that country:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        Finland: Helsinki.
        Germany: Berlin, Frankfurt.
        USA:  Chicago, New York, Washington.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The natural way to do this is to have a hash whose keys are country names.
  Associated with each country name key is a list of the cities in that country.
  Each time you read a line of input, split it into a country and a city, look
  up the list of cities already known to be in that country, and append the new
  city to the list. When you're done reading the input, iterate over the hash as
  usual, sorting each list of cities before you print it out.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If hash values can't be lists, you lose. In Perl 4, hash values can't be lists;
  they can only be strings. You lose. You'd probably have to combine all the
  cities into a single string somehow, and then when time came to write the
  output, you'd have to break the string into a list, sort the list, and turn it
  back into a string. This is messy and error-prone. And it's frustrating,
  because Perl already has perfectly good lists that would solve the problem if
  only you could use them.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="The_Solution"><a class="selflink" href="#The_Solution">The
  Solution</a></h1>
By the time Perl 5 rolled around, we were already stuck with this design: Hash
  values must be scalars. The solution to this is references.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A reference is a scalar value that <i>refers to</i> an entire array or an entire
  hash (or to just about anything else). Names are one kind of reference that
  you're already familiar with. Think of the President of the United States: a
  messy, inconvenient bag of blood and bones. But to talk about him, or to
  represent him in a computer program, all you need is the easy, convenient
  scalar string &quot;Barack Obama&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
References in Perl are like names for arrays and hashes. They're Perl's private,
  internal names, so you can be sure they're unambiguous. Unlike &quot;Barack
  Obama&quot;, a reference only refers to one thing, and you always know what it
  refers to. If you have a reference to an array, you can recover the entire
  array from it. If you have a reference to a hash, you can recover the entire
  hash. But the reference is still an easy, compact scalar value.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can't have a hash whose values are arrays; hash values can only be scalars.
  We're stuck with that. But a single reference can refer to an entire array,
  and references are scalars, so you can have a hash of references to arrays,
  and it'll act a lot like a hash of arrays, and it'll be just as useful as a
  hash of arrays.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We'll come back to this city-country problem later, after we've seen some syntax
  for managing references.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Syntax"><a class="selflink" href="#Syntax">Syntax</a></h1>
There are just two ways to make a reference, and just two ways to use it once
  you have it.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Making_References"><a class="selflink" href="#Making_References">Making
  References</a></h2>
<i></i><b><i>Make Rule 1</i></b><i></i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you put a &quot;\&quot; in front of a variable, you get a reference to that
  variable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $aref = \@array;         # $aref now holds a reference to @array
    $href = \%hash;          # $href now holds a reference to %hash
    $sref = \$scalar;        # $sref now holds a reference to $scalar
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once the reference is stored in a variable like $aref or $href, you can copy it
  or store it just the same as any other scalar value:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $xy = $aref;             # $xy now holds a reference to @array
    $p[3] = $href;           # $p[3] now holds a reference to %hash
    $z = $p[3];              # $z now holds a reference to %hash
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
These examples show how to make references to variables with names. Sometimes
  you want to make an array or a hash that doesn't have a name. This is
  analogous to the way you like to be able to use the string &quot;\n&quot; or
  the number 80 without having to store it in a named variable first.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Make Rule 2</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;[ ITEMS ]&quot; makes a new, anonymous array, and returns a reference to
  that array. &quot;{ ITEMS }&quot; makes a new, anonymous hash, and returns a
  reference to that hash.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $aref = [ 1, &quot;foo&quot;, undef, 13 ];
    # $aref now holds a reference to an array
    $href = { APR =&gt; 4, AUG =&gt; 8 };
    # $href now holds a reference to a hash
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The references you get from rule 2 are the same kind of references that you get
  from rule 1:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        # This:
        $aref = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
        # Does the same as this:
        @array = (1, 2, 3);
        $aref = \@array;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first line is an abbreviation for the following two lines, except that it
  doesn't create the superfluous array variable @array.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you write just &quot;[]&quot;, you get a new, empty anonymous array. If you
  write just &quot;{}&quot;, you get a new, empty anonymous hash.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Using_References"><a class="selflink" href="#Using_References">Using
  References</a></h2>
What can you do with a reference once you have it? It's a scalar value, and
  we've seen that you can store it as a scalar and get it back again just like
  any scalar. There are just two more ways to use it:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><b><i>Use Rule 1</i></b><i></i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can always use an array reference, in curly braces, in place of the name of
  an array. For example, &quot;@{$aref}&quot; instead of @array.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here are some examples of that:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Arrays:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        @a              @{$aref}                An array
        reverse @a      reverse @{$aref}        Reverse the array
        $a[3]           ${$aref}[3]             An element of the array
        $a[3] = 17;     ${$aref}[3] = 17        Assigning an element
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
On each line are two expressions that do the same thing. The left-hand versions
  operate on the array @a. The right-hand versions operate on the array that is
  referred to by $aref. Once they find the array they're operating on, both
  versions do the same things to the arrays.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Using a hash reference is <i>exactly</i> the same:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        %h              %{$href}              A hash
        keys %h         keys %{$href}         Get the keys from the hash
        $h{'red'}       ${$href}{'red'}       An element of the hash
        $h{'red'} = 17  ${$href}{'red'} = 17  Assigning an element
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Whatever you want to do with a reference, <b>Use Rule 1</b> tells you how to do
  it. You just write the Perl code that you would have written for doing the
  same thing to a regular array or hash, and then replace the array or hash name
  with &quot;{$reference}&quot;. &quot;How do I loop over an array when all I
  have is a reference?&quot; Well, to loop over an array, you would write
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        for my $element (@array) {
           ...
        }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
so replace the array name, @array, with the reference:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        for my $element (@{$aref}) {
           ...
        }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;How do I print out the contents of a hash when all I have is a
  reference?&quot; First write the code for printing out a hash:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        for my $key (keys %hash) {
          print &quot;$key =&gt; $hash{$key}\n&quot;;
        }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And then replace the hash name with the reference:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        for my $key (keys %{$href}) {
          print &quot;$key =&gt; ${$href}{$key}\n&quot;;
        }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i></i><b><i>Use Rule 2</i></b><i></i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Use Rule 1</b> is all you really need, because it tells you how to do
  absolutely everything you ever need to do with references. But the most common
  thing to do with an array or a hash is to extract a single element, and the
  <b>Use Rule 1</b> notation is cumbersome. So there is an abbreviation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;${$aref}[3]&quot; is too hard to read, so you can write
  &quot;$aref-&gt;[3]&quot; instead.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;${$href}{red}&quot; is too hard to read, so you can write
  &quot;$href-&gt;{red}&quot; instead.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If $aref holds a reference to an array, then &quot;$aref-&gt;[3]&quot; is the
  fourth element of the array. Don't confuse this with $aref[3], which is the
  fourth element of a totally different array, one deceptively named @aref.
  $aref and @aref are unrelated the same way that $item and @item are.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Similarly, &quot;$href-&gt;{'red'}&quot; is part of the hash referred to by the
  scalar variable $href, perhaps even one with no name. $href{'red'} is part of
  the deceptively named %href hash. It's easy to forget to leave out the
  &quot;-&gt;&quot;, and if you do, you'll get bizarre results when your program
  gets array and hash elements out of totally unexpected hashes and arrays that
  weren't the ones you wanted to use.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="An_Example"><a class="selflink" href="#An_Example">An
  Example</a></h2>
Let's see a quick example of how all this is useful.
<div class="Pp"></div>
First, remember that &quot;[1, 2, 3]&quot; makes an anonymous array containing
  &quot;(1, 2, 3)&quot;, and gives you a reference to that array.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now think about
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        @a = ( [1, 2, 3],
               [4, 5, 6],
               [7, 8, 9]
             );
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
@a is an array with three elements, and each one is a reference to another
  array.
<div class="Pp"></div>
$a[1] is one of these references. It refers to an array, the array containing
  &quot;(4, 5, 6)&quot;, and because it is a reference to an array, <b>Use Rule
  2</b> says that we can write $a[1]-&gt;[2] to get the third element from that
  array. $a[1]-&gt;[2] is the 6. Similarly, $a[0]-&gt;[1] is the 2. What we have
  here is like a two-dimensional array; you can write $a[ROW]-&gt;[COLUMN] to
  get or set the element in any row and any column of the array.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The notation still looks a little cumbersome, so there's one more abbreviation:
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Arrow_Rule"><a class="selflink" href="#Arrow_Rule">Arrow
  Rule</a></h2>
In between two <b>subscripts</b>, the arrow is optional.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Instead of $a[1]-&gt;[2], we can write $a[1][2]; it means the same thing.
  Instead of &quot;$a[0]-&gt;[1] = 23&quot;, we can write &quot;$a[0][1] =
  23&quot;; it means the same thing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now it really looks like two-dimensional arrays!
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can see why the arrows are important. Without them, we would have had to
  write &quot;${$a[1]}[2]&quot; instead of $a[1][2]. For three-dimensional
  arrays, they let us write $x[2][3][5] instead of the unreadable
  &quot;${${$x[2]}[3]}[5]&quot;.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Solution"><a class="selflink" href="#Solution">Solution</a></h1>
Here's the answer to the problem I posed earlier, of reformatting a file of city
  and country names.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    1   my %table;
    2   while (&lt;&gt;) {
    3    chomp;
    4     my ($city, $country) = split /, /;
    5     $table{$country} = [] unless exists $table{$country};
    6     push @{$table{$country}}, $city;
    7   }
    8   foreach $country (sort keys %table) {
    9     print &quot;$country: &quot;;
   10     my @cities = @{$table{$country}};
   11     print join ', ', sort @cities;
   12     print &quot;.\n&quot;;
   13   }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program has two pieces: Lines 2--7 read the input and build a data
  structure, and lines 8-13 analyze the data and print out the report. We're
  going to have a hash, %table, whose keys are country names, and whose values
  are references to arrays of city names. The data structure will look like
  this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
           %table
        +-------+---+
        |       |   |   +-----------+--------+
        |Germany| *----&gt;| Frankfurt | Berlin |
        |       |   |   +-----------+--------+
        +-------+---+
        |       |   |   +----------+
        |Finland| *----&gt;| Helsinki |
        |       |   |   +----------+
        +-------+---+
        |       |   |   +---------+------------+----------+
        |  USA  | *----&gt;| Chicago | Washington | New York |
        |       |   |   +---------+------------+----------+
        +-------+---+
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We'll look at output first. Supposing we already have this structure, how do we
  print it out?
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    8   foreach $country (sort keys %table) {
    9     print &quot;$country: &quot;;
   10     my @cities = @{$table{$country}};
   11     print join ', ', sort @cities;
   12     print &quot;.\n&quot;;
   13   }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%table is an ordinary hash, and we get a list of keys from it, sort the keys,
  and loop over the keys as usual. The only use of references is in line 10.
  $table{$country} looks up the key $country in the hash and gets the value,
  which is a reference to an array of cities in that country. <b>Use Rule 1</b>
  says that we can recover the array by saying &quot;@{$table{$country}}&quot;.
  Line 10 is just like
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        @cities = @array;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
except that the name &quot;array&quot; has been replaced by the reference
  &quot;{$table{$country}}&quot;. The &quot;@&quot; tells Perl to get the entire
  array. Having gotten the list of cities, we sort it, join it, and print it out
  as usual.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Lines 2-7 are responsible for building the structure in the first place. Here
  they are again:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    2   while (&lt;&gt;) {
    3    chomp;
    4     my ($city, $country) = split /, /;
    5     $table{$country} = [] unless exists $table{$country};
    6     push @{$table{$country}}, $city;
    7   }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Lines 2-4 acquire a city and country name. Line 5 looks to see if the country is
  already present as a key in the hash. If it's not, the program uses the
  &quot;[]&quot; notation ( <b>Make Rule 2</b>) to manufacture a new, empty
  anonymous array of cities, and installs a reference to it into the hash under
  the appropriate key.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Line 6 installs the city name into the appropriate array. $table{$country} now
  holds a reference to the array of cities seen in that country so far. Line 6
  is exactly like
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        push @array, $city;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
except that the name &quot;array&quot; has been replaced by the reference
  &quot;{$table{$country}}&quot;. The &quot;push&quot; adds a city name to the
  end of the referred-to array.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There's one fine point I skipped. Line 5 is unnecessary, and we can get rid of
  it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    2   while (&lt;&gt;) {
    3    chomp;
    4     my ($city, $country) = split /, /;
    5   ####  $table{$country} = [] unless exists $table{$country};
    6     push @{$table{$country}}, $city;
    7   }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If there's already an entry in %table for the current $country, then nothing is
  different. Line 6 will locate the value in $table{$country}, which is a
  reference to an array, and push $city into the array. But what does it do when
  $country holds a key, say &quot;Greece&quot;, that is not yet in %table?
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is Perl, so it does the exact right thing. It sees that you want to push
  &quot;Athens&quot; onto an array that doesn't exist, so it helpfully makes a
  new, empty, anonymous array for you, installs it into %table, and then pushes
  &quot;Athens&quot; onto it. This is called 'autovivification'--bringing things
  to life automatically. Perl saw that they key wasn't in the hash, so it
  created a new hash entry automatically. Perl saw that you wanted to use the
  hash value as an array, so it created a new empty array and installed a
  reference to it in the hash automatically. And as usual, Perl made the array
  one element longer to hold the new city name.

I promised to give you 90% of the benefit with 10% of the details, and that

  important parts, it should be easier to read the perlref manual page, which
  discusses 100% of the details.

Some of the highlights of perlref:

    If you ever see a string that looks like this, you'll know you printed out a
      reference by mistake.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A side effect of this representation is that you can use &quot;eq&quot; to
      see if two references refer to the same thing. (But you should usually use
      &quot;==&quot; instead because it's much faster.)</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">You can use a string as if it were a reference. If you use
      the string &quot;foo&quot; as an array reference, it's taken to be a
      reference to the array @foo. This is called a <i>soft reference</i> or
      <i>symbolic</i> <i>reference</i>. The declaration &quot;use strict
      'refs'&quot; disables this feature, which can cause all sorts of trouble
      if you use it by accident.</dd>

You might prefer to go on to perllol instead of perlref; it discusses lists of
  lists and multidimensional arrays in detail. After that, you should move on to
  perldsc; it's a Data Structure Cookbook that shows recipes for using and
  printing out arrays of hashes, hashes of arrays, and other kinds of data.

Everyone needs compound data structures, and in Perl the way you get them is
  with references. There are four important rules for managing references: Two
  for making references and two for using them. Once you know these rules you
  can do most of the important things you need to do with references.
