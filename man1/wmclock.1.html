<p>wmclock(1) General Commands Manual wmclock(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
wmclock - A dockable clock for the Window Maker window
manager</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
wmclock [{-12|-24|-year}] [-noblink] [-version] [-exe
program] [-led color] [-monthxpm filename] [-weekdayxpm
filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Wmclock is an applet which displays the date and time in a
dockable tile in the same style as the clock from the
NEXTSTEP(tm) operating system. Wmclock is specially designed
for <br>
the Window Maker window manager, by Alfredo Kojima, and
features multiple language support, twenty-four-hour and
twelve-hour (am/pm) time display, and, optionally, can run a
<br>
user-specified program on a mouse click. Wmclock is derived
from asclock, a similar clock for the AfterStep window
manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-12 or -24 <br>
Display the time in either twelve-hour format (with am/pm)
or twenty-four-hour format. Defaults to twenty-four-hour
display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-year Display the current year
in the LED display instead of the time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noblink <br>
The separator between the hours and minutes in the time
display blinks by default. This option turns off the
blinking and displays a steadily lit separator instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-interval n <br>
Set the blink cycle to n seconds. The default is 2 (1 second
on, 1 second off).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Displays the version of Wmclock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-exe command <br>
Run command in the background when a mouse button is pressed
over wmclock. See below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-led color <br>
Use color as the foreground color of the LED display. Color
may be either a named color from the rgb.txt database (for
example, &lsquo;red&rsquo; or &lsquo;chartreuse&rsquo;) or a
numeric color <br>
specification in any of the usual X11 formats (for example,
&lsquo;#ff0000&rsquo; or &lsquo;rgb:7f/ff/00&rsquo;). See
the X(1) man page for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-monthxpm filename <br>
Get month abbreviations from filename, which is expected to
be in the XPM format. See below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-weekdayxpm filename <br>
Get weekday abbreviations from filename, which is expected
to be in the XPM format. See below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INVOCATION AND EXAMPLES <br>
The simplest way to start wmclock is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wmclock</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wmclock displays in its own
appicon, which you can place in Window Maker&rsquo;s dock by
holding down the [Alt] or [Meta] key and dragging wmclock to
the dock with the primary mouse <br>
button (usually the left one).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a more complicated
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wmclock -12 -led gold -exe
/usr/GNUstep/Apps/WPrefs.app/WPrefs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This displays 12-hour time in an
amber-colored LED display, and starts Window Maker&rsquo;s
preferences utility when you click on wmclock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DETAILS <br>
Running Commands <br>
When you use wmclock with the -exe option, wmclock will run
the command you specify whenever you press a mouse button
while the mouse cursor is over wmclock. Wmclock uses the
<br>
system(3) function from the C library (and ultimately
/bin/sh) to run the command; hence, the command must be in
Bourne-shell syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using Alternate Month and
Weekday Abbreviations <br>
You can use the -monthxpm and -weekdayxpm options to
convince wmclock to display month and day-of-week
abbreviations in a language besides the one it was compiled
with, or to <br>
display them in a language that wmclock does not yet
support. The files you specify must be in the XPM format,
and they must follow the same strict size and placement as
the <br>
month and weekday XPMs that come in the wmclock source
package. Each weekday abbreviation must be 21 pixels wide
and 6 pixels high; each month abbreviation must be 22 pixels
<br>
wide and 6 pixels high. The month abbreviations must be
arranged vertically, beginning with January at the top and
continuing down to December at the bottom. The weekday
abbre&acirc; <br>
viations must also be arranged vertically, beginning with
Monday at the top and continuing to Sunday at the
bottom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can find XPM files for a
variety of languages in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/share/wmclock</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to have a French
display, you could use the following command line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wmclock -monthxpm
/usr/share/wmclock/lang.french/month.xpm -weekdayxpm
/usr/share/wmclock/lang.french/weekday.xpm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Obsolete Options <br>
In order to maintain command-line compatibility (mostly)
with asclock, wmclock accepts a few options on the command
line without complaining, even though they don&rsquo;t have
any <br>
effect. The options which wmclock accepts in this manner are
-shape and -iconic. Some dockable versions of asclock
required one or both of these options to become properly
<br>
dockable. However, Since wmclock is designed for Window
Maker&rsquo;s dock, it already displays in a shaped window
in its own dockable appicon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Wmclock shouldn&rsquo;t run a command on a single click;
should use a double click instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wmclock should use Alfredo
Kojima&rsquo;s libdockapp library instead of inventing its
own wheel.</p>
