<p>RAWDOG(1) General Commands Manual RAWDOG(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rawdog - an RSS Aggregator Without Delusions Of Grandeur</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rawdog [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
rawdog is a feed aggregator for Unix-like systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rawdog uses the Python
feedparser module to retrieve articles from a number of
feeds in RSS, Atom and other formats, and writes out a
single HTML file, based on a template either <br>
provided by the user or generated by rawdog, containing the
latest articles it&rsquo;s seen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rawdog uses the ETags and
Last-Modified headers to avoid fetching a file that
hasn&rsquo;t changed, and supports gzip and delta
compression to reduce bandwidth when it has. rawdog is <br>
configured from a simple text file; the only state kept
between invocations that can&rsquo;t be reconstructed from
the feeds is the ordering of articles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with
long options starting with two dashes (&lsquo;-&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General Options <br>
-d DIR, --dir DIR <br>
Use DIR instead of the $HOME/.rawdog directory. This option
lets you have two or more rawdog setups with different
configurations and sets of feeds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --no-locking <br>
Do not lock the state file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rawdog usually claims a lock on
its state file, to stop more than one instance from running
at the same time. Unfortunately, some filesystems
don&rsquo;t support file locking; <br>
you can use this option to disable locking entirely if
you&rsquo;re in that situation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Print more detailed information about what rawdog is doing
to stderr while it runs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V FILE, --log FILE <br>
As with -V, but write the information to FILE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W, --no-lock-wait <br>
Exit silently if the state file is already locked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the state file is already
locked, rawdog will normally wait until it becomes
available, then run. However, if you&rsquo;re got a lot of
feeds and a slow network connection, <br>
you might prefer rawdog to just give up immediately if the
previous instance is still running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Actions <br>
rawdog will perform these actions in the order given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a URL, --add URL <br>
Try to find a feed associated with URL and add it to the
config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">URL may be a feed itself, or it
can be an HTML page that links to a feed in any of a variety
of ways. rawdog uses heuristics to pick the best feed it can
find, and will <br>
complain if it can&rsquo;t find one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c FILE, --config FILE <br>
Read FILE as an additional config file; any options provided
in FILE will override those set in the main config file
(with the exception of &quot;feed&quot;, which is
cumulative). <br>
FILE may be an absolute path or a path relative to your
.rawdog directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that $HOME/.rawdog/config
will still be read first even if you specify this option. -c
is mostly useful when you want to write the same set of
feeds out using two <br>
different sets of output options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f URL, --update-feed URL <br>
Update the feed pointed to by URL immediately, even if its
period hasn&rsquo;t elapsed since it was last updated. This
is useful when you&rsquo;re publishing a feed yourself, and
<br>
want to test whether it&rsquo;s working properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --list <br>
List brief information about each of the feeds that was
known about at the time of the last update.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r URL, --remove URL <br>
Remove feed URL from the config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s TEMPLATE, --show TEMPLATE
<br>
Print one of the templates currently in use to stdout.
TEMPLATE may be page, item, feedlist or feeditem. This can
be used as a starting point if you want to design your <br>
own template for use with the corresponding template option
in the config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --update <br>
Fetch data from the feeds and store it. This could take some
time if you&rsquo;ve got lots of feeds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --write <br>
Write out the HTML output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special Actions <br>
If one of these options is specified, rawdog will perform
only that action, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dump URL <br>
Show what rawdog&rsquo;s feed parser returns for URL. This
can be useful when trying to understand why rawdog
doesn&rsquo;t display a feed correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Provide a brief summary
of all the options rawdog supports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
rawdog is typically invoked from cron(1). The following
crontab(5) entry would fetch data from feeds and write it to
HTML once an hour, exiting if rawdog is already running:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 * * * * rawdog -Wuw</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$HOME/.rawdog/config</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
cron(1).</p>
