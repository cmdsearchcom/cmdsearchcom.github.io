<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
biboumi - XMPP gateway to IRC</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description <br>
Biboumi is an XMPP gateway that connects to IRC servers and
translates between the two protocols. It can be used to
access IRC channels using any XMPP client as if these
chan&acirc; <br>
nels were XMPP MUCs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Synopsis <br>
biboumi [config_filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
Available command line options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">config_filename <br>
Specify the file to read for configuration. See CONFIG
section for more details on its content.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration <br>
The configuration file uses a simple format of the form
option=value. Here is a description of each possible
option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration can be re-read
at runtime (you can for example change the log level without
having to restart biboumi) by sending SIGUSR1 or SIGUSR2
(see kill(1)) to the <br>
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hostname <br>
Mandatory. The hostname served by the
XMPP&acirc;&macr;gateway. This domain must be configured in
the XMPP server as an external component. See the manual for
your XMPP server for more <br>
information. For prosody, see
&lt;http://prosody.im/doc/components#adding_an_external_component&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password <br>
Mandatory. The password used to authenticate the XMPP
component to your XMPP server. This password must be
configured in the XMPP&acirc;&macr;server, associated with
the external component <br>
on hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xmpp_server_ip <br>
The IP address to connect to the XMPP server on. The
connection to the XMPP server is unencrypted, so the biboumi
instance and the server should normally be on the same host.
<br>
The default value is 127.0.0.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port <br>
The TCP port to use to connect to the local XMPP component.
The default value is 5347.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">admin <br>
The bare JID of the gateway administrator. This JID will
have more privileges than other standard users (the admin
thus needs to check their privileges), for example some
admin&acirc; <br>
istration ad-hoc commands will only be available to that
JID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fixed_irc_server <br>
If this option contains the hostname of an IRC server (for
example irc.example.org), then biboumi will enforce the
connexion to that IRC server only. This means that a JID
like <br>
&lt;%22#chan@biboumi.example.com&gt;&quot; must be used
instead of
&lt;%22#chan%irc.example.org@biboumi.example.com%22&gt;. In
that mode, the virtual channel (see Connect to an IRC
server_) is <br>
not available. The &rsquo;%&rsquo; character loses any
meaning in the JIDs. It can appear in the JID but will not
be interpreted as a separator (thus the JID
&lt;%22#channel%hello@biboumi.ex&acirc; <br>
ample.com&gt;&quot; points to the channel named
&quot;#channel%hello&quot; on the configured IRC server)
This option can for example be used by an administrator that
just wants to let their users <br>
join their own IRC server using an XMPP client, while
forbidding access to any other IRC server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">realname_customization <br>
If this option is set to &acirc;false&acirc; (default is
&acirc;true&acirc;), the users will not be able to use the
ad-hoc commands that lets them configure their realname and
username.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">realname_from_jid <br>
If this option is set to &acirc;true&acirc;, the realname
and username of each biboumi user will be extracted from
their JID. The realname is their bare JID, and the username
is the <br>
node-part of their JID. Note that if realname_customization
is &acirc;true&acirc;, each user will still be able to
customize their realname and username, this option just
decides the de&acirc; <br>
fault realname and username.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is set to
&acirc;false&acirc; (the default value), the realname and
username of each user will be set to the nick they used to
connect to the IRC server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">webirc_password <br>
Configure a password to be communicated to the IRC server,
as part of the WEBIRC message (see
&lt;https://kiwiirc.com/docs/webirc&gt;). If this option is
set, an additional DNS reso&acirc; <br>
lution of the hostname of each XMPP server will be made when
connecting to an IRC server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_file <br>
A filename into which logs are written. If none is provided,
the logs are written on standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_level <br>
Indicate what type of log messages to write in the logs.
Value can be from 0 to 3. 0 is debug, 1 is info, 2 is
warning, 3 is error. The default is 0, but a more practical
val&acirc; <br>
ue for production use is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ca_file <br>
Specifies which file should be used as the list of trusted
CA when negociating a TLS session. By default this value is
unset and biboumi tries a list of well-known paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">outgoing_bind <br>
An address (IPv4 or IPv6) to bind the outgoing sockets to.
If no value is specified, it will use the one assigned by
the operating system. You can for example use outgo&acirc;
<br>
ing_bind=192.168.1.11 to force biboumi to use the interface
with this address. Note that this is only used for
connections to IRC servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usage <br>
Biboumi acts as a server, it should be run as a daemon that
lives in the background for as long as it is needed. Note
that biboumi does not daemonize itself, this task should be
<br>
done by your init system (SysVinit, systemd, upstart).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When started, biboumi connects,
without encryption (see Security_), to the local XMPP server
on the port 5347 and authenticates with the provided
password. Biboumi then serves <br>
the configured hostname: this means that all XMPP stanza
with a to JID&acirc;&macr;on that domain will be forwarded
to biboumi by the XMPP server, and biboumi will only send
messages coming <br>
from that hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a user joins an IRC channel
on an IRC&acirc;&macr;server (see Join an IRC channel_),
biboumi connects to the remote IRC server, sets the
user&rsquo;s nick as requested, and then tries to join <br>
the specified channel. If the same user subsequently tries
to connect to an other channel on the same server, the same
IRC connection is used. If, however, an other user wants
<br>
to join an IRC channel on that same IRC server, biboumi
opens a new connection to that server. Biboumi connects once
to each IRC server, for each user on it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, if one user is
using more than one clients (with the same bare JID), they
can join the same IRC channel (on the same server) behind
one single nickname. Biboumi <br>
will forward all the messages (the channel ones and the
private ones) and the presences to all the resources behind
that nick. There is no need to have multiple nicknames and
<br>
multiple connections to be able to take part in a
conversation (or idle) in a channel from a mobile client
while the desktop client is still connected, for
example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To cleanly shutdown the
component, send a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal to it. It will
send messages to all connected IRC and XMPP servers to
indicate a reason why the users are be&acirc; <br>
ing disconnected. Biboumi exits when the end of
communication is acknowledged by all IRC servers. If one or
more IRC servers do not respond, biboumi will only exit if
it re&acirc; <br>
ceives the same signal again or if a 2 seconds delay has
passed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Addressing <br>
IRC entities are represented by XMPP JIDs. The domain part
of the JID is the domain served by biboumi (the part after
the @, biboumi.example.com in the examples), and the local
<br>
part (the part before the @) depends on the concerned
entity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IRC channels and IRC users have
a local part formed like this: name % irc_server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name can be a channel name or an
user nickname. The distinction between the two is based on
the first character: by default, if the name starts with
&rsquo;#&rsquo; or &rsquo;&amp;&rsquo; (but this can be <br>
overridden by the server, using the ISUPPORT extension) then
it&rsquo;s a channel name, otherwise this is a nickname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special case, the channel
name can also be empty (for example %irc.example.com), in
that case this represents the virtual channel provided by
biboumi. See Connect to an IRC <br>
server for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is two ways to address an
IRC user, using a local part like this: nickname %
irc_server or by using the in-room address of the
participant, like this: channel_name % <br>
irc_server @ biboumi.example.com / Nickname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second JID is available only
to be compatible with XMPP clients when the user wants to
send a private message to the participant Nickname in the
room channel_name%irc_serv&acirc; <br>
er@biboumi.example.com.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On XMPP, the node part of the
JID can only be lowercase. On the other hand, IRC nicknames
are case-insensitive, this means that the nicknames toto,
Toto, tOtO and TOTO all rep&acirc; <br>
resent the same IRC user. This means you can talk to the
user toto, and this will work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also note that some IRC
nicknames or channels may contain characters that are not
allowed in the local part of a JID (for example
&lt;&rsquo;@&rsquo;&gt;). If you need to send a message to a
nick <br>
containing such a character, you can use a jid like
%irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com/AnnoyingNickn@me,
because the JID
AnnoyingNickn@me%irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com <br>
would not work. And if you need to address a channel that
contains such invalid characters, you have to use
jid-escaping
(http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0106.html#escaping),
<br>
and replace each of these characters with their escaped
version, for example to join the channel #b@byfoot, you need
to use the following JID:
#b40byfoot%irc.example.com@bibou&acirc; <br>
mi.example.com.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
#foo%irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com is the #foo IRC
channel, on the irc.example.com IRC server, and this is
served by the biboumi instance on biboumi.example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
toto%irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com is the IRC user
named toto, or TotO, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com is the IRC server
irc.example.com.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
%irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com is the virtual channel
provided by biboumi, for the IRC server irc.example.com.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Some JIDs are valid but
make no sense in the context of biboumi:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
#test%@biboumi.example.com, or any other JID that does not
contain an IRC server is invalid. Any message to that kind
of JID will trigger an error, or will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If compiled with Libidn, an IRC
channel participant has a bare JID representing the
&acirc;hostname&acirc; provided by the IRC server. This JID
can only be used to set IRC modes (for exam&acirc; <br>
ple to ban a user based on its IP), or to identify user. It
cannot be used to contact that user using biboumi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Join an IRC channel <br>
To join an IRC channel #foo on the IRC server
irc.example.com, join the XMPP MUC
#foo%irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Connect to an IRC server <br>
The connection to the IRC server is automatically made when
the user tries to join any channel on that IRC server. The
connection is closed whenever the last channel on that <br>
server is left by the user. To be able to stay connected to
an IRC server without having to be in a real IRC channel,
biboumi provides a virtual channel on the jid
%irc.exam&acirc; <br>
ple.com@biboumi.example.com. For example if you want to join
the channel #foo on the server irc.example.com, but you need
to authenticate to a bot of the server before you&rsquo;re
<br>
allowed to join it, you can first join the room
%irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com (this will effectively
connect you to the IRC server without joining any room),
then send <br>
your authentication message to the user
bot%irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com and finally join the
room #foo%irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Channel messages <br>
On XMPP, unlike on IRC, the displayed order of the messages
is the same for all participants of a MUC. Biboumi can not
however provide this feature, as it cannot know whether <br>
the IRC server has received and forwarded the messages to
other users. This means that the order of the messages
displayed in your XMPP client may not be the same than the
order <br>
on other IRC users&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">History <br>
Public channel messages are saved into archives, inside the
database, unless the record_history option is set to false
for that user Ad-hoc commands. Private messages (messages
<br>
that are sent directly to a nickname, not a channel) are
never stored in the database. When a channel is joined,
biboumi sends the max_history_length messages found in the
data&acirc; <br>
base as the MUC history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A channel history can be
retrieved by using Message archive management (MAM)
(https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.htm) on the channel
JID. The results can be filtered by start <br>
and end dates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a given channel, each user
has her or his own archive. The content of the archives are
never shared, and thus a user can not use someone
else&rsquo;s archive to get the messages <br>
that they didn&rsquo;t receive when they were offline.
Although this feature would be very convenient, this would
introduce a very important privacy issue: for example if a
biboumi <br>
gateway is used by two users, by querying the archive one
user would be able to know whether or not the other user was
in a room at a given time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List channels <br>
You can list the IRC channels on a given IRC server by
sending an XMPP disco items request on the IRC server JID.
The number of channels on some servers is huge, and biboumi
<br>
does not (yet) support result set management (XEP 0059) so
the result stanza may be very big.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nicknames <br>
On IRC, nicknames are server-wide. This means that one user
only has one single nickname at one given time on all the
channels of a server. This is different from XMPP where a
<br>
user can have a different nick on each MUC, even if these
MUCs are on the same server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that the nick you
choose when joining your first IRC channel on a given IRC
server will be your nickname in all other channels that you
join on that same IRC server. <br>
If you explicitely change your nickname on one channel, your
nickname will be changed on all channels on the same server
as well. Joining a new channel with a different nick, <br>
however, will not change your nick. The provided nick will
be ignored, in order to avoid changing your nick on the
whole server by mistake. If you want to have a different
<br>
nickname in the channel you&rsquo;re going to join, you need
to do it explicitly with the NICK command before joining the
channel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Private messages <br>
Private messages are handled differently on IRC and on XMPP.
On IRC, you talk directly to one server-user: toto on the
channel #foo is the same user as toto on the channel #bar
<br>
(as long as these two channels are on the same IRC server).
By default you will receive private messages from the
&acirc;global&acirc; user (aka
&lt;nickname%irc.example.com@biboumi.exam&acirc; <br>
ple.com&gt;), unless you previously sent a message to an
in-room participant (something like
#&lt;test%irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com/nickname&gt;),
in which case future messages <br>
from that same user will be received from that same
&acirc;in-room&acirc; JID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notices <br>
Notices are received exactly like private messages. It is
not possible to send a notice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invitations <br>
Biboumi forwards the mediated invitations to the target
nick. If the user wishes to invite the user
&acirc;FooBar&acirc; into a room, they can invite one of the
following &acirc;JIDs&acirc; (one of <br>
them is not a JID, actually):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&lt;foobar%anything@anything&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&lt;anything@anything/FooBar&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; FooBar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the
&acirc;anything&acirc; part are simply ignored because they
have no meaning for the IRC server: we already know which
IRC server is targeted using the JID of the target
chan&acirc; <br>
nel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kicks and bans <br>
Kicks are transparently translated from one protocol to
another. However banning an XMPP participant has no effect.
To ban an user you need to set a mode +b on that user nick
<br>
or host (see IRC modes_) and then kick it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encoding <br>
On XMPP, the encoding is always UTF-8, whereas on IRC the
encoding of each message can be anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that biboumi has to
convert everything coming from IRC into UTF-8 without
knowing the encoding of the received messages. To do so, it
checks if each message is UTF-8 <br>
valid, if not it tries to convert from iso_8859-1 (because
this appears to be the most common case, at least on the
channels I visit) to UTF-8. If that conversion fails at some
<br>
point, a placeholder character
&rsquo;&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;&rsquo; is inserted to indicate
this decoding error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Messages are always sent in
UTF-8 over IRC, no conversion is done in that direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IRC modes <br>
One feature that doesn&rsquo;t exist on XMPP but does on IRC
is the modes. Although some of these modes have a
correspondance in the XMPP world (for example the +o mode on
a user cor&acirc; <br>
responds to the moderator role in XMPP), it is impossible to
map all these modes to an XMPP feature. To circumvent this
problem, biboumi provides a raw notification when modes <br>
are changed, and lets the user change the modes
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To change modes, simply send a
message starting with &acirc;/mode&acirc; followed by the
modes and the arguments you want to send to the IRC server.
For example &acirc;/mode +aho louiz&acirc;. Note <br>
that your XMPP client may interprete messages begining with
&acirc;/&acirc; like a command. To actually send a message
starting with a slash, you may need to start your message
with <br>
&acirc;//mode&acirc; or &acirc;/say /mode&acirc;, depending
on your client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a mode is changed, the user
is notified by a message coming from the MUC bare JID,
looking like &acirc;Mode #foo [+ov] [toto tutu]&acirc;. In
addition, if the mode change can be trans&acirc; <br>
lated to an XMPP feature, the user will be notified of this
XMPP event as well. For example if a mode &acirc;+o
toto&acirc; is received, then toto&rsquo;s role will be
changed to moderator. The <br>
mapping between IRC modes and XMPP features is as
follow:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+q Sets the participant&rsquo;s
role to moderator and its affiliation to owner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+a Sets the participant&rsquo;s
role to moderator and its affiliation to owner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+o Sets the participant&rsquo;s
role to moderator and its affiliation to admin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+h Sets the participant&rsquo;s
role to moderator and its affiliation to member.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+v Sets the participant&rsquo;s
role to participant and its affiliation to member.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, when a biboumi user
changes some participant&rsquo;s affiliation or role,
biboumi translates that in an IRC mode change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Affiliation set to none <br>
Sets mode to -vhoaq</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Affiliation set to member <br>
Sets mode to +v-hoaq</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Role set to moderator <br>
Sets mode to +h-oaq</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Affiliation set to admin <br>
Sets mode to +o-aq</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Affiliation set to owner <br>
Sets mode to +a-q</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ad-hoc commands <br>
Biboumi supports a few ad-hoc commands, as described in the
XEP 0050. Different ad-hoc commands are available for each
JID type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the gateway itself (e.g on
the JID biboumi.example.com): <br>
&Acirc;&middot; ping: Just respond &acirc;pong&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; hello: Provide a
form, where the user enters their name, and biboumi responds
with a nice greeting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; disconnect-user:
Only available to the administrator. The user provides a
list of JIDs, and a quit message. All the selected users are
disconnected from all the IRC servers <br>
to which they were connected, using the provided quit
message. Sending SIGINT to biboumi is equivalent to using
this command by selecting all the connected JIDs and using
the <br>
&acirc;Gateway shutdown&acirc; quit message, except that
biboumi does not exit when using this ad-hoc command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
disconnect-from-irc-servers: Disconnect a single user from
one or more IRC server. The user is immediately disconnected
by closing the socket, no message is sent to the IRC <br>
server, but the user is of course notified with an XMPP
message. The administrator can disconnect any user, while
the other users can only disconnect themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On a server JID (e.g on the JID
<br>
&lt;chat.freenode.org@biboumi.example.com&gt;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; configure: Lets
each user configure some options that applies to the
concerned IRC server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
get-irc-connection-info: Returns some information about the
IRC server, for the executing user. It lets the user know if
they are connected to this server, from what port, <br>
with or without TLS, and it gives the list of joined IRC
channel, with a detailed list of which resource is in which
channel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On a channel JID (e.g on the JID
<br>
&lt;#test%chat.freenode.org@biboumi.example.com&gt;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; configure: Lets
each user configure some options that applies to the
concerned IRC channel. Some of these options, if not
configured for a specific channel, defaults to the <br>
value configured at the IRC server level. For example the
encoding can be specified for both the channel and the
server. If an encoding is not specified for a channel, the
<br>
encoding configured in the server applies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Raw IRC messages <br>
Biboumi tries to support as many IRC features as possible,
but doesn&rsquo;t handle everything yet (or ever). In order
to let the user send any arbitrary IRC message, biboumi
forwards <br>
any XMPP message received on an IRC Server JID (see
ADDRESSING) as a raw command to that IRC server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to WHOIS the user
Foo on the server irc.example.com, a user can send the
message &acirc;WHOIS Foo&acirc; to
&acirc;&lt;irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com&gt;&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The message will be forwarded as
is, without any modification appart from adding
&quot;rn&quot; at the end (to make it a valid IRC message).
You need to have a little bit of understanding <br>
of the IRC protocol to use this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
The connection to the XMPP server can only be made on
localhost. The XMPP&acirc;&macr;server is not supposed to
accept non-local connections from components. Thus,
encryption is not used <br>
to connect to the local XMPP&acirc;&macr;server because it
is useless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If compiled with the Botan
library, biboumi can use TLS when communicating with the IRC
servers. It will first try ports 6697 and 6670 and use TLS
if it succeeds, if connection <br>
fails on both these ports, the connection is established on
port 6667 without any encryption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Biboumi does not check if the
received JIDs are properly formatted using nodeprep. This
must be done by the XMPP server to which biboumi is directly
connected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note if you use a biboumi that
you have no control on: remember that the administrator of
the gateway you use is able to view all your IRC
conversations, whether you&rsquo;re using en&acirc; <br>
cryption or not. This is exactly as if you were running your
IRC client on someone else&rsquo;s server. Only use biboumi
if you trust its administrator (or, better, if you are the
<br>
administrator) or if you don&rsquo;t intend to have any
private conversation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Biboumi does not provide a way
to ban users from connecting to it, has no protection
against flood or any sort of abuse that your users may cause
on the IRC servers. Some XMPP <br>
server however offer the possibility to restrict what JID
can access a gateway. Use that feature if you wish to grant
access to your biboumi instance only to a list of trusted
<br>
users.</p>
