biboumi - XMPP gateway to IRC
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Description"><a class="selflink" href="#Description">Description</a></h1>
Biboumi is an XMPP gateway that connects to IRC servers and translates between
  the two protocols. It can be used to access IRC channels using any XMPP client
  as if these channels were XMPP MUCs.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Synopsis"><a class="selflink" href="#Synopsis">Synopsis</a></h1>
biboumi [ <i>config_filename</i>]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Options"><a class="selflink" href="#Options">Options</a></h1>
Available command line options:
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="config_filename"><a class="selflink" href="#config_filename">config_filename</a></h2>
Specify the file to read for configuration. See <i>CONFIG</i> section for more
  details on its content.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Configuration"><a class="selflink" href="#Configuration">Configuration</a></h1>
The configuration file uses a simple format of the form option=value. Here is a
  description of each possible option:
<div class="Pp"></div>
The configuration can be re-read at runtime (you can for example change the log
  level without having to restart biboumi) by sending SIGUSR1 or SIGUSR2 (see
  kill(1)) to the process.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="hostname"><a class="selflink" href="#hostname">hostname</a></h2>
Mandatory. The hostname served by the XMPP&#x202F;gateway. This domain must be
  configured in the XMPP server as an external component. See the manual for
  your XMPP server for more information. For prosody, see
  &lt;http://prosody.im/doc/components#adding_an_external_component&gt;
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="password"><a class="selflink" href="#password">password</a></h2>
Mandatory. The password used to authenticate the XMPP component to your XMPP
  server. This password must be configured in the XMPP&#x202F;server, associated
  with the external component on <i>hostname</i>.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="xmpp_server_ip"><a class="selflink" href="#xmpp_server_ip">xmpp_server_ip</a></h2>
The IP address to connect to the XMPP server on. The connection to the XMPP
  server is unencrypted, so the biboumi instance and the server should normally
  be on the same host. The default value is 127.0.0.1.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="port"><a class="selflink" href="#port">port</a></h2>
The TCP port to use to connect to the local XMPP component. The default value is
  5347.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="admin"><a class="selflink" href="#admin">admin</a></h2>
The bare JID of the gateway administrator. This JID will have more privileges
  than other standard users (the admin thus needs to check their privileges),
  for example some administration ad-hoc commands will only be available to that
  JID.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="fixed_irc_server"><a class="selflink" href="#fixed_irc_server">fixed_irc_server</a></h2>
If this option contains the hostname of an IRC server (for example
  irc.example.org), then biboumi will enforce the connexion to that IRC server
  only. This means that a JID like &lt;%22#chan@biboumi.example.com&gt;&quot;
  must be used instead of
  &lt;%22#chan%irc.example.org@biboumi.example.com%22&gt;. In that mode, the
  virtual channel (see Connect to an IRC server_) is not available. The '%'
  character loses any meaning in the JIDs. It can appear in the JID but will not
  be interpreted as a separator (thus the JID
  &lt;%22#channel%hello@biboumi.example.com&gt;&quot; points to the channel
  named &quot;#channel%hello&quot; on the configured IRC server) This option can
  for example be used by an administrator that just wants to let their users
  join their own IRC server using an XMPP client, while forbidding access to any
  other IRC server.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="realname_customization"><a class="selflink" href="#realname_customization">realname_customization</a></h2>
If this option is set to &#x201C;false&#x201D; (default is
  &#x201C;true&#x201D;), the users will not be able to use the ad-hoc commands
  that lets them configure their realname and username.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="realname_from_jid"><a class="selflink" href="#realname_from_jid">realname_from_jid</a></h2>
If this option is set to &#x201C;true&#x201D;, the realname and username of each
  biboumi user will be extracted from their JID. The realname is their bare JID,
  and the username is the node-part of their JID. Note that if
  realname_customization is &#x201C;true&#x201D;, each user will still be able
  to customize their realname and username, this option just decides the default
  realname and username.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If this option is set to &#x201C;false&#x201D; (the default value), the realname
  and username of each user will be set to the nick they used to connect to the
  IRC server.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="webirc_password"><a class="selflink" href="#webirc_password">webirc_password</a></h2>
Configure a password to be communicated to the IRC server, as part of the WEBIRC
  message (see &lt;https://kiwiirc.com/docs/webirc&gt;). If this option is set,
  an additional DNS resolution of the hostname of each XMPP server will be made
  when connecting to an IRC server.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="log_file"><a class="selflink" href="#log_file">log_file</a></h2>
A filename into which logs are written. If none is provided, the logs are
  written on standard output.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="log_level"><a class="selflink" href="#log_level">log_level</a></h2>
Indicate what type of log messages to write in the logs. Value can be from 0 to
  3. 0 is debug, 1 is info, 2 is warning, 3 is error. The default is 0, but a
  more practical value for production use is 1.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="ca_file"><a class="selflink" href="#ca_file">ca_file</a></h2>
Specifies which file should be used as the list of trusted CA when negociating a
  TLS session. By default this value is unset and biboumi tries a list of
  well-known paths.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="outgoing_bind"><a class="selflink" href="#outgoing_bind">outgoing_bind</a></h2>
An address (IPv4 or IPv6) to bind the outgoing sockets to. If no value is
  specified, it will use the one assigned by the operating system. You can for
  example use outgoing_bind=192.168.1.11 to force biboumi to use the interface
  with this address. Note that this is only used for connections to IRC servers.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Usage"><a class="selflink" href="#Usage">Usage</a></h1>
Biboumi acts as a server, it should be run as a daemon that lives in the
  background for as long as it is needed. Note that biboumi does not daemonize
  itself, this task should be done by your init system (SysVinit, systemd,
  upstart).
<div class="Pp"></div>
When started, biboumi connects, without encryption (see Security_), to the local
  XMPP server on the port 5347 and authenticates with the provided password.
  Biboumi then serves the configured hostname: this means that all XMPP stanza
  with a to JID&#x202F;on that domain will be forwarded to biboumi by the XMPP
  server, and biboumi will only send messages coming from that hostname.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a user joins an IRC channel on an IRC&#x202F;server (see Join an IRC
  channel_), biboumi connects to the remote IRC server, sets the user's nick as
  requested, and then tries to join the specified channel. If the same user
  subsequently tries to connect to an other channel on the same server, the same
  IRC connection is used. If, however, an other user wants to join an IRC
  channel on that same IRC server, biboumi opens a new connection to that
  server. Biboumi connects once to each IRC server, for each user on it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Additionally, if one user is using more than one clients (with the same bare
  JID), they can join the same IRC channel (on the same server) behind one
  single nickname. Biboumi will forward all the messages (the channel ones and
  the private ones) and the presences to all the resources behind that nick.
  There is no need to have multiple nicknames and multiple connections to be
  able to take part in a conversation (or idle) in a channel from a mobile
  client while the desktop client is still connected, for example.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To cleanly shutdown the component, send a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal to it. It
  will send messages to all connected IRC and XMPP servers to indicate a reason
  why the users are being disconnected. Biboumi exits when the end of
  communication is acknowledged by all IRC servers. If one or more IRC servers
  do not respond, biboumi will only exit if it receives the same signal again or
  if a 2 seconds delay has passed.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Addressing"><a class="selflink" href="#Addressing">Addressing</a></h2>
IRC entities are represented by XMPP JIDs. The domain part of the JID is the
  domain served by biboumi (the part after the @, biboumi.example.com in the
  examples), and the local part (the part before the @) depends on the concerned
  entity.
<div class="Pp"></div>
IRC channels and IRC users have a local part formed like this: name %
  irc_server.
<div class="Pp"></div>
name can be a channel name or an user nickname. The distinction between the two
  is based on the first character: by default, if the name starts with '#' or
  '&amp;' (but this can be overridden by the server, using the ISUPPORT
  extension) then it's a channel name, otherwise this is a nickname.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a special case, the channel name can also be empty (for example
  %irc.example.com), in that case this represents the virtual channel provided
  by biboumi. See <i>Connect to an IRC server</i> for more details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is two ways to address an IRC user, using a local part like this: nickname
  % irc_server or by using the in-room address of the participant, like this:
  channel_name % irc_server @ biboumi.example.com / Nickname
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second JID is available only to be compatible with XMPP clients when the
  user wants to send a private message to the participant Nickname in the room
  channel_name%irc_server@biboumi.example.com.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On XMPP, the node part of the JID can only be lowercase. On the other hand, IRC
  nicknames are case-insensitive, this means that the nicknames toto, Toto, tOtO
  and TOTO all represent the same IRC user. This means you can talk to the user
  toto, and this will work.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Also note that some IRC nicknames or channels may contain characters that are
  not allowed in the local part of a JID (for example &lt;'@'&gt;). If you need
  to send a message to a nick containing such a character, you can use a jid
  like %irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com/AnnoyingNickn@me, because the JID
  AnnoyingNickn@me%irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com would not work. And if
  you need to address a channel that contains such invalid characters, you have
  to use jid-escaping (http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0106.html#escaping),
  and replace each of these characters with their escaped version, for example
  to join the channel #b@byfoot, you need to use the following JID:
  #b\40byfoot%irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Examples:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">#foo%irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com is the #foo IRC
      channel, on the irc.example.com IRC server, and this is served by the
      biboumi instance on biboumi.example.com</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">toto%irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com is the IRC user
      named toto, or TotO, etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com is the IRC server
      irc.example.com.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">%irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com is the virtual channel
      provided by biboumi, for the IRC server irc.example.com.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note: Some JIDs are valid but make no sense in the context of biboumi:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">#test%@biboumi.example.com, or any other JID that does not
      contain an IRC server is invalid. Any message to that kind of JID will
      trigger an error, or will be ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If compiled with Libidn, an IRC channel participant has a bare JID representing
  the &#x201C;hostname&#x201D; provided by the IRC server. This JID can only be
  used to set IRC modes (for example to ban a user based on its IP), or to
  identify user. It cannot be used to contact that user using biboumi.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Join_an_IRC_channel"><a class="selflink" href="#Join_an_IRC_channel">Join
  an IRC channel</a></h2>
To join an IRC channel #foo on the IRC server irc.example.com, join the XMPP MUC
  #foo%irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Connect_to_an_IRC_server"><a class="selflink" href="#Connect_to_an_IRC_server">Connect
  to an IRC server</a></h2>
The connection to the IRC server is automatically made when the user tries to
  join any channel on that IRC server. The connection is closed whenever the
  last channel on that server is left by the user. To be able to stay connected
  to an IRC server without having to be in a real IRC channel, biboumi provides
  a virtual channel on the jid %irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com. For example
  if you want to join the channel #foo on the server irc.example.com, but you
  need to authenticate to a bot of the server before you're allowed to join it,
  you can first join the room %irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com (this will
  effectively connect you to the IRC server without joining any room), then send
  your authentication message to the user
  bot%irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com and finally join the room
  #foo%irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Channel_messages"><a class="selflink" href="#Channel_messages">Channel
  messages</a></h2>
On XMPP, unlike on IRC, the displayed order of the messages is the same for all
  participants of a MUC. Biboumi can not however provide this feature, as it
  cannot know whether the IRC server has received and forwarded the messages to
  other users. This means that the order of the messages displayed in your XMPP
  client may not be the same than the order on other IRC users'.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="History"><a class="selflink" href="#History">History</a></h2>
Public channel messages are saved into archives, inside the database, unless the
  record_history option is set to false for that user Ad-hoc commands. Private
  messages (messages that are sent directly to a nickname, not a channel) are
  never stored in the database. When a channel is joined, biboumi sends the
  max_history_length messages found in the database as the MUC history.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A channel history can be retrieved by using Message archive management (MAM)
  (https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.htm) on the channel JID. The results can
  be filtered by start and end dates.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For a given channel, each user has her or his own archive. The content of the
  archives are never shared, and thus a user can not use someone else's archive
  to get the messages that they didn't receive when they were offline. Although
  this feature would be very convenient, this would introduce a very important
  privacy issue: for example if a biboumi gateway is used by two users, by
  querying the archive one user would be able to know whether or not the other
  user was in a room at a given time.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="List_channels"><a class="selflink" href="#List_channels">List
  channels</a></h2>
You can list the IRC channels on a given IRC server by sending an XMPP disco
  items request on the IRC server JID. The number of channels on some servers is
  huge, and biboumi does not (yet) support result set management (XEP 0059) so
  the result stanza may be very big.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Nicknames"><a class="selflink" href="#Nicknames">Nicknames</a></h2>
On IRC, nicknames are server-wide. This means that one user only has one single
  nickname at one given time on all the channels of a server. This is different
  from XMPP where a user can have a different nick on each MUC, even if these
  MUCs are on the same server.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This means that the nick you choose when joining your first IRC channel on a
  given IRC server will be your nickname in all other channels that you join on
  that same IRC server. If you explicitely change your nickname on one channel,
  your nickname will be changed on all channels on the same server as well.
  Joining a new channel with a different nick, however, will not change your
  nick. The provided nick will be ignored, in order to avoid changing your nick
  on the whole server by mistake. If you want to have a different nickname in
  the channel you're going to join, you need to do it explicitly with the NICK
  command before joining the channel.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Private_messages"><a class="selflink" href="#Private_messages">Private
  messages</a></h2>
Private messages are handled differently on IRC and on XMPP. On IRC, you talk
  directly to one server-user: toto on the channel #foo is the same user as toto
  on the channel #bar (as long as these two channels are on the same IRC
  server). By default you will receive private messages from the
  &#x201C;global&#x201D; user (aka
  &lt;nickname%irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com&gt;), unless you previously
  sent a message to an in-room participant (something like
  #&lt;test%irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com/nickname&gt;), in which case
  future messages from that same user will be received from that same
  &#x201C;in-room&#x201D; JID.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Notices"><a class="selflink" href="#Notices">Notices</a></h2>
Notices are received exactly like private messages. It is not possible to send a
  notice.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Invitations"><a class="selflink" href="#Invitations">Invitations</a></h2>
Biboumi forwards the mediated invitations to the target nick. If the user wishes
  to invite the user &#x201C;FooBar&#x201D; into a room, they can invite one of
  the following &#x201C;JIDs&#x201D; (one of them is not a JID, actually):
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&lt;foobar%anything@anything&gt;</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&lt;anything@anything/FooBar&gt;</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">FooBar</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the &#x201C;anything&#x201D; part are simply ignored because they have
  no meaning for the IRC server: we already know which IRC server is targeted
  using the JID of the target channel.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Kicks_and_bans"><a class="selflink" href="#Kicks_and_bans">Kicks
  and bans</a></h2>
Kicks are transparently translated from one protocol to another. However banning
  an XMPP participant has no effect. To ban an user you need to set a mode +b on
  that user nick or host (see IRC modes_) and then kick it.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Encoding"><a class="selflink" href="#Encoding">Encoding</a></h2>
On XMPP, the encoding is always UTF-8, whereas on IRC the encoding of each
  message can be anything.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This means that biboumi has to convert everything coming from IRC into UTF-8
  without knowing the encoding of the received messages. To do so, it checks if
  each message is UTF-8 valid, if not it tries to convert from iso_8859-1
  (because this appears to be the most common case, at least on the channels I
  visit) to UTF-8. If that conversion fails at some point, a placeholder
  character '&#xFFFD;' is inserted to indicate this decoding error.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Messages are always sent in UTF-8 over IRC, no conversion is done in that
  direction.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="IRC_modes"><a class="selflink" href="#IRC_modes">IRC
  modes</a></h2>
One feature that doesn't exist on XMPP but does on IRC is the modes. Although
  some of these modes have a correspondance in the XMPP world (for example the
  +o mode on a user corresponds to the moderator role in XMPP), it is impossible
  to map all these modes to an XMPP feature. To circumvent this problem, biboumi
  provides a raw notification when modes are changed, and lets the user change
  the modes directly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To change modes, simply send a message starting with &#x201C;/mode&#x201D;
  followed by the modes and the arguments you want to send to the IRC server.
  For example &#x201C;/mode +aho louiz&#x201D;. Note that your XMPP client may
  interprete messages begining with &#x201C;/&#x201D; like a command. To
  actually send a message starting with a slash, you may need to start your
  message with &#x201C;//mode&#x201D; or &#x201C;/say /mode&#x201D;, depending
  on your client.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a mode is changed, the user is notified by a message coming from the MUC
  bare JID, looking like &#x201C;Mode #foo [+ov] [toto tutu]&#x201D;. In
  addition, if the mode change can be translated to an XMPP feature, the user
  will be notified of this XMPP event as well. For example if a mode &#x201C;+o
  toto&#x201D; is received, then toto's role will be changed to moderator. The
  mapping between IRC modes and XMPP features is as follow:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>+q</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Sets the participant's role to moderator and its
      affiliation to owner.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>+a</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Sets the participant's role to moderator and its
      affiliation to owner.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>+o</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Sets the participant's role to moderator and its
      affiliation to admin.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>+h</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Sets the participant's role to moderator and its
      affiliation to member.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>+v</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Sets the participant's role to participant and its
      affiliation to member.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Similarly, when a biboumi user changes some participant's affiliation or role,
  biboumi translates that in an IRC mode change.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Affiliation set to none</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Sets mode to -vhoaq</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"></div>

Biboumi tries to support as many IRC features as possible, but doesn't handle
  everything yet (or ever). In order to let the user send any arbitrary IRC
  message, biboumi forwards any XMPP message received on an IRC Server JID (see
  <i>ADDRESSING</i>) as a raw command to that IRC server.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, to WHOIS the user Foo on the server irc.example.com, a user can
  send the message &#x201C;WHOIS Foo&#x201D; to
  &#x201C;&lt;irc.example.com@biboumi.example.com&gt;&#x201D;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The message will be forwarded as is, without any modification appart from adding
  &quot;rn&quot; at the end (to make it a valid IRC message). You need to have a
  little bit of understanding of the IRC protocol to use this feature.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Security"><a class="selflink" href="#Security">Security</a></h1>
The connection to the XMPP server can only be made on localhost. The
  XMPP&#x202F;server is not supposed to accept non-local connections from
  components. Thus, encryption is not used to connect to the local
  XMPP&#x202F;server because it is useless.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If compiled with the Botan library, biboumi can use TLS when communicating with
  the IRC servers. It will first try ports 6697 and 6670 and use TLS if it
  succeeds, if connection fails on both these ports, the connection is
  established on port 6667 without any encryption.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Biboumi does not check if the received JIDs are properly formatted using
  nodeprep. This must be done by the XMPP server to which biboumi is directly
  connected.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note if you use a biboumi that you have no control on: remember that the
  administrator of the gateway you use is able to view all your IRC
  conversations, whether you're using encryption or not. This is exactly as if
  you were running your IRC client on someone else's server. Only use biboumi if
  you trust its administrator (or, better, if you are the administrator) or if
  you don't intend to have any private conversation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Biboumi does not provide a way to ban users from connecting to it, has no
  protection against flood or any sort of abuse that your users may cause on the
  IRC servers. Some XMPP server however offer the possibility to restrict what
  JID can access a gateway. Use that feature if you wish to grant access to your
  biboumi instance only to a list of trusted users.</div>
