<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
h5topng - generate PNG images from 2d slices of HDF5
files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
h5topng [OPTION]... [HDF5FILE]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
h5topng is a utility to generate images in PNG (Portable
Network Graphics) format from two-dimensional slices of
datasets in HDF5 files. It is designed for quick-and-dirty
visu&acirc; <br>
alization of scientific data, and for batch processing
thereof via shell scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HDF5 is a free, portable binary
format and supporting library developed by the National
Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of
Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. <br>
A single h5 file can contain multiple data sets; by default,
h5topng takes the first dataset, but this can be changed via
the -d option, or by using the syntax HDF5FILE:DATASET.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a three- or four-dimensional
dataset you must specify coordinates in one or two slice
dimensions, respectively, to get a two-dimensional slice,
via the -xyzt options. Yet <br>
more options control things like the colormap and
magnification. Still, the most basic usage is something like
&Acirc;&acute;h5topng foo.h5&Acirc;&acute;, which will
output a file foo.png containing an <br>
image from the two-dimensional data in foo.h5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Display help on the command-line options and usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print the version number and
copyright info for h5topng.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose output. This output
includes the minimum and maximum values encountered in the
data, which is useful to know for the -mM options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o file <br>
Send PNG output to file rather than to the filename with .h5
replaced with .png (the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x ix, -y iy, -z iz, -t it <br>
This tells h5topng to use a particular slice of a
multi-dimensional dataset. e.g. -x causes a yz plane (of a
3d dataset) to be used, at an x index of ix (where the <br>
indices run from zero to one less than the maximum index in
that direction). Here, x/y/z correspond to the
first/second/third dimensions of the HDF5 dataset. The -t
<br>
option specifies a slice in the last dimension, whichever
that might be. See also the -0 option to shift the origin of
the x/y/z slice coordinates to the dataset center.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of specifying a single
index as an argument to these options, you can also specify
a range of indices in a Matlab-like notation: start:step:end
or start:end (step <br>
defaults to 1). This loops over that slice index, from start
to end in steps of step, producing a sequence of output PNG
files (with the slice index appended to the file&acirc; <br>
name, before the &quot;.png&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-0 Shift the origin of the x/y/z
slice coordinates to the dataset center, so that e.g. -0 -x
0 (or more compactly -0x0) returns the central x plane of
the dataset instead of <br>
the edge x plane. (-t coordinates are not affected.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X scalex, -Y scaley, -S scale
<br>
Scale the x and y dimensions of the image by scalex and
scaley respectively. The -S option scales both x and y. The
default is to use scale factors of 1.0; i.e. the <br>
image has the same dimensions (in pixels) as the data.
Linear interpolation is used to fill in the pixels when the
scale factors are not 1.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s skewangle <br>
Skew the image by skewangle (in degrees) to the left or
right. The result is a parallelogram, with the leftover
space in the (square) image filled with either black or <br>
white pixels, depending upon the color map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Transpose the data
(interchange the image axes). By default, the first (x)
coordinate of the data corresponds to the columns, and the
second (y) coordinate corresponds to <br>
the rows; transposition reverses this convention.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c colormap <br>
Use a color map colormap rather than the default gray color
map (a grayscale ramp from white to black). colormap is
normally the name of one of the color maps provided <br>
with h5topng (in the /usr/share/h5utils/colormaps
directory), or can instead be the name of a color-map
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Three useful included color maps
are hot (black-red-yellow-white, useful for intensity data),
bluered (blue-white-red, useful for signed data), and hsv (a
multi-color <br>
&quot;rainbow&quot;). If you use the bluered color map for
signed data, you may also want to use the -Z option so that
the center of the color scale (white) corresponds to
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A color-map file is a sequence
of whitespace-separated R G B A quadruples, where each value
is in the range 0.0 to 1.0 and indicates the fraction of
red/green/blue/alpha. <br>
(An alpha of 0 is transparent and of 1 is opaque; this is
only used for the -a option, below.) The colors in the color
map are linearly interpolated as necessary to pro&acirc;
<br>
vide a continuous color ramp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Reverse the ordering of the
color map. You can also accomplish this by putting a
&quot;-&quot; before the colormap name in the -c or -a
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z Center the color scale on the
value zero in the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m min, -M max <br>
Normally, the bottom and top of the color map correspond to
the minimum and maximum values in the data. Using these
options, you can make the bottom and top of the color <br>
map correspond to min and max instead. Data values below or
above this range will be treated as if they were min or max
respectively. See also the -Z and -R options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R When multiple files are
specified, set the bottom and top of the color maps
according to the minimum and maximum over all the data. This
is useful to process many files <br>
using a consistent color scale, since otherwise the scale is
set for each file individually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C file, -b val <br>
Superimpose contour outlines from the first dataset in the
file HDF5 file on all of the output images. (If the contour
dataset does not have the same dimensions as the <br>
output data, it is peridically &quot;tiled&quot; over the
output.) You can use the syntax file:dataset to specify a
particular dataset within the file. The contour outlines are
<br>
around a value of val (defaults to middle of value range in
file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A file, -a colormap:opacity
<br>
Translucently overlay the data from the first dataset in the
file HDF5 file, which should have the same dimensions as the
input dataset, on all of the output images, using <br>
the colormap colormap with opacity (from 0 for completely
transparent to 1 for completely opaque) opacity multiplied
by the opacity (alpha) values in the colormap. (If <br>
the overlay dataset does not have the same dimensions as the
output data, it is peridically &quot;tiled&quot; over the
output.) You can use the syntax file:dataset to specify a
<br>
particular dataset within the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some predefined colormaps that
work particularly well for this feature are yellow
(transparent white to opaque yellow) gray (transparent white
to opaque black), yarg <br>
(transparent black to opaque white), green (transparent
white to opaque green), and bluered (opaque blue to
transparent white to opaque red). You can prepend
&quot;-&quot; to the <br>
colormap name to reverse the colormap order. (See also -c,
above.) The default for -a is yellow:0.3 (yellow colormap
multiplied by 30% opacity).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d name <br>
Use dataset name from the input files; otherwise, the first
dataset from each file is used. Alternatively, use the
syntax HDF5FILE:DATASET, which allows you to specify a <br>
different dataset for each file. You can use the h5ls
command (included with hdf5) to find the names of datasets
within a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-8 Use 8-bit (indexed) color for
the PNG output, instead of 24-bit (direct) color (the
default). (This shrinks the image size slightly, with some
degradation in quality.) <br>
Not supported in conjunction with the -A (translucent
overlay) option.</p>
