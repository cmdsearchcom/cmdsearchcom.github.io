<p>DB5.3_UPGRADE(1) General Commands Manual
DB5.3_UPGRADE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
db5.3_upgrade - Upgrade the Berkeley DB version to the
current release version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
db5.3_upgrade [-NsVv] [-h home] [-P password] file ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The db5.3_upgrade utility upgrades the Berkeley DB version
of one or more files and the databases they contain to the
current release version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Specify a home directory for the database environment; by
default, the current working directory is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Do not acquire shared region
mutexes while running. Other problems, such as potentially
fatal errors in Berkeley DB, will be ignored as well. This
option is intended <br>
only for debugging errors, and should not be used under any
other circumstances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Specify an environment
password. Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite password
strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a window
of vulnerability on systems <br>
where unprivileged users can see command-line arguments or
where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
containing the command-line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s This flag is only meaningful
when upgrading databases from releases before the Berkeley
DB 3.1 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As part of the upgrade from the
Berkeley DB 3.0 release to the 3.1 release, the on-disk
format of duplicate data items changed. To correctly upgrade
the format requires <br>
that applications specify whether duplicate data items in
the database are sorted or not. Specifying the -s flag means
that the duplicates are sorted; otherwise, they are <br>
assumed to be unsorted. Incorrectly specifying the value of
this flag may lead to database corruption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because the db5.3_upgrade
utility upgrades a physical file (including all the
databases it contains), it is not possible to use
db5.3_upgrade to upgrade files where some <br>
of the databases it includes have sorted duplicate data
items, and some of the databases it includes have unsorted
duplicate data items. If the file does not have more <br>
than a single database, if the databases do not support
duplicate data items, or if all the databases that support
duplicate data items support the same style of dupli&acirc;
<br>
cates (either sorted or unsorted), db5.3_upgrade will work
correctly as long as the -s flag is correctly specified.
Otherwise, the file cannot be upgraded using <br>
db5.3_upgrade, and must be upgraded manually using the
db5.3_dump and db5.0_load utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Write the library version
number to the standard output, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Run in verbose mode,
displaying a message for each successful upgrade.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important to realize that
Berkeley DB database upgrades are done in place, and so are
potentially destructive. This means that if the system
crashes during the upgrade pro&acirc; <br>
cedure, or if the upgrade procedure runs out of disk space,
the databases may be left in an inconsistent and
unrecoverable state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_upgrade utility may be
used with a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the -h
option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the
utility was run in a direc&acirc; <br>
tory containing a Berkeley DB environment). In order to
avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB
environment, db5.3_upgrade should always be given the chance
to <br>
detach from the environment and exit gracefully. To cause
db5.3_upgrade to release all environment resources and exit
cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_upgrade utility exits
0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DB_HOME <br>
If the -h option is not specified and the environment
variable DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the
database home, as described in DB_ENV-&gt;open.</p>
