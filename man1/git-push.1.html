<p>GIT-PUSH(1) Git Manual GIT-PUSH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-push - Update remote refs along with associated
objects</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git push [--all | --mirror | --tags] [--follow-tags] [-n |
--dry-run] [--receive-pack=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;] <br>
[--repo=&lt;repository&gt;] [-f | --force] [--prune] [-v |
--verbose] [-u | --set-upstream] <br>
[&lt;repository&gt; [&lt;refspec&gt;...]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects
necessary to complete the given refs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can make interesting things
happen to a repository every time you push into it, by
setting up hooks there. See documentation for
git-receive-pack(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the command line does not
specify where to push with the &lt;repository&gt; argument,
branch.*.remote configuration for the current branch is
consulted to determine where to push. <br>
If the configuration is missing, it defaults to origin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the command line does not
specify what to push with &lt;refspec&gt;... arguments or
--all, --mirror, --tags options, the command finds the
default &lt;refspec&gt; by consulting <br>
remote.*.push configuration, and if it is not found, honors
push.default configuration to decide what to push (See
gitlink:git-config[1] for the meaning of push.default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
&lt;repository&gt; <br>
The &quot;remote&quot; repository that is destination of a
push operation. This parameter can be either a URL (see the
section GIT URLS below) or the name of a remote (see the
section <br>
REMOTES below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;refspec&gt;... <br>
Specify what destination ref to update with what source
object. The format of a &lt;refspec&gt; parameter is an
optional plus +, followed by the source object &lt;src&gt;,
followed by a <br>
colon :, followed by the destination ref &lt;dst&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;src&gt; is often the
name of the branch you would want to push, but it can be any
arbitrary &quot;SHA-1 expression&quot;, such as master~4 or
HEAD (see gitrevisions(7)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;dst&gt; tells which ref
on the remote side is updated with this push. Arbitrary
expressions cannot be used here, an actual ref must be
named. If :&lt;dst&gt; is omitted, the same <br>
ref as &lt;src&gt; will be updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The object referenced by
&lt;src&gt; is used to update the &lt;dst&gt; reference on
the remote side. By default this is only allowed if
&lt;dst&gt; is not a tag (annotated or lightweight), and
<br>
then only if it can fast-forward &lt;dst&gt;. By having the
optional leading +, you can tell Git to update the
&lt;dst&gt; ref even if it is not allowed by default (e.g.,
it is not a <br>
fast-forward.) This does not attempt to merge &lt;src&gt;
into &lt;dst&gt;. See EXAMPLES below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tag &lt;tag&gt; means the same
as refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;:refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pushing an empty &lt;src&gt;
allows you to delete the &lt;dst&gt; ref from the remote
repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special refspec : (or +: to
allow non-fast-forward updates) directs Git to push
&quot;matching&quot; branches: for every branch that exists
on the local side, the remote side is <br>
updated if a branch of the same name already exists on the
remote side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--all <br>
Instead of naming each ref to push, specifies that all refs
under refs/heads/ be pushed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--prune <br>
Remove remote branches that don&acirc;t have a local
counterpart. For example a remote branch tmp will be removed
if a local branch with the same name doesn&acirc;t exist any
more. This <br>
also respects refspecs, e.g. git push --prune remote
refs/heads/*:refs/tmp/* would make sure that remote
refs/tmp/foo will be removed if refs/heads/foo doesn&acirc;t
exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mirror <br>
Instead of naming each ref to push, specifies that all refs
under refs/ (which includes but is not limited to
refs/heads/, refs/remotes/, and refs/tags/) be mirrored to
the <br>
remote repository. Newly created local refs will be pushed
to the remote end, locally updated refs will be force
updated on the remote end, and deleted refs will be removed
<br>
from the remote end. This is the default if the
configuration option remote.&lt;remote&gt;.mirror is
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --dry-run <br>
Do everything except actually send the updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--porcelain <br>
Produce machine-readable output. The output status line for
each ref will be tab-separated and sent to stdout instead of
stderr. The full symbolic names of the refs will be <br>
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--delete <br>
All listed refs are deleted from the remote repository. This
is the same as prefixing all refs with a colon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tags <br>
All refs under refs/tags are pushed, in addition to refspecs
explicitly listed on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--follow-tags <br>
Push all the refs that would be pushed without this option,
and also push annotated tags in refs/tags that are missing
from the remote but are pointing at committish that are <br>
reachable from the refs being pushed.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--receive-pack=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;,
--exec=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt; <br>
Path to the git-receive-pack program on the remote end.
Sometimes useful when pushing to a remote repository over
ssh, and you do not have the program in a directory on the
<br>
default $PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
Usually, the command refuses to update a remote ref that is
not an ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it. This
flag disables the check. This can cause the remote <br>
repository to lose commits; use it with care.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--repo=&lt;repository&gt; <br>
This option is only relevant if no &lt;repository&gt;
argument is passed in the invocation. In this case, git push
derives the remote name from the current branch: If it
tracks a <br>
remote branch, then that remote repository is pushed to.
Otherwise, the name &quot;origin&quot; is used. For this
latter case, this option can be used to override the name
&quot;origin&quot;. In <br>
other words, the difference between these two commands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git push public #1 <br>
git push --repo=public #2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is that #1 always pushes to
&quot;public&quot; whereas #2 pushes to &quot;public&quot;
only if the current branch does not track a remote branch.
This is useful if you write an alias or script <br>
around git push.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --set-upstream <br>
For every branch that is up to date or successfully pushed,
add upstream (tracking) reference, used by argument-less
git-pull(1) and other commands. For more information, see
<br>
branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge in git-config(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no-]thin <br>
These options are passed to git-send-pack(1). A thin
transfer significantly reduces the amount of sent data when
the sender and receiver share many of the same objects in
<br>
common. The default is --thin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Suppress all output, including the listing of updated refs,
unless an error occurs. Progress is not reported to the
standard error stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Run verbosely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--progress <br>
Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by
default when it is attached to a terminal, unless -q is
specified. This flag forces progress status even if the <br>
standard error stream is not directed to a terminal.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--recurse-submodules=check|on-demand
<br>
Make sure all submodule commits used by the revisions to be
pushed are available on a remote-tracking branch. If check
is used Git will verify that all submodule commits that <br>
changed in the revisions to be pushed are available on at
least one remote of the submodule. If any commits are
missing the push will be aborted and exit with non-zero <br>
status. If on-demand is used all submodules that changed in
the revisions to be pushed will be pushed. If on-demand was
not able to push all necessary revisions it will also <br>
be aborted and exit with non-zero status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GIT URLS <br>
In general, URLs contain information about the transport
protocol, the address of the remote server, and the path to
the repository. Depending on the transport protocol, some of
<br>
this information may be absent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Git supports ssh, git, http, and
https protocols (in addition, ftp, and ftps can be used for
fetching and rsync can be used for fetching and pushing, but
these are inefficient <br>
and deprecated; do not use them).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following syntaxes may be
used with them:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
git://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
http[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
ftp[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
rsync://host.xz/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alternative scp-like syntax
may also be used with the ssh protocol:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
[user@]host.xz:path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ssh and git protocols
additionally support ~username expansion:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
git://host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
[user@]host.xz:/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For local repositories, also
supported by Git natively, the following syntaxes may be
used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
file:///path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These two syntaxes are mostly
equivalent, except when cloning, when the former implies
--local option. See git-clone(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When Git doesn&acirc;t know how
to handle a certain transport protocol, it attempts to use
the remote-&lt;transport&gt; remote helper, if one exists.
To explicitly request a remote helper, <br>
the following syntax may be used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&lt;transport&gt;::&lt;address&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &lt;address&gt; may be a
path, a server and path, or an arbitrary URL-like string
recognized by the specific remote helper being invoked. See
gitremote-helpers(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are a large number of
similarly-named remote repositories and you want to use a
different format for them (such that the URLs you use will
be rewritten into URLs that <br>
work), you can create a configuration section of the
form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[url &quot;&lt;actual url
base&gt;&quot;] <br>
insteadOf = &lt;other url base&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, with this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[url
&quot;git://git.host.xz/&quot;] <br>
insteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/ <br>
insteadOf = work:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a URL like
&quot;work:repo.git&quot; or like
&quot;host.xz:/path/to/repo.git&quot; will be rewritten in
any context that takes a URL to be
&quot;git://git.host.xz/repo.git&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to rewrite URLs for
push only, you can create a configuration section of the
form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[url &quot;&lt;actual url
base&gt;&quot;] <br>
pushInsteadOf = &lt;other url base&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, with this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[url
&quot;ssh://example.org/&quot;] <br>
pushInsteadOf = git://example.org/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a URL like
&quot;git://example.org/path/to/repo.git&quot; will be
rewritten to &quot;ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git&quot;
for pushes, but pulls will still use the original URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMOTES <br>
The name of one of the following can be used instead of a
URL as &lt;repository&gt; argument:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a remote in the
Git configuration file: $GIT_DIR/config,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a file in the
$GIT_DIR/remotes directory, or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a file in the
$GIT_DIR/branches directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of these also allow you to
omit the refspec from the command line because they each
contain a refspec which git will use by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Named remote in configuration
file <br>
You can choose to provide the name of a remote which you had
previously configured using git-remote(1), git-config(1) or
even by a manual edit to the $GIT_DIR/config file. The <br>
URL of this remote will be used to access the repository.
The refspec of this remote will be used by default when you
do not provide a refspec on the command line. The entry in
<br>
the config file would appear like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[remote
&quot;&lt;name&gt;&quot;] <br>
url = &lt;url&gt; <br>
pushurl = &lt;pushurl&gt; <br>
push = &lt;refspec&gt; <br>
fetch = &lt;refspec&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;pushurl&gt; is used for
pushes only. It is optional and defaults to &lt;url&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Named file in $GIT_DIR/remotes
<br>
You can choose to provide the name of a file in
$GIT_DIR/remotes. The URL in this file will be used to
access the repository. The refspec in this file will be used
as default <br>
when you do not provide a refspec on the command line. This
file should have the following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">URL: one of the above URL format
<br>
Push: &lt;refspec&gt; <br>
Pull: &lt;refspec&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Push: lines are used by git push
and Pull: lines are used by git pull and git fetch. Multiple
Push: and Pull: lines may be specified for additional branch
mappings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Named file in $GIT_DIR/branches
<br>
You can choose to provide the name of a file in
$GIT_DIR/branches. The URL in this file will be used to
access the repository. This file should have the following
format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;url&gt;#&lt;head&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;url&gt; is required;
#&lt;head&gt; is optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Depending on the operation, git
will use one of the following refspecs, if you don&acirc;t
provide one on the command line. &lt;branch&gt; is the name
of this file in $GIT_DIR/branches and <br>
&lt;head&gt; defaults to master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git fetch uses:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">refs/heads/&lt;head&gt;:refs/heads/&lt;branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git push uses:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">HEAD:refs/heads/&lt;head&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT <br>
The output of &quot;git push&quot; depends on the transport
method used; this section describes the output when pushing
over the Git protocol (either locally or via ssh).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The status of the push is output
in tabular form, with each line representing the status of a
single ref. Each line is of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;flag&gt; &lt;summary&gt;
&lt;from&gt; -&gt; &lt;to&gt; (&lt;reason&gt;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --porcelain is used, then
each line of the output is of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;flag&gt;
&lt;from&gt;:&lt;to&gt; &lt;summary&gt; (&lt;reason&gt;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The status of up-to-date refs is
shown only if --porcelain or --verbose option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flag <br>
A single character indicating the status of the ref:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(space) <br>
for a successfully pushed fast-forward;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ <br>
for a successful forced update;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- <br>
for a successfully deleted ref;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* <br>
for a successfully pushed new ref;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! <br>
for a ref that was rejected or failed to push; and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= <br>
for a ref that was up to date and did not need pushing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">summary <br>
For a successfully pushed ref, the summary shows the old and
new values of the ref in a form suitable for using as an
argument to git log (this is &lt;old&gt;..&lt;new&gt; in
most cases, <br>
and &lt;old&gt;...&lt;new&gt; for forced non-fast-forward
updates).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a failed update, more
details are given:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rejected <br>
Git did not try to send the ref at all, typically because it
is not a fast-forward and you did not force the update.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote rejected <br>
The remote end refused the update. Usually caused by a hook
on the remote side, or because the remote repository has one
of the following safety options in effect: <br>
receive.denyCurrentBranch (for pushes to the checked out
branch), receive.denyNonFastForwards (for forced
non-fast-forward updates), receive.denyDeletes or <br>
receive.denyDeleteCurrent. See git-config(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote failure <br>
The remote end did not report the successful update of the
ref, perhaps because of a temporary error on the remote
side, a break in the network connection, or other <br>
transient error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">from <br>
The name of the local ref being pushed, minus its
refs/&lt;type&gt;/ prefix. In the case of deletion, the name
of the local ref is omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to <br>
The name of the remote ref being updated, minus its
refs/&lt;type&gt;/ prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reason <br>
A human-readable explanation. In the case of successfully
pushed refs, no explanation is needed. For a failed ref, the
reason for failure is described.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE ABOUT FAST-FORWARDS <br>
When an update changes a branch (or more in general, a ref)
that used to point at commit A to point at another commit B,
it is called a fast-forward update if and only if B is a
<br>
descendant of A.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a fast-forward update from A
to B, the set of commits that the original commit A built on
top of is a subset of the commits the new commit B builds on
top of. Hence, it does <br>
not lose any history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In contrast, a non-fast-forward
update will lose history. For example, suppose you and
somebody else started at the same commit X, and you built a
history leading to commit B <br>
while the other person built a history leading to commit A.
The history looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B <br>
/ <br>
---X---A</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Further suppose that the other
person already pushed changes leading to A back to the
original repository from which you two obtained the original
commit X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The push done by the other
person updated the branch that used to point at commit X to
point at commit A. It is a fast-forward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But if you try to push, you will
attempt to update the branch (that now points at A) with
commit B. This does not fast-forward. If you did so, the
changes introduced by commit A <br>
will be lost, because everybody will now start building on
top of B.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command by default does not
allow an update that is not a fast-forward to prevent such
loss of history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not want to lose your
work (history from X to B) nor the work by the other person
(history from X to A), you would need to first fetch the
history from the repository, <br>
create a history that contains changes done by both parties,
and push the result back.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can perform &quot;git
pull&quot;, resolve potential conflicts, and &quot;git
push&quot; the result. A &quot;git pull&quot; will create a
merge commit C between commits A and B.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B---C <br>
/ / <br>
---X---A</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Updating A with the resulting
merge commit will fast-forward and your push will be
accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, you can rebase
your change between X and B on top of A, with &quot;git pull
--rebase&quot;, and push the result back. The rebase will
create a new commit D that builds the <br>
change between X and B on top of A.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B D <br>
/ / <br>
---X---A</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Again, updating A with this
commit will fast-forward and your push will be accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is another common
situation where you may encounter non-fast-forward rejection
when you try to push, and it is possible even when you are
pushing into a repository nobody <br>
else pushes into. After you push commit A yourself (in the
first picture in this section), replace it with &quot;git
commit --amend&quot; to produce commit B, and you try to
push it out, <br>
because forgot that you have pushed A out already. In such a
case, and only if you are certain that nobody in the
meantime fetched your earlier commit A (and started building
on <br>
top of it), you can run &quot;git push --force&quot; to
overwrite it. In other words, &quot;git push --force&quot;
is a method reserved for a case where you do mean to lose
history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
git push <br>
Works like git push &lt;remote&gt;, where &lt;remote&gt; is
the current branch&acirc;s remote (or origin, if no remote
is configured for the current branch).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git push origin <br>
Without additional configuration, works like git push origin
:.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default behavior of this
command when no &lt;refspec&gt; is given can be configured
by setting the push option of the remote, or the
push.default configuration variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to default to
pushing only the current branch to origin use git config
remote.origin.push HEAD. Any valid &lt;refspec&gt; (like the
ones in the examples below) can be <br>
configured as the default for git push origin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git push origin : <br>
Push &quot;matching&quot; branches to origin. See
&lt;refspec&gt; in the OPTIONS section above for a
description of &quot;matching&quot; branches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git push origin master <br>
Find a ref that matches master in the source repository
(most likely, it would find refs/heads/master), and update
the same ref (e.g. refs/heads/master) in origin repository
<br>
with it. If master did not exist remotely, it would be
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git push origin HEAD <br>
A handy way to push the current branch to the same name on
the remote.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git push mothership
master:satellite/master dev:satellite/dev <br>
Use the source ref that matches master (e.g.
refs/heads/master) to update the ref that matches
satellite/master (most probably
refs/remotes/satellite/master) in the <br>
mothership repository; do the same for dev and
satellite/dev.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is to emulate git fetch run
on the mothership using git push that is run in the opposite
direction in order to integrate the work done on satellite,
and is often <br>
necessary when you can only make connection in one way (i.e.
satellite can ssh into mothership but mothership cannot
initiate connection to satellite because the latter is <br>
behind a firewall or does not run sshd).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After running this git push on
the satellite machine, you would ssh into the mothership and
run git merge there to complete the emulation of git pull
that were run on <br>
mothership to pull changes made on satellite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git push origin HEAD:master <br>
Push the current branch to the remote ref matching master in
the origin repository. This form is convenient to push the
current branch without thinking about its local name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git push origin
master:refs/heads/experimental <br>
Create the branch experimental in the origin repository by
copying the current master branch. This form is only needed
to create a new branch or tag in the remote repository <br>
when the local name and the remote name are different;
otherwise, the ref name on its own will work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git push origin :experimental
<br>
Find a ref that matches experimental in the origin
repository (e.g. refs/heads/experimental), and delete
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git push origin +dev:master <br>
Update the origin repository&acirc;s master branch with the
dev branch, allowing non-fast-forward updates. This can
leave unreferenced commits dangling in the origin
repository. <br>
Consider the following situation, where a fast-forward is
not possible:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o---o---o---A---B origin/master
<br>
X---Y---Z dev</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above command would change
the origin repository to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A---B (unnamed branch) <br>
/ <br>
o---o---o---X---Y---Z master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commits A and B would no longer
belong to a branch with a symbolic name, and so would be
unreachable. As such, these commits would be removed by a
git gc command on the <br>
origin repository.</p>
