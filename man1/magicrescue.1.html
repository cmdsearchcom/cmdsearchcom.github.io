<p>MAGICRESCUE(1) Magic Rescue MAGICRESCUE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
magicrescue - Scans a block device and extracts known file
types by looking at magic bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
magicrescue [ options ] devices</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Magic Rescue opens devices for reading, scans them for file
types it knows how to recover and calls an external program
to extract them. It looks at &quot;magic bytes&quot; in file
<br>
contents, so it can be used both as an undelete utility and
for recovering a corrupted drive or partition. It works on
any file system, but on very fragmented file systems it <br>
can only recover the first chunk of each file. These chunks
are sometimes as big as 50MB, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To invoke magicrescue, you must
specify at least one device and the -d and -r options. See
the &quot;USAGE&quot; section in this manual for getting
started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b blocksize <br>
Default: 1. This will direct magicrescue to only consider
files that start at a multiple of the blocksize argument.
The option applies only to the recipes following it, <br>
so by specifying it multiple times it can be used to get
different behavior for different recipes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using this option you can
usually get better performance, but fewer files will be
found. In particular, files with leading garbage (e.g. many
mp3 files) and files <br>
contained inside other files are likely to be skipped. Also,
some file systems don&rsquo;t align small files to block
boundaries, so those won&rsquo;t be found this way
either.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t know your
file system&rsquo;s block size, just use the value 512,
which is almost always the hardware sector size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d directory <br>
Mandatory. Output directory for found files. Make sure you
have plenty of free space in this directory, especially when
extracting very common file types such as jpeg or <br>
gzip files. Also make sure the file system is able to handle
thousands of files in a single directory, i.e. don&rsquo;t
use FAT if you are extracting many files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should not place the output
directory on the same block device you are trying to rescue
files from. This might add the same file to the block device
ahead of the <br>
current reading position, causing magicrescue to find the
same file again later. In the worst theoretical case, this
could cause a loop where the same file is extracted <br>
thousands of times until disk space is exhausted. You are
also likely to overwrite the deleted files you were looking
for in the first place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r recipe <br>
Mandatory. Recipe name, file, or directory. Specify this as
either a plain name (e.g. &quot;jpeg-jfif&quot;) or a path
(e.g. recipes/jpeg-jfif). If it doesn&rsquo;t find such a
file <br>
in the current directory, it will look in ./recipes and
/usr/share/magicrescue/recipes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If recipe is a directory, all
files in that directory will be treated as recipes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Browse the
/usr/share/magicrescue/recipes directory to see what recipes
are available. A recipe is a text file, and you should read
the comments inside it before using <br>
it. Either use the recipe as it is or copy it somewhere and
modify it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For information on creating your
own recipes, see the &quot;RECIPES&quot; section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I file <br>
Reads input files from file in addition to those listed on
the command line. If file is &quot;-&quot;, read from
standard input. Each line will be interpreted as a file
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M output_mode <br>
Produce machine-readable output to stdout. output_mode can
be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i Print each input file name
before processing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Print each output file name
after processing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">io Print both input and output
file names. Input file names will be prefixed by
&quot;i&quot; and a space. Output file names will be
prefixed by &quot;o&quot; and a space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nothing else will be written to
standard output in this mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O [+|-|=][0x]offset <br>
Resume from the specified offset in the first device. If
prefixed with 0x it will be interpreted as a hex number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number may be prefixed with
a sign:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= Seek to an absolute position
(default)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ Seek to a relative position.
On regular files this does the same as the above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Seek to EOF, minus the
offset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
Say you have destroyed the file system on /dev/hdb1 and you
want to extract all the jpeg files you lost. This guide
assumes you have installed Magic Rescue in /usr/local, which
<br>
is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make sure DMA and other
optimizations are enabled on your disk, or it will take
hours. In Linux, use hdparm to set these options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ hdparm -d 1 -c 1 -u 1
/dev/hdb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Choose your output directory,
somewhere with lots of disk space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ mkdir ~/output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Look in the
/usr/local/share/magicrescue/recipes directory for the
recipes you want. Magic Rescue comes with recipes for some
common file types, and you can make your own too <br>
(see the next section). Open the recipes you want to use in
a text editor and read their comments. Most recipes require
3rd party software to work, and you may want to modify <br>
some parameters (such as min_output_file) to suit your
needs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then invoke magicrescue</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ magicrescue -r jpeg-jfif -r
jpeg-exif -d ~/output /dev/hdb1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It will scan through your entire
hard disk, so it may take a while. You can stop it and
resume later of you want to. To do so, interrupt it (with
CTRL+C) and note the progress <br>
information saying what address it got to. Then restart it
later with the -O option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When it has finished you will
probably find thousands of .jpg files in ~/output, including
things you never knew was in your browser cache. Sorting
through all those files can <br>
be a huge task, so you may want to use software or scripts
to do it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, try to eliminate
duplicates with the dupemap(1) tool included in this
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ dupemap delete,report
~/output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are performing an
undelete operation you will want to get rid of all the
rescued files that also appear on the live file system. See
the dupemap(1) manual for <br>
instructions on doing this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If that&rsquo;s not enough, you
can use use magicsort(1) to get a better overview:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ magicsort ~/output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RECIPES <br>
Creating recipe files <br>
A recipe file is a relatively simple file of 3-5 lines of
text. It describes how to recognise the beginning of the
file and what to do when a file is recognised. For example,
<br>
all jfif images start with the bytes &quot;0xff 0xd8&quot;.
At the 6th byte will be the string &quot;JFIF&quot;. Look at
recipes/jpeg-jfif in the source distribution to follow this
example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Matching magic data is done with
a &quot;match operation&quot; that looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">offset operation parameter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where offset is a decimal
integer saying how many bytes from the beginning of the file
this data is located, operation refers to a built-in match
operation in magicrescue, and <br>
parameter is specific to that operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The string
operation matches a string of any length. In the jfif
example this is four bytes. You can use escape characters,
like &quot;0 or &quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The int32
operation matches 4 bytes ANDed with a bit mask. To match
all four bytes, use the bit mask &quot;FFFFFFFF&quot;. If
you have no idea what a bit mask is, just use the string
<br>
operation instead. The mask &quot;FFFF0000&quot; in the jfif
example matches the first two bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The char
operation is like &quot;string&quot;, except it only matches
a single character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To learn these patterns for a
given file type, look at files of the desired type in a hex
editor, search through the resource files for the file(1)
utility <br>
(&lt;http://freshmeat.net/projects/file&gt;) and/or search
the Internet for a reference on the format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If all the operations match, we
have found the start of the file. Finding the end of the
file is a much harder problem, and therefore it is delegated
to an external shell <br>
command, which is named by the command directive. This
command receives the block device&rsquo;s file descriptor on
stdin and must write to the file given to it in the $1
variable. <br>
Apart from that, the command can do anything it wants to try
and extract the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For some file types (such as
jpeg), a tool already exists that can do this. However, many
programs misbehave when told to read from the middle of a
huge block device. Some seek <br>
to byte 0 before reading (can be fixed by prefixing cat|,
but some refuse to work on a file they can&rsquo;t seek in).
Others try to read the whole file into memory before doing
<br>
anything, which will of course fail on a muti-gigabyte block
device. And some fail completely to parse a partially
corrupted file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that you may have to
write your own tool or wrap an existing program in some
scripts that make it behave better. For example, this could
be to extract the first 10MB <br>
into a temporary file and let the program work on that. Or
perhaps you can use tools/safecat if the file may be very
large.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recipe format reference <br>
Empty lines and lines starting with &quot;#&quot; will be
skipped. A recipe contains a series of match operations to
find the content and a series of directives to specify what
to do with <br>
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lines of the format offset
operation parameter will add a match operation to the list.
Match operations will be tried in the order they appear in
the recipe, and they must all <br>
match for the recipe to succeed. The offset describes what
offset this data will be found at, counting from the
beginning of the file. operation can have the following
values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string string <br>
The parameter is a character sequence that may contain
escape sequences such as .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">char character <br>
The parameter is a single character (byte), or an escape
sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int32 value bitmask <br>
Both value and bitmask are expressed as 8-character hex
strings. bitmask will be ANDed with the data, and the result
will be compared to value. The byte order is as you <br>
see it in the hex editor, i.e. big-endian.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first match operation in a
recipe is special, it will be used to scan through the file.
Only the char and string operations can be used there. To
add more operation types, <br>
look at the instructions in magicrescue.c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A line that doesn&rsquo;t start
with an integer is a directive. This can be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extension ext <br>
Mandatory. ext names the file extension for this type, such
as &quot;jpg&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command command <br>
Mandatory. When all the match operations succeed, this
command will be executed to extract the file from the block
device. command is passed to the shell with the block <br>
device&rsquo;s file descriptor (seeked to the right byte) on
stdin. The shell variable $1 will contain the file its
output should be written to, and it must respect this. <br>
Otherwise magicrescue cannot tell whether it succeeded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rename command <br>
Optional. After a successful extraction this command will be
run. Its purpose is to gather enough information about the
file to rename it to something more meaningful. <br>
The script must not perform the rename command itself, but
it should write to standard output the string
&quot;RENAME&quot;, followed by a space, followed by the new
file name. <br>
Nothing else must be written to standard output. If the file
should not be renamed, nothing should be written to standard
output. Standard input and $1 will work like <br>
with the command directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">min_output_file size <br>
Default: 100. Output files less than this size will be
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow_overlap bytes <br>
By default, recipes will not match on overlapping byte
ranges. allow_overlap disables this, and it should always be
used for recipes where the extracted file may be <br>
larger than it was on disk. If bytes is negative, overlap
checking will be completely disabled. Otherwise, overlap
checking will be in effect for everything but the last <br>
bytes of the output. For example, if the output may be up to
512 bytes bigger than the input, allow_overlap should be set
to 512.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To test whether your recipe
actually works, either just run it on your hard disk or use
the tools/checkrecipe script to pick out files that should
match but don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have created a recipe
that works, please mail it to me at jbj@knef.dk so I can
include it in the distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WHEN TO NOT USE MAGIC RESCUE
<br>
Magic Rescue is not meant to be a universal application for
file recovery. It will give good results when you are
extracting known file types from an unusable file system,
but <br>
for many other cases there are better tools available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If there are
intact partitions present somewhere, use gpart to find
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If file
system&rsquo;s internal data structures are more or less
undamaged, use The Sleuth Kit. At the time of writing, it
only supports NTFS, FAT, ext[23] and FFS, though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If Magic Rescue
does not have a recipe for the file type you are trying to
recover, try foremost instead. It recognizes more file
types, but in most cases it extracts them <br>
simply by copying out a fixed number of bytes after it has
found the start of the file. This makes postprocessing the
output files more difficult.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In many cases you will want to
use Magic Rescue in addition to the tools mentioned above.
They are not mutually exclusive, e.g. combining magicrescue
with dls from The Sleuth <br>
Kit could give good results. In many cases you&rsquo;ll want
to use magicrescue to extract its known file types and
another utility to extract the rest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When combining the results of
more than one tool, dupemap(1) can be used to eliminate
duplicates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
Similar programs <br>
gpart(8) <br>
&lt;http://www.stud.uni-hannover.de/user/76201/gpart/&gt;.
Tries to rebuild the partition table by scanning the disk
for lost partitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foremost(1) <br>
&lt;http://foremost.sourceforge.net&gt;. Does the same thing
as magicrescue, except that its &quot;recipes&quot; are less
complex. Finding the end of the file must happen by either
<br>
matching an EOF string or just extracting a fixed number of
bytes every time. It supports more file types than Magic
Rescue, but extracted files usually have lots of <br>
trailing garbage, so removal of duplicates and sorting by
size is not possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Sleuth Kit <br>
&lt;http://www.sleuthkit.org/sleuthkit/&gt;. This popular
package of utilities is extremely useful for undeleting
files from a FAT/NTFS/ext2/ext3/FFS file system that&rsquo;s
not <br>
completely corrupted. Most of the utilities are not very
useful if the file system has been corrupted or overwritten.
It is based on The Coroner&rsquo;s Toolkit <br>
(&lt;http://www.porcupine.org/forensics/tct.html&gt;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JPEG recovery tools <br>
This seems to be the file type most people are trying to
recover. Available utilities include
