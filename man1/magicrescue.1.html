magicrescue - Scans a block device and extracts known file types by looking at
  magic bytes.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>magicrescue</b> [ <i>options</i> ] <i>devices</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Magic Rescue opens <i>devices</i> for reading, scans them for file types it
  knows how to recover and calls an external program to extract them. It looks
  at &quot;magic bytes&quot; in file contents, so it can be used both as an
  undelete utility and for recovering a corrupted drive or partition. It works
  on any file system, but on very fragmented file systems it can only recover
  the first chunk of each file. These chunks are sometimes as big as 50MB,
  however.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To invoke <b>magicrescue</b>, you must specify at least one device and the
  <b>-d</b> and <b>-r</b> options. See the &quot;USAGE&quot; section in this
  manual for getting started.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-b</b> <i>blocksize</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Default: 1. This will direct <b>magicrescue</b> to only
      consider files that start at a multiple of the <i>blocksize</i> argument.
      The option applies only to the recipes following it, so by specifying it
      multiple times it can be used to get different behavior for different
      recipes.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Using this option you can usually get better performance, but fewer files
      will be found. In particular, files with leading garbage (e.g. many mp3
      files) and files contained inside other files are likely to be skipped.
      Also, some file systems don't align small files to block boundaries, so
      those won't be found this way either.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you don't know your file system's block size, just use the value 512,
      which is almost always the hardware sector size.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d</b> <i>directory</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Mandatory. Output directory for found files. Make sure you
      have plenty of free space in this directory, especially when extracting
      very common file types such as jpeg or gzip files. Also make sure the file
      system is able to handle thousands of files in a single directory, i.e.
      don't use FAT if you are extracting many files.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You should not place the output directory on the same block device you are
      trying to rescue files from. This might add the same file to the block
      device ahead of the current reading position, causing <b>magicrescue</b>
      to find the same file again later. In the worst theoretical case, this
      could cause a loop where the same file is extracted thousands of times
      until disk space is exhausted. You are also likely to overwrite the
      deleted files you were looking for in the first place.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-r</b> <i>recipe</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Mandatory. Recipe name, file, or directory. Specify this as
      either a plain name (e.g. &quot;jpeg-jfif&quot;) or a path (e.g.
      <i>recipes/jpeg-jfif</i>). If it doesn't find such a file in the current
      directory, it will look in <i>./recipes</i> and
      <i>/usr/share/magicrescue/recipes</i>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

Say you have destroyed the file system on /dev/hdb1 and you want to extract all
  the jpeg files you lost. This guide assumes you have installed Magic Rescue in
  <i>/usr/local</i>, which is the default.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Make sure DMA and other optimizations are enabled on your disk, or it will take
  hours. In Linux, use hdparm to set these options:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $ hdparm -d 1 -c 1 -u 1 /dev/hdb
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Choose your output directory, somewhere with lots of disk space.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $ mkdir ~/output
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Look in the <i>/usr/local/share/magicrescue/recipes</i> directory for the
  recipes you want. Magic Rescue comes with recipes for some common file types,
  and you can make your own too (see the next section). Open the recipes you
  want to use in a text editor and read their comments. Most recipes require 3rd
  party software to work, and you may want to modify some parameters (such as
  <b>min_output_file</b>) to suit your needs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then invoke <b>magicrescue</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $ magicrescue -r jpeg-jfif -r jpeg-exif -d ~/output /dev/hdb1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It will scan through your entire hard disk, so it may take a while. You can stop
  it and resume later of you want to. To do so, interrupt it (with CTRL+C) and
  note the progress information saying what address it got to. Then restart it
  later with the <b>-O</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When it has finished you will probably find thousands of .jpg files in
  <i>~/output</i>, including things you never knew was in your browser cache.
  Sorting through all those files can be a huge task, so you may want to use
  software or scripts to do it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
First, try to eliminate duplicates with the <b>dupemap</b>(1) tool included in
  this package.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $ dupemap delete,report ~/output
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are performing an undelete operation you will want to get rid of all the
  rescued files that also appear on the live file system. See the
  <b>dupemap</b>(1) manual for instructions on doing this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If that's not enough, you can use use <b>magicsort</b>(1) to get a better
  overview:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $ magicsort ~/output
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RECIPES"><a class="selflink" href="#RECIPES">RECIPES</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Creating_recipe_files"><a class="selflink" href="#Creating_recipe_files">Creating
  recipe files</a></h2>
A recipe file is a relatively simple file of 3-5 lines of text. It describes how
  to recognise the beginning of the file and what to do when a file is
  recognised. For example, all jfif images start with the bytes &quot;0xff
  0xd8&quot;. At the 6th byte will be the string &quot;JFIF&quot;. Look at
  <i>recipes/jpeg-jfif</i> in the source distribution to follow this example.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Matching magic data is done with a &quot;match operation&quot; that looks like
  this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>offset</i> <i>operation</i> <i>parameter</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where <i>offset</i> is a decimal integer saying how many bytes from the
  beginning of the file this data is located, <i>operation</i> refers to a
  built-in match operation in <b>magicrescue</b>, and <i>parameter</i> is
  specific to that operation.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <b>string</b> operation matches a string of any length.
      In the jfif example this is four bytes. You can use escape characters,
      like &quot;\n&quot; or &quot;\xA7&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <b>int32</b> operation matches 4 bytes ANDed with a bit
      mask. To match all four bytes, use the bit mask &quot;FFFFFFFF&quot;. If
      you have no idea what a bit mask is, just use the <b>string</b> operation
      instead. The mask &quot;FFFF0000&quot; in the jfif example matches the
      first two bytes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <b>char</b> operation is like &quot;string&quot;,
      except it only matches a single character.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To learn these patterns for a given file type, look at files of the desired type
  in a hex editor, search through the resource files for the <b>file</b>(1)
  utility (&lt;http://freshmeat.net/projects/file&gt;) and/or search the
  Internet for a reference on the format.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If all the operations match, we have found the start of the file. Finding the
  end of the file is a much harder problem, and therefore it is delegated to an
  external shell command, which is named by the <b>command</b> directive. This
  command receives the block device's file descriptor on stdin and must write to
  the file given to it in the $1 variable. Apart from that, the command can do
  anything it wants to try and extract the file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For some file types (such as jpeg), a tool already exists that can do this.
  However, many programs misbehave when told to read from the middle of a huge
  block device. Some seek to byte 0 before reading (can be fixed by prefixing
  cat|, but some refuse to work on a file they can't seek in). Others try to
  read the whole file into memory before doing anything, which will of course
  fail on a muti-gigabyte block device. And some fail completely to parse a
  partially corrupted file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This means that you may have to write your own tool or wrap an existing program
  in some scripts that make it behave better. For example, this could be to
  extract the first 10MB into a temporary file and let the program work on that.
  Or perhaps you can use <i>tools/safecat</i> if the file may be very large.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Recipe_format_reference"><a class="selflink" href="#Recipe_format_reference">Recipe
  format reference</a></h2>
Empty lines and lines starting with &quot;#&quot; will be skipped. A recipe
  contains a series of match operations to find the content and a series of
  directives to specify what to do with it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Lines of the format <i>offset</i> <i>operation</i> <i>parameter</i> will add a
  match operation to the list. Match operations will be tried in the order they
  appear in the recipe, and they must all match for the recipe to succeed. The
  <i>offset</i> describes what offset this data will be found at, counting from
  the beginning of the file. <i>operation</i> can have the following values:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>string</b> <i>string</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The parameter is a character sequence that may contain
      escape sequences such as \xFF.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>char</b> <i>character</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The parameter is a single character (byte), or an escape
      sequence.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>int32</b> <i>value</i> <i>bitmask</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Both <i>value</i> and <i>bitmask</i> are expressed as
      8-character hex strings. <i>bitmask</i> will be ANDed with the data, and
      the result will be compared to <i>value</i>. The byte order is as you see
      it in the hex editor, i.e. big-endian.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first match operation in a recipe is special, it will be used to scan
  through the file. Only the <b>char</b> and <b>string</b> operations can be
  used there. To add more operation types, look at the instructions in
  <i>magicrescue.c</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A line that doesn't start with an integer is a directive. This can be:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>extension</b> <i>ext</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Mandatory. <i>ext</i> names the file extension for this
      type, such as &quot;jpg&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>command</b> <i>command</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Mandatory. When all the match operations succeed, this
      <i>command</i> will be executed to extract the file from the block device.
      <i>command</i> is passed to the shell with the block device's file
      descriptor (seeked to the right byte) on stdin. The shell variable $1 will
      contain the file its output should be written to, and it must respect
      this. Otherwise <b>magicrescue</b> cannot tell whether it succeeded.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>rename</b> <i>command</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Optional. After a successful extraction this command will
      be run. Its purpose is to gather enough information about the file to
      rename it to something more meaningful. The script must not perform the
      rename command itself, but it should write to standard output the string
      &quot;RENAME&quot;, followed by a space, followed by the new file name.
      Nothing else must be written to standard output. If the file should not be
      renamed, nothing should be written to standard output. Standard input and
      $1 will work like with the <b>command</b> directive.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>min_output_file</b> <i>size</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Default: 100. Output files less than this size will be
      deleted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>allow_overlap</b> <i>bytes</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">By default, recipes will not match on overlapping byte
      ranges. <b>allow_overlap</b> disables this, and it should always be used
      for recipes where the extracted file may be larger than it was on disk. If
      <i>bytes</i> is negative, overlap checking will be completely disabled.
      Otherwise, overlap checking will be in effect for everything but the last
      <i>bytes</i> of the output. For example, if the output may be up to 512
      bytes bigger than the input, <b>allow_overlap</b> should be set to
    512.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To test whether your recipe actually works, either just run it on your hard disk
  or use the <i>tools/checkrecipe</i> script to pick out files that should match
  but don't.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have created a recipe that works, please mail it to me at jbj@knef.dk so
  I can include it in the distribution.

  TO NOT USE MAGIC RESCUE</a></h1>
Magic Rescue is not meant to be a universal application for file recovery. It
  will give good results when you are extracting known file types from an
  unusable file system, but for many other cases there are better tools
  available.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If there are intact partitions present somewhere, use
      <b>gpart</b> to find them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If file system's internal data structures are more or less
      undamaged, use <b>The Sleuth Kit</b>. At the time of writing, it only
      supports NTFS, FAT, ext[23] and FFS, though.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If Magic Rescue does not have a recipe for the file type
      you are trying to recover, try <b>foremost</b> instead. It recognizes more
      file types, but in most cases it extracts them simply by copying out a
      fixed number of bytes after it has found the start of the file. This makes
      postprocessing the output files more difficult.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In many cases you will want to use Magic Rescue in addition to the tools
  mentioned above. They are not mutually exclusive, e.g. combining
  <b>magicrescue</b> with <b>dls</b> from The Sleuth Kit could give good
  results. In many cases you'll want to use <b>magicrescue</b> to extract its
  known file types and another utility to extract the rest.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When combining the results of more than one tool, <b>dupemap</b>(1) can be used
  to eliminate duplicates.
