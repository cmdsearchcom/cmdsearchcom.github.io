<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
eclipse - extensible tool platform and Java IDE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
eclipse [ platform options ] [ -vmargs [ Java VM arguments
]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The Eclipse Platform is an open and extensible platform for
anything and yet nothing in particular. It provides a
foundation for constructing and running integrated
software-de&acirc; <br>
velopment tools. The Eclipse Platform allows tool builders
to independently develop tools that integrate with other
people&rsquo;s tools so seamlessly you can&rsquo;t tell
where one tool <br>
ends and another starts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When invoked without selecting
any particular application, the eclipse command will start
the Eclipse Platform with the Java Development Tools (JDT)
functionality enabled and <br>
ready to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manual page documents the
command-line arguments for the Eclipse Platform and it is
based on the Runtime Options help item in the Eclipse online
help &acirc;&uml;see below&acirc;&copy; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLATFORM OPTIONS <br>
Listed below are the command line arguments processed by
various parts of the Eclipse runtime. Many of these values
can also be specified using System properties either on the
<br>
command line using -D VM arguments, by specifying their
values in a config.ini file or by using a
&lt;launcher&gt;.ini file. Using the two latter techniques
it is possible to customize <br>
Eclipse without using command line arguments at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each argument in the list,
its corresponding System property key is given (in {}). Also
given is the Eclipse runtime layer in which the command line
argument is processed (in <br>
()).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-application &lt;id&gt;
(Runtime) <br>
The identifier of the application to run. The value given
here overrides any application defined by the product being
run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the property eclipse.application to &lt;id&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-arch &lt;architecture&gt;
(OSGi) <br>
The processor architecture value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the property osgi.arch to &lt;architecture&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-clean (OSGi) <br>
Wipe clean any cached data used by the OSGi framework and
eclipse runtime. This will clean the caches used to store
bundle dependency resolution and eclipse extension
reg&acirc; <br>
istry data. Using this option will force eclipse to
reinitialize these caches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the property osgi.clean to &quot;true&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-configuration &lt;location&gt;
(Main) <br>
The configuration location for this run of the platform. The
configuration determines what plug-ins will run as well as
various other system settings. See the On-line Help <br>
for details (SEE ALSO below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the property osgi.configuration.area to
&lt;location&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-console [port] (OSGi) <br>
Enable the OSGi console (if installed). If the [port] value
is a suitable integer, it is interpreted as the port on
which the console listens and directs its output to the <br>
given port. Handy for investigating the state of the
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the property osgi.console to [port] or the empty string if
the default port is to be used (i.e., when the port is not
specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-consoleLog (Runtime) <br>
Any log output is also sent to Java&rsquo;s System.out
(typically back to the command shell if any). Handy when
combined with -debug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the property eclipse.consoleLog to &quot;true&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-data &lt;location&gt; (OSGi)
<br>
The instance data location for this session. Plug-ins use
this location to store their data. For example, the
Resources plug-in uses this as the default location for <br>
projects (aka the workspace). See the On-line Help for
details (SEE ALSO below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the property osgi.instance.area to &lt;location&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-debug [options file] (OSGi)
<br>
Put the platform in debug mode. If [options file] is given,
it is interpreted as the location of the .options file. This
file indicates what debug points are available for <br>
a plug-in and whether or not they are enabled. If a location
is not specified, the platform searches for the .options
file under the install directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the property osgi.debug to [options file] or the empty
string to simply enable debug (i.e., if the options file
location is not specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dev [entries] (OSGi) <br>
Turn on dev mode. If given, [entries] should be a
comma-separated class path entries which are added to the
class path of each plug-in or a URL to a Java properties
file <br>
containing custom classpath additions for a set of plug-ins.
For each plug-in requiring a customized dev time classpath
the file will contain an entry of the form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the property osgi.dev to [entries] or the empty string to
simply enable dev mode (i.e., if entries are not
specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-eclipse.keyring &lt;file
path&gt; (Equinox) <br>
Set to override location of the default secure storage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-eclipse.password &lt;file
path&gt; (Equinox) <br>
If specified, the secure storage treats contents of the file
as a default password. When not set, password providers are
used to obtain a password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-feature &lt;feature id&gt;
(Runtime) <br>
Set the identifier of the product being run. This controls
various branding information and what application is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the property eclipse.product to &lt;feature id&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-framework &lt;location&gt;
(Main) <br>
Set the URL location of the OSGi framework. Useful if the
Eclipse install is disjoint. See the On-line Help for
details (SEE ALSO below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the property osgi.framework to &lt;location&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-initialize (Main) <br>
Initializes the configuration being run. All runtime related
data structures and caches are refreshed. Any user/plug-in
defined configuration data is not purged. No appli&acirc;
<br>
cation is run, any product specifications are ignored and no
UI is presented (e.g., the splash screen is not drawn).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-install &lt;location&gt; (Main)
<br>
Set the install location of the platform. This option
indicates the location of the basic Eclipse plug-ins and is
useful if the Eclipse install is disjoint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the property osgi.install.area to &lt;location&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keyring &lt;location&gt;
(Runtime) <br>
The location of the authorization database on disk. This
argument has to be used together with the -password
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--launcher.library
&lt;location&gt; (Executable) <br>
The location of the eclipse executable&rsquo;s companion
shared library. If not specified the executable looks in the
plugins directory for the appropriate <br>
org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.[platform] fragment with the
highest version and uses the shared library named eclipse_*
inside.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--launcher.ini &lt;location&gt;
(Executable) <br>
The location of the product .ini file to use. If not
specified the executable will look for a file beside the
launcher with the same name and the extension .ini. (ie.,
<br>
/usr/bin/eclipse looks for eclipse.ini, /opt/product looks
for product.ini).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--launcher.suppressErrors
(Executable) <br>
If specified the executable will not display any error or
message dialogs. This is useful if the executable is being
used in an unattended situation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--launcher.XXMaxPermSize
&lt;value&gt; (Executable) <br>
If specified, and the executable detects that the VM being
used is a Sun VM, then the launcher will automatically add
the -XX:MaxPermSize=&lt;value&gt; vm argument. The
exe&acirc; <br>
cutable is not capable of detecting Sun VMs on all
platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-name &lt;string&gt; <br>
The name to be displayed in task bar item when the
application starts up. When not set, the name is the name of
the executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nl &lt;locale&gt; (OSGi) <br>
The name of the locale on which Eclipse platform will run.
NL values should follow the standard Java locale naming
conventions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the property osgi.nl to &lt;locale&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noExit (OSGi) <br>
Disable automatic termination of the VM after the eclipse
application has ended. This is useful for examining the OSGi
framework after the eclipse application has ended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the property osgi.noShutdown to &quot;true&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noLazyRegistryCacheLoading
(Runtime) <br>
Deactivate the platform&rsquo;s plug-in registry cache
loading optimization. By default, configuration elements are
loaded from the registry cache (when available) only on
de&acirc; <br>
mand, reducing memory footprint. This option forces the
registry cache to be fully loaded at startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the property eclipse.noLazyRegistryCacheLoading to
&quot;true&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noRegistryCache (Runtime) <br>
The internal extension registry cache will neither be read
nor written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the property eclipse.noRegistryCache to
&quot;true&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noSplash (Executable, Main)
<br>
Controls whether or not the splash screen is shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-os &lt;operating system&gt;
(OSGi) <br>
The operating system value. The value should be one of the
Eclipse processor architecture names known to Eclipse (e.g.,
x86, sparc, ...).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the property osgi.os to &lt;operating system&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-password &lt;password&gt;
(Runtime) <br>
The password for the authorization database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pluginCustomization
&lt;location&gt; (Runtime) <br>
The file system location of a properties file containing
default settings for plug-in preferences. These default
settings override default settings specified in the
prima&acirc; <br>
ry feature. Relative paths are interpreted relative to the
current working directory for eclipse itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the property eclipse.pluginCustomization to
&lt;location&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-product &lt;id&gt; (OSGi) <br>
The identifier of the product being run. This controls
various branding information and what application is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the property eclipse.product to &lt;id&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-showSplash &lt;bitmap&gt;
(Executable, Main) <br>
Specifies the bitmap to use in the splash screen. If
specified, the launcher may be able to show the splash
screen before starting the Java VM. If not specified, Main
will <br>
find the bitmap using the osgi.splashLocation and
osgi.splashPath properties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-startup &lt;location&gt;
(Executable) <br>
The location of jar used to startup eclipse. The jar
referred to should have the Main-Class attribute set to
org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.Main. If this parameter is not
<br>
set, the executable will look in the plugins directory for
the org.eclipse.equinox.launcher bundle with the highest
version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-user &lt;location&gt; (OSGi)
<br>
Set the location of the user area. The user area contains
data (e.g., preferences) specific to the OS user and
independent of any Eclipse install, configuration or
in&acirc; <br>
stance. See the On-line Help for details (SEE ALSO
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the property osgi.user.area to &lt;location&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vm &lt;path to java vm&gt;
(Executable, Main) <br>
When passed to the Eclipse executable, this option is used
to locate the Java VM to use to run Eclipse. It should be
the full file system path to an appropriate: Java <br>
jre/bin directory, Java Executable, Java shared library
(libjvm.so), or a Java VM Execution Environment description
file. If not specified, the Eclipse executable uses a <br>
search algorithm to locate a suitable VM. In any event, the
executable then passes the path to the actual VM used to
Java Main using the -vm argument. Java Main then <br>
stores this value in eclipse.vm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vmargs [vmargs*] (Executable,
Main) <br>
when passed to the Eclipse, this option is used to customize
the operation of the Java VM to use to run Eclipse. If
specified, this option must come at the end of the
com&acirc; <br>
mand line. Even if not specified on the executable command
line, the executable will automatically add the relevant
arguments (including the class being launched) to the <br>
command line passed into Java using the -vmargs argument.
Java Main then stores this value in eclipse.vmargs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ws &lt;window system&gt; (OSGi)
<br>
Set the window system value. The value should be one of the
Eclipse window system names known to Eclipse (e.g., win32,
motif, ...).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the property osgi.ws to &lt;window system&gt;.</p>
