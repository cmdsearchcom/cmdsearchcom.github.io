<p>SIRNA(1e) EMBOSS Manual for Debian SIRNA(1e)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sirna - Finds siRNA duplexes in mRNA</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sirna -sequence seqall [-poliii boolean] [-aa boolean] [-tt
boolean] [-polybase boolean] -outfile report -outseq
seqoutall [-context boolean]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sirna -help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
sirna is a command line program from EMBOSS (&acirc;the
European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite&acirc;). It
is part of the &quot;Nucleic:Functional sites,Nucleic:2D
structure&quot; command <br>
group(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Input section <br>
-sequence seqall</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sequence input options <br>
-poliii boolean <br>
This option allows you to select only the 21 base probes
that start with a purine and so can be expressed from Pol
III expression vectors. This is the NARN(17)YNN pattern <br>
that has been suggested by Tuschl et al. Default value:
N</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-aa boolean <br>
This option allows you to select only those 23 base regions
that start with AA. If this option is not selected then
regions that start with AA will be favoured by giving them
<br>
a higher score, but regions that do not start with AA will
also be reported. Default value: N</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tt boolean <br>
This option allows you to select only those 23 base regions
that end with TT. If this option is not selected then
regions that end with TT will be favoured by giving them a
<br>
higher score, but regions that do not end with TT will also
be reported. Default value: N</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-polybase boolean <br>
If this option is FALSE then only those 23 base regions that
have no repeat of 4 or more of any bases in a row will be
reported. No regions will ever be reported that have 4 <br>
or more G&rsquo;s in a row. Default value: Y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output section <br>
-outfile report <br>
The output is a table of the forward and reverse parts of
the 21 base siRNA duplex. Both the forward and reverse
sequences are written 5&rsquo; to 3&rsquo;, ready to be
ordered. The last <br>
two bases have been replaced by &rsquo;dTdT&rsquo;. The
starting position of the 23 base region and the %GC content
is also given. If you wish to see the complete 23 base
sequence, then <br>
either look at the sequence in the other output file, or use
the qualifier &rsquo;-context&rsquo; which will display the
23 bases of the forward sequence in this report with the
first <br>
two bases in brackets. These first two bases do not form
part of the siRNA probe to be ordered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-outseq seqoutall <br>
This is a file of the sequences of the 23 base regions that
the siRNAs are selected from. You may use it to do searches
of mRNA databases (e.g. REFSEQ) to confirm that the <br>
probes are unique to the gene you wish to use it on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-context boolean <br>
The output report file gives the sequences of the 21 base
siRNA regions ready to be ordered. This does not give you an
indication of the 2 bases before the 21 bases. It is <br>
often interesting to see which of the suggested possible
probe regions have an &rsquo;AA&rsquo; in front of them
(i.e. it is useful to see which of the 23 base regions start
with an <br>
&rsquo;AA&rsquo;). This option displays the whole 23 bases
of the region with the first two bases in brackets, e.g.
&rsquo;(AA)&rsquo; to give you some context for the probe
region. YOU SHOULD NOT <br>
INCLUDE THE TWO BASES IN BRACKETS WHEN YOU PLACE AN ORDER
FOR THE PROBES. Default value: N</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Bugs can be reported to the Debian Bug Tracking system
(http://bugs.debian.org/emboss), or directly to the EMBOSS
developers <br>

(http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=93650&amp;atid=605031).</p>
