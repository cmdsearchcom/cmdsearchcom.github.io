<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
adabrowse - Generate fully cross-referenced HTML rendering
of Ada 95 specs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
adabrowse [options] -f file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
adabrowse produces a fully cross-referenced HTML rendering
of Ada 95 specs (no bodies) similar to what javadoc does for
Java sources. adabrowse is a command-line utility; it has
<br>
no graphical user interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">adabrowse is highly configurable
through command-line options, style sheets, and
configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">adabrowse completely takes apart
the source code and produces a HTML documentation
containing: <br>
&Acirc;&middot; All context clauses <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Unit header <br>
&Acirc;&middot; If the unit is a package: <br>
&acirc; All exceptions (including renames) <br>
&acirc; All constants <br>
&acirc; All variables <br>
&acirc; A type index containing all types and their
primitive operations (the latter only for (tagged) record
types, private types, and types derived from those). The
primitive <br>
operations list is fully cross-referenced and ordered by
newly defined, overridden, and inherited operations. <br>
&acirc; Any other items</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
There are two ways to use adabrowse:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Call adabrowse for your spec:
adabrowse -f file (and any other options as needed, in
particular -I if the file is not in the current directory or
depends on other units whose <br>
sources are not in the current directory!) If no tree file
for the given unit exists, adabrowse will try to generate
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Generate the tree files for
the specs you want to process by calling gnatgcc -c -gnatc
-gnatt file (with the appropriate -I options, if
needed.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Call adabrowse for these
specs: adabrowse -f file (and any other options, as needed
[look in particular at -T!]).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">adabrowse generates HTML files
by default in the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">adabrowse doesn&rsquo;t care
whether the tree files have been produced from specs or
bodies: since the tree file of a body always also contains
the information on the spec, it can work <br>
with either.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h, -?, -help, --help <br>
Writes a comprehensive help text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, -all, --all <br>
Generate HTML not only for the unit given in the -f option,
but also for all application units on which it depends
semantically (transitive closure of &quot;with&quot;es and
parent <br>
units).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this option processes
only the application units in the transitive closure even if
the &quot;-g&quot; option is also given; it does not process
any &quot;with&quot;ed standard <br>
library unit. This also means that if the unit given is a
standard library unit, the &quot;-all&quot; option has no
effect. This behavior is intentional: you&rsquo;ll normally
generate <br>
HTML for the standard library once by processing all
standard library units explicitly, and you don&rsquo;t want
to re-generate HTML for these units each time one of your
appli&acirc; <br>
cation unit &quot;with&quot;es a standard library unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c file <br>
Defines a configuration file for the HTML generator.
Multiple -c options may be given; the files are processed in
the given order and may overwrite earlier config set&acirc;
<br>
tings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f file <br>
Gives the filename (*.ads) of the spec to process. This
filename may contain a path! See below for more comments.
Only one -f option may be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g If set, adabrowse also
generates cross-references to items from library units in
the standard and run-time packages, except for items from
the implict package &quot;Standard&quot;. <br>
Note: This can also be set by a configuration file key
&quot;Refs_To_Standard&quot;. The latter definition
wins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G output_formats... <br>
Specify the output formats adabrowse shall generate. The -G
option must be followed by one or more output format names,
given as separate arguments. Recognized output for&acirc;
<br>
mat names are html and xml (case insensitive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i [file] <br>
If set, adabrowse will generate a package index if it runs
in &quot;file input mode&quot; (see below) or the -all
option is set and the output does not go to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a filename is given, the
index is written to that file (or to stdout, if the filename
is &quot;-&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-is [file] <br>
Same as -i, but generates an index using indentation for
child units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Make adabrowse generate
cross-references in HTML output using only the line number.
This is what earlier versions of adabrowse (up to and
including V2.13) always did. As <br>
of V3.0, cross-references are constructed taking into
account both line and column number of an item. You should
use this option only if you have HTML documentation
gener&acirc; <br>
ated by earlier adabrowse versions and somehow cannot
re-generate that documentation. However, the recommended
usage is never to use this option and to regenerate possibly
<br>
already existing HTML documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that HTML generated with -l
is not compatible with HTML generated without -l! Also, HTML
generated by adabrowse 3.0 and beyond is compatible with
HTML generated by <br>
adabrowse 2.13 and earlier only if the -l option is
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usage of this option generates a
warning message on stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o [file] <br>
Define the output file name. If not set, the output goes to
a file with the name of the input and suffix .html. If file
specifies a directory (i.e., ends in a &quot; <br>
dows or a &quot;/&quot; on Unix), all generated HTML files
will be put into that directory. If the filename is
&quot;-&quot;, output is written to stdout. Only one -o
option may be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A dash as the filename
(&quot;-&quot;) is allowed only if there is exactly one
output format specified. If there are multiple output
formats specified (e.g. both XML and HTML), out&acirc; <br>
put is not allowed to go to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p [file] <br>
As -i, but generates a subprogram index over all units
processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-private, --private <br>
If given, adabrowse will also process the private parts of
packages and task or protected declarations. (By default, it
doesn&rsquo;t do so but replaces the private parts by a <br>
comment saying &quot;Implementation defined&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet mode: do not issue
warning or info messages. Synonym to -w0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s URL Defines the URL to the
style sheet the generated HTML file shall use. This URL
should be relative to the final place where you will put the
HTML files! Note that a -s <br>
option can be overwritten by a later -c option, if the
configuration file defines the key
&quot;Style_Sheet&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t [file] <br>
As -i, but generates a global type index over all units
processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version, --version <br>
Print version information of adabrowse to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wi Sets the warning level of
adabrowse. i may be one of the following: <br>
0, or e print only error messages. <br>
1, or w print warnings and errors. <br>
2, or i, or a print all messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x If set, adabrowse never
overwrites existing HTML files. (May be useful in
conjunction with the -a option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X name=value <br>
Define an environment variable name with value value. The
value supersedes any possibly already existing definition of
name in the system&rsquo;s environment for this call to <br>
adabrowse. The new definition affects any configuration file
processed subsequently and also the project file (if any).
The name must not contain white space; if value <br>
contains white space, quote the whole definition as in
-X&quot;user=John Doe&quot;. There may or may not be white
space between the -X and the variable definition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I directory <br>
Define source paths for ASIS. Same semantics as for GNAT.
Multiple -I options may be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T directory <br>
Define paths for ASIS to search for tree files (*.adt).
Multiple -T options may be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if you give a filename
to the -i option that starts with the letter &quot;s&quot;,
you must have a white space between the option and the
filename, otherwise it will be <br>
recognized as a -is option. Also, if the filename starts
with &quot;-&quot;, there mustn&rsquo;t be any whitespace
between the option and the filename, for if there is,
adabrowse will <br>
assume the filename to be the next option and handle it as
such (options all start with &quot;-&quot;), and not as a
filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same caveat also applies to
the -p option, if you want the subprogram index to go to a
file named &quot;rivate&quot;: there must be a blank,
otherwise, the whole thing will be <br>
recognized as the -private option. (Admittedly this is a
rather pathological case, but it&rsquo;s mentioned here for
completeness.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE -f OPTION <br>
The -f option has three different formats:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If the filename is
&quot;-&quot; or &quot;@-&quot;, adabrowse reads the unit
specs of the units to process from stdin, one unit per line,
until EOF is encountered. Empty lines are skipped. (If <br>
you try this interactively, you&rsquo;ll have to signal EOF
yourself. Otherwise, this may be useful if the input comes
from a pipe, like in &quot;ls -1 *.ads | adabrowse -f-
...&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If the filename starts with
&quot;@&quot;, adabrowse doesn&rsquo;t consider it a unit
spec, but as the name of a text file from which to read the
unit names, one unit per line. Empty lines <br>
in the file are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If neither applies, adabrowse
uses the given filename as the unit spec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first two cases are called
the &quot;file input mode&quot; of adabrowse. The file may
contain empty lines and comments (starting with the first
&quot;#&quot; on a line and extending up to the <br>
end of the line), which are ignored. Note that contrary to
configuration files, string handling for finding comment
starts is not done, and line continuations also are not <br>
allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In all three cases, a unit spec
is a filename that may contain a path; a possible suffix is
ignored. Note that a unit spec is a file name; in other
words, you give test-gen, or <br>
test-gen.ads, and not Test.Gen. The reason is simply that
for most shell scripting languages, it is easier to work
with filenames than to massage them into unit names (e.g. by
<br>
replacing dashes by dots). Also, if you have krunched file
names, there is no simple connection between the file name
and the unit name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a unit spec contains a path,
the HTML file for that unit is placed into that directory
unless overridden by a -o option. Note that if the unit spec
contains a path, you&rsquo;ll <br>
most probably also have to set a -T or -I option, unless you
do happen to have the ASIS information available directly
(i.e., a tree file for the unit in the current directory;
<br>
but that&rsquo;s not exactly typical).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In file input mode, the -o
option (if given at all) may either be &quot;-&quot; (in
which case all output goes to stdout) or specify a
directory, but must not specify a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">adabrowse assumes a GNAT-like
naming scheme for source and HTML files. It also assumes
that there is one library unit per file. As of V1.4,
adabrowse can handle krunched file <br>
names in the -f option, provided it can find a source file,
and it has the extension .ads. If so, adabrowse opens and
parses the source file to extract the unit name, instead of
<br>
deriving it directly from the file name. Note that generated
files always have names based on the unit name, not the
original file name: i.e., output file names will never be
<br>
krunched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generated HTML files always have
the suffix &quot;.html&quot; (not &quot;.htm&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INDEX GENERATION <br>
Index generation is active when adabrowse is told to process
several units, and the output does not go to stdout (when
the -o- option has been given).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several options
controlling index generation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i or -is Switches on generation
of a unit index. <br>
-p Switches on generation of a subprogram index. <br>
-t Switches on generation of a type index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All these options take an
optional filename as a parameter. If a filename follows, the
index will be written to that file (or to stdout, if the
filename happens to be &quot;-&quot;). If no <br>
filename is given, some default name is chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All these options are actually
maintained only for backwards compatibility reasons. As of
V4.0, indices are defined primarily through configuration
file entries, not on the com&acirc; <br>
mand line. In order not to break existing scripts using
command line options of earlier adabrowse versions, these
options are still available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">adabrowse assumes it will
process several units in the following cases: <br>
&Acirc;&middot; In file input mode (-f @file_name or -f-).
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; When using a project file (-P
project_file_name). <br>
&Acirc;&middot; When the -all option is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no filename is given, or it
doesn&rsquo;t contain a path, it depends upon the setting of
other options where the index will be placed: <br>
&Acirc;&middot; In file input mode, if a -o option is given,
it must specify a directory. All HTML files, including the
index, will be put into that directory. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; If no -o option is given, but the first unit
spec contains a path, the index is put into the directory
designated by that path. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; If not in file input mode, but the -all
option has been given, the -o option may specify a file
name. The index is put into the directory designated by the
path part of that <br>
file name (the current directory, if the filename
doesn&rsquo;t contain a path). <br>
&Acirc;&middot; If using a project file, the indices are
written into the ADABROWSE_OUTPUT directory. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Otherwise, this index is put in the current
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a filename containing a path
is given, the index will be placed into that file in the
given directory. If the filename contains only a path,
adabrowse will use that path and <br>
create an index named &quot;index.html&quot; in the
designated directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a -x option is given
(inhibiting overwriting of existing HTML files) and a file
exists already in the place where adabrowse wants to put the
index, no index will be generated <br>
and adabrowse will issue a warning. It&rsquo;ll also warn if
it cannot generate an index for any other reasons, but will
otherwise continue processing.</p>
