<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The following is the old c2ph.doc documentation by Tom
Christiansen &lt;tchrist@perl.com&gt; Date: 25 Jul 91
08:10:21 GMT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once upon a time, I wrote a
program called pstruct. It was a perl program that tried to
parse out C structures and display their member offsets for
you. This was especially <br>
useful for people looking at binary dumps or poking around
the kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pstruct was not a pretty
program. Neither was it particularly robust. The problem,
you see, was that the C compiler was much better at parsing
C than I could ever hope to be.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So I got smart: I decided to be
lazy and let the C compiler parse the C, which would spit
out debugger stabs for me to read. These were much easier to
parse. It&rsquo;s still not a <br>
pretty program, but at least it&rsquo;s more robust.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pstruct takes any .c or .h
files, or preferably .s ones, since that&rsquo;s the format
it is going to massage them into anyway, and spits out
listings like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct tty { <br>
int tty.t_locker 000 4 <br>
int tty.t_mutex_index 004 4 <br>
struct tty * tty.t_tp_virt 008 4 <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Actually, this was generated by
a particular set of options. You can control the formatting
of each column, whether you prefer wide or fat, hex or
decimal, leading zeroes or <br>
whatever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All you need to be able to use
this is a C compiler than generates BSD/GCC-style stabs. The
-g option on native BSD compilers and GCC should get this
for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To learn more, just type a bogus
option, like - <br>
If you&rsquo;re only a C programmer, than this is the end of
the message for you. You can quit right now, and if you care
to, save off the source and run it when you feel like it. Or
<br>
not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But if you&rsquo;re a perl
programmer, then for you I have something much more wondrous
than just a structure offset printer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You see, if you call pstruct by
its other incybernation, c2ph, you have a code generator
that translates C code into perl code! Well, structure and
union declarations at least, <br>
but that&rsquo;s quite a bit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prior to this point, anyone
programming in perl who wanted to interact with C programs,
like the kernel, was forced to guess the layouts of the C
structures, and then hardwire <br>
these into his program. Of course, when you took your
wonderfully crafted program to a system where the sgtty
structure was laid out differently, your program broke.
Which is a <br>
shame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We&rsquo;ve had Larry&rsquo;s
h2ph translator, which helped, but that only works on cpp
symbols, not real C, which was also very much needed. What I
offer you is a symbolic way of getting <br>
at all the C structures. I&rsquo;ve couched them in terms of
packages and functions. Consider the following program:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/local/bin/perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require
&rsquo;syscall.ph&rsquo;; <br>
require &rsquo;sys/time.ph&rsquo;; <br>
require &rsquo;sys/resource.ph&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ru = &quot; &quot; x
&amp;rusage&rsquo;sizeof();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syscall(&amp;SYS_getrusage,
&amp;RUSAGE_SELF, $ru) &amp;&amp; die &quot;getrusage:
$!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@ru = unpack($t =
&amp;rusage&rsquo;typedef(), $ru);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$utime = $ru[
&amp;rusage&rsquo;ru_utime + &amp;timeval&rsquo;tv_sec ]
<br>
+ ($ru[ &amp;rusage&rsquo;ru_utime +
&amp;timeval&rsquo;tv_usec ]) / 1e6;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$stime = $ru[
&amp;rusage&rsquo;ru_stime + &amp;timeval&rsquo;tv_sec ]
<br>
+ ($ru[ &amp;rusage&rsquo;ru_stime +
&amp;timeval&rsquo;tv_usec ]) / 1e6;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf &quot;you have used
%8.3fs+%8.3fu seconds.0, $utime, $stime;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As you see, the name of the
package is the name of the structure. Regular fields are
just their own names. Plus the following accessor functions
are provided for your <br>
convenience:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct This takes no arguments,
and is merely the number of first-level <br>
elements in the structure. You would use this for indexing
<br>
into arrays of structures, perhaps like this</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$usec = $u[
&amp;user&rsquo;u_utimer <br>
+ (&amp;ITIMER_VIRTUAL * &amp;itimerval&rsquo;struct) <br>
+ &amp;itimerval&rsquo;it_value <br>
+ &amp;timeval&rsquo;tv_usec <br>
];</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sizeof Returns the bytes in the
structure, or the member if <br>
you pass it an argument, such as</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;rusage&rsquo;sizeof(&amp;rusage&rsquo;ru_utime)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typedef This is the perl format
definition for passing to pack and <br>
unpack. If you ask for the typedef of a nothing, you get
<br>
the whole structure, otherwise you get that of the member
<br>
you ask for. Padding is taken care of, as is the magic to
<br>
guarantee that a union is unpacked into all its aliases.
<br>
Bitfields are not quite yet supported however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">offsetof This function is the
byte offset into the array of that <br>
member. You may wish to use this for indexing directly <br>
into the packed structure with vec() if you&rsquo;re too
lazy <br>
to unpack it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typeof Not to be confused with
the typedef accessor function, this <br>
one returns the C type of that field. This would allow <br>
you to print out a nice structured pretty print of some <br>
structure without knoning anything about it beforehand. <br>
No args to this one is a noop. Someday I&rsquo;ll post such
<br>
a thing to dump out your u structure for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The way I see this being used is
like basically this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% h2ph &lt;some_include_file.h
&gt; /usr/lib/perl/tmp.ph <br>
% c2ph some_include_file.h &gt;&gt; /usr/lib/perl/tmp.ph
<br>
% install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s a little tricker with
c2ph because you have to get the includes right. I
can&rsquo;t know this for your system, but it&rsquo;s not
usually too terribly difficult.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The code isn&rsquo;t pretty as I
mentioned -- I never thought it would be a 1000- line
program when I started, or I might not have begun. :-) But I
would have been less cavalier in <br>
how the parts of the program communicated with each other,
etc. It might also have helped if I didn&rsquo;t have to
divine the makeup of the stabs on the fly, and then account
for <br>
micro differences between my compiler and gcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anyway, here it is. Should run
on perl v4 or greater. Maybe less.</p>
