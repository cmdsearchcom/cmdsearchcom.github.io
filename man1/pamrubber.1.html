<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pamrubber - a rubber-sheeting utility that stretches an
image based on control points</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pamrubber {-tri | -quad} [-linear] [-frame] [-randomseed=N]
cp1x cp1y [cp2x cp2y [cp3x cp3y [cp4x cp4y]]] cp1x cp1y
[cp2x cp2y [cp3x cp3y [cp4x cp4y]]] [filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimum unique abbreviation of
options is acceptable. You may use double hyphens instead of
single hyphen to denote options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pamrubber utility converts a
pam image into a new image with the contents moved around.
The transformation is often called &rsquo;rubber
sheeting&rsquo;: you identify control points <br>
(CP) on the source image and specify new positions for those
points in the new image. pamrubber moves all the pixels
around, stretching and compressing as necessary, as if the
<br>
original image were on a sheet of rubber and you pulled on
the sheet to make the control points move to their new
locations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The new image has the same
dimensions and format as the original.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The transformation can happen in
two very different ways, called &rsquo;quad&rsquo; and
&rsquo;tri.&rsquo; With the former, you must specify four
control points (for both source and target). These are <br>
the corners of two quadrilaterals that will act as the
coordinate system for both source and target images.
Consider them as non-orthogonal (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) and
(1,1) points. <br>
This transformation comes close to the one pamperspective
does, however that program does other corrections as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you specify less than four
control points, the program adds control points in the
following way. With three control points, pamrubber chooses
the fourth one such that the <br>
four points form a parallelogram. With two points, pamrubber
considers them the opposite corners of a rectangle. When you
specify only one control point, pamrubber uses a rec&acirc;
<br>
tangle from the top left corner of the image to the single
control point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In &rsquo;tri&rsquo; mode,
pamrubber conceptually cuts up the source and target image
into triangles. It Transforms within each corresponding pair
of triangles in a stretching fashion. <br>
It&rsquo;s like pulling on the three corners of the
triangle. In this mode, each pixel in the source image gets
mapped to a position in the target image. No pixels are
lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When, in &rsquo;tri&rsquo; mode,
you specify only a single control point in the source and
target image, pamrubber creates four triangles from this
point to the four corners of the image. <br>
With two points, the program creates six triangles from the
two endpoints of the line connecting the two points, again
to the four corners of the image. Three control points is
<br>
in a way the core of this utility in &rsquo;tri&rsquo; mode.
Between the three edges of the central triangle and the four
edges of the image, pamrubber constructs another seven
triangles. <br>
Four control points define two central connected triangles.
In total this results in cutting the source and target image
up into ten triangles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case clearly a picture
says more than a thousand words. There is a graphical
illustration of these various modes at <br>
www.schaik.com/netpbm/rubber
&acirc;&uml;http://www.schaik.com/netpbm/rubber&acirc;&copy;
. An example of how to use this type of rubber sheeting in
cartography is in the article <br>
Visualizing the Landscape of Old-Time Tokyo
&acirc;&uml;http://www.isprs.org/proceedings/XXXVI/5-W1/papers/21.pdf&acirc;&copy;
.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS <br>
The parameters are control points (cp) in pairs of x and y.
The source and target image must have the same number of
control points. The minimum number of values specified here
<br>
is 4 for a single control point in the source and target
image. The maximum is 16 for four control points in each
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename is the name of the
input file. If you don&rsquo;t specify this, pamrubber reads
the image from Standard Input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
&lt;dl compact=&quot;compact&quot;&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tri | -quad</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This selects the type of rubber
sheeting done. You must specify exactly one of these
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-linear</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This determines whether
pamrubber uses nearest neighbor interpolation or bilinear
interpolation of four source pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-frame</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option causes pamrubber to
overlay the target image with the edges of the
quadrilaterals, respectively the triangles used for the
rubber sheeting. To get the same <br>
overlay for the source image, use a pamrubber transformation
with identical control points for source and target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-randomseed=N</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamrubber randomizes some of its
output. So that you can produce repeatable results, you can
choose the seed of the random number generator with this
option. If you use <br>
the same input image and the same random number generator
seed, you should always get the exact same output. By
default, pamrubber uses the time of day as the seed, so <br>
you get slightly different output when you run the program
twice on the same input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 10.61 (December
2012), this was called -randseed, and that still works.</p>
