<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
idlj - The IDL-to-Java Compiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idlj generates Java bindings
from a given IDL file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Synopsis <br>
idlj [ options ] idl-file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where idl-file is the name of a
file containing Interface Definition Language (IDL)
definitions. Options may appear in any order, but must
precede the idl-file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description <br>
The IDL-to-Java Compiler generates the Java bindings for a
given IDL file. For binding details, see the OMG IDL to Java
Language Language Mapping Specification. Some previous <br>
releases of the IDL-to-Java compiler were named
idltojava.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Emitting Client and Server
Bindings <br>
To generate Java bindings for an IDL file named My.idl: idlj
My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This generates the client-side
bindings and is equivalent to: idlj -fclient My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The client-side bindings do not
include the server-side skeleton. If you want to generate
the server-side bindings for the interfaces: idlj -fserver
My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Server-side bindings include the
client-side bindings plus the skeleton, all of which are POA
(that is, Inheritance Model) classes. If you want to
generate both client and <br>
server-side bindings, use one of the following (equivalent)
commands: idlj -fclient -fserver My.idl <br>
idlj -fall My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two possible
server-side models: the Inheritance Model and the Tie
Delegation Model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default server-side model is
the Portable Servant Inheritance Model. Given an interface
My defined in My.idl, the file MyPOA.java is generated. You
must provide the imple&acirc; <br>
mentation for My and it must inherit from MyPOA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MyPOA.java is a stream-based
skeleton that extends org.omg.PortableServer.Servant and
implements the InvokeHandler interface and the operations
interface associated with the <br>
IDL interface the skeleton implements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PortableServer module for
the Portable Object Adapter (POA) defines the native Servant
type. In the Java programming language, the Servant type is
mapped to the Java <br>
org.omg.PortableServer.Servant class. It serves as the base
class for all POA servant implementations and provides a
number of methods that may be invoked by the application
<br>
programmer, as well as methods which are invoked by the POA
itself and may be overridden by the user to control aspects
of servant behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another option for the
Inheritance Model is to use the -oldImplBase flag in order
to generate server-side bindings that are compatible with
versions of the Java programming <br>
language prior to J2SE 1.4. Note that using the -oldImplBase
flag is non-standard: these APIs are being deprecated. You
would use this flag ONLY for compatibility with exist&acirc;
<br>
ing servers written in J2SE 1.3. In that case, you would
need to modify an existing MAKEFILE to add the -oldImplBase
flag to the idlj compiler, otherwise POA-based server-side
<br>
mappings will be generated. To generate server-side bindings
that are backwards compatible:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idlj -fclient -fserver
-oldImplBase My.idl <br>
idlj -fall -oldImplBase My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Given an interface My defined in
My.idl, the file _MyImplBase.java is generated. You must
provide the implementation for My and it must inherit from
_MyImplBase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other server-side model is
called the Tie Model. This is a delegation model. Because it
is not possible to generate ties and skeletons at the same
time, they must be gen&acirc; <br>
erated separately. The following commands generate the
bindings for the Tie Model:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idlj -fall My.idl <br>
idlj -fallTIE My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the interface My, the second
command generates MyPOATie.java. The constructor to MyPOATie
takes a delegate. In this example, using the default POA
model, the constructor <br>
also needs a poa. You must provide the implementation for
delegate, but it does not have to inherit from any other
class, only the interface MyOperations. But to use it with
<br>
the ORB, you must wrap your implementation within MyPOATie.
For instance: <br>
ORB orb = ORB.init(args, System.getProperties());</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">// Get reference to rootpoa
&amp; activate the POAManager <br>
POA rootpoa =
(POA)orb.resolve_initial_references(&quot;RootPOA&quot;);
<br>
rootpoa.the_POAManager().activate();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">// create servant and register
it with the ORB <br>
MyServant myDelegate = new MyServant(); <br>
myDelegate.setORB(orb);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">// create a tie, with servant
being the delegate. <br>
MyPOATie tie = new MyPOATie(myDelegate, rootpoa);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">// obtain the objectRef for the
tie <br>
My ref = tie._this(orb);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You might want to use the Tie
model instead of the typical Inheritance model if your
implementation must inherit from some other implementation.
Java allows any number of <br>
interface inheritance, but there is only one slot for class
inheritance. If you use the inheritance model, that slot is
used up . By using the Tie Model, that slot is freed up <br>
for your own use. The drawback is that it introduces a level
of indirection: one extra method call occurs when invoking a
method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To generate server-side, Tie
model bindings that are compatible with versions of the IDL
to Java language mapping in versions prior to J2SE 1.4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idlj -oldImplBase -fall My.idl
<br>
idlj -oldImplBase -fallTIE My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the interface My, this will
generate My_Tie.java. The constructor to My_Tie takes a
impl. You must provide the implementation for impl, but it
does not have to inherit <br>
from any other class, only the interface HelloOperations.
But to use it with the ORB, you must wrap your
implementation within My_Tie. For instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ORB orb = ORB.init(args,
System.getProperties());</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">// create servant and register
it with the ORB <br>
MyServant myDelegate = new MyServant(); <br>
myDelegate.setORB(orb);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">// create a tie, with servant
being the delegate. <br>
MyPOATie tie = new MyPOATie(myDelegate);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">// obtain the objectRef for the
tie <br>
My ref = tie._this(orb);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying Alternate Locations
for Emitted Files <br>
If you want to direct the emitted files to a directory other
than the current directory, invoke the compiler as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idlj -td /altdir My.idl <br>
For the interface My, the bindings will be emitted to
/altdir/My.java, etc., instead of ./My.java.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying Alternate Locations
for Include Files <br>
If My.idl included another idl file, MyOther.idl, the
compiler assumes that MyOther.idl resides in the local
directory. If it resides in /includes, for example, then you
would <br>
invoke the compiler with the following command: idlj -i
/includes My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If My.idl also included
Another.idl that resided in /moreIncludes, for example, then
you would invoke the compiler with the following command:
idlj -i /includes -i /moreIn&acirc; <br>
cludes My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since this form of include can
become irritatingly long, another means of indicating to the
compiler where to search for included files is provided.
This technique is similar <br>
to the idea of an environment variable. Create a file named
idl.config in a directory that is listed in your CLASSPATH.
Inside of idl.config, provide a line with the following <br>
form: includes=/includes;/moreIncludes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler will find this file
and read in the includes list. Note that in this example the
separator character between the two directories is a
semicolon (;). This separa&acirc; <br>
tor character is platform dependent. On the Windows
platform, use a semicolon, on the Unix platform, use a
colon, etc. For more information on includes, read the
CLASS&acirc; <br>
PATH (Solaris) or CLASSPATH (Windows) documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Emitting Bindings for Include
Files <br>
By default, only those interfaces, structs, etc, that are
defined in the idl file on the command line have Java
bindings generated for them. The types defined in included
<br>
files are not generated. For example, assume the following
two idl files: My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#include &lt;MyOther.idl&gt;
<br>
interface My <br>
{ <br>
}; <br>
MyOther.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interface MyOther <br>
{ <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following command will only
generate the java bindings for My: idlj My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To generate all of the types in
My.idl and all of the types in the files that My.idl
includes (in this example, MyOther.idl), use the following
command: idlj -emitAll My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a caveat to the default
rule. #include statements which appear at global scope are
treated as described. These #include statements can be
thought of as import state&acirc; <br>
ments. #include statements which appear within some
enclosing scope are treated as true #include statements,
meaning that the code within the included file is treated as
if it <br>
appeared in the original file and, therefore, Java bindings
are emitted for it. Here is an example: My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#include &lt;MyOther.idl&gt;
<br>
interface My <br>
{ <br>
#include &lt;Embedded.idl&gt; <br>
}; MyOther.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interface MyOther <br>
{ <br>
}; Embedded.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enum E {one, two, three};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running the following command:
idlj My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will generate the following list
of Java files: ./MyHolder.java <br>
./MyHelper.java <br>
./_MyStub.java <br>
./MyPackage <br>
./MyPackage/EHolder.java <br>
./MyPackage/EHelper.java <br>
./MyPackage/E.java <br>
./My.java</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice that MyOther.java was not
generated because it is defined in an import-like #include.
But E.java was generated because it was defined in a true
#include. Also notice <br>
that since Embedded.idl was included within the scope of the
interface My, it appears within the scope of My (that is,in
MyPackage).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -emitAll flag had been
used in the previous example, then all types in all included
files would be emitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inserting Package Prefixes <br>
Suppose that you work for a company named ABC that has
constructed the following IDL file: <br>
Widgets.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">module Widgets <br>
{ <br>
interface W1 {...}; <br>
interface W2 {...}; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running this file through the
IDL-to-Java compiler will place the Java bindings for W1 and
W2 within the package Widgets. But there is an industry
convention that states that <br>
a company&rsquo;s packages should reside within a package
named com.&lt;company name&gt;. The Widgets package is not
good enough. To follow convention, it should be
com.abc.Widgets. To <br>
place this package prefix onto the Widgets module, execute
the following: idlj -pkgPrefix Widgets com.abc
Widgets.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have an IDL file which
includes Widgets.idl, the -pkgPrefix flag must appear in
that command also. If it does not, then your IDL file will
be looking for a Widgets <br>
package rather than a com.abc.Widgets package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have a number of these
packages that require prefixes, it might be easier to place
them into the idl.config file described above. Each package
prefix line should be of <br>
the form:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">PkgPrefix.&lt;type&gt;=&lt;prefix&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So the line for the above
example would be: PkgPrefix.Widgets=com.abc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of this option does not
affect the Repository ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defining Symbols Before
Compilation <br>
You may need to define a symbol for compilation that is not
defined within the IDL file, perhaps to include debugging
code in the bindings. The command idlj -d MYDEF My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is the equivalent of putting the
line #define MYDEF inside My.idl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Preserving Pre-Existing Bindings
<br>
If the Java binding files already exist, the -keep flag will
keep the compiler from overwriting them. The default is to
generate all files without considering if they already <br>
exist. If you&rsquo;ve customized those files (which you
should not do unless you are very comfortable with their
contents), then the -keep option is very useful. The command
idlj <br>
-keep My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">emit all client-side bindings
that do not already exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Viewing Progress of Compilation
<br>
The IDL-to-Java compiler will generate status messages as it
progresses through its phases of execution. Use the -v
option to activate this &quot;verbose&quot; mode: idlj -v
My.idl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default the compiler does not
operate in verbose mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Displaying Version Information
<br>
To display the build version of the IDL-to-Java compiler,
specify the -version option on the command-line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idlj -version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version information also appears
within the bindings generated by the compiler. Any
additional options appearing on the command-line are
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
-d symbol <br>
This is equivalent to the following line in an IDL file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define symbol</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-emitAll <br>
Emit all types, including those found in #include files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fside <br>
Defines what bindings to emit. side is one of client,
server, serverTIE, all, or allTIE. The -fserverTIE and
-fallTIE options cause delegate model skeletons to be
emitted. <br>
Assumes -fclient if the flag is not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i include-path <br>
By default, the current directory is scanned for included
files. This option adds another directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keep <br>
If a file to be generated already exists, do not overwrite
it. By default it is overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noWarn <br>
Suppresses warning messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-oldImplBase <br>
Generates skeletons compatible with pre-1.4 JDK ORBs. By
default, the POA Inheritance Model server-side bindings are
generated. This option provides backward-compatibility <br>
with older versions of the Java programming language by
generating server-side bindings that are ImplBase
Inheritance Model classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pkgPrefix type prefix <br>
Wherever type is encountered at file scope, prefix the
generated Java package name with prefix for all files
generated for that type. The type is the simple name of
either <br>
a top-level module, or an IDL type defined outside of any
module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pkgTranslate type package <br>
Whenever the module name type is encountered in an
identifier, replace it in the identifier with package for
all files in the generated Java package. Note that pkgPrefix
<br>
changes are made first. type is the simple name of either a
top-level module, or an IDL type defined outside of any
module, and must match the full package name exactly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If more than one translation
matches an identifier, the longest match is chosen. For
example, if the arguments include: <br>
-pkgTranslate foo bar -pkgTranslate foo.baz buzz.fizz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following translations would
occur: <br>
foo =&gt; bar <br>
foo.boo =&gt; bar.boo <br>
foo.baz =&gt; buzz.fizz <br>
foo.baz.bar =&gt; buzz.fizz.bar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following package names
cannot be translated:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o org.omg or any subpackages of
org.omg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any attempt to translate these
packages will result in uncompilable code, and the use of
these packages as the first argument after -pkgTranslate
will be treated as an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-skeletonName xxx%yyy <br>
Use xxx%yyy as the pattern for naming the skeleton. The
defaults are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o %POA for the POA base class
(-fserver or -fall)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o _%ImplBase for the oldImplBase
class (-oldImplBase and (-fserver or -fall))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-td dir <br>
Use dir for the output directory instead of the current
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tieName xxx%yyy <br>
Name the tie according to the pattern. The defaults are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o %POATie for the POA tie base
class (-fserverTie or -fallTie)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o %_Tie for the oldImplBase tie
class (-oldImplBase and (-fserverTie or -fallTie))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nowarn, -verbose <br>
Verbose mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Display version information and terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the Description section for
more option information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Restrictions: <br>
o Escaped identifiers in the global scope may not have the
same spelling as IDL primitive types, Object, or ValueBase.
This is because the symbol table is pre-loaded with <br>
these identifiers; allowing them to be redefined would
overwrite their original definitions. (Possible permanent
restriction).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The fixed IDL type is not
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known Problems: <br>
o No import generated for global identifiers. If you invoke
on an unexported local impl, you do get an exception, but it
seems to be due to a NullPointerException in the <br>
ServerDelegate DSI code.</p>
