<p>TRS(1) Linux User&rsquo;s Manual TRS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
trs - filter replacing strings</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
trs [-[r]e] &rsquo;REPLACE_THIS WITH_THAT [AND_THIS
WITH_THAT]...&rsquo; <br>
trs [-[r]f] FILE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Copy stdin to stdout replacing every occurrence of given
strings with other ones. This is similar to tr(1), but
replaces strings, not only single chars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rules (separated by whitespace)
can be given directly after -e option, or can be read from
FILE. Argument not preceded by -e or -f is guessed to be a
script when it contains <br>
some whitespace, or a filename otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comments are allowed from #
until the end of line. The character # in strings must be
specified as\ 0n are recognized. In <br>
Standard C-like escapes \ addition, means a space character
and means an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets of acceptable characters at
a given position can be specified between and ]. ASCII
ranges in sets can be shortly written as FIRST-LAST. When a
set consists of only a <br>
single range, and ] can be omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a part of the string to
translate is enclosed in ..., only that part is replaced.
Any text outside ... serves as an assertion: a string is
translated only if it is <br>
preceded by the given text and followed by another one. at
the beginning or at the end of the string can be omitted.
Text outside ... is treated as untranslated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before the beginning of the file
and after its end there are only 0s. Thus, for example,
.matches . on a line by itself, including the first line,
and the last one <br>
even without the marker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A fragment of the form fragment
in the source text causes the given rule to be considered
only if that variable has such value. Initially all
variables have the value of 0. Several assignments or <br>
conditions can be present in one rule - they are ANDed
together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-e Give the translation rules directly in the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Get them from the file
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Reverse every rule. This
affects only the next -e or -f option. Of course this
doesn&rsquo;t have to give the reverse translation! Any rule
containing any of &minus; is <br>
taken in only one direction. You may force any rule to be
taken in only one direction by enclosing the string to
translate in ....</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help display help and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
output version information and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple -e or -f options are
allowed. All rules are loaded together then, and earlier
ones have precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
$ echo Leeloo |trs -e &rsquo;el n e i i aqq ox o u&rsquo;
<br>
Linux</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIFFERENCES FROM sed <br>
The main difference between trs and sed &rsquo;s///g;
...&rsquo; (excluding sed&rsquo;s regular expressions) is
that sed takes every rule in the order specified and applies
it to the whole line of <br>
translated file, whereas trs examines every position and
tries all rules in this place first. In sed every next rule
is fed with the text produced by the previous one, whereas
in <br>
trs every piece of text can be translated at most once (if
more than one rule matches at a given position, the one
mentioned earlier wins). That&rsquo;s why sed isn&rsquo;t
well suited for <br>
translating between character sets. On the other hand, tr
translates only single bytes, so it can&rsquo;t be used for
Unicode conversions, or TeX / SGML ways for specifying
extended <br>
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another example: <br>
$ echo 642 |trs -e &rsquo;4 7 72 66 64 4&rsquo; <br>
42 <br>
$ echo 642 |sed &rsquo;s/4/7/g; s/72/66/g; s/64/4/g&rsquo;
<br>
666</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The string to replace can be
empty; there must be something outside then. In this special
case only one such create-from-nothing rule can success at a
given position. For <br>
example, 0&minus; @ precedes every character with high byte
set with @. The rule of the form some thing doesn&rsquo;t
work at the end of a file.</p>
