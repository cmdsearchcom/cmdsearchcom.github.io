<b>trs</b> [<b>-</b>[<b>r</b>]<b>f</b>] <i>FILE</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Copy stdin to stdout replacing every occurrence of given strings with other
  ones. This is similar to <b>tr</b>(1), but replaces strings, not only single
  chars.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Rules (separated by whitespace) can be given directly after <b>-e</b> option, or
  can be read from <i>FILE</i>. Argument not preceded by <b>-e</b> or <b>-f</b>
  is guessed to be a script when it contains some whitespace, or a filename
  otherwise.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Comments are allowed from <b>#</b> until the end of line. The character <b>#</b>
  in strings must be specified as <b>\\#</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Standard C-like escapes <b>\a \b \e \f \n \r \t \v \\</b> <b>\\</b><i>nnn</i>
  are recognized. In addition, <b>\s</b> means a space character and <b>\!</b>
  means an empty string.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sets of acceptable characters at a given position can be specified between
  <b>\[</b> and <b>\]</b>. ASCII ranges in sets can be shortly written as
  <i>FIRST</i><b>-</b><i>LAST.</i> When a set consists of only a single range,
  <b>\[</b> and <b>\]</b> can be omitted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a part of the string to translate is enclosed in <b>\\{</b>...<b>\\}</b>,
  only that part is replaced. Any text outside <b>\\{</b>...<b>\\}</b> serves as
  an assertion: a string is translated only if it is preceded by the given text
  and followed by another one. <b>\{</b> at the beginning or <b>\}</b> at the
  end of the string can be omitted. Text outside <b>\\{</b>...<b>\\}</b> is
  treated as untranslated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before the beginning of the file and after its end there are only <b>\\n</b>'s.
  Thus, for example, <b>\n\{.\}\n</b> matches <b>.</b> on a line by itself,
  including the first line, and the last one even without the <b>\n</b> marker.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A fragment of the form <b>\\?</b><i>x</i><b>=</b><i>N,</i> where <i>x</i> is a
  letter <b>A</b>-<b>Za</b>-<b>z</b> and <i>N</i> is a digit <b>0</b>-<b>9</b>,
  contained in the target text sets the variable <i>x</i> to the value <i>N</i>
  when that rule succeeds. Similar fragment in the source text causes the given
  rule to be considered only if that variable has such value. Initially all
  variables have the value of <b>0</b>. Several assignments or conditions can be
  present in one rule - they are ANDed together.

      translation! Any rule containing any of <b>\{\}\[\]\{\}\-</b> is taken in
      only one direction. You may force any rule to be taken in only one
      direction by enclosing the string to translate in
    <b>\\{</b>...<b>\\}</b>.</dd>

<div class="Pp"></div>
Multiple <b>-e</b> or <b>-f</b> options are allowed. All rules are loaded
  together then, and earlier ones have precedence.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLE"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLE">EXAMPLE</a></h1>
<pre>
$ echo Leeloo |trs -e 'el n e i i aqq o\}\n x o u'
Linux
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DIFFERENCES_FROM_sed"><a class="selflink" href="#DIFFERENCES_FROM_sed">DIFFERENCES
  FROM sed</a></h1>
The main difference between <b>trs</b> and <b>sed 's///g;</b> ...<b>'</b>
  (excluding sed's regular expressions) is that sed takes every rule in the
  order specified and applies it to the whole line of translated file, whereas
  trs examines every position and tries all rules in this place first. In sed
  every next rule is fed with the text produced by the previous one, whereas in
  trs every piece of text can be translated at most once (if more than one rule
  matches at a given position, the one mentioned earlier wins). That's why sed
  isn't well suited for translating between character sets. On the other hand,
  tr translates only single bytes, so it can't be used for Unicode conversions,
  or TeX / SGML ways for specifying extended characters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another example:
<pre>
$ echo 642 |trs -e '4 7 72 66 64 4'
42
$ echo 642 |sed 's/4/7/g; s/72/66/g; s/64/4/g'
666
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The string to replace can be empty; there must be something outside <b>\{\}</b>
  then. In this special case only one such create-from-nothing rule can success
  at a given position. For example, <b>\}\x80\-\xFF @</b> precedes every
  character with high byte set with <b>@</b>. The rule of the form <b>some\{
  thing</b> doesn't work at the end of a file.

<b>tr</b>(1), <b>konwert</b>(1)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COPYRIGHT"><a class="selflink" href="#COPYRIGHT">COPYRIGHT</a></h1>
trs is a filter replacing strings. It forms part of the konwert package.
