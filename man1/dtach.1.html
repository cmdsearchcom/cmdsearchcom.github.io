<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dtach - simple program that emulates the detach feature of
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dtach -a &lt;socket&gt; &lt;options&gt; <br>
dtach -A &lt;socket&gt; &lt;options&gt; &lt;command...&gt;
<br>
dtach -c &lt;socket&gt; &lt;options&gt; &lt;command...&gt;
<br>
dtach -n &lt;socket&gt; &lt;options&gt; &lt;command...&gt;
<br>
dtach -N &lt;socket&gt; &lt;options&gt; &lt;command...&gt;
<br>
dtach -p &lt;socket&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dtach is a program that emulates the detach feature of
screen. It is designed to be transparent and un-intrusive;
it avoids interpreting the input and output between attached
<br>
terminals and the program under its control. Consequently,
it works best with full-screen applications such as
emacs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dtach is intended for users who
want the detach feature of screen without the other overhead
of screen. It is tiny, does not use many libraries, and
stays out of the way as much <br>
as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SESSIONS <br>
A session in dtach is a single instance in which a program
is running under the control of dtach. The program is
disassociated from the original terminal, and is thus
protected <br>
from your original terminal being disconnected for some
reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other instances of dtach can
attach themselves to a particular session. Input and output
is copied between the program running in the dtach session,
and the attached terminals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dtach avoids interpreting the
communication stream between the program and the attached
terminals; it instead relies on the ability of the attached
terminals to manage the <br>
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sessions are represented by
Unix-domain sockets in the filesystem. No other permission
checking other than the filesystem access checks is
performed. dtach creates a master <br>
process that monitors the session socket, the program, and
any attached terminals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODES <br>
dtach has several modes of operation. It can create a new
session in which a program is executed, or it can attach to
an existing session. The first argument specifies which mode
<br>
dtach should operate in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Attach to an existing
session. dtach attaches itself to the session specified by
&lt;socket&gt;. After the attach is completed, the window
size of the current terminal is sent <br>
to the master process, and a redraw is also requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Attach to an existing
session, or create a new one. dtach first tries to attach to
the session specified by &lt;socket&gt; if possible. If the
attempt to open the socket fails, <br>
dtach tries to create a new session before attaching to
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Creates a new session. A new
session is created in which the specified program is
executed. dtach then tries to attach itself to the newly
created session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Creates a new session,
without attaching to it. A new session is created in which
the specified program is executed. dtach does not try to
attach to the newly created <br>
session, however, and exits instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Creates a new session,
without attaching to it or daemonizing. A new session is
created in which the specified program is executed. dtach
does not try to attach to the <br>
newly created session, however, and will stay in the
foreground until the program exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Copies the contents of
standard input to a session. dtach connects to the session
specified by &lt;socket&gt;, copies the contents of standard
input to the session, and then <br>
exits. dtach will not scan the input for a detach
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
dtach has a few options that allow you to modify its
behavior. Each attaching process can have separate settings
for these options, which allows for some flexibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e &lt;char&gt; <br>
Sets the detach character to &lt;char&gt;. When the detach
character is pressed, dtach detaches itself from the current
session and exits. The process running in the session is
<br>
unaffected by the detach. By default, the detach character
is set to ^&nbsp;(Ctrl-.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Disables the detach
character. dtach does not try to scan input from the
terminal for a detach character. The only way to detach from
the session is then by sending the <br>
attaching process an appropriate signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r &lt;method&gt; <br>
Sets the redraw method to &lt;method&gt;. The valid methods
are none, ctrl_l, or winch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none disables redrawing
completely, ctrl_l sends a Ctrl L character to the program
if the terminal is in character-at-a-time and no-echo mode,
and winch forces a WINCH <br>
signal to be sent to the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When creating a new session, the
specified method is used as the default redraw method for
the session. If not specified, the ctrl_l method is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Disables processing of the
suspend key. Normally, dtach will suspend itself when the
suspend key is pressed. With this option, the suspend
character is sent to the ses&acirc; <br>
sion instead of being handled by dtach.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following example creates a new session that has the
detach character and suspend processing disabled. A socket
is created in the /tmp directory for the session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ dtach -c /tmp/foozle -Ez
bash</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example attaches
to the /tmp/foozle session if it exists, and if not, creates
a new session using /tmp/foozle as the socket for the
session. Processing of the sus&acirc; <br>
pend character is also disabled for the attach instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ dtach -A /tmp/foozle -z
bash</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example attaches
to the /tmp/foozle session, using the winch redraw method to
redraw the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ dtach -a /tmp/foozle -r
winch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example creates a
new session and sets the default redraw method for the
session to the winch redraw method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ dtach -c /tmp/foozle -r winch
bash</p>
