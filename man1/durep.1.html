<p>DUREP(1) Disk Usage Report Generator DUREP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
durep - disk usage report generator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
durep [OPTIONS]... [DIRECTORY]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
durep creates disk usage reports with bar graphs, allowing
one to easily deduce which directories are using the most
space. Although durep can produce text output similar to du,
<br>
its real power lies in the ability to store reports in a
file, which can then be viewed as a web page with the
supplied cgi script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Options are grouped into three distinct sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text Output Options <br>
These options are for controlling the text report
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-td, --text-depth=N <br>
Limit text report on directories to depth N. No directories
below this level will be shown in the report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hs, --hide-size=N[bkmg] <br>
Do not display entries using N Bytes/KB/MB/GB or less
(default Bytes). This is to reduce clutter in the reports.
It allows you to remove small files from the text
report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sd, --show-date <br>
Display the modification date of the file or directory in
the report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ns, --nosort <br>
Do not sort results by size. Leaves results in the order in
which they were scanned, which is highly dependent on the
file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Do not produce text output. This stops the creation of a
text report, and is useful when you are only interested in
generating a save-file for use with the web report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File Options <br>
These options control load and save files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sf, --save-file=FILE <br>
Save the results of the scan into this file. This can be
loaded for a text report, but is generally used by the cgi
script to display web reports. The filename should end <br>
in .ds (it is appended if it does not).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lf, --load-file=FILE <br>
Load the results of a scan from this file. This takes the
place of scanning a directory. Inclusion options (described
below) will not take effect if this option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --desc=DESCRIPTION <br>
Give a description to be stored in the save-file. This is
displayed on the web report summary page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --collate==DIR <br>
Collate the save-files in the given directory. This creates
a durep.cds file, which is used by the cgi script to manage
and display save-files. See Web Reports section <br>
below for more detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inclusion Options <br>
These options control which directories and files should be
included in the report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --files <br>
Do not descend into sub-directories, only report files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --one-file-system <br>
Do not traverse file systems. This is similar to the -x
option for du, allowing easy checking of an entire file
system such as /.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cp, --collapse-path=PATTERN
<br>
Hide entries below paths that match PATTERN. This allows you
to conceal the contents of certain directories in the
report. You may wish perhaps to show home directories in
<br>
a report but not show their content in which case you could
use the option &quot;-cp &rsquo;/home&rsquo;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ep, --exclude-path=PATTERN <br>
Ignore paths that match PATTERN. This works in a similar
manner to &quot;-cp&quot; above, except it excludes the
directory from the scan itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cf, --coalesce-files==N[bkmg]
<br>
Coalesces entries for files below the given size into one
entry. This is useful for reducing clutter in reports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WEB REPORTS <br>
Since version 0.9, durep no longer directly generates html
files for its web reports. It now uses a cgi script that
reads data from save-files. The script will handle multiple
<br>
save-files, potentially from multiple hosts, so you can
consolidate your reports into one place. Copying save-files
from other hosts is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is necessary to collate the
save-files before viewing them via the cgi script. This
process creates the file &quot;durep.cds&quot; which
contains meta-data about all of the save-files. <br>
From this a summary page is shown where you can choose which
report you wish to view. The collation must be done any time
a save-file is added or overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The cgi-script has some
configurable variables at the top. These tell the script
where to look for the css file and the graphic used for the
bar graphs. There are also options to <br>
set whether the modification date, and/or the options used
to create the save-file should be shown. These are both set
to 1 by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As always, you should take care
when installing the cgi script. I&rsquo;ve done my best, but
I make no guarantees about its security. It would probably
be unwise to allow this script <br>
to be accessed from the Internet at large.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. durep -td 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This would print the directory
tree starting from the current directory to depth 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. durep -f /var/spool/mail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This might be useful for keeping
a check on the mail directory. The &quot;-f&quot; switch
tells durep to just scan files and not descend into
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. durep -x -cp
&quot;/(etc|usr/share)&quot; -ep &quot;/var&quot; -sf
/var/lib/durep/root.ds /</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This more complicated version
does the following. It scans the root file system only,
collapses the contents of any paths beginning /etc or
/usr/share and skips the contents <br>
of the /var directory. It saves the output of this report
into the file /var/lib/durep/root.ds. No text report is
produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. durep -lf
/var/lib/durep/root.ds -hs 1m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This reads the save-file
/var/lib/durep/root.ds and produces a text report from it,
hiding any files below 1 megabyte.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. durep -c /var/lib/durep</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This collates any save-files in
/var/lib/durep.</p>
