<p>GPM-ROOT(1) General Commands Manual GPM-ROOT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gpm-root - a default handler for gpm, used to draw menus on
the root window</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gpm-root [ options ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The program gpm-root is designed to handle Control-Mouse
events to draw menus on the background of the current tty.
The actual menus are described by a configuration file in
the <br>
user&rsquo;s home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that gpm-root needs
to run with Linux 1.1.73 or newer, because previous kernels
lack some screen handling capabilities required by the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program uses the files
/dev/vcs* to draw to the console screen. These are available
only from kernel 1.1.81 onward. If you miss those device
nodes, you should create them <br>
using create_vcs in the distribution directory. The tool
won&rsquo;t run with kernels older than 1.1.81, because they
lacked a full screen dump/restore capability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Available command line options
are the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m number <br>
Choose the modifier to use (by default: control). The
modifier can be provided either as a number or as a symbolic
string. Allowed strings are shift, anyAlt, leftAlt, <br>
rightAlt, control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Deny using user-specific
configuration files. With this option on, only
/etc/gpm-root.conf will be used as a source of configuration
information. This option is intended <br>
for those system administrators who fear security could be
broken by this daemon. Things should be sufficiently secure,
but if you find a hole please tell me about it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Do not automatically enter
background operation when started, and log messages to the
standard error stream, not the syslog mechanism. This is
useful for debugging; in <br>
previous releases it was done with a compile-time
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V verbosity increment <br>
Raise the maximum level of messages that will be logged.
Thus a positive argument has the effect of making the
program more verbose. One can also give a negative
argu&acirc; <br>
ment to hush the program; however, note that due to
getopt(3) rules a negative argument must follow the option
with no space betwixt (that is, -V-1 but not -V -1).
Pro&acirc; <br>
gram Arguments,,,libc. The argument is optional and its
default value is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each time a menu is drawn, the
configuration file is reparsed if it has changed. This
allows modification of personal setup without reinvoking the
daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actual configuration file is
better introduced by looking at your /etc/gpm-root.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syntax for the file
won&rsquo;t be described here, being it quite apparent from
the example above. Blanks and newlines are unused in parsing
the file, and the layout of the file is <br>
free. Comments are allowed in the file: any hash mark (#)
found at the beginning of the line or after white space
makes the parser discard anything up to the next line. To
insert <br>
quotes (&quot;) in strings precede them with a
backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that recursive menus are
allowed, to any level of recursion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keywords belong to three groups:
the button keyword, the cfg keywords and the action
keywords. They are all described in the table below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">button number menu <br>
The button keyword is used to introduce a menu. It is
followed by the number of the relevant button (1=left,
2=middle, 3=right), an open brace, a menu and a closed
brace. <br>
A menu is made up of cfg statements, followed by action
statements. Cfg statements can come in any order, while the
order of action statements tells the actual order in <br>
which actions will appear on the screen, top to bottom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following statements belong
to the cfg set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name string <br>
If the name keyword is present, the specified string will be
used as the name for the current menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">background color <br>
This statements is used to specify the background color to
be used in the current menu. The color can be specified with
one of the eight canonical strings black, red, cyan <br>
etc. The background defaults to black.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foreground color <br>
This statements is used to specify the foreground color for
menu items. Its value defaults to white. An optional bright
keyword can appear before the actual color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">border color <br>
border is used to specify the border color for the menu. Its
value defaults to white. An optional bright keyword can
appear before the actual color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">head color <br>
head is used to specify the foreground color for the title
of the menu. Its value defaults to white. An optional bright
keyword can appear before the actual color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following statements belong
to the action set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string f.fgcmd cmdstring <br>
When the mouse button is released above the corresponding
menu item, the cmdstring is pasted in the keyboard queue of
the current console. This is not yet implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string f.bgcmd cmdstring <br>
When the mouse button is released above the corresponding
menu item, a shell (/bin/sh) is forked to execute the
specified command, with stdin connected to /dev/null, and
<br>
stdout, stderr connected to the active console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string f.jptty ttynumber <br>
When the mouse button is released above the corresponding
menu item, the console is switched to the one specified. The
ttynumber must be specified as a string. Any tty can <br>
be reached this way, even those which are not accessible via
the keyboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string f.mktty ttynumber <br>
When the mouse button is released above the corresponding
menu item, an unused console is selected, and /sbin/mingetty
is executed in it. The current console is switched <br>
to the newly opened console. I use this command to save
kernel memory by opening a single console through
/etc/inittab and requesting the others only when i need to
login.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string Whole-menu <br>
A menu can directly follow the label string. When the mouse
pointer leaves the menu frame at the level of string, a
second menu is posted on screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string f.lock <br>
When the mouse button is released above the corresponding
menu item, the keyboard and the screen are locked, and only
the locking user or the superuser can unlock them. <br>
This is not yet implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string f.load <br>
The current loadavg when the menu is posted is concatenated
to string to build the actual message displayed on screen.
Nothing happens at button release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string f.free <br>
The free memory and swap when the menu is posted is
concatenated to string to build the actual message displayed
on screen. Nothing happens at button release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string f.time <br>
The current time is formatted with strftime(3), according to
string. The resulting string is the actual message displayed
on screen. Nothing happens at button release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string f.pipe cmdline <br>
When the mouse pointer leaves the menu frame at the level of
string, a message box is posted on screen showing the last
ten lines of the output of cmdline. cmdline is exe&acirc;
<br>
cuted by /bin/sh. This is not yet implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string f.nop <br>
This does nothing, it only displays string on the menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The HOME, LOGNAME and USER
environment variables are setup to the values for the
invoking user before spawning an external process (f.bgcmd,
f.pipe). The current directory is <br>
always /.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Known bugs have been fixed. In particular, if you invoke
gpm-root right after gpm, it will delay a few seconds before
trying to connect to the daemon.</p>
