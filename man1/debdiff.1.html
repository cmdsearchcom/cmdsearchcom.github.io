<p>DEBDIFF(1) General Commands Manual DEBDIFF(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
debdiff - compare file lists in two Debian packages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
debdiff [options] <br>
debdiff [options] ... deb1 deb2 <br>
debdiff [options] ... changes1 changes2 <br>
debdiff [options] ... --from deb1a deb1b ... --to deb2a
deb2b ... <br>
debdiff [options] ... dsc1 dsc2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
debdiff takes the names of two Debian package files (.debs
or .udebs) on the command line and compares their contents
(considering only the files in the main package, not the
<br>
maintenance scripts). It shows which files have been
introduced and which removed between the two package files,
and is therefore useful for spotting files which may have
been <br>
inadvertently lost between revisions of the package. It also
checks the file owners and permissions, and compares the
control files of the two packages using the wdiff program.
<br>
If you want a deeper comparison of two Debian package files
you can use the diffoscope tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no arguments are given,
debdiff tries to compare the content of the current source
directory with the last version of the package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debdiff can also handle changes
between groups of .deb files in two ways. The first is to
specify two .changes files. In this case, the .deb files
listed in the .changes file <br>
will be compared, by taking the contents of all of the
listed .deb files together. (The .deb files listed are
assumed to be in the same directory as the .changes file.)
The <br>
second way is to list the .deb files of interest
specifically using the --from ... --to syntax. These both
help if a package is broken up into smaller packages and one
wishes to <br>
ensure that nothing is lost in the interim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debdiff examines the devscripts
configuration files as described below. Command line options
override the configuration file settings, though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If debdiff is passed two source
packages (.dsc files) it will compare the contents of the
source packages. If the source packages differ only in
Debian revision number (that is, <br>
the .orig.tar.gz files are the same in the two .dsc files),
then interdiff(1) will be used to compare the two patch
files if this program is available on the system, otherwise
a <br>
diff will be performed between the two source trees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--dirs, -d <br>
The default mode of operation is to ignore directory names
which appear in the file list, but they, too, will be
considered if this option is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nodirs <br>
Ignore directory names which appear in the file list. This
is the default and it can be used to override a
configuration file setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--move FROM TO, -m FROM TO <br>
It sometimes occurs that various files or directories are
moved around between revisions. This can be handled using
this option. There are two arguments, the first giv&acirc;
<br>
ing the location of the directory or file in the first
package, and the second in the second. Any files in the
first listing whose names begin with the first argument are
<br>
treated as having that substituted for the second argument
when the file lists are compared. Any number of --move
arguments may be given; they are processed in the order <br>
in which they appear. This only affects comparing binary
packages, not source packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--move-regex FROM TO <br>
This is the same as --move, except that FROM is treated as a
regular expression and the perl substitution command
s/^FROM/TO/ is applied to the files. In particular, TO <br>
can make use of backreferences such as $1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nocontrol <br>
debdiff will usually compare the respective control files of
the packages using wdiff(1). This option suppresses this
part of the processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--control <br>
Compare the respective control files; this is the default,
and it can be used to override a configuration file
setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--controlfiles FILE[,FILE ...]
<br>
Specify which control files to compare; by default this is
just control, but could include postinst, config and so on.
Files will only be compared if they are present in <br>
both .debs being compared. The special value ALL compares
all control files present in both packages, except for
md5sums. This option can be used to override a
configu&acirc; <br>
ration file setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--wdiff-source-control <br>
When processing source packages, compare control files using
wdiff. Equivalent to the --control option for binary
packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-wdiff-source-control <br>
Do not compare control files in source packages using wdiff.
This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--wp, --wl, --wt <br>
Pass a -p, -l or -t option to wdiff respectively. (This
yields the whole wdiff output rather than just the lines
with any changes.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-moved <br>
If multiple .deb files are specified on the command line,
either using .changes files or the --from/--to syntax, then
this option will also show which files (if any) have <br>
moved between packages. (The package names are simply
determined from the names of the .deb files.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noshow-moved <br>
The default behaviour; can be used to override a
configuration file setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--renamed FROM TO <br>
If --show-moved is being used and a package has been renamed
in the process, this command instructs debdiff to treat the
package in the first list called FROM as if it <br>
were called TO. Multiple uses of this option are
permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude PATTERN <br>
Exclude files that match PATTERN. Multiple uses of this
option are permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--diffstat <br>
Include the result of diffstat before the generated
diff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-diffstat <br>
The default behaviour; can be used to override a
configuration file setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--auto-ver-sort <br>
When comparing source packages, do so in version order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-auto-ver-sort <br>
Compare source packages in the order they were passed on the
command-line, even if that means comparing a package with a
higher version against one with a lower version. <br>
This is the default behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unpack-tarballs <br>
When comparing source packages, also unpack tarballs found
in the top level source directory to compare their contents
along with the other files. This is the default be&acirc;
<br>
haviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-unpack-tarballs <br>
Do not unpack tarballs inside source packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-conf, --noconf <br>
Do not read any configuration files. This can only be used
as the first option given on the command-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debs-dir directory <br>
Look for the .dsc files in directory instead of the parent
of the source directory. This should either be an absolute
path or relative to the top of the source directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help, -h <br>
Show a summary of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version, -v <br>
Show version and copyright information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quiet, -q <br>
Be quiet if no differences were found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-space, -w <br>
Ignore whitespace in diffs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION VARIABLES <br>
The two configuration files /etc/devscripts.conf and
~/.devscripts are sourced by a shell in that order to set
configuration variables. Command line options can be used to
over&acirc; <br>
ride configuration file settings. Environment variable
settings are ignored for this purpose. The currently
recognised variables are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBDIFF_DIRS <br>
If this is set to yes, then it is the same as the --dirs
command line parameter being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBDIFF_CONTROL <br>
If this is set to no, then it is the same as the --nocontrol
command line parameter being used. The default is yes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBDIFF_CONTROLFILES <br>
Which control files to compare, corresponding to the
--controlfiles command line option. The default is
control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBDIFF_SHOW_MOVED <br>
If this is set to yes, then it is the same as the
--show-moved command line parameter being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBDIFF_WDIFF_OPT <br>
This option will be passed to wdiff; it should be one of -p,
-l or -t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBDIFF_SHOW_DIFFSTAT <br>
If this is set to yes, then it is the same as the --diffstat
command line parameter being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBDIFF_WDIFF_SOURCE_CONTROL
<br>
If this is set to yes, then it is the same as the
--wdiff-source-control command line parameter being
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBDIFF_AUTO_VER_SORT <br>
If this is set to yes, then it is the same as the
--auto-ver-sort command line parameter being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBDIFF_UNPACK_TARBALLS <br>
If this is set to no, then it is the same as the
--no-unpack-tarballs command line parameter being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBRELEASE_DEBS_DIR <br>
This specifies the directory in which to look for the .dsc
and files, and is either an absolute path or relative to the
top of the source tree. This corresponds to the <br>
--debs-dir command line option. This directive could be
used, for example, if you always use pbuilder or
svn-buildpackage to build your packages. Note that it also
<br>
affects debrelease(1) in the same way, hence the strange
name of the option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT VALUES <br>
Normally the exit value will be 0 if no differences are
reported and 1 if any are reported. If there is some fatal
error, the exit code will be 255.</p>
