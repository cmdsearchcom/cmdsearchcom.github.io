<p>GKERMIT(1) General Commands Manual GKERMIT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gkermit - G-Kermit (GNU Kermit) 1.00 file transfer
software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gkermit [ options ] -s file(s) Send files <br>
gkermit [ options ] -g file(s) Get files <br>
gkermit [ options ] -r Receive files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
G-Kermit is a UNIX program for transferring files using the
Kermit proto&acirc; <br>
col. G-Kermit is a product of Kermit Project at Columbia
University. It <br>
is free software under the GNU Public License. See the
COPYING file for <br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INVOKING G-KERMIT <br>
The G-Kermit binary is called &quot;gkermit&quot;. It should
be stored someplace <br>
in your UNIX PATH; normally it is available as
/usr/local/bin/gkermit. <br>
To run G-Kermit, just type &quot;gkermit&quot; followed by
command-line options <br>
that tell it what to do. If no options are given, it prints
a usage mes&acirc; <br>
sage listing the available options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an option takes an argument,
the argument is required; if an option <br>
does not take an argument, no argument may be given
(exception: -d). The <br>
action options are -r, -s, and -g. Only one action option
may be given. <br>
If no action options are given, G-Kermit does nothing
(except possibly to <br>
print its usage message or create a debug.log file). Here
are some exam&acirc; <br>
ples (&quot;$ &quot; is the shell prompt):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ gkermit -s hello.c &lt;-- Send
the hello.c file <br>
$ gkermit -s hello.* &lt;-- Send all hello.* files <br>
$ gkermit -r &lt;-- Wait to receive files <br>
$ gkermit -g hello.c &lt;-- Get hello.c file <br>
$ gkermit -g hello. &lt;-- Get all hello.* files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options that do not take
arguments can be &quot;bundled&quot; with other options.
<br>
An option that takes an argument must always be followed by
a space and <br>
then its argument(s). Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ gkermit -is hello.o &lt;--
Send hello.o in binary mode <br>
$ gkermit -dr &lt;-- Receive with debugging</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS <br>
-r RECEIVE. Wait for incoming files. <br>
-s fn SEND. Send file(s) specified by fn. <br>
-g fn GET. Get specified file(s) from server. <br>
-a fn AS-NAME. Alternative name for file. <br>
-i IMAGE. Binary-mode transfer (default). <br>
-T TEXT. Text-mode transfer. <br>
-P PATH (filename) conversion disabled. <br>
-w WRITEOVER when filenames collide. <br>
-K KEEP incompletely received files. <br>
-p x PARITY. x = e,o,m,s,n; default = n(one). <br>
-e n PACKET LENGTH. n = 40-9000; default=4000. <br>
-b n TIMEOUT. Per-packet timeout, seconds. <br>
-x XON/XOFF. Set Xon/Xoff in the tty driver. <br>
--x Unset Xon/Xoff in the tty driver. <br>
-S STREAMING disabled. <br>
-X EXTERNAL. G-Kermit is an external protocol. <br>
-q QUIET. Suppress messages. <br>
-d DEBUG. Write debugging info to ./debug.log. <br>
-d fn DEBUG. Write debugging info to given file. <br>
-h HELP. Display brief usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may supply options to
G-Kermit on the command line or through the <br>
GKERMIT environment variable, which can contain any valid
gkermit com&acirc; <br>
mand-line options. These are processed before the actual
command-line <br>
options and so can be overridden by them. Example for bash
or ksh, which <br>
you can put in your profile if you want to always keep
incomplete files, <br>
suppress streaming, suppress messages, and use Space
parity:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export GKERMIT=&quot;-K -S -q -p
s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MECHANICS OF FILE TRANSFER <br>
To transfer files with G-Kermit you must be connected
through a terminal <br>
emulator to the UNIX system where G-Kermit is running,
meaning you are <br>
online to UNIX and have access to the shell prompt (or to a
menu that has <br>
an option to invoke G-Kermit). The connection can be serial
(direct or <br>
dialed) or network (Telnet, Rlogin, X.25, etc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you tell G-Kermit to SEND a
file (or files), e.g. with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ gkermit -Ts oofa.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">it pauses for a second and then
sends its first packet. What happens <br>
next depends on the capabilities of your terminal
emulator:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If your emulator
supports Kermit &quot;autodownloads&quot; then it <br>
receives the file automatically and puts you back in the
termi&acirc; <br>
nal screen when done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Otherwise,
you&rsquo;ll need to take whatever action is required by
<br>
your emulator to get its attention: a mouse action, a
keystroke <br>
like Alt-x, or a character sequence like Ctrl-&nbsp;or
Ctrl-] fol&acirc; <br>
lowed by the letter &quot;c&quot; (this is called
&quot;escaping back&quot;) and <br>
then tell it to receive the file. When the transfer is
com&acirc; <br>
plete, you must instruct your emulator to go back to its
termi&acirc; <br>
nal screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During file transfer, most
terminal emulators put up some kind of running <br>
display of the file transfer progress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you tell G-Kermit to
RECEIVE (with &quot;gkermit -r&quot;), this requires you
<br>
to escape back to your terminal emulator and instruct it to
send the <br>
desired file(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your terminal emulator
supports Kermit autodownloads AND Kermit server <br>
mode, then you can use GET (&quot;gkermit -g files...&quot;)
rather than RECEIVE <br>
(&quot;gkermit -r&quot;), and the rest happens
automatically, as when G-Kermit is <br>
sending.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERRUPTING FILE TRANSFER <br>
G-Kermit supports file and group interruption. The method
for interrupt&acirc; <br>
ing a transfer depends on your terminal emulator. For
example, while the <br>
file-transfer display is active, you might type the letter
&rsquo;x&rsquo; to cancel <br>
the current file and go on to the next one (if any), and the
letter &rsquo;z&rsquo; <br>
to cancel the group. Or there might be buttons you can click
with your <br>
mouse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When G-Kermit is in packet mode
and your terminal emulator is in its ter&acirc; <br>
minal screen, you can also type three (3) Ctrl-C characters
in a row to <br>
make G-Kermit exit and restore the normal terminal
modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEXT AND BINARY TRANSFER MODE
<br>
When sending files in binary mode, G-Kermit sends every byte
exactly as <br>
it is stored on the disk. This mode is appropriate for
program binaries, <br>
graphics files, tar archives, compressed files, etc, and is
G-Kermit&rsquo;s <br>
default file transfer mode when sending. When receiving
files in binary <br>
mode, G-Kermit simply copies each byte to disk. (Obviously
the bytes are <br>
encoded for transmission, but the encoding and decoding
procedures give a <br>
replica of the original file after transfer.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When sending files in text mode,
G-Kermit converts the record format to <br>
the common one that is defined for the Kermit protocol,
namely lines ter&acirc; <br>
minated by carriage return and linefeed (CRLF); the receiver
converts the <br>
CRLFs to whatever line-end or record-format convention is
used on its <br>
platform. When receiving files in text mode, G-Kermit simply
strips car&acirc; <br>
riage returns, leaving only a linefeed at the end of each
line, which is <br>
the UNIX convention.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When receiving files, the
sender&rsquo;s transfer mode (text or binary) predom&acirc;
<br>
inates if the sender gives this information to G-Kermit in a
Kermit File <br>
Attribute packet, which of course depends on whether your
terminal emula&acirc; <br>
tor&rsquo;s Kermit protocol has this feature. Otherwise, if
you gave a -i or <br>
-T option on the gkermit command line, the corresponding
mode is used; <br>
otherwise the default mode (binary) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, when either sending
or receiving, G-Kermit and your terminal <br>
emulator&rsquo;s Kermit can inform each other of their OS
type (UNIX in G-Ker&acirc; <br>
mit&rsquo;s case). If your emulator supports this
capability, which is called <br>
&quot;automatic peer recognition&quot;, and it tells
G-Kermit that its platform is <br>
also UNIX, G-Kermit and the emulator&rsquo;s Kermit
automatically switch into <br>
binary mode, since no record-format conversion is necessary
in this case. <br>
Automatic peer recognition is disabled automatically if you
include the <br>
-i (image) or -T (text) option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When sending, G-Kermit sends all
files in the same mode, text or binary. <br>
There is no automatic per-file mode switching. When
receiving, however, <br>
per-file switching occurs automatically based on the
incoming Attribute <br>
packets, if any (explained below), that accompany each
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATHNAMES <br>
When SENDING a file, G-Kermit obtains the filenames from the
command <br>
line. It depends on the shell to expand metacharacters
(wildcards and <br>
tilde).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G-Kermit uses the full pathname
given to find and open the file, but then <br>
strips the pathname before sending the name to the receiver.
For exam&acirc; <br>
ple:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ gkermit -s /etc/hosts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">results in the receiver getting
a file called &quot;HOSTS&quot; or &quot;hosts&quot; (the
<br>
directory part, &quot;/etc/&quot;, is stripped).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if a pathname is
included in the -a option, the directory part <br>
is not stripped:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ gkermit -s /etc/hosts -a
/tmp/hosts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example sends the
/etc/hosts file but tells the receiver that its <br>
name is &quot;/tmp/hosts&quot;. What the receiver does with
the pathname is, of <br>
course, up to the receiver, which might have various options
for dealing <br>
with incoming pathnames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When RECEIVING a file, G-Kermit
does NOT strip the pathname. If the <br>
incoming filename includes a path, G-Kermit tries to store
the file in <br>
the specified place. If the path does not exist, the
transfer fails. <br>
The incoming pathname can, of course, be overridden with the
-a option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILENAME CONVERSION <br>
When sending a file, G-Kermit normally converts outbound
filenames to <br>
common form: uppercase, no more than one period, and no
funny characters. <br>
So, for example, gkermit.tar.gz would be sent as
GKERMIT_TAR.GZ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When receiving a file, if the
name is all uppercase, G-Kermit converts it <br>
to all lowercase. If the name contains any lowercase
letters, G-Kermit <br>
leaves the name alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the automatic peer
recognition feature is available in the terminal <br>
emulator, and G-Kermit recognizes the emulator&rsquo;s
platform as UNIX, G-Ker&acirc; <br>
mit automatically disables filename conversion and sends and
accepts <br>
filenames literally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can force literal filenames
by including the -P option on the command <br>
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILENAME COLLISIONS <br>
When G-Kermit receives a file whose name is the same as that
of an exist&acirc; <br>
ing file, G-Kermit &quot;backs up&quot; the existing file by
adding a unique suffix <br>
to its name. The suffix is &quot;.~n~&quot;, where n is a
number. This kind of <br>
backup suffix is compatible with GNU EMACS and various other
popular <br>
applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To defeat the backup feature and
have incoming files overwrite existing <br>
files of the same name, include the -w (writeover) option on
the command <br>
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
G-Kermit resturns an exit status code of 0 if all actions
succeeded and 1 <br>
if any actions failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPLEMENTATION NOTES <br>
G-Kermit is designed to be small, portable, and stable, and
is intended <br>
for use only on the &quot;far end&quot; of a connection; it
does not make connec&acirc; <br>
tions itself, although it can be used as an external
protocol by other <br>
programs that do make connections. To keep it small and
stable, it does <br>
not include sliding windows, a command or scripting language
or charac&acirc; <br>
ter-set translation. To keep it portable and stable, it
avoids use of <br>
system services that are not standardized across all UNIX
varieties and <br>
therefore, in particular, does not support file timestamps,
internal <br>
wildcard expansion, and other features that are not
implemented consis&acirc; <br>
tently (or at all) across all UNIXes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
A GKERMIT environment variable may be defined (for example
in your shell <br>
profile) to include G-Kermit command-line options; these are
processed by <br>
G-Kermit before any options that are specified on the
command line, and <br>
therefore are overriden by command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
If an error occurs during file transfer G-Kermit sends an
error packet to <br>
your terminal emulator to cancel the transfer; an
appropriate error mes&acirc; <br>
sage should be displayed on your screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERRORS <br>
File transfers can fail for a number of reasons:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Lack of read
access to a source file. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Lack of write access to a target directory.
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; Lack of adequate flow control. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Use of streaming on an unreliable
connection. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Excessive unprefixing of control characters.
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; Sending bare 8-bit data on a 7-bit
connection. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Packets too long for receiver&rsquo;s
buffers. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Timeout interval too short for
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and many others; these are
covered in the references.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The speed of a file transfer depends not only on the speed
of the two <br>
computers involved and the characteristics of the
connection, but also on <br>
the capabilities and configuration of the two Kermit
programs. Kermit is <br>
a fast and reliable protocol, but not all implementations of
it are nec&acirc; <br>
essarily fast or reliable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nonstreaming transfers on a
TCP/IP connection might be inordinately slow <br>
if one or both of the TCP/IP stacks uses the Nagle or
Delayed ACK tricks. <br>
Streaming is used automatically if the other Kermit supports
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When receiving files in text
mode, G-Kermit strips all carriage returns, <br>
even if they aren&rsquo;t followed by linefeed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A backups files are not
guaranteed to have the highest number in their <br>
backup suffix.</p>
