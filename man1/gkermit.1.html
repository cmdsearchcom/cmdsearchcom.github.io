G-Kermit is a UNIX program for transferring files using the Kermit protocol.
  G-Kermit is a product of Kermit Project at Columbia University. It is free
  software under the GNU Public License. See the COPYING file for details.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="INVOKING_G-KERMIT"><a class="selflink" href="#INVOKING_G-KERMIT">INVOKING
  G-KERMIT</a></h2>
The G-Kermit binary is called &quot;gkermit&quot;. It should be stored someplace
  in your UNIX PATH; normally it is available as /usr/local/bin/gkermit. To run
  G-Kermit, just type &quot;gkermit&quot; followed by command-line options that
  tell it what to do. If no options are given, it prints a usage message listing
  the available options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If an option takes an argument, the argument is required; if an option does not
  take an argument, no argument may be given (exception: -d). The action options
  are -r, -s, and -g. Only one action option may be given. If no action options
  are given, G-Kermit does nothing (except possibly to print its usage message
  or create a debug.log file). Here are some examples (&quot;$ &quot; is the
  shell prompt):
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  $ gkermit -s hello.c   &lt;-- Send the hello.c file
  $ gkermit -s hello.*   &lt;-- Send all hello.* files
  $ gkermit -r           &lt;-- Wait to receive files
  $ gkermit -g hello.c   &lt;-- Get hello.c file
  $ gkermit -g hello.\*  &lt;-- Get all hello.* files
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
Options that do not take arguments can be &quot;bundled&quot; with other
  options. An option that takes an argument must always be followed by a space
  and then its argument(s). Examples:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  $ gkermit -is hello.o  &lt;-- Send hello.o in binary mode
  $ gkermit -dr          &lt;-- Receive with debugging
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="COMMAND-LINE_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#COMMAND-LINE_OPTIONS">COMMAND-LINE
  OPTIONS</a></h2>
<pre>
  -r      RECEIVE.  Wait for incoming files.
  -s fn   SEND.  Send file(s) specified by fn.
  -g fn   GET.  Get specified file(s) from server.
  -a fn   AS-NAME.  Alternative name for file.
  -i      IMAGE.  Binary-mode transfer (default).
  -T      TEXT. Text-mode transfer.
  -P      PATH (filename) conversion disabled.
  -w      WRITEOVER when filenames collide.
  -K      KEEP incompletely received files.
  -p x    PARITY. x = e,o,m,s,n; default = n(one).
  -e n    PACKET LENGTH.  n = 40-9000; default=4000.
  -b n    TIMEOUT.  Per-packet timeout, seconds.
  -x      XON/XOFF.  Set Xon/Xoff in the tty driver.
  --x     Unset Xon/Xoff in the tty driver.
  -S      STREAMING disabled.
  -X      EXTERNAL.  G-Kermit is an external protocol.
  -q      QUIET.  Suppress messages.
  -d      DEBUG.  Write debugging info to ./debug.log.
  -d fn   DEBUG.  Write debugging info to given file.
  -h      HELP.  Display brief usage message.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may supply options to G-Kermit on the command line or through the GKERMIT
  environment variable, which can contain any valid gkermit command-line
  options. These are processed before the actual command-line options and so can
  be overridden by them. Example for bash or ksh, which you can put in your
  profile if you want to always keep incomplete files, suppress streaming,
  suppress messages, and use Space parity:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  export GKERMIT=&quot;-K -S -q -p s&quot;
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="MECHANICS_OF_FILE_TRANSFER"><a class="selflink" href="#MECHANICS_OF_FILE_TRANSFER">MECHANICS
  OF FILE TRANSFER</a></h2>
To transfer files with G-Kermit you must be connected through a terminal
  emulator to the UNIX system where G-Kermit is running, meaning you are online
  to UNIX and have access to the shell prompt (or to a menu that has an option
  to invoke G-Kermit). The connection can be serial (direct or dialed) or
  network (Telnet, Rlogin, X.25, etc).
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you tell G-Kermit to SEND a file (or files), e.g. with:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  $ gkermit -Ts oofa.txt
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
it pauses for a second and then sends its first packet. What happens next
  depends on the capabilities of your terminal emulator:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
&#x2022;	If your emulator supports Kermit &quot;autodownloads&quot; then it
  receives the file automatically and puts you back in the terminal screen when
  done.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
&#x2022;	Otherwise, you'll need to take whatever action is required by your
  emulator to get its attention: a mouse action, a keystroke like Alt-x, or a
  character sequence like Ctrl-\ or Ctrl-] followed by the letter &quot;c&quot;
  (this is called &quot;escaping back&quot;) and then tell it to receive the
  file. When the transfer is complete, you must instruct your emulator to go
  back to its terminal screen.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
During file transfer, most terminal emulators put up some kind of running
  display of the file transfer progress.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you tell G-Kermit to RECEIVE (with &quot;gkermit -r&quot;), this requires
  you to escape back to your terminal emulator and instruct it to send the
  desired file(s).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If your terminal emulator supports Kermit autodownloads AND Kermit server mode,
  then you can use GET (&quot;gkermit -g files...&quot;) rather than RECEIVE
  (&quot;gkermit -r&quot;), and the rest happens automatically, as when G-Kermit
  is sending.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="INTERRUPTING_FILE_TRANSFER"><a class="selflink" href="#INTERRUPTING_FILE_TRANSFER">INTERRUPTING
  FILE TRANSFER</a></h2>
G-Kermit supports file and group interruption. The method for interrupting a
  transfer depends on your terminal emulator. For example, while the
  file-transfer display is active, you might type the letter 'x' to cancel the
  current file and go on to the next one (if any), and the letter 'z' to cancel
  the group. Or there might be buttons you can click with your mouse.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When G-Kermit is in packet mode and your terminal emulator is in its terminal
  screen, you can also type three (3) Ctrl-C characters in a row to make
  G-Kermit exit and restore the normal terminal modes.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="TEXT_AND_BINARY_TRANSFER_MODE"><a class="selflink" href="#TEXT_AND_BINARY_TRANSFER_MODE">TEXT
  AND BINARY TRANSFER MODE</a></h2>
When sending files in binary mode, G-Kermit sends every byte exactly as it is
  stored on the disk. This mode is appropriate for program binaries, graphics
  files, tar archives, compressed files, etc, and is G-Kermit's default file
  transfer mode when sending. When receiving files in binary mode, G-Kermit
  simply copies each byte to disk. (Obviously the bytes are encoded for
  transmission, but the encoding and decoding procedures give a replica of the
  original file after transfer.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
When sending files in text mode, G-Kermit converts the record format to the
  common one that is defined for the Kermit protocol, namely lines terminated by
  carriage return and linefeed (CRLF); the receiver converts the CRLFs to
  whatever line-end or record-format convention is used on its platform. When
  receiving files in text mode, G-Kermit simply strips carriage returns, leaving
  only a linefeed at the end of each line, which is the UNIX convention.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When receiving files, the sender's transfer mode (text or binary) predominates
  if the sender gives this information to G-Kermit in a Kermit File Attribute
  packet, which of course depends on whether your terminal emulator's Kermit
  protocol has this feature. Otherwise, if you gave a -i or -T option on the
  gkermit command line, the corresponding mode is used; otherwise the default
  mode (binary) is used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Furthermore, when either sending or receiving, G-Kermit and your terminal
  emulator's Kermit can inform each other of their OS type (UNIX in G-Kermit's
  case). If your emulator supports this capability, which is called
  &quot;automatic peer recognition&quot;, and it tells G-Kermit that its
  platform is also UNIX, G-Kermit and the emulator's Kermit automatically switch
  into binary mode, since no record-format conversion is necessary in this case.
  Automatic peer recognition is disabled automatically if you include the -i
  (image) or -T (text) option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When sending, G-Kermit sends all files in the same mode, text or binary. There
  is no automatic per-file mode switching. When receiving, however, per-file
  switching occurs automatically based on the incoming Attribute packets, if any
  (explained below), that accompany each file.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="PATHNAMES"><a class="selflink" href="#PATHNAMES">PATHNAMES</a></h2>
When SENDING a file, G-Kermit obtains the filenames from the command line. It
  depends on the shell to expand metacharacters (wildcards and tilde).
<div class="Pp"></div>
G-Kermit uses the full pathname given to find and open the file, but then strips
  the pathname before sending the name to the receiver. For example:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  $ gkermit -s /etc/hosts
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
results in the receiver getting a file called &quot;HOSTS&quot; or
  &quot;hosts&quot; (the directory part, &quot;/etc/&quot;, is stripped).
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, if a pathname is included in the -a option, the directory part is not
  stripped:
<pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  $ gkermit -s /etc/hosts -a /tmp/hosts
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</pre>
This example sends the /etc/hosts file but tells the receiver that its name is
  &quot;/tmp/hosts&quot;. What the receiver does with the pathname is, of
  course, up to the receiver, which might have various options for dealing with
  incoming pathnames.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When RECEIVING a file, G-Kermit does NOT strip the pathname. If the incoming
  filename includes a path, G-Kermit tries to store the file in the specified
  place. If the path does not exist, the transfer fails. The incoming pathname
  can, of course, be overridden with the -a option.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="FILENAME_CONVERSION"><a class="selflink" href="#FILENAME_CONVERSION">FILENAME
  CONVERSION</a></h2>
When sending a file, G-Kermit normally converts outbound filenames to common
  form: uppercase, no more than one period, and no funny characters. So, for
  example, gkermit.tar.gz would be sent as GKERMIT_TAR.GZ.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When receiving a file, if the name is all uppercase, G-Kermit converts it to all
  lowercase. If the name contains any lowercase letters, G-Kermit leaves the
  name alone.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the automatic peer recognition feature is available in the terminal emulator,
  and G-Kermit recognizes the emulator's platform as UNIX, G-Kermit
  automatically disables filename conversion and sends and accepts filenames
  literally.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can force literal filenames by including the -P option on the command line.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="FILENAME_COLLISIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#FILENAME_COLLISIONS">FILENAME
  COLLISIONS</a></h2>
When G-Kermit receives a file whose name is the same as that of an existing
  file, G-Kermit &quot;backs up&quot; the existing file by adding a unique
  suffix to its name. The suffix is &quot;.~n~&quot;, where n is a number. This
  kind of backup suffix is compatible with GNU EMACS and various other popular
  applications.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To defeat the backup feature and have incoming files overwrite existing files of
  the same name, include the -w (writeover) option on the command line.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RETURN_VALUES"><a class="selflink" href="#RETURN_VALUES">RETURN
  VALUES</a></h1>
G-Kermit resturns an exit status code of 0 if all actions succeeded and 1 if any
  actions failed.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES">IMPLEMENTATION
  NOTES</a></h1>
G-Kermit is designed to be small, portable, and stable, and is intended for use
  only on the &quot;far end&quot; of a connection; it does not make connections
  itself, although it can be used as an external protocol by other programs that
  do make connections. To keep it small and stable, it does not include sliding
  windows, a command or scripting language or character-set translation. To keep
  it portable and stable, it avoids use of system services that are not
  standardized across all UNIX varieties and therefore, in particular, does not
  support file timestamps, internal wildcard expansion, and other features that
  are not implemented consistently (or at all) across all UNIXes.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
A GKERMIT environment variable may be defined (for example in your shell
  profile) to include G-Kermit command-line options; these are processed by
  G-Kermit before any options that are specified on the command line, and
  therefore are overriden by command-line options.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DIAGNOSTICS"><a class="selflink" href="#DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</a></h1>
If an error occurs during file transfer G-Kermit sends an error packet to your
  terminal emulator to cancel the transfer; an appropriate error message should
  be displayed on your screen.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ERRORS"><a class="selflink" href="#ERRORS">ERRORS</a></h1>
File transfers can fail for a number of reasons:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
&#x2022;	Lack of read access to a source file. &#x2022;	Lack of write access to
  a target directory. &#x2022;	Lack of adequate flow control. &#x2022;	Use of
  streaming on an unreliable connection. &#x2022;	Excessive unprefixing of
  control characters. &#x2022;	Sending bare 8-bit data on a 7-bit connection.
  &#x2022;	Packets too long for receiver's buffers. &#x2022;	Timeout interval
  too short for connection.
<br/>
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
and many others; these are covered in the references.

The Kermit protocol is specified in &quot;Kermit, A File Transfer Protocol&quot;
  by Frank da Cruz, Digital Press (1987). A correctness proof of the Kermit
  protocol appears in &quot;Specification and Validation Methods&quot;, edited
  by Egon Boerger, Oxford University Press (1995). &quot;Using C-Kermit&quot; by
  Frank da Cruz and Christine M. Gianone, Digital Press (1997, or later edition)
  explains many of the terms and techniques referenced here in case you are not
  familiar with them, and also includes tutorials on data communications,
  extensive troubleshooting and performance tips, etc. Various other books on
  Kermit are available from Digital Press. Online resources include:

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
The speed of a file transfer depends not only on the speed of the two computers
  involved and the characteristics of the connection, but also on the
  capabilities and configuration of the two Kermit programs. Kermit is a fast
  and reliable protocol, but not all implementations of it are necessarily fast
  or reliable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Nonstreaming transfers on a TCP/IP connection might be inordinately slow if one
  or both of the TCP/IP stacks uses the Nagle or Delayed ACK tricks. Streaming
  is used automatically if the other Kermit supports it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When receiving files in text mode, G-Kermit strips all carriage returns, even if
  they aren't followed by linefeed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A backups files are not guaranteed to have the highest number in their backup
  suffix.
