<p>ETEX(1) General Commands Manual ETEX(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
etex - extended (plain) TeX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
etex [options] [&amp;format] [file| DESCRIPTION <br>
Run the e-TeX typesetter on file, by default creating
file.dvi. If the file argument has no extension,
&quot;.tex&quot; will be appended to it. Instead of a
filename, a set of e-TeX com&acirc; <br>
mands can be given, the first of which must start with a
backslash. With a &amp;format argument e-TeX uses a
different set of precompiled commands, contained in
format.fmt; it is <br>
usually better to use the -fmt format option instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e-TeX is the first concrete
result of an international research &amp; development
project, the NTS Project, which was established under the
aegis of DANTE e.V. during 1992. The aims <br>
of the project are to perpetuate and develop the spirit and
philosophy of TeX, whilst respecting Knuth&rsquo;s wish that
TeX should remain frozen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e-TeX can be used in two
different modes: in compatibility mode it is supposed to be
completely interchangable with standard TeX. In extended
mode several new primitives are <br>
added that facilitate (among other things) bidirectional
typesetting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An extended mode format is
generated by prefixing the name of the source file for the
format with an asterisk (*).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e-TeX&rsquo;s handling of its
command-line arguments is similar to that of the other TeX
programs in the web2c implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
This version of e-TeX understands the following command line
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmt format <br>
Use format as the name of the format to be used, instead of
the name by which e-TeX was called or a %&amp; line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-enc Enable the encTeX
extensions. This option is only effective in combination
with -ini. For documentation of the encTeX extensions see
http://www.olsak.net/enctex.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-etex Enable the e-TeX
extensions. This option is only effective in combination
with -ini.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-file-line-error <br>
Print error messages in the form file:line:error which is
similar to the way many compilers format them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-file-line-error <br>
Disable printing error messages in the file:line:error
style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-file-line-error-style <br>
This is the old name of the -file-line-error option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-halt-on-error <br>
Exit with an error code when an error is encountered during
processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help Print help message and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ini Start in INI mode, which is
used to dump formats. The INI mode can be used for
typesetting, but no format is preloaded, and basic
initializations like setting catcodes <br>
may be required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-interaction mode <br>
Sets the interaction mode. The mode can be either batchmode,
nonstopmode, scrollmode, and errorstopmode. The meaning of
these modes is the same as that of the corre&acirc; <br>
sponding <br>
-ipc Send DVI output to a socket as well as the usual output
file. Whether this option is available is the choice of the
installer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ipc-start <br>
As -ipc, and starts the server at the other end as well.
Whether this option is available is the choice of the
installer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jobname name <br>
Use name for the job name, instead of deriving it from the
name of the input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kpathsea-debug bitmask <br>
Sets path searching debugging flags according to the
bitmask. See the Kpathsea manual for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mktex fmt <br>
Enable mktexfmt, where fmt must be either tex or tfm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mltex Enable MLTeX extensions.
Only effective in combination with -ini.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-mktex fmt <br>
Disable mktexfmt, where fmt must be either tex or tfm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-output-comment string <br>
Use string for the DVI file comment instead of the date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-output-directory directory <br>
Write output files in directory instead of the current
directory. Look up input files in directory first, the along
the normal search path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-parse-first-line <br>
If the first line of the main input file begins with %&amp;
parse it to look for a dump name or a -translate-file
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-parse-first-line <br>
Disable parsing of the first line of the main input
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-progname name <br>
Pretend to be program name. This affects both the format
used and the search paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-recorder <br>
Enable the filename recorder. This leaves a trace of the
files opened for input and output in a file with extension
.fls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-shell-escape <br>
Enable the 480uct. The command can be any shell command.
This construct is normally disallowed for security
reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-shell-escape <br>
Disable the 480uct, even if it is enabled in the texmf.cnf
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-src-specials <br>
Insert source specials into the DVI file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-src-specials where <br>
Insert source specials in certain placed of the DVI file.
where is a comma-separated value list: cr, display, hbox,
math, par, parent, or vbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-translate-file tcxname <br>
Use the tcxname translation table to set the mapping of
input characters and re-mapping of output characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-default-translate-file tcxname
<br>
Like -translate-file except that a %&amp; line can overrule
this setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Print version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
See the Kpathsearch library documentation (the &lsquo;Path
specifications&rsquo; node) for precise details of how the
environment variables are used. The kpsewhich utility can be
used to <br>
query the values of the variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One caveat: In most e-TeX
formats, you cannot use ~ in a filename you give directly to
e-TeX, because ~ is an active character, and hence is
expanded, not taken as part of the <br>
filename. Other programs, such as Metafont, do not have this
problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEXMFOUTPUT <br>
Normally, e-TeX puts its output files in the current
directory. If any output file cannot be opened there, it
tries to open it in the directory specified in the
environ&acirc; <br>
ment variable TEXMFOUTPUT. There is no default value for
that variable. For example, if you say etex paper and the
current directory is not writable, if TEXMFOUTPUT has <br>
the value /tmp, e-TeX attempts to create /tmp/paper.log (and
/tmp/paper.dvi, if any output is produced.) TEXMFOUTPUT is
also checked for input files, as TeX often gener&acirc; <br>
ates files that need to be subsequently read; for input, no
suffixes (such as &lsquo;&lsquo;.tex&rsquo;&rsquo;) are
added by default, the input name is simply checked as
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEXINPUTS <br>
Search path for input and mty path component will be
replaced with <br>
the paths defined in the texmf.cnf file. For example, set
TEXINPUTS to &quot;.:/home/user/tex:&quot; to prepend the
current direcory and
&lsquo;&lsquo;/home/user/tex&rsquo;&rsquo; to the standard
search <br>
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEXFORMATS <br>
Search path for format files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEXPOOL <br>
search path for etex internal strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEXEDIT <br>
Command template for switching to editor. The default,
usually vi, is set when e-TeX is compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TFMFONTS <br>
Search path for font metric (.tfm) files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
The location of the files mentioned below varies from system
to system. Use the kpsewhich utility to find their
locations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">etex.pool <br>
Text file containing e-TeX&rsquo;s internal strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">texfonts.map <br>
Filename mapping definitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*.tfm Metric files for
e-TeX&rsquo;s fonts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*.fmt Predigested e-TeX format
(.fmt) files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Starting with version 1.40, pdfTeX incorporates the e-TeX
extensions, so in this installation eTeX may be just a
symbolic link to pdfTeX. See pdftex(1). This manual page is
not <br>
meant to be exhaustive. The complete documentation for this
version of e-TeX can be found in the info manual Web2C: A
TeX implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
This version of e-TeX implements a number of optional
extensions. In fact, many of these extensions conflict to a
greater or lesser extent with the definition of e-TeX. When
<br>
such extensions are enabled, the banner printed when e-TeX
starts is changed to print e-TeXk instead of e-TeX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This version of e-TeX fails to
trap arithmetic overflow when dimensions are added or
subtracted. Cases where this occurs are rare, but when it
does the generated DVI file will <br>
be invalid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
pdftex(1), tex(1), mf(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
e-TeX was developed by Peter Breitenlohner and the NTS team;
Peter later continued its development outside of the
team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TeX was designed by Donald E.
Knuth, who implemented it using his Web system for Pascal
programs. It was ported to Unix at Stanford by Howard
Trickey, and at Cornell by Pavel <br>
Curtis. The version now offered with the Unix TeX
distribution is that generated by the Web to C system
(web2c), originally written by Tomas Rokicki and Tim
Morgan.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The encTeX extensions were
written by Petr Olsak.</p>
