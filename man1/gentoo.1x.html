<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gentoo - A highly configurable file manager for X</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gentoo [--version] [--locale-info] [--root-ok] [--no-rc]
[--no-gtkrc] [--no-dir-history] [--left=path] [--right=path]
[--run=ARG]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gentoo is a file manager for Linux and compatible systems.
It allows you to interactively navigate your file system
using the mouse, and also to perform various fairly standard
<br>
operations (such as copy, move, rename, ...) on the files
and directories contained therein.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gentoo always shows you the
contents of two directories at once. Each of these is
displayed in its own scrollable list, called a pane. At any
time, exactly one pane is the cur&acirc; <br>
rent pane, and has a highlighted bar running across its top
region. The current pane acts as the source for all file
operations, while the other pane is the destination. You can
<br>
select rows in panes using selection methods of varying
complexity (from simply clicking a row, to selecting rows by
name using a regular expression). Once you have a selection,
<br>
you can click a button to perform some command on the
selected files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All file operations performed by
gentoo are implemented natively. When you use gentoo to copy
a file, for example, gentoo does not simply execute the
system&rsquo;s cp(1L) command. <br>
Rather, gentoo contains its own code for opening source and
destination files, and then reading and writing the right
amount of data between them. This way of doing things makes
<br>
gentoo independent of the availability of shell commands to
do things.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gentoo incorporates a fairly
powerful, object-oriented file typing and styling system. It
can use a variety of ways to determine the type of the files
it is displaying. Each type <br>
is then linked to something called a style, which controls
how rows of that type are rendered in panes. You can use
this system to control icons, colors, and various operations
<br>
on the rows. For example, it is easy to make gentoo display
all PNG images in red, and to invoke The GIMP(1) on them
when double-clicked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A design goal with gentoo has
been to provide full GUI configurability, removing the need
to edit a configuration file by hand and restart the program
to see the changes, as is <br>
otherwise common in many programs for Un*x. As a result of
this, gentoo features a Configuration dialog window where
you can configure most aspects of its operation directly,
<br>
using the mouse and standard GUI widgets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gentoo borrows its basic
look&rsquo;n&rsquo;feel from the classic Amiga file manager
Directory OPUS, but is not a &quot;clone&quot; of any
kind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
gentoo is not primarily driven by command line arguments,
but the following are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Causes gentoo to print its version number (a string of the
form MAJOR.MINOR.MICRO, like 0.20.7) to the standard output,
and then exit successfully. Numbers having an odd <br>
MINOR component indicate development versions of the
program. So far, all versions of gentoo have been classified
as being development versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--locale-info <br>
Makes gentoo print a couple of localization settings, and
then exit. This is mostly useful during development and
debugging, and not of a lot of interest when just using <br>
the application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--root-ok <br>
Makes gentoo accept being run by the root user. Normally,
this is not allowed since it is considered a big threat to
system security. Note that gentoo has the ability to <br>
execute user-defined strings using the execvp(3) function.
This is generally considered harmful. However, if you really
want to run gentoo while logged on as root, supply&acirc;
<br>
ing this option allows you to. It is not recommended,
though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-rc <br>
Starts up gentoo without loading any configuration file.
This makes it run using the built-in defaults, which are
very Spartan indeed. Seldom comfortable, but occasionally
<br>
handy when trying to determine if a problem is with the
configuration or with the core code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-gtkrc <br>
Avoids loading the GTK+ RC file, thus disabling any widget
customizations, and forces all widgets to use the default
GTK+ look.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-dir-history <br>
Avoids loading the file that holds the history, i.e. which
directories have been previously visited by the two panes.
Very rarely needed, included mostly for completeness&rsquo;
<br>
sake.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--left, --right (or -1, -2) <br>
Sets the initial path for the left and right pane,
respectively. If present, the path specified with one of
these options overrides any other path for the pane in
ques&acirc; <br>
tion. See below (Initial Directory Paths) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--run ARG (or -rARG) <br>
Runs ARG, a gentoo command. Commands specified this way are
executed before gentoo accepts any user input through the
graphical interface, but after the configuration file <br>
has been read in. You can use it many times in order to make
gentoo run a whole series of commands. Remember that
gentoo&rsquo;s command names are case-sensitive, and that
<br>
built-in commands (like &quot;About&quot;) always begin with
a capital letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any non-option command arguments
will be silently ignored. If an argument &quot;-h&quot; or
&quot;--help&quot; is given, gentoo will give a summary of
its supported command line options and exit <br>
successfully. If an unknown option is given, or a option is
missing a required argument, gentoo will whine and exit with
a failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BASIC USAGE <br>
When gentoo starts up, it will open up its single main
window, which is split vertically (or horizontally;
it&rsquo;s configurable) down the middle, forming the two
panes mentioned <br>
above. It also contains a bank of buttons along the
bottom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Initial Directory Paths <br>
The actual paths shown in the two panes upon start-up can be
controlled in various ways. There are four ways of getting a
path to show up in pane. In order of decreasing prior&acirc;
<br>
ity, they are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Command-line Argument <br>
Using the --left and --right (or their short forms, -1 and
-2) command-line arguments overrides any other setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Configured Default Directory
<br>
If no command-line argument is present, and the
&quot;Default Directory&quot; configuration option is set,
that directory is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Most Recently Visited
Directory <br>
If no default directory exists, the most recently visited
directory is taken from the directory history for each pane.
This only works if a directory history file has been <br>
found and loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Current Directory <br>
If all else fails, gentoo uses the current directory
(&quot;.&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Navigating <br>
Navigating around the file system using gentoo is very
simple. The two panes act as independent views of the file
system, and both are navigated in exactly the same way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can always see which
directory a pane is showing by reading its path, shown in
the entry box below (by default--you can change the position
to above) the pane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To enter a directory, locate it
in the pane and double click it with the left mouse button.
gentoo will read the directory&rsquo;s contents, and update
the display accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several ways of going
up in the directory structure. To enter the directory
containing the one currently shown (the current dir&rsquo;s
parent), you can: click the parent <br>
button (to the left of the path entry box); hit Backspace on
your keyboard; click the middle mouse button; select
&quot;Parent&quot; from the pop-up menu on the right mouse
button, or <br>
click the downward arrow to the right of the path box (this
pops up the directory history menu), then select the second
row from the top.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selecting Files <br>
Before you can do anything to a file, you need to select it.
All file-management commands in gentoo act upon the current
selection (in the current pane). There are several ways <br>
of selecting files, but the most frequently used are
mouse-based. Note that the word &quot;file&quot; used below
really should be taken to mean &quot;file or
directory&quot;, since selection doesn&rsquo;t <br>
distinguish between the two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To select a file (or directory),
just point the mouse at the name (anywhere in the row is
fine), and click the left mouse button. The colors of the
clicked row will change, indi&acirc; <br>
cating that it is currently selected. To select more rows,
keep the mouse button down, and drag the mouse vertically.
gentoo extends the selection, including all rows touched.
<br>
If you drag across the top or bottom border, the pane will
scroll, trying to keep up. This is a very quick and
convenient way of selecting multiple files, as long as they
are <br>
listed in succession.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you click again on an already
selected file, you will unselect it. You can drag to
unselect several files, just as when selecting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To select a sequence of files
without dragging, first click normally on the first file
that you wish to select. Then release the mouse button,
locate the last file in the <br>
sequence (it can be either above or below the first one),
hold down shift on your keyboard, and click the wanted file.
gentoo now adds all files between the first and the last to
<br>
the current selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you follow the instructions
given above to select a sequence, but press control rather
than shift before clicking the second time, gentoo will
unselect the range of files <br>
indicated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you click on a file with the
meta key held down (that&rsquo;s actually a key labeled Alt,
located to the immediate left of the space bar, on my PC
keyboard), gentoo will do some&acirc; <br>
thing cool: it will select (or unselect, it&rsquo;s a toggle
just like ordinary selection) all files, including the
clicked one, that have the same type as the one you clicked.
This <br>
can be used to select for example all PNG image files in a
directory even if you can only see one. Occasionally very
useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you click on a file with both
the shift and control keys held down, gentoo will toggle the
selected state of all files having the same file name
extension as the one you <br>
clicked. This can sometimes be useful to select files that
you don&rsquo;t have a proper type defined for, as long as
those files do share an extension, that is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changing Sort Order <br>
The files and directories listed in each of gentoo&rsquo;s
two panes are always sorted on some column: typically file
name. You can chose to sort on some other field by clicking
the <br>
appropriate column title once. If you click on the field
that is already current, the sorting will be reversed (i.e.,
for names it will be Z-A rather than A-Z).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your display includes icons,
try sorting on that column: gentoo will then order each row
according to its File Style, grouping the rows based on
their parent styles, all the <br>
way up to the root of the Style tree. This means that, for
example, JPEG and PNG pictures (both having an immediate
parent style of Image) will be shown together, and before
all <br>
Text files (HTML, man pages and so on). It&rsquo;s quite
cool, really. :)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Executing Commands <br>
Commands are used to make gentoo do stuff. The typical
command operates upon the set of selected files in the
current pane, so it&rsquo;s usually a good idea to first
select some <br>
files. See the previous subsection for details on how to
select files. Once you have a bunch of files selected, you
need to tell gentoo which command to execute. There are
sev&acirc; <br>
eral ways of doing this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most basic file operations (e.g.
copy, move, rename, and so on) are found on the (cleverly
labeled) buttons along the bottom of gentoo&rsquo;s main
window. To copy a file, just select <br>
it, then click the button labeled &quot;Copy&quot;.
It&rsquo;s really that simple. Most of these built-in (or
native) commands automatically operate recursively on
directories, so you could copy <br>
(or move) a whole directory of files by just selecting it
and then clicking &quot;Copy&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you can&rsquo;t see a button
that does what you want to do, there&rsquo;s a chance that
the command exists, but isn&rsquo;t bound. Click the right
mouse button in a pane, this opens up the <br>
&quot;pane pop-up menu&quot;. Select the &quot;Run...&quot;
item. This opens up a dialog window showing all available
commands. Select a command, and click &quot;OK&quot; to
execute it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
gentoo is a pretty complicated program; it has a rather
large amount of configuration data that it needs in order to
be really useful. For example, my current personal
configura&acirc; <br>
tion file contains well over a thousand different
configuration values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To store this hefty amount of
configuration data, gentoo uses a heavily structured
configuration file. In fact, the file is (or at least it
should be) legal XML!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When new features are added to
gentoo, they will typically require some form of
configuration data. This data is then simply added somewhere
in the existing configuration file <br>
structure. Effort is made to assign reasonable built-in
default values for all such new features, so older
configuration files (that don&rsquo;t contain the values
required by the new <br>
features) should still work. The first time you hit
&quot;Save&quot; in the configuration window after changing
your version of gentoo, your personal configuration file
will be updated to <br>
match the version of gentoo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Describing how to go about
configuring gentoo is too big a topic for a manual page to
cover. I&rsquo;ll just say that the command to open up the
configuration window is called &quot;Config&acirc; <br>
ure&quot;. It is by default available on a button (typically
the top-right one), in the pane pop-up menu, and also by
pressing the C key on your keyboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.config/gentoo/gentoorc <br>
A user&rsquo;s personal configuration file. When gentoo
starts up, it will try to load this file. If the file
isn&rsquo;t found, the old name ~/.gentoorc is tested, and
if that also <br>
fails a site-wide configuration (see below) will be tried
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/gentoorc <br>
This is the site-wide configuration file. If a user
doesn&rsquo;t have a configuration in his/her home
directory, gentoo loads this file instead. The actual
location of this <br>
file is slightly system-dependent, the above is the default.
As an end user, you typically won&rsquo;t need to access
this file manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.config/gentoo/dirhistory <br>
This file contains lists of the most recently visited
directories, for both panes. These are the lists that appear
in the drop-down menu when the arrow next to the path <br>
entry box is clicked. Can be disabled in the Dir Pane
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.config/gentoo/gtkrc <br>
This file allows you to control the look of the widgets used
by gentoo, through the GTK+ style system. You can change the
actual path in gentoo&rsquo;s Configuration window, the <br>
above is the typical default for a modern Linux-based
system. If a file named gtkrc is not found in the configured
path, the names gentoogtkrc and .gentoogtkrc (note the <br>
period), in that order, are also tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/passwd, /etc/group <br>
These two files normally hold the system&rsquo;s password
and group information. These are (probably) the ones gentoo
uses to map user IDs to login names, to do tilde-expansion
<br>
(mapping of user name to directory path), and to map group
IDs to group names. That is probably, because gentoo
doesn&rsquo;t actually refer to these files by name.
Instead, it <br>
uses the (BSD-style) API function calls getpwent(3) and
getgrent(3) to access this information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/fstab, /proc/mounts, (or
/etc/mtab) <br>
These files contain data on available and mounted file
systems. They are read by gentoo&rsquo;s auto-mounting code.
You can configure the exact file names used, on the
&quot;Mount&acirc; <br>
ing&quot; tab in the main configuration window. Note that
using /proc/mounts rather than /etc/mtab is recommended on
Linux systems; they contain roughly the same data, but the
<br>
one in /proc is always up to date, and faster to read!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
All releases of gentoo numbered 0.x.y, where x (the so
called minor version number) is odd, are to be considered
development releases, as opposed to stable ones. This means
that <br>
the software will probably suffer from bugs. If you find
something that you suspect is indeed a bug, please
don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact the author! For details on
how to do this, <br>
see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re concerned about
using potentially buggy and completely unwarranted software
to manage your precious files, please feel free not to use
gentoo. The world is full of <br>
alternatives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The chances that a bug gets
fixed increase greatly if you report it. When reporting a
bug, you must describe how to reproduce it, and also try to
be as detailed and precise as <br>
possible in your description of the actual bug. If possible,
perhaps you should include the output of gdb(1) (or whatever
your system&rsquo;s debugger is called). In some cases it
<br>
might be helpful if you include the configuration file you
were using when the problem occurred. Before reporting a
bug, please make sure that you are running a reasonably
recent <br>
version of the software, since otherwise &quot;your&quot;
bug might already been fixed. See below for how to obtain
new releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, you should locate and read
through the BUGS file distributed with gentoo, so you
don&rsquo;t go through all this hassle just to report an
already known bug, thereby wasting <br>
everybody&rsquo;s time...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
gentoo was written, from scratch, by Emil Brink. The first
line of code was written on May 15th, 1998. It is my first
program to use the GTK+ GUI toolkit, my first program to be
<br>
released under the GPL, and also my first really major Linux
application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only efficient way to
contact me (to report bugs, give praise, suggest
features/fixes/extensions/whatever) is by Internet e-mail.
My address is &lt;emil@obsession.se&gt;. Please <br>
try and include the word &quot;gentoo&quot; in the Subject
part of your e-mail, to help me organize my inbox. Thanks.
If you&rsquo;re really not in the mood for the direct feel
of e-mail, the <br>
second best choice for reporting bugs and making suggestions
is the use the web-based bug tracker at
&lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/gentoo/bugs/&gt;. Thanks for
contributing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS <br>
The author wishes to thank the following people for their
various contributions to gentoo:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Johan Hanson
(&lt;johan@tiq.com&gt;) <br>
