<p>UNIFDEF(1) Programmer&rsquo;s Manual UNIFDEF(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
unifdef, unifdefall &acirc; remove preprocessor conditionals
from code</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
unifdef [-bBcdehKkmnsStV] [-Ipath] [-[i]Dsym[=val]]
[-[i]Usym] ... [-f defile] [-x {012}] [-M backext] [-o
outfile] [infile ...] <br>
unifdefall [-Ipath] ... file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The unifdef utility selectively processes conditional cpp(1)
directives. It removes from a file both the directives and
any additional text that they specify should be removed,
<br>
while otherwise leaving the file alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The unifdef utility acts on #if,
#ifdef, #ifndef, #elif, #else, and #endif lines, using
macros specified in -D and -U command line options or in -f
definitions files. A directive <br>
is processed if the macro specifications are sufficient to
provide a definite value for its control expression. If the
result is false, the directive and the following lines under
<br>
its control are removed. If the result is true, only the
directive is removed. An #ifdef or #ifndef directive is
passed through unchanged if its controlling macro is not
speci&acirc; <br>
fied. Any #if or #elif control expression that has an
unknown value or that unifdef cannot parse is passed through
unchanged. By default, unifdef ignores #if and #elif lines
with <br>
constant expressions; it can be told to process them by
specifying the -k flag on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It understands a commonly-used
subset of the expression syntax for #if and #elif lines:
integer constants, integer values of macros defined on the
command line, the defined() oper&acirc; <br>
ator, the operators !, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, ==, !=,
&amp;&amp;, ||, and parenthesized expressions. A kind of
&acirc;short circuit&acirc; evaluation is used for the
&amp;&amp; operator: if either operand is defi&acirc; <br>
nitely false then the result is false, even if the value of
the other operand is unknown. Similarly, if either operand
of || is definitely true then the result is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When evaluating an expression,
unifdef does not expand macros first. The value of a macro
must be a simple number, not an expression. A limited form
of indirection is allowed, <br>
where one macro&rsquo;s value is the name of another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In most cases, unifdef does not
distinguish between object-like macros (without arguments)
and function-like macros (with arguments). A function-like
macro invocation can appear <br>
in #if and #elif control expressions. If the macro is not
explicitly defined, or is defined with the -D flag on the
command-line, or with #define in a -f definitions file, its
<br>
arguments are ignored. If a macro is explicitly undefined on
the command line with the -U flag, or with #undef in a -f
definitions file, it may not have any arguments since this
<br>
leads to a syntax error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The unifdef utility understands
just enough about C to know when one of the directives is
inactive because it is inside a comment, or affected by a
backslash-continued line. It <br>
spots unusually-formatted preprocessor directives and knows
when the layout is too odd for it to handle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A script called unifdefall can
be used to remove all conditional cpp(1) directives from a
file. It uses unifdef -s and cpp -dM to get lists of all the
controlling macros and their <br>
definitions (or lack thereof), then invokes unifdef with
appropriate arguments to process the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-Dsym=val <br>
Specify that a macro is defined to a given value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dsym Specify that a macro is
defined to the value 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Usym Specify that a macro is
undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the same macro appears in
more than one argument, the last occurrence dominates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iDsym[=val] <br>
-iUsym C strings, comments, and line continuations are
ignored within #ifdef and #ifndef blocks controlled by
macros specified with these options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f defile <br>
The file defile contains #define and #undef preprocessor
directives, which have the same effect as the corresponding
-D and -U command-line arguments. You can have multi&acirc;
<br>
ple -f arguments and mix them with -D and -U arguments;
later options override earlier ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each directive must be on a
single line. Object-like macro definitions (without
arguments) are set to the given value. Function-like macro
definitions (with arguments) <br>
are treated as if they are set to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Replace removed lines with
blank lines instead of deleting them. Mutually exclusive
with the -B option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Compress blank lines around a
deleted section. Mutually exclusive with the -b option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Complement, i.e., lines that
would have been removed or blanked are retained and vice
versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Turn on printing of debugging
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e By default, unifdef will
report an error if it needs to remove a preprocessor
directive that spans more than one line, for example, if it
has a multi-line comment hanging <br>
off its right hand end. The -e flag makes it ignore the line
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ipath Specifies to unifdefall
an additional place to look for #include files. This option
is ignored by unifdef for compatibility with cpp(1) and to
simplify the implementation <br>
of unifdefall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K Always treat the result of
&amp;&amp; and || operators as unknown if either operand is
unknown, instead of short-circuiting when unknown operands
can&rsquo;t affect the result. This <br>
option is for compatibility with older versions of
unifdef.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Process #if and #elif lines
with constant expressions. By default, sections controlled
by such lines are passed through unchanged because they
typically start &acirc;#if 0&acirc; and <br>
are used as a kind of comment to sketch out future or past
development. It would be rude to strip them out, just as it
would be for normal comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Modify one or more input
files in place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M backext <br>
Modify input files in place, and keep backups of the
original files by appending the backext to the input
filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Add #line directives to the
output following any deleted lines, so that errors produced
when compiling the output file correspond to line numbers in
the input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o outfile <br>
Write output to the file outfile instead of the standard
output when processing a single file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Instead of processing an
input file as usual, this option causes unifdef to produce a
list of macros that are used in preprocessor directive
controlling expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Like the -s option, but the
nesting depth of each macro is also printed. This is useful
for working out the number of possible combinations of
interdependent defined/unde&acirc; <br>
fined macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Disables parsing for C
strings, comments, and line continuations, which is useful
for plain text. This is a blanket version of the -iD and -iU
flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print version details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x {012} <br>
Set exit status mode to zero, one, or two. See the EXIT
STATUS section below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The unifdef utility takes its
input from stdin if there are no file arguments. You must
use the -m or -M options if there are multiple input files.
You can specify inut from <br>
stdin or output to stdout with &acirc;-&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The unifdef utility works nicely
with the -Dsym option of diff(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
In normal usage the unifdef utility&rsquo;s exit status
depends on the mode set using the -x option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the exit mode is zero (the
default) then unifdef exits with status 0 if the output is
an exact copy of the input, or with status 1 if the output
differs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the exit mode is one, unifdef
exits with status 1 if the output is unmodified or 0 if it
differs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the exit mode is two, unifdef
exits with status zero in both cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In all exit modes, unifdef exits
with status 2 if there is an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exit status is 0 if the -h
or -V command line options are given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Too many levels of nesting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inappropriate #elif, #else or
#endif.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Obfuscated preprocessor control
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Premature EOF (with the line
number of the most recent unterminated #if).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EOF in comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The unifdef home page is
http://dotat.at/prog/unifdef</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The unifdef command appeared in 2.9BSD. ANSI C support was
added in FreeBSD 4.7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
The original implementation was written by Dave Yost
&lt;Dave@Yost.com&gt;. <br>
Tony Finch &lt;dot@dotat.at&gt; rewrote it to support ANSI
C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Expression evaluation is very limited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Handling one line at a time
means preprocessor directives split across more than one
physical line (because of comments or backslash-newline)
cannot be handled in every situation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trigraphs are not
recognized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no support for macros
with different definitions at different points in the source
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The text-mode and ignore
functionality does not correspond to modern cpp(1)
behaviour.</p>
