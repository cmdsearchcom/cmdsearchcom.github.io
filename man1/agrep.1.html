agrep - search a file for a string or regular expression, with approximate
  matching capabilities
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>agrep</b> [ <b>-#cdehiklnpstvwxBDGIS</b> ] <i>pattern</i> [ -f
  <i>patternfile</i> ] [ <i>filename</i>... ]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>agrep</b> searches the input <i>filenames</i> (standard input is the default,
  but see a warning under LIMITATIONS) for records containing strings which
  either <i>exactly</i> or <i>approximately</i> match a pattern. A record is by
  default a line, but it can be defined differently using the -d option (see
  below). Normally, each record found is copied to the standard output.
  Approximate matching allows finding records that contain the pattern with
  several errors including substitutions, insertions, and deletions. For
  example, Massechusets matches Massachusetts with two errors (one substitution
  and one insertion). Running <b>agrep</b> -2 Massechusets foo outputs all lines
  in foo containing any string with at most 2 errors from Massechusets.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>agrep</b> supports many kinds of queries including arbitrary wild cards, sets
  of patterns, and in general, regular expressions. See PATTERNS below. It
  supports most of the options supported by the <b>grep</b> family plus several
  more (but it is not 100% compatible with grep). For more information on the
  algorithms used by agrep see Wu and Manber, &quot;Fast Text Searching With
  Errors,&quot; Technical report #91-11, Department of Computer Science,
  University of Arizona, June 1991 (available by anonymous ftp from
  cs.arizona.edu in agrep/agrep.ps.1), and Wu and Manber, &quot;Agrep -- A Fast
  Approximate Pattern Searching Tool&quot;, To appear in USENIX Conference 1992
  January (available by anonymous ftp from cs.arizona.edu in agrep/agrep.ps.2).
<div class="Pp"></div>
As with the rest of the <b>grep</b> family, the characters `<b>$</b>',
  `^<b>',</b> `<b>&#x2217;</b>', `<b>[</b>'<b>,</b> `<b>]</b>'<b>,</b>
  `<b>^</b>', `<b>|</b>', `<b>(</b>', `<b>)</b>', `<b>!</b>', and `<b>\</b>' can
  cause unexpected results when included in the <i>pattern</i>, as these
  characters are also meaningful to the shell. To avoid these problems, one
  should always enclose the entire pattern argument in single quotes, i.e.,
  'pattern'. Do not use double quotes (&quot;).
<div class="Pp"></div>
When <b>agrep</b> is applied to more than one input file, the name of the file
  is displayed preceding each line which matches the pattern. The filename is
  not displayed when processing a single file, so if you actually want the
  filename to appear, use <b>/dev/null</b> as a second file in the list.

      <i>delim</i> can be a string of size at most 8 (with possible use of ^ and
      $), but not a regular expression. Text between two <i>delim</i>'s, before
      the first <i>delim</i>, and after the last <i>delim</i> is considered as
      one record. For example, -d '$$' defines paragraphs as records and -d

<i>agrep</i> supports a large variety of patterns, including simple strings,
  strings with classes of characters, sets of strings, wild cards, and regular
  expressions.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Strings</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">any sequence of characters, including the special symbols
      `^' for beginning of line and `$' for end of line. The special characters
      listed above ( `<b>$</b>', `^<b>',</b> `<b>&#x2217;</b>',
      `<b>[</b>'<b>,</b> `<b>^</b>', `<b>|</b>', `<b>(</b>', `<b>)</b>',
      `<b>!</b>', and `<b>\</b>' ) should be preceded by `\' if they are to be
      matched as regular characters. For example, \^abc\\ corresponds to the
      string ^abc\, whereas ^abc corresponds to the string abc at the beginning
      of a line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Classes of characters</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">a list of characters inside [] (in order) corresponds to
      any character from the list. For example, [a-ho-z] is any character
      between a and h or between o and z. The symbol `^' inside [] complements
      the list. For example, [^i-n] denote any character in the character set
      except character 'i' to 'n'. The symbol `^' thus has two meanings, but
      this is consistent with egrep. The symbol `.' (don't care) stands for any
      symbol (except for the newline symbol).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Boolean operations</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>agrep</b> supports an `and' operation `;' and an `or'
      operation `,', but not a combination of both. For example, 'fast;network'
      searches for all records containing both words.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Wild cards</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The symbol '#' is used to denote a wild card. # matches
      zero or any number of arbitrary characters. For example, ex#e matches
      example. The symbol # is equivalent to .* in egrep. In fact, .* will work
      too, because it is a valid regular expression (see below), but unless this
      is part of an actual regular expression, # will work faster.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Combination of exact and approximate matching</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">any pattern inside angle brackets &lt;&gt; must match the
      text exactly even if the match is with errors. For example,
      &lt;mathemat&gt;ics matches mathematical with one error (replacing the
      last s with an a), but mathe&lt;matics&gt; does not match mathematical no
      matter how many errors we allow.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Regular expressions</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The syntax of regular expressions in <b>agrep</b> is in
      general the same as that for <b>egrep</b>. The union operation `|', Kleene
      closure `*', and parentheses () are all supported. Currently '+' is not
      supported. Regular expressions are currently limited to approximately 30
      characters (generally excluding meta characters). Some options (-d, -w,
      -f, -t, -x, -D, -I, -S) do not currently work with regular expressions.
      The maximal number of errors for regular expressions that use '*' or '|'
      is 4.</dd>

Regular expressions do not support the '+' operator (match 1 or more instances
  of the preceding token). These can be searched for by using this syntax in the
  pattern:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
' <i>pattern</i><b>(</b><i>pattern</i><b>)*</b>'
<br/>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
(search for strings containing one instance of the pattern, followed by 0 or
  more instances of the pattern).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following can cause an infinite loop: <b>agrep</b> pattern * &gt;
  output_file. If the number of matches is high, they may be deposited in
  output_file before it is completely read leading to more matches of the
  pattern within output_file (the matches are against the whole directory). It's
  not clear whether this is a &quot;bug&quot; (grep will do the same), but be
  warned.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The maximum size of the <i>patternfile</i> is limited to be 250Kb, and the
  maximum number of patterns is limited to be 30,000.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Standard input is the default if no input file is given. However, if standard
  input is keyed in directly (as opposed to through a pipe, for example) agrep
  may not work for some non-simple patterns.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is no size limit for simple patterns. More complicated patterns are
  currently limited to approximately 30 characters. Lines are limited to 1024
  characters. Records are limited to 48K, and may be truncated if they are
  larger than that. The limit of record length can be changed by modifying the
  parameter Max_record in agrep.h.
