<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
agrep - search a file for a string or regular expression,
with approximate matching capabilities</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
agrep [ -#cdehiklnpstvwxBDGIS ] pattern [ -f patternfile ] [
filename... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
agrep searches the input filenames (standard input is the
default, but see a warning under LIMITATIONS) for records
containing strings which either exactly or approximately
match <br>
a pattern. A record is by default a line, but it can be
defined differently using the -d option (see below).
Normally, each record found is copied to the standard
output. <br>
Approximate matching allows finding records that contain the
pattern with several errors including substitutions,
insertions, and deletions. For example, Massechusets matches
<br>
Massachusetts with two errors (one substitution and one
insertion). Running agrep -2 Massechusets foo outputs all
lines in foo containing any string with at most 2 errors
from <br>
Massechusets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">agrep supports many kinds of
queries including arbitrary wild cards, sets of patterns,
and in general, regular expressions. See PATTERNS below. It
supports most of the options <br>
supported by the grep family plus several more (but it is
not 100% compatible with grep). For more information on the
algorithms used by agrep see Wu and Manber, &quot;Fast Text
<br>
Searching With Errors,&quot; Technical report #91-11,
Department of Computer Science, University of Arizona, June
1991 (available by anonymous ftp from cs.arizona.edu in <br>
agrep/agrep.ps.1), and Wu and Manber, &quot;Agrep -- A Fast
Approximate Pattern Searching Tool&quot;, To appear in
USENIX Conference 1992 January (available by anonymous ftp
from cs.ari&acirc; <br>
zona.edu in agrep/agrep.ps.2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As with the rest of the grep
family, the characters &lsquo;$&rsquo;, &lsquo;^&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;, &lsquo;[&rsquo;, &lsquo;]&rsquo;,
&lsquo;^&rsquo;, &lsquo;|&rsquo;, &lsquo;(&rsquo;,
&lsquo;)&rsquo;, &lsquo;!&rsquo;, and &lsquo;&acute; can
cause unexpected results when included in the pattern, as
these <br>
characters are also meaningful to the shell. To avoid these
problems, one should always enclose the entire pattern
argument in single quotes, i.e., &rsquo;pattern&rsquo;. Do
not use double <br>
quotes (&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When agrep is applied to more
than one input file, the name of the file is displayed
preceding each line which matches the pattern. The filename
is not displayed when processing <br>
a single file, so if you actually want the filename to
appear, use /dev/null as a second file in the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-# # is a non-negative integer (at most 8) specifying the
maximum number of errors permitted in finding the
approximate matches (defaults to zero). Generally, each
inser&acirc; <br>
tion, deletion, or substitution counts as one error. It is
possible to adjust the relative cost of insertions,
deletions and substitutions (see -I -D and -S options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Display only the count of
matching records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d &rsquo;delim&rsquo; <br>
Define delim to be the separator between two records. The
default value is &rsquo;$&rsquo;, namely a record is by
default a line. delim can be a string of size at most 8
(with pos&acirc; <br>
sible use of ^ and $), but not a regular expression. Text
between two delim&rsquo;s, before the first delim, and after
the last delim is considered as one record. For example,
<br>
-d &rsquo;$$&rsquo; defines paragraphs as records and -d
&rsquo;^From &rsquo; defines mail messages as records. agrep
matches each record separately. This option does not
currently work with <br>
regular expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e pattern <br>
Same as a simple pattern argument, but useful when the
pattern begins with a &lsquo;-&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f patternfile <br>
patternfile contains a set of (simple) patterns. The output
is all lines that match at least one of the patterns in
patternfile. Currently, the -f option works only for <br>
exact match and for simple patterns (any meta symbol is
interpreted as a regular character); it is compatible only
with -c, -h, -i, -l, -s, -v, -w, and -x options. see <br>
LIMITATIONS for size bounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Do not display filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Case-insensitive search
&acirc; e.g., &quot;A&quot; and &quot;a&quot; are considered
equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k No symbol in the pattern is
treated as a meta character. For example, agrep -k
&rsquo;a(b|c)*d&rsquo; foo will find the occurrences of
a(b|c)*d in foo whereas agrep &rsquo;a(b|c)*d&rsquo; foo
<br>
will find substrings in foo that match the regular
expression &rsquo;a(b|c)*d&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l List only the files that
contain a match. This option is useful for looking for files
containing a certain pattern. For example, &quot; agrep -l
&rsquo;wonderful&rsquo; * &quot; will list <br>
the names of those files in current directory that contain
the word &rsquo;wonderful&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Each line that is printed is
prefixed by its record number in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Find records in the text that
contain a supersequence of the pattern. For example, <br>
agrep -p DCS foo will match &quot;Department of Computer
Science.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Work silently, that is,
display nothing except error messages. This is useful for
checking the error status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Output the record starting
from the end of delim to (and including) the next delim.
This is useful for cases where delim should come at the end
of the record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Inverse mode &acirc; display
only those records that do not contain the pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Search for the pattern as a
word &acirc; i.e., surrounded by non-alphanumeric
characters. The non-alphanumeric must surround the match;
they cannot be counted as errors. For <br>
example, agrep -w -1 car will match cars, but not
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x The pattern must match the
whole line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Used with -B option. When -y
is on, agrep will always output the best matches without
giving a prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Best match mode. When -B is
specified and no exact matches are found, agrep will
continue to search until the closest matches (i.e., the ones
with minimum number of <br>
errors) are found, at which point the following message will
be shown: &quot;the best match contains x errors, there are
y matches, output them? (y/n)&quot; The best match mode is
<br>
not supported for standard input, e.g., pipeline input. When
the -#, -c, or -l options are specified, the -B option is
ignored. In general, -B may be slower than -#, but <br>
not by very much.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dk Set the cost of a deletion
to k (k is a positive integer). This option does not
currently work with regular expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Output the files that contain
a match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ik Set the cost of an insertion
to k (k is a positive integer). This option does not
currently work with regular expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sk Set the cost of a
substitution to k (k is a positive integer). This option
does not currently work with regular expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATTERNS <br>
agrep supports a large variety of patterns, including simple
strings, strings with classes of characters, sets of
strings, wild cards, and regular expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Strings <br>
any sequence of characters, including the special symbols
&lsquo;^&rsquo; for beginning of line and &lsquo;$&rsquo;
for end of line. The special characters listed above (
&lsquo;$&rsquo;, &lsquo;^&rsquo;, &lsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;[&rsquo;, <br>
&lsquo;^&rsquo;, &lsquo;|&rsquo;, &lsquo;(&rsquo;,
&lsquo;)&rsquo;, &lsquo;!&rsquo;, and &lsquo;&acute; )
should be preceded by &lsquo;&acute; if they are to be
matched as regular characters. For example, abc\ corresponds
to the string ^abc <br>
whereas ^abc corresponds to the string abc at the beginning
of a line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Classes of characters <br>
a list of characters inside [] (in order) corresponds to any
character from the list. For example, [a-ho-z] is any
character between a and h or between o and z. The sym&acirc;
<br>
bol &lsquo;^&rsquo; inside [] complements the list. For
example, [^i-n] denote any character in the character set
except character &rsquo;i&rsquo; to &rsquo;n&rsquo;. The
symbol &lsquo;^&rsquo; thus has two meanings, <br>
but this is consistent with egrep. The symbol
&lsquo;.&rsquo; (don&rsquo;t care) stands for any symbol
(except for the newline symbol).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Boolean operations <br>
agrep supports an &lsquo;and&rsquo; operation
&lsquo;;&rsquo; and an &lsquo;or&rsquo; operation
&lsquo;,&rsquo;, but not a combination of both. For example,
&rsquo;fast;network&rsquo; searches for all records
containing both <br>
words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wild cards <br>
The symbol &rsquo;#&rsquo; is used to denote a wild card. #
matches zero or any number of arbitrary characters. For
example, ex#e matches example. The symbol # is equivalent to
.* <br>
in egrep. In fact, .* will work too, because it is a valid
regular expression (see below), but unless this is part of
an actual regular expression, # will work faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Combination of exact and
approximate matching <br>
any pattern inside angle brackets &lt;&gt; must match the
text exactly even if the match is with errors. For example,
&lt;mathemat&gt;ics matches mathematical with one error
(replac&acirc; <br>
ing the last s with an a), but mathe&lt;matics&gt; does not
match mathematical no matter how many errors we allow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regular expressions <br>
The syntax of regular expressions in agrep is in general the
same as that for egrep. The union operation &lsquo;|&rsquo;,
Kleene closure &lsquo;*&rsquo;, and parentheses () are all
supported. <br>
Currently &rsquo;+&rsquo; is not supported. Regular
expressions are currently limited to approximately 30
characters (generally excluding meta characters). Some
options (-d, -w, -f, <br>
-t, -x, -D, -I, -S) do not currently work with regular
expressions. The maximal number of errors for regular
expressions that use &rsquo;*&rsquo; or &rsquo;|&rsquo; is
4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
agrep -2 -c ABCDEFG foo <br>
gives the number of lines in file foo that contain ABCDEFG
within two errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">agrep -1 -D2 -S2
&rsquo;ABCD#YZ&rsquo; foo <br>
outputs the lines containing ABCD followed, within arbitrary
distance, by YZ, with up to one additional insertion (-D2
and -S2 make deletions and substitutions too
&quot;expen&acirc; <br>
sive&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">agrep -5 -p abcdefghij
/usr/dict/words <br>
outputs the list of all words containing at least 5 of the
first 10 letters of the alphabet in order. (Try it: any list
starting with academia and ending with sacrile&acirc; <br>
gious must mean something!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">agrep -1
&rsquo;abc[0-9](de|fg)*[x-z]&rsquo; foo <br>
outputs the lines containing, within up to one error, the
string that starts with abc followed by one digit, followed
by zero or more repetitions of either de or fg, fol&acirc;
<br>
lowed by either x, y, or z.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">agrep -d &rsquo;^From &rsquo;
&rsquo;breakdown;internet&rsquo; mbox <br>
outputs all mail messages (the pattern &rsquo;^From &rsquo;
separates mail messages in a mail file) that contain
keywords &rsquo;breakdown&rsquo; and
&rsquo;internet&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">agrep -d &rsquo;$$&rsquo; -1
&rsquo;&lt;word1&gt; &lt;word2&gt;&rsquo; foo <br>
finds all paragraphs that contain word1 followed by word2
with one error in place of the blank. In particular, if
word1 is the last word in a line and word2 is the first <br>
word in the next line, then the space will be substituted by
a newline symbol and it will match. Thus, this is a way to
overcome separation by a newline. Note that -d <br>
&rsquo;$$&rsquo; (or another delim which spans more than one
line) is necessary, because otherwise agrep searches only
one line at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS/LIMITATIONS <br>
Any bug reports or comments will be appreciated! Please mail
them to sw@cs.arizona.edu or udi@cs.arizona.edu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regular expressions do not
support the &rsquo;+&rsquo; operator (match 1 or more
instances of the preceding token). These can be searched for
by using this syntax in the pattern:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;pattern(pattern)*&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(search for strings containing
one instance of the pattern, followed by 0 or more instances
of the pattern).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following can cause an
infinite loop: agrep pattern * &gt; output_file. If the
number of matches is high, they may be deposited in
output_file before it is completely read <br>
leading to more matches of the pattern within output_file
(the matches are against the whole directory). It&rsquo;s
not clear whether this is a &quot;bug&quot; (grep will do
the same), but be <br>
warned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The maximum size of the
patternfile is limited to be 250Kb, and the maximum number
of patterns is limited to be 30,000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard input is the default if
no input file is given. However, if standard input is keyed
in directly (as opposed to through a pipe, for example)
agrep may not work for some <br>
non-simple patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no size limit for
simple patterns. More complicated patterns are currently
limited to approximately 30 characters. Lines are limited to
1024 characters. Records are <br>
limited to 48K, and may be truncated if they are larger than
that. The limit of record length can be changed by modifying
the parameter Max_record in agrep.h.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Exit status is 0 if any matches are found, 1 if none, 2 for
syntax errors or inaccessible files.</p>
