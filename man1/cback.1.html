cback - Local and remote backups to CD or DVD media or Amazon S3 storage
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>cback</b> [ <i>switches</i>] action(s)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The cback script provides the command-line interface for Cedar Backup 2. Cedar
  Backup 2 is a software package designed to manage system backups for a pool of
  local and remote machines. It understands how to back up filesystem data as
  well as MySQL and PostgreSQL databases and Subversion repositories. It can
  also be easily extended to support other kinds of data sources.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Cedar Backup 2 is focused around weekly backups to a single CD or DVD disc, with
  the expectation that the disc will be changed or overwritten at the beginning
  of each week. If your hardware is new enough, Cedar Backup can write
  multisession discs, allowing you to add incremental data to a disc on a daily
  basis.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Alternately, Cedar Backup 2 can write your backups to the Amazon S3 cloud rather
  than relying on physical media.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BACKUP_CONCEPTS"><a class="selflink" href="#BACKUP_CONCEPTS">BACKUP
  CONCEPTS</a></h1>
There are two kinds of machines in a Cedar Backup pool. One machine (the
  <i>master</i>) has a CD or DVD writer on it and is where the backup is written
  to disc. The others ( <i>clients</i>) collect data to be written to disc by
  the master. Collectively, the master and client machines in a pool are all
  referred to as <i>peer</i> machines. There are four actions that take place as
  part of the backup process: <i>collect</i>, <i>stage</i>, <i>store</i> and
  <i>purge</i>. Both the master and the clients execute the collect and purge
  actions, but only the master executes the stage and store actions. The
  configuration file <i>/etc/cback.conf</i> controls the actions taken during
  the collect, stage, store and purge actions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Cedar Backup also supports the concept of <i>managed clients</i>. Managed
  clients have their entire backup process managed by the master via a remote
  shell. The same actions are run as part of the backup process, but the master
  controls when the actions are executed on the clients rather than the clients
  controlling it for themselves. This facility is intended for use in
  environments where a scheduler like cron is not available.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MIGRATING_FROM_VERSION_2_TO_VERSION_3"><a class="selflink" href="#MIGRATING_FROM_VERSION_2_TO_VERSION_3">MIGRATING
  FROM VERSION 2 TO VERSION 3</a></h1>
The main difference between Cedar Backup version 2 and Cedar Backup version 3 is
  the targeted Python interpreter. Cedar Backup version 2 was designed for
  Python 2, while version 3 is a conversion of the original code to Python 3.
  Other than that, both versions are functionally equivalent. The configuration
  format is unchanged, and you can mix-and-match masters and clients of
  different versions in the same backup pool. Both versions will be fully
  supported until around the time of the Python 2 end-of-life in 2020, but you
  should plan to migrate sooner than that if possible.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A major design goal for version 3 was to facilitate easy migration testing for
  users, by making it possible to install version 3 on the same server where
  version 2 was already in use. A side effect of this design choice is that all
  of the executables, configuration files, and logs changed names in version 3.
  Where version 2 used <i>cback</i>, version 3 uses <i>cback3</i>:
  <i>cback3.conf</i> instead of <i>cback.conf</i>, <i>cback3.log</i> instead of
  <i>cback.log</i>, etc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
So, while migrating from version 2 to version 3 is relatively straightforward,
  you will have to make some changes manually. You will need to create a new
  configuration file (or soft link to the old one), modify your cron jobs to use
  the new executable name, etc. You can migrate one server at a time in your
  pool with no ill effects, or even incrementally migrate a single server by
  using version 2 and version 3 on different days of the week or for different
  parts of the backup.

The script is designed to run as root, since otherwise it's difficult to back up
  system directories or write the CD or DVD device. However, pains are taken to
  switch to a backup user (specified in configuration) when appropriate.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To use the script, you must specify at least one action to take. More than one
  of the &quot;collect&quot;, &quot;stage&quot;, &quot;store&quot; or
  &quot;purge&quot; actions may be specified, in any arbitrary order. The
  &quot;all&quot;, &quot;rebuild&quot; or &quot;validate&quot; actions may not
  be combined with other actions. If more than one action is specified, then
  actions will be taken in a sensible order (generally collect, followed by
  stage, followed by store, followed by purge).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have configured any Cedar Backup extensions, then the actions associated
  with those extensions may also be specified on the command line. If you
  specify any other actions along with an extended action, the actions will be
  executed in a sensible order per configuration. However, the &quot;all&quot;
  action never executes extended actions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that there is no facility for restoring backups. It is assumed that the
  user can deal with copying tarfiles off disc and using them to restore missing
  files as needed. The user manual provides detailed instructions in Appendix C.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, you should be aware that backups to CD or DVD can probably be read by
  any user which has permissions to mount the CD or DVD drive. If you intend to
  leave the backup disc in the drive at all times, you may want to consider this
  when setting up device permissions on your machine. You might also want to
  investigate the encrypt extension.

  it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If possible, give me the output from --diagnostics, all of the error messages
  that the script printed into its log, and also any stack-traces (exceptions)
  that Python printed. It would be even better if you could tell me how to
  reproduce the problem, for instance by sending me your configuration file.
