Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You may use double hyphens
  instead of single hyphens to denote options. You may use white space in place
  of the equals sign to separate an option name from its value.

<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pamtohdiff</b> takes a PAM (or PNM) image as input and produced a horizontal
  difference image version of it as output. A horizontal difference image is one
  where the samples in each row indicate the difference between the sample value
  in the corresponding sample of the input image and the sample directly above
  it (in the previous row) in the input image. The horizontal difference image
  has the property that if a row of the original image is identical to the row
  above it over a long extent, the corresponding row in the horizontal
  difference image will contain all zeroes. That makes it compress better than
  the original image.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Because the horizontal difference samples can be positive or negative, but PAM
  samples are unsigned integers, the samples in the horizontal difference image
  PAM are defined to be the difference modulus the range of the input (maxval +
  1). This doesn't lose any information, as it might seem, because: of the two
  differences that could result in the same <b>pamtohdiff</b> output value (e.g.
  if maxval is 99, +20 and -80 would both result in &quot;20&quot; in the
  output), only one is possible in context and the other would result, when
  reconstructing the original image, in a value less than 0 or greater than
  maxval.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before the modulus operation, the values <b>pamtohdiff</b> computes are also
  biased by half the maxval. This is to make the results easier to inspect
  visually. Because of the bias, you can display the <b>pamtohdiff</b> output as
  if it were a PNM image. As long as none of your differences are more than half
  the maxval, large negative differences show up as dark spots, smaller negative
  differences are lighter, zero differences are medium intensity, and positive
  differences are light. If you want this to work even for images that have
  differences that exceed half the maxval, just use <b>ppmdim 50</b> on the
  original image. To avoid losing information, though, do a <b>pamdepth</b> to
  double the maxval first.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that because of the transfer function just described, a difference of zero,
  which is most common, is represented by a PAM sample value in the output of
  one half the maxval.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The output PAM has a tuple type of &quot;hdiff&quot;.

You can use <b>hdifftopam</b> to recover the original image from a horizontal
  difference image PAM.
