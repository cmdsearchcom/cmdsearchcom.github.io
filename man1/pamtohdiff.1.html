<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pamtohdiff - convert PAM image to horizontal difference
image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pamtohdiff [pamfile] [-verbose]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimum unique abbreviation of
option is acceptable. You may use double hyphens instead of
single hyphens to denote options. You may use white space in
place of the equals sign <br>
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamtohdiff takes a PAM (or PNM)
image as input and produced a horizontal difference image
version of it as output. A horizontal difference image is
one where the samples in each <br>
row indicate the difference between the sample value in the
corresponding sample of the input image and the sample
directly above it (in the previous row) in the input image.
<br>
The horizontal difference image has the property that if a
row of the original image is identical to the row above it
over a long extent, the corresponding row in the horizontal
<br>
difference image will contain all zeroes. That makes it
compress better than the original image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because the horizontal
difference samples can be positive or negative, but PAM
samples are unsigned integers, the samples in the horizontal
difference image PAM are defined to be <br>
the difference modulus the range of the input (maxval + 1).
This doesn&rsquo;t lose any information, as it might seem,
because: of the two differences that could result in the
same <br>
pamtohdiff output value (e.g. if maxval is 99, +20 and -80
would both result in &quot;20&quot; in the output), only one
is possible in context and the other would result, when
reconstruct&acirc; <br>
ing the original image, in a value less than 0 or greater
than maxval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before the modulus operation,
the values pamtohdiff computes are also biased by half the
maxval. This is to make the results easier to inspect
visually. Because of the bias, <br>
you can display the pamtohdiff output as if it were a PNM
image. As long as none of your differences are more than
half the maxval, large negative differences show up as dark
<br>
spots, smaller negative differences are lighter, zero
differences are medium intensity, and positive differences
are light. If you want this to work even for images that
have <br>
differences that exceed half the maxval, just use ppmdim 50
on the original image. To avoid losing information, though,
do a pamdepth to double the maxval first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that because of the
transfer function just described, a difference of zero,
which is most common, is represented by a PAM sample value
in the output of one half the maxval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output PAM has a tuple type
of &quot;hdiff&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use hdifftopam to
recover the original image from a horizontal difference
image PAM.</p>
