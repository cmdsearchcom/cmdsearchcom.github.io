<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
r.texture creates raster maps with textural features from a
user-specified raster map layer. The module calculates
textural features based on spatial dependence matrices at 0,
<br>
45, 90, and 135 degrees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to take into account
the scale of the texture to be measured, r.texture allows
the user to define the size of the moving window and the
distance at which to compare <br>
pixel grey values. By default the module averages the
results over the 4 orientations, but the user can also
request output of the texture variables in 4 different
orientations <br>
(flag -s). Please note that angles are defined in degrees of
east and they increase counterclockwise, so 0 is East -
West, 45 is North-East - South-West, 90 is North - South,
135 <br>
is North-West - South-East.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user can either chose one or
several texture measures (see below for their description)
using the method parameter, or can request the creating of
maps for all available <br>
methods with the -a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r.texture assumes grey levels
ranging from 0 to 255 as input. The input is automatically
rescaled to 0 to 255 if the input map range is outside of
this range. In order to <br>
reduce noise in the input data (thus generally reinforcing
the textural features), and to speed up processing, it is
recommended that the user recode the data using
equal-proba&acirc; <br>
bility quantization. Quantization rules for r.recode can be
generated with r.quantile -r using e.g 16 or 32 quantiles
(see example below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Texture is a feature of specific land cover classes in
satellite imagery. It is particularly useful in situations
where spectral differences between classes are small, but
<br>
classes are distinguishable by their organisation on the
ground, often opposing natural to human-made spaces:
cultivated fields vs meadows or golf courses, palm tree
plantations <br>
vs natural rain forest, but texture can also be a natural
phenomen: dune fields, different canopies due to different
tree species. The usefulness and use of texture is highly
<br>
dependent on the resolution of satellite imagery and on the
scale of the human intervention or the phenomenon that
created the texture (also see the discussion of scale
depen&acirc; <br>
dency below). The user should observe the phenomenon
visually in order to determine an adequat setting of the
size parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output of r.texture can
constitute very useful additional variables as input for
image classification or image segmentation (object
recognition). It can be used in super&acirc; <br>
vised classification algorithms such as i.maxlik or i.smap,
or for the identification of objects in i.segment, and/or
for the characterization of these objects and thus, for <br>
example, as one of the raster inputs of the i.segment.stats
addon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, several variables
constitute texture: differences in grey level values,
coarseness as scale of grey level differences, presence or
lack of directionality and regular <br>
patterns. A texture can be characterized by tone (grey level
intensity properties) and structure (spatial relationships).
Since textures are highly scale dependent, hierarchical <br>
textures may occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r.texture uses the common
texture model based on the so-called grey level
co-occurrence matrix as described by Haralick et al (1973).
This matrix is a two-dimensional histogram <br>
of grey levels for a pair of pixels which are separated by a
fixed spatial relationship. The matrix approximates the
joint probability distribution of a pair of pixels. Several
<br>
texture measures are directly computed from the grey level
co-occurrence matrix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following part offers brief
explanations of the Haralick et al texture measures (after
Jensen 1996).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First-order statistics in the
spatial domain <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Sum Average (SA)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Entropy (ENT):
This measure analyses the randomness. It is high when the
values of the moving window have similar values. It is low
when the values are close to either 0 <br>
or 1 (i.e. when the pixels in the local window are
uniform).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Difference
Entropy (DE)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Sum Entropy
(SE)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Variance (VAR):
A measure of gray tone variance within the moving window
(second-order moment about the mean)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Difference
Variance (DV)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Sum Variance
(SV) <br>
Note that measures &quot;mean&quot;, &quot;kurtosis&quot;,
&quot;range&quot;, &quot;skewness&quot;, and &quot;standard
deviation&quot; are available in r.neighbors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Second-order statistics in the
spatial domain <br>
The second-order statistics texture model is based on the
so-called grey level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM; after
Haralick 1979).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Angular Second
Moment (ASM, also called Uniformity): This is a measure of
local homogeneity and the opposite of Entropy. High values
of ASM occur when the pixels in the <br>
moving window are very similar. <br>
Note: The square root of the ASM is sometimes used as a
texture measure, and is called Energy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Inverse
Difference Moment (IDM, also called Homogeneity): This
measure relates inversely to the contrast measure. It is a
direct measure of the local homogeneity of a <br>
digital image. Low values are associated with low
homogeneity and vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Contrast (CON):
This measure analyses the image contrast (locally gray-level
variations) as the linear dependency of grey levels of
neighboring pixels (similarity). Typi&acirc; <br>
cally high, when the scale of local texture is larger than
the distance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Correlation
(COR): This measure analyses the linear dependency of grey
levels of neighboring pixels. Typically high, when the scale
of local texture is larger than the <br>
distance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Information
Measures of Correlation (MOC)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Maximal
Correlation Coefficient (MCC)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The computational region should
be set to the input map with g.region rast=&lt;input
map&gt;, or aligned to the input map with g.region
align=&lt;input map&gt; if only a subregion should be <br>
analyzed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the output of
r.texture will always be smaller than the current region as
only cells for which there are no null cells and for which
all cells of the moving window are <br>
within the current region will contain a value. The output
will thus appear cropped at the margins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Importantly, the input raster
map cannot have more than 255 categories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Calculation of Angular Second Moment of B/W orthophoto
(North Carolina data set): <br>
g.region raster=ortho_2001_t792_1m -p <br>
# set grey level color table 0% black 100% white <br>
r.colors ortho_2001_t792_1m color=grey <br>
# extract grey levels <br>
r.mapcalc &quot;ortho_2001_t792_1m.greylevel =
ortho_2001_t792_1m&quot; <br>
# texture analysis <br>
r.texture ortho_2001_t792_1m.greylevel prefix=ortho_texture
method=asm -s <br>
# display <br>
g.region n=221461 s=221094 w=638279 e=638694 <br>
d.shade color=ortho_texture_ASM_0 shade=ortho_2001_t792_1m
<br>
This calculates four maps (requested texture at four
orientations): ortho_texture_ASM_0, ortho_texture_ASM_45,
ortho_texture_ASM_90, ortho_texture_ASM_135. Reducing the
number <br>
of gray levels (equal-probability quantizing): <br>
g.region -p rast=ortho_2001_t792_1m <br>
r.quantile in=ortho_2001_t792_1m quantiles=16 -r | r.recode
in=ortho_2001_t792_1m out=ortho_2001_t792_1m_q16 rules=-
<br>
The recoded raster map can then be used as input for
r.texture as before.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Second example: analysis of IDM
(homogeneity) on a simple raster with North-South line
pattern. <br>
# import raster <br>
r.in.ascii in=- output=lines &lt;&lt; EOF <br>
north: 9 <br>
south: 0 <br>
east: 9 <br>
west: 0 <br>

EOF <br>
# adjust region to raster <br>
g.region rast=lines <br>
# calculate IDM (homogeneity) in all directions <br>
r.texture -s lines method=idm out=text_lines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following image shows the
original map, the result in East-West direction and the
result in North-South direction, showing how texture can
depend on direction, with texture <br>
perfectly homogeneous (value=1) in the North-South
direction, but quite heterogeneous in East-West direction,
except for those areas where there are three columns of
equal values <br>
(as size=3). The overlayed grid highlights that the texture
measures output maps are cropped at the margins. <br>
IDM textures according to direction</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN ISSUES <br>
The program can run incredibly slow for large raster maps
and large moving windows (size option).</p>
