<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Aghermann -- a sleep research experiment manager and
Achermann et al (1993) model simulator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
aghermann [-l LOG_FILE] [-n] [EXP_ROOT_DIR]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Aghermann is a GTK+ program designed to run Process S
simulations on Slow-Wave Activity profiles from EEG
recordings as outlined in Achermann et al (1993). In this
capacity, <br>
Aghermann produces a set of sleep homeostat parameters which
can be used to describe and differentiate individual
sleepers, such as short vs long sleepers, early vs late,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also provided are
general-purpose facilities for displaying EEG and
accompanying recordings, such as EOG and EMG, saved in EDF
(European Data Format) files (plain EDF as well as <br>
EDF+C are supported). These recordings can then be
conveniently scored; scores can be imported/exported in
plain ASCII. Scoring can be outsourced to external scripts
written in <br>
lua.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS <br>
If run without arguments, your last session will be
restored; an experiment located in EXP_ROOT_DIR will be
selected otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With option -n (and an
EXP_ROOT_DIR, which is non-optional in this case), the
experiment session in that directory will be initialised and
immediately closed, upon which Agher&acirc; <br>
mann will exit. No windows will be open and no GTK+ code
run; this option was implemented with the idea of running
the core structural part of Aghermann under valgrind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With option -l LOG_FILE,
aghermann will write a log of its inner workings to
LOG_FILE; if the latter is &quot;-&quot;, stdout is used. By
default, (almost all) logging is suppressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE ON EDF FILE METADATA <br>
For Aghermann to be able to manage an EDF file, all relevant
fields in its header must be filled out correctly, as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; patient_id
uniquely identifies the subject;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; recording_id
identifies the recording session (out of several other such
sessions, each containing the same series of episodes) and
the individual episode. These two <br>
items must appear in one of the following combinations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Session/Episode&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;Session :
Episode&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;Episode
(Session)&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; recording_date
and recording_time must not overlap with other episodes in
the same session and not be too far removed from each other
(more than 7 days).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.config/aghermann/sessionrc, contains a list of paths to
recent experiment trees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./.agherman.conf and
./.expdesign.conf, saved settings of the experiment located
in <br>
this tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
edfhed-gtk(1), edfhed(1), edfcat(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The project&acirc;s git
repository is kept on sf.net and also on github.com; more
details on the Achermann model as well as on usage and
project background can be found at http://john&acirc; <br>
