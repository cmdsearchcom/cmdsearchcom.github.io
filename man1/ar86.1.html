<p>ar86(1) General Commands Manual ar86(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ar86 - Create, modify, and extract from archive file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ar86 operation archive [file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ar86 positional-op member
archive [file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ar86 program is used to create, examine and modify
archive files produced by the Dev86/ELKS toolchain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The ar86 command requires that the operation to be performed
on the archive be specified as the first option. If the
operation is positional then the next option is the archive
<br>
member marking the position. This is followed by the archive
file name and any list of file names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operations <br>
One of the following operations can be specified</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d delete the listed files from
the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m move the named files. By
default files are moved to the end of the archive unless a
positional modifier is present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p print the contents of archive
members to standard out. If a file list is included only
those members are printed. If the v modifier is present each
file&rsquo;s contents are <br>
preceeded by a new line, a line with the string member, a
space character, the member name, and two following
newlines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q quickly add the files to the
end of the archive without checking to see if they already
exist in the archive. This operation will ignore any
positional modifiers. Creates <br>
the archive file if it does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r replace archive members with
the files listed. If the file name is not present in the
archive it is added to the end of the archive (or to any
explicitly specified <br>
position). Creates the archive file if it does not
exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t table; list the file names of
archive members. If a file list is present only those files
that are present in the archive are listed. The v modifier
prints member <br>
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x extract the named files from
the archive into the current directory. If no files are
specified all the archive members will be extracted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modifiers <br>
The following modifiers may be used with the operations</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o original time stamps from the
archive are preserved for extracted files when possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s symbol update; this option may
be used by itself to force an update to the symbol
definition section of the archive (the __.SYMDEF member). If
any files are specified they <br>
will be replaced as if the r operation had been specified.
If no symbol definition section exists one is created. This
option will also creates the archive file if it does <br>
not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u update files in the archive
during a r (replace) operation. The files are added to the
archive in exactly the same manner as replace except that an
existing archive member <br>
will be retained (in its original position) if it has a
modified more recently than the file being added. Note that
this modifier acts as if a r operation has been <br>
specified (even it has not), and will actually override any
other previously specified operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v verbose; print additional
diagnostic messages while processing the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Positional Modifiers <br>
The following modifiers specify where in the archive files
are moved to or added. If any of these modifiers are
specified then the second option to ar86 must be the name of
an <br>
archive member.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a after; files are placed after
the specified archive member.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b before; files are placed
before the specified archive member.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i same as b.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To see the contents of an archive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ar86 tv libfile.a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To add some files to an
archive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ar86 r libfile.a file1.o
file2.o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to add some files after a member
named mem.o and to update the symbol table</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ar86 rsa mem.o libfile.a file1.o
file2.o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
A l modifier will be accepted but ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
This command is intended for use only with object files
created using the Dev86/ELKS toolchain.</p>
