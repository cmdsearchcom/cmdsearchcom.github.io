<p>PMDASENDMAIL(1) General Commands Manual
PMDASENDMAIL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmdasendmail - sendmail performance metrics domain agent
(PMDA)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sendmail/pmdasendmail [-d domain] [-l
logfile] [-U username]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmdasendmail is a sendmail Performance Metrics Domain Agent
(PMDA) which exports mail traffic statistics as collected by
sendmail(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before the sendmail PMDA can
export any metrics, sendmail(1) must have statistics
collection enabled. This involves checking the name of the
statistics file, as given by the OS <br>
or O StatusFile control lines in /etc/sendmail.cf, and then
creating this file if it does not already exist. Removing
the file will terminate statistics collection by send&acirc;
<br>
mail(1) and hence the sendmail PMDA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A brief description of the
pmdasendmail command line options follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d It is absolutely crucial that
the performance metrics domain number specified here is
unique and consistent. That is, domain should be different
for every PMDA on the one <br>
host, and the same domain number should be used for the same
PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Location of the log file. By
default, a log file named sendmail.log is written in the
current directory of pmcd(1) when pmdasendmail is started,
i.e. $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. <br>
If the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output
is written to the standard error instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U User account under which to
run the agent. The default is the unprivileged
&quot;pcp&quot; account in current versions of PCP, but in
older versions the superuser account (&quot;root&quot;) <br>
was used by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are no communication
options, as the Install script ensures the sendmail PMDA
will be connected to PMCD by a pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
If you want access to the names, help text and values for
the sendmail performance metrics, do the following as
root:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sendmail
<br>
# ./Install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to undo the
installation, do the following as root:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sendmail
<br>
# ./Remove</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmdasendmail is launched by
pmcd(1) and should never be executed directly. The Install
and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the agent is
installed or removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH <br>
command line options used to launch pmdasendmail <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sendmail/help <br>
default help text file for the sendmail metrics <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sendmail/Install <br>
installation script for the pmdasendmail agent <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sendmail/Remove <br>
undo installation script for the pmdasendmail agent <br>
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/sendmail.log <br>
default log file for error messages and other information
from pmdasendmail <br>
/etc/sendmail.cf <br>
sendmail configuration file to identify the name of the
statistics file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
