<p>RLOG(1) General Commands Manual RLOG(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rlog - print log messages and other information about RCS
files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rlog [ options ] file ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
rlog prints information about RCS files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filenames matching an RCS suffix
denote RCS files; all others denote working files. Names are
paired as explained in ci(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rlog prints the following
information for each RCS file: RCS file name, working file
name, head (i.e., the number of the latest revision on the
trunk), default branch, access <br>
list, locks, symbolic names, suffix, total number of
revisions, number of revisions selected for printing, and
descriptive text. This is followed by entries for the
selected <br>
revisions in reverse chronological order for each branch.
For each revision, rlog prints revision number, author,
date/time, state, number of lines added/deleted (with
respect <br>
to the previous revision), locker of the revision (if any),
and log message. All times are displayed in Coordinated
Universal Time (UTC) by default; this can be overridden with
<br>
-z. Without options, rlog prints complete information. The
options below restrict this output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Ignore RCS files that have no
locks set. This is convenient in combination with -h, -l,
and -R.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Print only the name of the
RCS file. This is convenient for translating a working file
name into an RCS file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print only the RCS file name,
working file name, head, default branch, access list, locks,
symbolic names, and suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Print the same as -h, plus
the descriptive text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Do not print the symbolic
names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Print information about the
revisions on the default branch, normally the highest branch
on the trunk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ddates <br>
Print information about revisions with a checkin date/time
in the ranges given by the semicolon-separated list of
dates. A range of the form d1&lt;d2 or d2&gt;d1 selects the
revi&acirc; <br>
sions that were deposited between d1 and d2 exclusive. A
range of the form &lt;d or d&gt; selects all revisions
earlier than d. A range of the form d&lt; or &gt;d selects
all revisions <br>
dated later than d. If &lt; or &gt; is followed by = then
the ranges are inclusive, not exclusive. A range of the form
d selects the single, latest revision dated d or earlier.
<br>
The date/time strings d, d1, and d2 are in the free format
explained in co(1). Quoting is normally necessary,
especially for &lt; and &gt;. Note that the separator is a
semi&acirc; <br>
colon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l[lockers] <br>
Print information about locked revisions only. In addition,
if the comma-separated list lockers of login names is given,
ignore all locks other than those held by the lock&acirc;
<br>
ers. For example, rlog -L -R -lwft RCS/* prints the name of
RCS files locked by the user wft.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r[revisions] <br>
prints information about revisions given in the
comma-separated list revisions of revisions and ranges. A
range rev1:rev2 means revisions rev1 to rev2 on the same
branch, <br>
:rev means revisions from the beginning of the branch up to
and including rev, and rev: means revisions starting with
rev to the end of the branch containing rev. An argu&acirc;
<br>
ment that is a branch means all revisions on that branch. A
range of branches means all revisions on the branches in
that range. A branch followed by a . means the latest <br>
revision in that branch. A bare -r with no revisions means
the latest revision on the default branch, normally the
trunk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sstates <br>
prints information about revisions whose state attributes
match one of the states given in the comma-separated list
states.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w[logins] <br>
prints information about revisions checked in by users with
login names appearing in the comma-separated list logins. If
logins is omitted, the user&rsquo;s login is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q This option has no effect; it
is provided for consistency with other commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T This option has no effect; it
is present for compatibility with other RCS commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print RCS&rsquo;s version
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Vn Emulate RCS version n when
generating logs. See co(1) for more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xsuffixes <br>
Use suffixes to characterize RCS files. See ci(1) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rlog prints the intersection of
the revisions selected with the options -d, -l, -s, and -w,
intersected with the union of the revisions selected by -b
and -r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-zzone specifies the date output
format, and specifies the default time zone for date in the
-ddates option. The zone should be empty, a numeric UTC
offset, or the special <br>
string LT for local time. The default is an empty zone,
which uses the traditional RCS format of UTC without any
time zone indication and with slashes separating the <br>
parts of the date; otherwise, times are output in ISO 8601
format with time zone indication. For example, if local time
is January 11, 1990, 8pm Pacific Standard Time, <br>
eight hours west of UTC, then the time is output as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">option time output <br>
-z 1990/01/12 04:00:00 (default) <br>
-zLT 1990-01-11 20:00:00-08 <br>
-z+05:30 1990-01-12 09:30:00+05:30</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
rlog -L -R RCS/* <br>
rlog -L -h RCS/* <br>
rlog -L -l RCS/* <br>
rlog RCS/*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first command prints the
names of all RCS files in the subdirectory RCS that have
locks. The second command prints the headers of those files,
and the third prints the head&acirc; <br>
ers plus the log messages of the locked revisions. The last
command prints complete information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
RCSINIT <br>
Options prepended to the argument list, separated by spaces.
A backslash escapes spaces within an option. The RCSINIT
options are prepended to the argument lists of most <br>
RCS commands. Useful RCSINIT options include -q, -V, -x, and
-z.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RCS_MEM_LIMIT <br>
An integer lim, measured in kilobytes, specifying the
threshold under which commands will try to use memory-based
operations for processing the RCS file. (For RCS files <br>
of size lim kilobytes or greater, RCS will use the slower
standard input/output routines.) Default value is 256.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR Name of the temporary
directory. If not set, the environment variables TMP and
TEMP are inspected instead and the first value found is
taken; if none of them are set, a <br>
host-dependent default is used, typically /tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The exit status is zero if and only if all operations were
successful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The full documentation for RCS
is maintained as a Texinfo manual. If the info(1) and RCS
programs are properly installed at your site, the
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info rcs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">should give you access to the
complete manual. Additionally, the RCS homepage:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">has news and links to the latest
release, development site, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The separator for revision ranges in the -r option used to
be - instead of :, but this leads to confusion when symbolic
names contain -. For backwards compatibility rlog -r <br>
still supports the old - separator, but it warns about this
obsolete use.</p>
