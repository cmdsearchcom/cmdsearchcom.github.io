ftpcopy copies a FTP site recursivly. It afterwards deletes all files in the
  local directory tree which were not found on the remote site.
<div class="Pp"></div>
local-directory defaults to `.' - the current working directory - if the
  --no-delete option is used. local-directory is not needed if the --interactive
  option is used. Otherwise you must provide a local-directory argument.

    Limit the transfer rate of file downloads to about that many bytes per

    The default is to take the times from the directory listings. This doesn't

      doesn't send time stamps in universal coordinated time (UTC). The damage
      caused by this is limited to file time stamps being wrong by a few hours.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    This option makes ftpcopy send a MDTM command for any file it might want to
      download. The drawback is that this eats performance: ftpcopy usually
      sends just one command for a complete directory its traverses. With the
      --mdtm option it has to send an additional command for any file.

    Normally ftpls only accepts data connections to the IP addresses it received

      this is not enough, especially when NAT or masquerading are active.
      ftpcopy then prints an error message `illegal redirect by FTP server'.
      With this option, which may be given more than once, you can add
      additional addresses to the internal list of allowed data connection
      targets. <i>IP4</i> has to be an IPv4 address or a list of IPv4 addresses,
      separated by commas.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    The environment variable FTPCOPY_ALLOW_PASV_IP serves the same purpose.

mirror cr.yp.to:
<pre>
  ftpcopy  \
  --exclude '*.cdb'  \
  --exclude '*software/precompiled*' \
  cr.yp.to / /private/file/0/mirror/cr.yp.to
</pre>
This means:
<pre>
  * i'm not interested in .cdb files.
  * precompiled stuff is also not downloaded.
  * the host to connect to is cr.yp.to.
  * the remote directory is /, and
  * and /private/file/0/mirror/cr.yp.to is the local directory.
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="IN/EXCLUDE"><a class="selflink" href="#IN/EXCLUDE">IN/EXCLUDE</a></h1>
In- and exclude lists are internally mixed together, keeping the order in which
  they were given. The list starts with an implicit `include *'. ftpcopy honors
  the last match.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The wildcard matching is done against the full remote path of the file. The `/'
  character has no special meaning for the matching and is treated like any
  other.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note: you have to include top level directories of files or directories you want
  to include. Something like this will NOT work:
<pre>
    --exclude '*' --include '/w/h/e/r/e/file.c'
</pre>
You need to include /w, /w/h and so on.
