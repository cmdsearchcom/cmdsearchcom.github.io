<p>ftpcopy(1) User Commands ftpcopy(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ftpcopy - create and maintain a ftp mirror.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ftpcopy [options] host[:port] remotedir [localdir] <br>
or: ftpcopy [options] ftp://host[:port]/remotedir
[localdir]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ftpcopy copies a FTP site recursivly. It afterwards deletes
all files in the local directory tree which were not found
on the remote site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local-directory defaults to
&lsquo;.&rsquo; - the current working directory - if the
--no-delete option is used. local-directory is not needed if
the --interactive option is used. Otherwise <br>
you must provide a local-directory argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Connect / login / username / password options: <br>
-u, --user=NAME <br>
Use NAME to login on the ftp server. <br>
The default is &lsquo;anonymous&rsquo;. Use an empty name to
force the program to not log in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pass=PASSWORD <br>
Use PASS as password to login on the ftp server. <br>
The default is &lsquo;anonymous@invalid.example&rsquo;. If
an empty password is given the programm will not send a
password to the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--account=ACCOUNT <br>
Send ACCOUNT as account name during login phase. <br>
Note: this is _not_ the user name, but the name of what
could be called a subaccount implemented by a few servers.
If you don&rsquo;t understand what it means you have a good
<br>
chance to never need this option anyway. If you think you
need it please try the --user option first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tries=ARG <br>
Number of tries to connect and log in. <br>
The default is 1, meaning that the program will give up
after the first error. <br>
This option was added in version 0.3.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--data-connect-retries=ARG <br>
Number of tries to connect to data port. <br>
The program will try to reach the data port (for retrieval
of listings or data) that many times and will give up after
that many errors in a row. The default is 5, meaning <br>
that the program will give up after the fifth error. <br>
This option was added in version 0.6.6. The old behaviour
was to give up after the first error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--login-sleep=ARG <br>
Seconds to sleep after a failed login. <br>
More precisely: the program will fall to sleep for this many
seconds after a try to connect or login has failed. The
default is 5. A 0 is treated as 1, and abuse, espe&acirc;
<br>
cially together with --tries, is likely to annory the
servers adminstrators. <br>
This option was added in version 0.4.5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4, --v4 <br>
Only use IPv4, even if v6 is available. <br>
This option effectively disallows the use of IPv6, except
for DNS queries. <br>
It was added in version 0.6.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6, --v6 <br>
Only use IPv6, even if v4 is available. <br>
This option effectively disallows the use of IPv4, except
for DNS queries. <br>
It was added in version 0.6.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verbosity options: <br>
-l, --loglevel=ARG <br>
Controls the amount of logging done. <br>
0: nothing except warnings and error messages. <br>
1: downloads and deletes (this is the default). <br>
2: links/symlinks created, files we already got. <br>
3: useless stuff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bps Log transfer rates. <br>
This option causes ftpcopy to log byte / kilobyte / megabyte
per second information after successful transfers. <br>
This option was added in version 0.3.9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--progress <br>
Report progress to stderr. <br>
This will print a report of the download every second: a
short form of the file name, the bytes got and expected and
the percentage received. <br>
This option was added in version 0.6.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File selection options: <br>
-m, --max-days=DAYS <br>
Download only files modified in the last DAYS. <br>
Locally existing copies of the not downloaded files will be
kept. The default is not to restrict the age of files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-size=MAXBYTES <br>
Download only files up to MAXBYTES length. <br>
Locally existing copies of overlong files will be deleted
during the clean-up step. The default is not to restrict the
file size. <br>
This option was added in version 0.5.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --exclude=WILDCARD <br>
Exclude paths matching WILDCARD. <br>
If WILDCARD matches the full path of the remote file then
the file will not be downloaded. WILDCARD is a shell style
wildcard expression, not a regular expression like <br>
those of grep. You can repeat this option as often as you
want, and you can intermix it with the --include option.
<br>
If both includes and excludes are used then the last
matching one will be honored. The list starts with an
implicit &rsquo;--include *&rsquo;. <br>
If the --tolower option is used together with --exclude or
--include then the in/exclude patterns have to be written in
lower case. <br>
This option was added in version 0.3.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --include=WILDCARD <br>
Include paths matching WILDCARD. <br>
This is the opposite of the --exclude option. <br>
It was added in version 0.3.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X, --in-exclude-file=FILE <br>
Read in/exclude patterns from FILE. <br>
The include and exclude patterns are read from a file. If
the first character of a line is a &rsquo;+&rsquo; the
remainder of the line is treated as an argument of a
--include optiona <br>
and if it is a &rsquo;-&rsquo; it is treated as an argument
to a --exclude option. Lines starting with a &rsquo;#&rsquo;
are ignored. <br>
FILE will be read after any --include and --exclude options
given on the command line have been read. <br>
This option was added in version 0.6.6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-size <br>
Ignore file size. <br>
Do not compare file sizes when checking the remote file has
to be downloaded. <br>
This option was added in version 0.4.4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-time <br>
Ignore modification times. <br>
Do not compare file modification times when checking the
remote file has to be downloaded. This option may be
combined with --ignore-size, in which case a file will never
<br>
be downloaded regardless of changes in file size or
modification time. In other words: ftpcopy will not download
any updates. <br>
This option was added in version 0.4.4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-depth=ARG <br>
Descend at most LEVEL directories. <br>
0 means &lsquo;do not enter sub directories at all&rsquo;,
<br>
1 means &lsquo;enter sub-directories, but not their
sub-directories&rsquo;. <br>
The default is 2^32-1 meaning &lsquo;enter all&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deletion options: <br>
-n, --no-delete <br>
Do not delete files. <br>
This influences the cleanup step when getting rid of things
the server doesn&rsquo;t have anymore. It does not stop
ftpcopy from deleting files when it detects something in
it&rsquo;s <br>
way during a download.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --max-deletes=COUNT <br>
Do not delete more then COUNT files. <br>
This option may be useful to limit the impact of a tempoary
loss of files on the server. This only influences the
cleanup step and does not stop ftpcopy to delete files in
<br>
it&rsquo;s way during a download. The default is 0, meaning
unlimited. <br>
This option was added in version 0.4.5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operational options: <br>
-d, --directories-only <br>
Only create the directory hierarchie. <br>
Do not download files. Any file in the tree will be deleted
unless the -n option is also given. <br>
This option will be removed in future versions, unless
someone objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dry-run <br>
Don&rsquo;t do anything. <br>
ftpcopy will only show what would be done. <br>
This option was added in version 0.3.6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --timeout=SECONDS <br>
Timeout to use for network read/write. <br>
The default is 30 seconds and is usually sufficient. <br>
This option was added in version 0.3.8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rate-limit=BYTES_PER_SECOND
<br>
Limit file download speed. <br>
Limit the transfer rate of file downloads to about that many
bytes per seconds. The implementation is crude and simple,
by sleeping up to one second between network reads, <br>
and therefore does not even try to limit the rate exactly to
that number. On the other hand it usually works and is
unlikely to break things by causing timeouts. <br>
The default is unlimited. <br>
This option was added in version 0.4.7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--interactive <br>
Read directories from stdin. <br>
This option tells ftpcopy to ignore any directories given on
the command line, and to read commands from the standard
input. Each command consists of two lines, the first <br>
being a directory on the remote server, and the second a
local directory. ftpcopy will print an END-OF-COPY line
after each operation. <br>
This option was added in version 0.3.6 and will be removed
in future versions, unless someone objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Workaround options: <br>
--ascii-listings <br>
Do directory listings in ASCII mode. <br>
Use this option if the FTP server is unable to correctly
list directories in binary mode, for example, if you see a
message like this (usually on one line): <br>
&lsquo;fatal: received unwanted answer to LIST: 426 Data
connection: Illegal seek.&rsquo; <br>
This option was added in version 0.5.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --list-options=OPTS <br>
Add OPTS to LIST command. <br>
This allows to pass arbitrary options to the FTP servers
LIST command. Note that ftpcopy does not cope well with
recursive directory listings. <br>
This option was added in version 0.3.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --symlink-hack <br>
Deal with symbolic links. <br>
This is only useful to mirror sites which create listings
through /bin/ls, and will fail if a file name in a link
contains a &lsquo; -&gt; &rsquo; sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force-select <br>
Use select, not poll. <br>
Do not use the poll() system call even if it&rsquo;s
available, but use select() instead. This allows the program
to be used together with runsocks from the socks5 reference
<br>
implementation. <br>
Please note that you will need a directly reachable name
server anyway, as the DNS library in use does not support
SOCKS (you can always use IP addresses). <br>
This option was added in version 0.3.8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mdtm Use the MDTM command to
get the remote time. <br>
The default is to take the times from the directory
listings. This doesn&rsquo;t work if the server implements
an inferior listing format (most do) and doesn&rsquo;t send
time stamps <br>
in universal coordinated time (UTC). The damage caused by
this is limited to file time stamps being wrong by a few
hours. <br>
This option makes ftpcopy send a MDTM command for any file
it might want to download. The drawback is that this eats
performance: ftpcopy usually sends just one command <br>
for a complete directory its traverses. With the --mdtm
option it has to send an additional command for any file.
<br>
This option was added in version 0.3.10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-pasv-ip=IP4 <br>
Allow data connections to the address IP4. <br>
Normally ftpls only accepts data connections to the IP
addresses it received as an answer to the DNS request, or
the IP address in the URL. Sometimes this is not enough,
<br>
especially when NAT or masquerading are active. ftpcopy then
prints an error message &lsquo;illegal redirect by FTP
server&rsquo;. With this option, which may be given more
than once, <br>
you can add additional addresses to the internal list of
allowed data connection targets. IP4 has to be an IPv4
address or a list of IPv4 addresses, separated by commas.
<br>
The environment variable FTPCOPY_ALLOW_PASV_IP serves the
same purpose. <br>
Note: Do not use this option without thinking: FTP redirects
may be used to launch denial of service attacks against
innocent targets. <br>
This option was added in version 0.6.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-resume <br>
Do not try to resume downloads. <br>
The REST command, needed to resume a failed <br>
download, is badly specified and likely to be misinterpreted
and -implemented. Use this option in case of trouble. <br>
This option was added in version 0.6.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tolower <br>
Change all local file names to lowercase. <br>
Use this only if you are absolutely sure that the remote
side does not contain any files or directories whose lower
cased names collide with each other. Otherwise this <br>
option will waste bandwidth. <br>
If this option is used together with the --exclude or
--include options then the in/exclude patterns have to be
written in lower case. <br>
This option was added in version 0.3.8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help options: <br>
--include-exclude-help <br>
How --include and --exclude work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--examples <br>
Show usage examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--see-also <br>
Where to find related information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Show version: ftpcopy (ftpcopy) 0.6.7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Show a list of options or
the long help on one. <br>
The use with an argument shows the long help text <br>
of that option, without an argument it will list <br>
all options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--longhelp <br>
Show longer help texts for all or one option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
mirror cr.yp.to: <br>
ftpcopy --exclude &rsquo;*.cdb&rsquo; --exclude
&rsquo;*software/precompiled*&rsquo; cr.yp.to /
/private/file/0/mirror/cr.yp.to <br>
This means: <br>
* i&rsquo;m not interested in .cdb files. <br>
* precompiled stuff is also not downloaded. <br>
* the host to connect to is cr.yp.to. <br>
* the remote directory is /, and <br>
* and /private/file/0/mirror/cr.yp.to is the local
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IN/EXCLUDE <br>
In- and exclude lists are internally mixed together, keeping
the order in which they were given. The list starts with an
implicit &lsquo;include *&rsquo;. ftpcopy honors the last
match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The wildcard matching is done
against the full remote path of the file. The
&lsquo;/&rsquo; character has no special meaning for the
matching and is treated like any other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: you have to include top
level directories of files or directories you want to
include. Something like this will NOT work: <br>
--exclude &rsquo;*&rsquo; --include
&rsquo;/w/h/e/r/e/file.c&rsquo; <br>
You need to include /w, /w/h and so on.</p>
