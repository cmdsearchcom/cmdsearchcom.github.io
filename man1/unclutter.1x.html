<p>UNCLUTTER(1X) UNCLUTTER(1X)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
unclutter - remove idle cursor image from screen</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
unclutter [-display|-d display] [-idle seconds] [-keystroke]
[-jitter pixels] [-grab] [-noevents] [-reset] [-root]
[-onescreen] [-not] name ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
unclutter removes the cursor image from the screen so that
it does not obstruct the area you are looking at after it
has not moved for a given time. It does not do this if the
<br>
cursor is in the root window or a button is down. It tries
to ignore jitter (small movements due to noise) if you have
a mouse that twitches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-display <br>
is followed by the display to open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-idle is followed by the number
of seconds between polls for idleness. The default is 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keystroke <br>
tells unclutter not to use a timeout to determine when to
remove the cursor, but to instead wait until a key has been
pressed (released, really).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jitter <br>
is followed by the amount of movement of the pointer that is
to be ignored and considered as random noise. The default is
0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-grab means use the original
method of grabbing the pointer in order to remove the
cursor. This often doesn&rsquo;t interoperate too well with
some window managers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noevents <br>
stops unclutter sending a pseudo EnterNotify event to the X
client whose cursor has been stolen. Sending the event helps
programs like emacs think that they have not lost <br>
the pointer focus. This option is provided for backwards
compatibility in case some clients get upset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-reset resets the timeout for
idleness after the cursor is restored for some reason (such
as a window being pushed or popped) even though the x y
coordinates of the cursor have <br>
not changed. Normally, the cursor would immediately be
removed again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-root means remove the cursor
even if it is on the root background, where in principle it
should not be obscuring anything useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-onescreen <br>
restricts unclutter to the single screen specified as
display, or the default screen for the display. Normally,
unclutter will unclutter all the screens on a display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-not is followed by a list of
window names where the cursor should not be removed. The
first few characters of the WM_NAME property on the window
need to match one the listed <br>
names. This argument must be the last on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
The -keystroke option may not work (that is, the cursor will
not disappear) with clients that request KeyRelease events.
Games and Xt applications using KeyUp in their
transla&acirc; <br>
tion tables are most likely to suffer from this problem. The
most feasible solution is to extend unclutter to use the
XTest extension to get all keyboard and mouse events, <br>
though this of course requires XTest to be in the server
too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -keystroke option does not
distinguish modifier keys from keys which actually generate
characters. If desired this could be implemented in a simple
way by using XLookup&acirc; <br>
String to see if any characters are returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">someone created a sub-window to
my sub-window!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">means that unclutter thinks a
second unclutter is running, and tried to steal the cursor
by creating a sub-window to the sub-window already used to
steal the cursor. This situa&acirc; <br>
tion quickly deteriorates into a fight no one can win, so it
is detected when possible and the program gives up.</p>
