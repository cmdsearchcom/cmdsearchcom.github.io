<b>unclutter</b> removes the cursor image from the screen so that it does not
  obstruct the area you are looking at after it has not moved for a given time.
  It does not do this if the cursor is in the root window or a button is down.
  It tries to ignore jitter (small movements due to noise) if you have a mouse
  that twitches.

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-grab</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">means use the original method of grabbing the pointer in
      order to remove the cursor. This often doesn't interoperate too well with
      some window managers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-noevents</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">stops unclutter sending a pseudo EnterNotify event to the X
      client whose cursor has been stolen. Sending the event helps programs like
      emacs think that they have not lost the pointer focus. This option is
      provided for backwards compatibility in case some clients get upset.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-reset</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">resets the timeout for idleness after the cursor is
      restored for some reason (such as a window being pushed or popped) even
      though the x y coordinates of the cursor have not changed. Normally, the
      cursor would immediately be removed again.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-root</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">means remove the cursor even if it is on the root
      background, where in principle it should not be obscuring anything
    useful.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-onescreen</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">restricts unclutter to the single screen specified as
      display, or the default screen for the display. Normally, unclutter will
      unclutter all the screens on a display.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-not</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">is followed by a list of window names where the cursor
      should not be removed. The first few characters of the WM_NAME property on
      the window need to match one the listed names. This argument must be the
      last on the command line.</dd>

The -keystroke option may not work (that is, the cursor will not disappear) with
  clients that request KeyRelease events. Games and Xt applications using KeyUp
  in their translation tables are most likely to suffer from this problem. The
  most feasible solution is to extend unclutter to use the XTest extension to
  get all keyboard and mouse events, though this of course requires XTest to be
  in the server too.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The -keystroke option does not distinguish modifier keys from keys which
  actually generate characters. If desired this could be implemented in a simple
  way by using XLookupString to see if any characters are returned.

The message
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 someone created a sub-window to my sub-window!
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
means that unclutter thinks a second unclutter is running, and tried to steal
  the cursor by creating a sub-window to the sub-window already used to steal
  the cursor. This situation quickly deteriorates into a fight no one can win,
  so it is detected when possible and the program gives up.
