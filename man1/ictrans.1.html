<p>ICTRANS(1NCARG) NCAR GRAPHICS ICTRANS(1NCARG)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ictrans - interactive NCAR CGM translator ctrans</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ictrans [ -d device ] [ -font font ] [ -e script ]* [ -soft
] [ -bell ] [ -lmin min ] [ -lmax max ] [ -lscale scale ] [
-pal pal_fname ] [ -Version ] [ -wid window_id ] [ <br>
device-specific options ] metafile...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ictrans is the user interface to the Computer Graphics
Metafile (CGM) translator ctrans. ictrans will enter command
interpreter mode upon invocation and await instructions from
<br>
the user. When waiting for commands from the user, ictrans
displays the prompt &lsquo;ictrans&gt;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upon invocation ictrans performs
a configuration of its spooled device table. The table is
configured by processing several sources. ictrans first
searches for the file <br>
ncarv_spool in the $NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg directory. If the
file exists ictrans will load it into the spooled device
table. Next, ictrans searches for the file .ncarv_spool in
<br>
the user&rsquo;s home directory. If found, its contents are
merged into the spooler table. Finally, the NCARV_SPOOL
environment variable may contain the definition for a single
<br>
spooler. If this variable is set, its contents also are
merged into the table. Each entry in the above set of
sources is identified by a name. If a conflict in names
exists then <br>
the last entry encountered takes precedence. i.e. the
previous entry of the same name is overridden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-bell Ring the bell at the end of each frame. The default is
to run in silent mode. This option is not supported by all
devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d device <br>
Device name. ictrans will use the Graphcap (if it exists) or
the appropriate graphics library indicated by device;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If device is preceded by a UNIX
directory path then ictrans will look in that directory for
the specified graphcap. Otherwise ictrans searches the
directory <br>
$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/graphcaps for the graphcap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For all device specifications
except X11 output is directed to standard out. In the case
of X11 translation results in appropriate calls to the X11
libraries. See graph&acirc; <br>
cap(5NCARG) for a description of supported devices. See
gcaps(1NCARG) for a list of devices supported by your
particular configuration of ctrans.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option overrides the
GRAPHCAP environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e script <br>
script is a single ictrans command. The valid ictrans
commands are discussed in the COMMANDS section below.
Multiple -e options may appear on a single command line. Be
<br>
careful to use quotes if your command contains spaces or
metacharacters that might be interpreted by the shell. When
this option is used ictrans does not enter interactive <br>
mode. It simply performs the given commands and then
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-font fontcap <br>
Fontcap file to be used for stroking text. When interpreting
CGM TEXT command elements use fontcap as the default font
for textual translation. Note: CGMs may contain <br>
textual descriptions which are not embedded in CGM TEXT
elements. Hence they are not influenced by fontcap
specifications. Note also that a CGM may explicitly specify
a <br>
named font which may override a font provided on the command
line. The environment variable FONTCAP may also be used to
specify a default fontcap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If fontcap is preceded by a UNIX
directory path then ictrans will look in that directory for
the specified fontcap. Otherwise ictrans searches the
directory <br>
$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/fontcaps for the fontcap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See fontcap(5NCARG) for a
description of the available fontcaps. See fcap(1NCARG) for
a list of the fontcaps installed on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option overrides the
FONTCAP environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lmin min <br>
On devices which support line width scaling all lines are
guaranteed to be scaled at least min times the default line
width for that device. This option effectively <br>
insures that the minimum value for the CGM element
&quot;LINE WIDTH&quot; is min.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lmax max <br>
On devices which support line width scaling all lines are
guaranteed to be scaled at most max times the default line
width for that device. This option effectively insures <br>
that the maximum value for the CGM element &quot;LINE
WIDTH&quot; is max. The results of setting max less then min
are undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lscale scale <br>
On devices which support line width scaling all line width
specifications within the metafile will be scaled by scale.
will be scaled scale This option is subject to mod&acirc;
<br>
ification by the -lmin and -lmax options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pal pal_fname <br>
Use the color palette defined in the file pal_fname for
subsequent translation of the metafile. This palette will
override any color map defined by the CGM being trans&acirc;
<br>
lated. For a description of the format of pal_fname see
ras_palette(5NCARG).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-soft Unconditionally perform
software filling of all filled polygons. This option may be
useful for devices which have limits on the number of
vertices describing a polygon. On <br>
some devices this number is known and software filling is
performed, as appropriate, without user specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Version <br>
Print the version number and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVICE SPECIFIC OPTIONS <br>
ictrans accepts an identical set of device-specific options
to that of ctrans. For a description of the device-specific
options see ctrans(1NCARG).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
Command Structure <br>
ictrans commands have a simple and regular structure.
Commands which operate directly on the metafile being
processed may be preceded by a frame_list which designate
the frames <br>
to which the command applies. Some commands accept
arguments. Anything following a command name is regarded as
an argument:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">( frame [ ,frame ])* command (
argument )*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A comma-separated pair of frames
implies the inclusive list of frames. If a frame list is
omitted and a command requires a frame then the current
frame is used as the default. <br>
If no argument list is specified and one is required then a
default argument is used whenever possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the command 1,5 8
save /tmp/foo would write the first through fifth and the
eighth frame of the metafile to the file /tmp/foo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands will ignore any
unexpected arguments. Command names may be abbreviated up to
the point that they are unique.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Frame Lists <br>
Frames can be addressed in several ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nnn By frame number. Frames are
assigned a relative number from first to last in the
metafile. The first frame is numbered 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ The last frame in the
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">. The current frame. ictrans
keeps track of the last frame upon which an operation was
performed. This frame is called the &quot;current
frame&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">frame+-n <br>
A frame number followed by a plus sign (+) or a minus sign
(-), followed by a decimal number, specifies the frame plus
or minus the indicated number of frames. frame may <br>
be omitted in which case the current frame is assumed. For
example, &lsquo;10+2&rsquo; addresses frame 12 in the
metafile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands <br>
! command <br>
Run command as a shell command on the local machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias [ name [ def ] ] <br>
Assign def to the alias name. If def is omitted, the alias
name is displayed along with its current definition. If both
name and def are omitted, all aliases are dis&acirc; <br>
played. def is of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">: [ ctrans_args ] : [
filter_chain ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where ctrans_args is list of
command line arguments for the metafile translator ctrans
and filter_chain is a set of simple commands separated by |.
filter_chain may be <br>
terminated by &gt; or &gt;&gt; filename. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ictrans&gt; alias name1 : -d xwd
: | cat &gt; outfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ictrans&gt; alias name2 : -d
ps.mono : | filter1 | lpr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dup [number] <br>
This command is used to set the number of times each frame
is displayed during subsequent plotting. The default is one.
If dup is invoked without any arguments the current <br>
value of dup is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">count <br>
Reports number of frames contained in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">current <br>
Reports the current frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file [ metafile ] <br>
The file metafile will be used for subsequent translation.
ictrans uses the shell defined by the environment variable
SHELL (/bin/sh by default) to perform filename sub&acirc;
<br>
stitution on metafile. The rules governing filename
substitution are as defined by the working shell. If no
argument is given the current metafile name is reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">font [ font ] <br>
Set the fontcap to font for future translation. This
function is identical to that of the -font option. If font
is omitted the current fontcap name is reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help [ command ] <br>
Print a usage statement for command. If command is omitted a
brief description of all commands is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ frames ] list <br>
Provide brief information about each metafile frame in
frames. If frames is omitted then the current frame is used.
If frames is omitted and the current frame is not the <br>
last frame then the current frame is incremented to the next
frame in the metafile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt; frame1 &gt; &lt; frame2
&gt; merge <br>
Plot frame number frame1 and then plot frame number frame2
over the first frame without clearing the device. The result
is a &quot;merge&quot; of the two plots. The current frame
is <br>
not changed. There are no defaults for frame1 or frame2. The
resulting plot might not be what was expected. Attributes
from the first frame, such as color, may override <br>
attributes in the second frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loop <br>
Toggle loop mode on or off. When loop mode is on subsequent
plot commands will cause the requested frames to be plotted
and then ictrans will proceed to either the first <br>
frame in the defined segment or the last and repeatedly
display the first through last (last through first) frames.
Looping continues until an interrupt signal is <br>
received. The determination of which order to loop, forwards
or backwards, is made as follows: If the last group of
frames plotted was in ascending order loop forward. If <br>
the last group of frames plotted was in descending order
loop backwards. If the order cannot be determined
don&rsquo;t loop. For example; if loop mode is set &quot;1
3,4 plot&quot; will <br>
result in forward looping, &quot;1 4,3 plot&quot; will
result in backward looping, and &quot;3,4 1 plot&quot; will
result in no looping because the last group of frames
plotted, &quot;1&quot;, is a <br>
single frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">movie [ time ] <br>
Display each frame for time seconds before proceding to the
next frame during subsequent plots. If time is omitted then
movie mode is toggled off or on. In the case the <br>
movie mode is toggled on the default time is zero seconds.
If movie mode is toggled to off a newline must be received
before advancing to the next frame during plotting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">next <br>
Multiple files may be specified on the ictrans command line.
To edit the next file in the argument list use the next
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ frames ] plot <br>
Plot the addressed frames. If frames is omitted then the
current frame is plotted and if possible, the current frame
number is incremented. If &quot;movie&quot; mode is set
ictrans <br>
will wait time seconds after displaying each plot before
continuing. time is set with the movie command. If
&quot;movie&quot; mode is not set ictrans will wait for a
newline char&acirc; <br>
acter before advancing to the next frame. plot will report
the number of frames and the last frame in frames. Plotting
will be terminated and ictrans will reenter com&acirc; <br>
mand mode after the last frame is plotted or upon receiving
a interrupt signal, SIGINT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ frames ] Print <br>
The addressed frames are translated and sent to the current
spooling device. Translation is performed by a spawned
translator. The spooler command may be used to select a <br>
spooling device. See ncarv_spool(5NCARG).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit <br>
Terminate the session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ frames ] save [ metafile ]
<br>
Save the addressed frames to metafile. If metafile does not
exist then it is created. Filename substitution is performed
on metafile. If metafile is omitted than the <br>
last file saved to is used. If frames is omitted than the
current frame is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ frames ] Save [ metafile ]
<br>
Same as the save command except Save does not confirm its
actions with the user in the case that the file exists. If
the file exists but is not a valid NCGM it is over&acirc;
<br>
written. If the file exists and is a valid NCGM it is
appended to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skip [ number ] <br>
Set number of frames to skip over during subsequent
plotting. For example, if &quot;skip&quot; is set to 1 and a
request is made to plot frames 1 through 10 frames 1, 3, 5,
7, and 9 <br>
will be displayed. With no arguments skip reports its
current value. The default is zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spooler [ spooler_alias ] <br>
With no arguments the current spooler alias name is
reported. If spooler_alias is a valid alias either defined
by the alias command, or in a ncarv_spool configuration <br>
file, or by the NCARV_SPOOL environment variable, then
spooler alias becomes the current spooler. Subsequent Print
commands will use the spooler definition defined by the <br>
current spooler. See ncarv_spool(5NCARG).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ start frame ] start <br>
This command defines the first frame in a segment of frames.
start, together with the stop command, define the boundaries
of a segment of metafile frames. When ictrans is <br>
in loop mode the contents of this segment are repeatedly
displayed. The default start frame is the first frame in the
metafile, 1. If no arguments are given start reports <br>
the first frame in the current segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ stop frame ] stop <br>
This command defines the last frame in a segment of frames.
The default stop frame is the last frame in the metafile, $.
If no arguments are given stop reports the last <br>
frame in the current segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zoom [ llx [ lly [ urx [ ury
]]]] <br>
The zoom command allows for specification of a workstation
window (in the GKS sense). Four coordinates are specified
which define a rectangular window which is a subset of <br>
the normalized VDC rectangle with corner points (0.0, 0.0)
and (1.0, 1,0). The specified window is then mapped onto the
entire viewport. For example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ictrans&gt; zoom 0.0 0.0 0.5
0.5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would result in the lower left
quarter of subsequent plots being blown up to fill the
entire display. Specification of such a window may be used
for zooming and panning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The range with which one may
zoom in on a plot may be limited by the integer addressing
precision of the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following example shows how ictrans might be used in a
batch mode to translate a metafile called gmeta and send the
translated results of the entire file to a spooled device
<br>
called &quot;imagen&quot; which might be defined in the
system ncarv_spool file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% ictrans -e &rsquo;spooler
imagen&rsquo; -e &rsquo;1,$Print&rsquo; gmeta</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
FONTCAP <br>
Default fontcap specifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRAPHCAP <br>
Default output device specifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NCARG_ROOT <br>
Path to root of NCAR Graphics installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NCARG_LIB <br>
If set this variable contains the path to the installed NCAR
Graphics libraries. NCARG_LIB overrides NCARG_ROOT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NCARG_TMP <br>
If set, this environment variable contains a directory path
to be used for temporary files. On most systems the default
is /tmp. On some systems the default is /usr/tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR If NCARG_TMP is not set
this environment variable specifies the directory path for
scratch disk space. If neither NCARG_TMP TMPDIR is set a
site-dependent, hard-coded <br>
default is used.</p>
