<p>MKFONTDIR(1) General Commands Manual MKFONTDIR(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mkfontdir - create an index of X font files in a
directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mkfontdir [-n] [-x suffix] [-r] [-p prefix] [-e
encoding-directory-name] ... [--] [directory-name ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
For each directory argument, mkfontdir reads all of the font
files in the directory searching for properties named
&quot;FONT&quot;, or (failing that) the name of the file
stripped of its <br>
suffix. These are converted to lower case and used as font
names, and, along with the name of the font file, are
written out to the file &quot;fonts.dir&quot; in the
directory. The X <br>
server and font server use &quot;fonts.dir&quot; to find
font files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The kinds of font files read by
mkfontdir depend on configuration parameters, but typically
include PCF (suffix &quot;.pcf&quot;), SNF (suffix
&quot;.snf&quot;) and BDF (suffix &quot;.bdf&quot;). If a
font <br>
exists in multiple formats, mkfontdir will first choose PCF,
then SNF and finally BDF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first line of fonts.dir
gives the number of fonts in the file. The remaining lines
list the fonts themselves, one per line, in two fields.
First is the name of the font <br>
file, followed by a space and the name of the font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCALABLE FONTS <br>
Because scalable font files do not usually include the X
font name, the file &quot;fonts.scale&quot; can be used to
name the scalable fonts in the directory. The fonts listed
in it are <br>
copied to fonts.dir by mkfontdir. &quot;fonts.scale&quot;
has the same format as the &quot;fonts.dir&quot; file, and
can be created with the mkfontscale(1) program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FONT NAME ALIASES <br>
The file &quot;fonts.alias&quot;, which can be put in any
directory of the font-path, is used to map new names to
existing fonts, and should be edited by hand. The format is
two white- <br>
space separated columns, the first containing aliases and
the second containing font-name patterns. Lines beginning
with &quot;!&quot; are comment lines and are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither the alias nor the
value specifies the size fields of the font name, this is a
scalable alias. A font name of any size that matches this
alias will be mapped to the <br>
same size of the font that the alias resolves to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a font alias is used, the
name it references is searched for in the normal manner,
looking through each font directory in turn. This means that
the aliases need not mention <br>
fonts in the same directory as the alias file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To embed white space in either
name, simply enclose it in double-quote marks; to embed
double-quote marks (or any other character), precede them
with back-slash:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;magic-alias with
spaces&quot; &quot; <br>
regular-alias fixed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the string
&quot;FILE_NAMES_ALIASES&quot; stands alone on a line, each
file-name in the directory (stripped of its suffix) will be
used as an alias for that font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENCODING FILES <br>
The option -e can be used to specify a directory with
encoding files. Every such directory is scanned for encoding
files, the list of which is then written to an
&quot;encodings.dir&quot; <br>
file in every font directory. The &quot;encodings.dir&quot;
file is used by the server to find encoding information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;encodings.dir&quot;
file has the same format as &quot;fonts.dir&quot;. It maps
encoding names (strings of the form
CHARSET_REGISTRY-CHARSET_ENCODING ) to encoding file
names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Specify a directory
containing encoding files. The -e option may be specified
multiple times, and all the specified directories will be
read. The order of the entries is <br>
significant, as encodings found in earlier directories
override those in later ones; encoding files in the same
directory are discriminated by preferring compressed
ver&acirc; <br>
sions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n do not scan for fonts, do not
write font directory files. This option is useful when
generating encoding directories only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Specify a prefix that is
prepended to the encoding file path names when they are
written to the &quot;encodings.dir&quot; file. The prefix is
prepended as-is. If a &lsquo;/&rsquo; is required <br>
between the prefix and the path names, it must be supplied
explicitly as part of the prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Keep non-absolute encoding
directories in their relative form when writing the
&quot;encodings.dir&quot; file. The default is to convert
relative encoding directories to absolute <br>
directories by prepending the current directory. The
positioning of this options is significant, as this option
only applies to subsequent -e options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x suffix <br>
Ignore fonts files of type suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- End options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
fonts.dir List of fonts in the directory and the files they
are stored in. Created by mkfontdir. Read by the X server
and font server each time the font path is set (see <br>
xset(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fonts.scale List of scalable
fonts in the directory. Contents are copied to fonts.dir by
mkfontdir. Can be created with mkfontscale(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fonts.alias List of font name
aliases. Read by the X server and font server each time the
font path is set (see xset(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">encodings.dir List of known
encodings and the files they are stored in. Created by
mkfontdir. Read by the X server and font server each time a
font with an unknown charset is <br>
opened.</p>
