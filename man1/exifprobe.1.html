<p>EXIFPROBE(1) General Commands Manual EXIFPROBE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
exifprobe - probe and report structure and metadata content
of camera image files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
exifprobe [options] filename(s)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Exifprobe reads image files produced by digital cameras
(including several so-called &quot;raw&quot; file formats)
and reports the structure of the files and the auxiliary
data and meta&acirc; <br>
data contained within them. In addition to TIFF, JPEG, and
EXIF, the program understands several formats which may
contain &quot;raw&quot; camera data, including MRW,
CIFF/CRW, <br>
JP2/JPEG2000, RAF, and X3F, as well as most most
TIFF-derived &quot;raw&quot; formats, including DNG, ORF,
CR2, NEF, K25/KDC/DCR, and PEF. Other TIFF or JPEG-derived
formats (which begin <br>
with a TIFF header or JPEG marker) should also be readable.
The program attempts to display ALL information in the image
file, in a manner which mimics the structure of the file
<br>
as closely as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where possible, output is not
limited to &acirc;known&acirc; data items. I.e. for tagged
file formats, unknown tags will be identified by tag number
and type, and values shown without <br>
interpretation. Proprietary, untagged or fixed format files
do not permit this, but unknown or undefined data can
usually be dumped in a hex/ascii format for examination, so
long <br>
as the file structure is understood. The program will report
the contents of any properly structured TIFF IFD or CIFF
directory encountered, even when entry tags are not
recog&acirc; <br>
nized. Recognized TIFF, TIFF/EP, DNG, and CIFF tags are
expanded, including EXIF2.2 sections and camera MakerNotes
which are found to be in TIFF IFD format. TIFF and/or JPEG
<br>
sections found in MRW, RAF or JP2 files will be reported,
along with the &acirc;native&acirc; sections of those
formats. JP2 boxes will be reported whether known or
unknown, and expanded if <br>
known. Unknown boxes cannot be expanded, since JP2 is not
tagged below the box (or sub-box) level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An effort is made to identify
all sub-images (in any image format) contained in
multi-image files; the location, size, and format of such
images is reported, and a hex/ascii dump <br>
of the image data may be requested. Image data is not
processed, but the program will recognize and report all
standard JPEG and JPEG2000 markers (including JPEG APPn
markers) <br>
and will expand APP0 (JFIF/JFXX) and APP1 (EXIF)
sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the program does not
attempt to display images or modify the contents of files,
it can often recover from and report failures or warn about
structural oddities which would <br>
confuse a display or image edit program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a wide variety of
output formats, selectable in detail by the &acirc;lower
case&acirc; options described in the OPTIONS section below.
These options select which items to print, <br>
and within narrow confines, how and where to print them. A
large number of combinations of options exist, and some of
those combinations may not be sensible. In order to avoid
<br>
the need for constant creativity or invention, three
&acirc;prefabricated&acirc; output formats are provided,
selected by the upper case option letters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The structural (-S) output
format (default) provides a description of the image file
which mimics as closely as possible the layout and structure
of the data in the image file, <br>
including file offsets of headers, section and segment
markers, fully described TIFF IFDs, CIFF directories, or JP2
boxes, and the location of actual image and/or thumbnail
data. <br>
The contents of each section are indented relative to the
beginning of the section, and &acirc;offset&acirc; values
for TIFF IFDs and CIFF directories are reported at the
offsets where they <br>
are found (usually following the entry list for TIFF, or in
the HEAP for CIFF). The peculiar &acirc;reverse&acirc;
structures of CIFF and X3F formats are handled sensibly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The report format (-R) shows the
&acirc;logical&acirc; structure of the image file, but
eliminates addresses, offsets, IFD value types and counts,
etc., and prints &acirc;offset&acirc; directory values <br>
inline, while otherwise preserving the primary structure of
the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list format (-L) omits all
structural data. It writes only &acirc;tag&acirc; values
from TIFF, Exif, and MakerNote IFDs, CIFF or other format
directories or JP2 boxes, including section <br>
and image offsets and sizes. Identifiable values from
non-tagged formats are written in a similar manner. This
format may be useful for extracting information for photo
gal&acirc; <br>
leries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The structural format is
default. This format provides maximum information about the
contents of an image file, and may reveal information
(sometimes important) which other for&acirc; <br>
mats (or image info programs) may hide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In all formats, the filename,
file type, file size, an image summary, and a summary file
format will be displayed (even when all other output is
disabled by option). The image <br>
summary includes a summary report, for each subimage found,
giving the image type, compression type (if any), pixel
size, data length, file offset where found, and section of
the <br>
file which includes or references the image. In some cases,
short remarks may be included for images mentioned but not
found, etc. The summary concludes with the number of <br>
images found, and number of images not found (if any). The
summary is followed by a listing of format sections found
(TIFF/JPEG/EXIF, etc.) and a type identifier for
TIFF-derived <br>
types (e.g. CR2) where possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An environment variable may be
set to a list of options to customize the default output
behavior (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MakerNotes <br>
Camera-generated images which contain EXIF sections may also
contain sections introduced by a MakerNote tag, which may
contain information about camera or firmware settings used
<br>
to produce the image. The structure and contents of
MakerNote sections is not mandated by the Exif
specification, but many camera MakerNotes are written in
TIFF IFD format, pos&acirc; <br>
sibly offset following an ID string or new TIFF header (or
both), and sometimes with inventive handling of
&acirc;offsets&acirc;. Exifprobe currently understands and
automatically detects <br>
such schemes and prints the contents of the IFD (and the ID
string, if present). This detection is not dependent upon
make or model of camera. Make and Model information will
<br>
usually be available from the first TIFF IFD in the file;
this information may be used to interpret the MakerNote
information for &acirc;known&acirc; cameras; otherwise, tag
numbers, sizes, <br>
types, and raw values from the IFD will be shown (if
permitted by option settings).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some camera makes are known to
use more than one version of MakerNote, depending upon
model. If an unknown model from that maker is encountered,
the note will be briefly exam&acirc; <br>
ined and a noteversion assigned automatically if possible.
If that fails, the note will be displayed without
interpretation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MakerNotes which are not in a
recognizable IFD format will be reported (start and end
offsets) in structural (-S) and report (-R) formats , and
the beginning of the note section <br>
hex/ascii dumped. The remainder of the note may be dumped,
in whole or in part, by the -M option (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In list (-L) format, the
starting file offset and length supplied by the MakerNote
tag will be reported, and three &acirc;pseudo&acirc; tags
which report the offset (MakerNote.Offset), size <br>
(MakerNote.Length) and scheme (MakerNote.Scheme) will
appear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JPEG APPn <br>
In JPEG interchange format files, APP0 (JFIF,JFXX) and APP1
(Exif) segments will be fully decoded, and the
&acirc;printable&acirc; portions of APP12 sections will be
displayed. APP3 (Meta) <br>
sections will be expanded and the contained TIFF IFD will be
displayed, although little interpretation is done. Other APP
markers will be reported, and the sections may be <br>
hex/ascii dumped in whole or in part using the -A option.
APP1 sections not marked as Exif will be treated as
unknown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ANSI Color <br>
The program (by default) emits ANSI color escape sequences
to highlight Exif, MakerNote , and Interoperability
sub-sections. Errors and warnings are highlighted in red.
These <br>
sequences are effective, of course, only for terminals or
terminal emulators (e.g. xterm) which respond to ANSI color
escape sequences. If a pager is used to display the output
<br>
when these sequences are present, a &acirc;raw&acirc; option
to the pager may be required (e.g. less -R). The use of
these sequences may be toggled by the -c option. LIST mode
turns color <br>
sequences off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program may be compiled
without support for color sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FORMATS <br>
In all formats, and regardless of option setting, the first
three lines of output for each file processed are the
filename, image type (TIFF, CIFF, JP2, etc.), and the file
size. <br>
If the type (taken from the file header) specifies a data
byte order, the byte order will be indicated with the type
as &lsquo;II&rsquo; (Intel byte order) or &lsquo;MM&rsquo;
(Motorola byte order). <br>
The image summary and summary format will always be printed
at the end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Structural Format <br>
Structural format output begins with a display of the file
header. The header is followed by lines of the form <br>
&lt;IFD0&gt; <br>
... <br>
&lt;/IFD0&gt; <br>
&lt;APP0&gt; <br>
... <br>
&lt;/APP0&gt; <br>
&lt;DIRECTORY&gt; <br>
... <br>
&lt;/DIRECTORY&gt; <br>
etc. to indicate the beginning and end of each
&acirc;section&acirc; of the file. Actual section names
will, of course, depend upon the file format and/or the tags
encountered. Only the <br>
TIFF IFD format is described here; other formats are
similar, except that JP2 box names are printed inside square
(rather than angle) brackets, and MRW section names inside
curly <br>
braces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Within sections, directory
entries, subdirectories, the contents of known APP sections,
JPEG segment markers, etc. are printed. Non-jpeg image data
sections will be shown with a <br>
few lines of hex/ascii dump of the beginning of the
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each line of output is preceded
by a file offset given in hex and decimal. File offsets are
preceded by the character &lsquo;@&rsquo;, except that
section end markers are preceded by &lsquo;-&rsquo; <br>
and the character &lsquo;&gt;&rsquo; may be used to mark
sections which are located outside the IFD in which they are
declared. If that section includes a subsection which is
similarly <br>
afflicted, the &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; is replaced by
&rsquo;+&rsquo; in the subsection. In JP2 files, the
&rsquo;@&rsquo; is replaced by &rsquo;=&rsquo;, for no
particular reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JPEG and JPEG2000 segment
markers are written with the marker name, and the decoded
values of any information associated with the marker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIFF information is written in a
manner which reflects the structure of the IFD, with all
values interpreted according to the applicable specification
where possible. All IFD <br>
fields are reported. The following fields will appear on
each line (in the order given, following the file
offset):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Tag number in
hex and decimal representations, enclosed in brackets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Tag name (where
known); names for unknown tags are created as a hex
representation of the tag number prefixed by the string
&rsquo;TAG_&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The TIFF type
number, name, and byte count for the associated value,
enclosed in square brackets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&acirc;value/offset&acirc; for the entry. If the value fits
in the four bytes of the entry, the value is printed
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the value for the entry did
not fit in the four bytes of the entry, then the value found
is an offset to the actual location of the data; that offset
is printed pre&acirc; <br>
ceded by an &rsquo;@&rsquo; symbol. The actual value will be
printed later, at the file offset where it was found (except
in some non-conforming MakerNote IFDs). If the value <br>
requires interpretation (e.g. TIFF Orientation) it is
followed by an &rsquo;=&rsquo; sign and the interpretation,
enclosed in double quotes (e.g. &acirc;0,0 top
left&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list of entries will be
followed by a line giving the offset to the next IFD (often
0) which is always found at the end of a TIFF IFD entry
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there were offset entries
found in the list above, the TIFF (and Exif) specification
requires that they will be located next in the file,
immediately following the directory <br>
entries. This stricture is frequently ignored in MakerNotes
and TIFF-derived formats. A line reporting the beginning of
these offset values will be printed immediately after <br>
the next IFD offset, followed by one line for each offset
entry, with the tag name repeated, followed by the actual
value, followed by its interpretation (if any).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple values in entries are
printed on a single line, but large lists will be elided,
with just the first two or three values shown, followed by
an ellipsis, followed by the <br>
last value, the number of values, and the offset of the last
value in the list. The full value list may be printed using
the -eA option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In structural format, ascii
strings in the entry are printed for the entire length given
in the IFD entry, including nulls and non-ascii values (if
present), which are printed in <br>
&lsquo;backslashed&rsquo; octal notation. The -ea option may
be used to force ascii values to be printed only up to the
first null. This option is often necessary for CIFF format
files, <br>
and is enabled by default in &acirc;list&acirc; mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Entries are indented slightly
from the start identifier for the IFD, and subsegments (e.g.
an Exif IFD, SubIFD, or MakerNote) will be further indented
in order to indicate the <br>
structure of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The resulting output displays
the contents of the IFD much as it appears in the file (see
the TIFF or EXIF specifications for descriptions of the IFD
format).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, the start and end of
actual image data for the primary image (and possibly
thumbnail or reduced-resolution image) is reported at the
end. For JPEG images, this usually <br>
includes display of the JPEG segment markers within the
image. Binary format image data will be shown with a brief
hex/ascii dump of the beginning of the data, between start
and <br>
end markers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that values preceded by
&lsquo;@&rsquo; are always offsets from the beginning of the
file to the actual value. IFD offsets are usually recorded
in the file as offsets relative to the <br>
beginning of the TIFF header (which is offset from the
beginning of the file in JPEG APP1 files) but are adjusted
by exifprobe to show offset from the beginning of the file.
If <br>
it is important to see the recorded value, the -er option
may be used to print the recorded value in parentheses,
following the adjusted file offset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Report Format <br>
The report format (-R) displays all sections and segments of
the image file, including start and end of sections, but
eliminates much of the &acirc;cruft&acirc; of the structural
format by <br>
eliminating address/offset information and much of the
&lsquo;internal&rsquo; information from the TIFF IFD (tag
number, type and count). Offset values are printed inline
with the tag name. <br>
The output is indented to show the logical structure of the
image file, but is much less difficult to view than the
structural format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List format <br>
The list format (-L) suppresses structural information,
writing only content in the format tagname = value or
tagname = value = &acirc;what value means&acirc;. For
non-tagged file formats, <br>
the tagname will be replaced by a fixed identifier for the
item. In LIST format, &acirc;long&acirc; tagnames are used,
which include the names of all parent sections of the
section in which <br>
the data is found. Long tagnames can be toggled off,
although this is unwise if the file contains multiple image
sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;value&acirc; of tags
or items which represent an offset to a subsection or image
are printed in list format as
&acirc;@offset:length&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The List format is used by the
auxiliary script exifgrep, which permits selective
extraction of information e.g. for photo galleries, and
output in (almost) &acirc;shell variable&acirc; for&acirc;
<br>
mat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Custom Formats <br>
The -Z option &acirc;zeroes&acirc; all option flags (except
the longnames modifier), after which the lower-case options
may be used to set desired options. The lower-case options
are &lsquo;tog&acirc; <br>
gles&rsquo;, which may also be used to turn off items in the
pre-defined formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example, the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exifprobe -Z -et
somefile.tif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">may be used to list just the
TIFF and Exif tags, without values (or anything else) in
&acirc;long name&acirc; format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exifprobe -eNnT somefile.tif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will print in structural format,
suppressing output of hex and decimal tag numbers, and tag
type and count.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;zero-level&acirc;
output still reports the file data and image summary as
described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The environment variable EXIFPROBE_OPTIONS may be set to any
valid option string, which will be evaluated before command
line options. E.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export
EXIFPROBE_OPTIONS=&rsquo;-L -c&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will make list format the
default output format, and re-enable the color sequences
turned off by -L.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options are evaluated from left
to right, so -Z should be given first, while -D (decimal
only) or -X (hex only) should be given last.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Structure mode: (default)
almost everything; offset values not inline</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Report mode: like structural,
but only tagnames and decimal values, indented, inline</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L List mode: print only tags
and values (including interpreted values); no section info;
no color</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z turn off (zero) all optional
output. Prints only filename, filetype, filesize, image
summary, and file format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c toggle use of ANSI color
control sequences to emphasize EXIF sections. (default
&rsquo;on&rsquo; except list mode, unless compiled with no
color support)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a toggle printing of addresses
(file offsets) in hex and decimal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I three-way toggle indent
(after address -&gt; before -&gt; none)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r - relative (unadjusted) offset
in decimal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R - also print &acirc;raw&acirc;
values where normal values are computed (e.g. rational
values, or some MakerNote values where APEX values must be
computed from a raw value).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A - print ALL elements of
multiple-value tags</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a - ascii &quot;ignore

(but only if the structure of the data is not known)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M[len|a] dump len (or all)

doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m make Force the makernote code
to interpret the note according to the make given, rather
than that contained in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l model force the makernote
code to interpret the note according to the model given,
rather than that contained in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t This option has effect only
if set in EXIFPROBE_OPTIONS. If set when command line
options are processed, color will be be off by default if
the output is not to a <br>
tty. Any command line option which toggles or sets color
(e.g. &acirc;-R&acirc;) will turn color back on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Print &acirc;raw&acirc;
Unicode data. Normally 16 bit data is printed as though the
high byte is zero (which is often the case). Writing the
nulls would annoy most ascii terminal <br>
devices, so the default is more hospitable. The -u option
forces printing of the full value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h print a help message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V print program version and
copyright</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Interpretation of MakerNote data for specific cameras is
incomplete and probably always will be. The X3F
specification is incomplete, and the final JPEG2000/JP2
specification is <br>
not freely available; support for these formats is therefore
