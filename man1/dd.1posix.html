<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dd &acirc; convert and copy a file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dd [operand...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The dd utility shall copy the specified input file to the
specified output file with possible conversions using
specific input and output block sizes. It shall read the
input one <br>
block at a time, using the specified input block size; it
shall then process the block of data actually returned,
which could be smaller than the requested block size. It
shall <br>
apply any conversions that have been specified and write the
resulting data to the output in blocks of the specified
output block size. If the bs=expr operand is specified and
no <br>
conversions other than sync, noerror, or notrunc are
requested, the data returned from each input block shall be
written as a separate output block; if the read returns less
than <br>
a full block and the sync conversion is not specified, the
resulting output block shall be the same size as the input
block. If the bs=expr operand is not specified, or a
conver&acirc; <br>
sion other than sync, noerror, or notrunc is requested, the
input shall be processed and collected into full-sized
output blocks until the end of the input is reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The processing order shall be as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. An input block is read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If the input block is shorter
than the specified input block size and the sync conversion
is specified, null bytes shall be appended to the input data
up to the specified <br>
size. (If either block or unblock is also specified,
&lt;space&gt; characters shall be appended instead of null
bytes.) The remaining conversions and output shall include
the pad <br>
characters as if they had been read from the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If the bs=expr operand is
specified and no conversion other than sync or noerror is
requested, the resulting data shall be written to the output
as a single block, and the <br>
remaining steps are omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. If the swab conversion is
specified, each pair of input data bytes shall be swapped.
If there is an odd number of bytes in the input block, the
last byte in the input record <br>
shall not be swapped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Any remaining conversions
(block, unblock, lcase, and ucase) shall be performed. These
conversions shall operate on the input data independently of
the input blocking; an <br>
input or output fixed-length record may span block
boundaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. The data resulting from input
or conversion or both shall be aggregated into output blocks
of the specified size. After the end of input is reached,
any remaining output <br>
shall be written as a block without padding if conv=sync is
not specified; thus, the final output block may be shorter
than the output block size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
All of the operands shall be processed before any input is
read. The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if=file Specify the input
pathname; the default is standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">of=file Specify the output
pathname; the default is standard output. If the seek=expr
conversion is not also specified, the output file shall be
truncated before the copy <br>
begins if an explicit of=file operand is specified, unless
conv=notrunc is specified. If seek=expr is specified, but
conv=notrunc is not, the effect of the copy shall <br>
be to preserve the blocks in the output file over which dd
seeks, but no other portion of the output file shall be
preserved. (If the size of the seek plus the size of <br>
the input file is less than the previous size of the output
file, the output file shall be shortened by the copy. If the
input file is empty and either the size of the <br>
seek is greater than the previous size of the output file or
the output file did not previously exist, the size of the
output file shall be set to the file offset after <br>
the seek.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ibs=expr Specify the input block
size, in bytes, by expr (default is 512).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">obs=expr Specify the output
block size, in bytes, by expr (default is 512).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bs=expr Set both input and
output block sizes to expr bytes, superseding ibs= and obs=.
If no conversion other than sync, noerror, and notrunc is
specified, each input block <br>
shall be copied to the output as a single block without
aggregating short blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cbs=expr Specify the conversion
block size for block and unblock in bytes by expr (default
is zero). If cbs= is omitted or given a value of zero, using
block or unblock produces <br>
unspecified results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The application shall ensure
that this operand is also specified if the conv= operand is
specified with a value of ascii, ebcdic, or ibm. For a conv=
operand with an <br>
ascii value, the input is handled as described for the
unblock value, except that characters are converted to ASCII
before any trailing &lt;space&gt; characters are deleted.
<br>
For conv= operands with ebcdic or ibm values, the input is
handled as described for the block value except that the
characters are converted to EBCDIC or IBM EBCDIC, <br>
respectively, after any trailing &lt;space&gt; characters
are added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skip=n Skip n input blocks
(using the specified input block size) before starting to
copy. On seekable files, the implementation shall read the
blocks or seek past them; on <br>
non-seekable files, the blocks shall be read and the data
shall be discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">seek=n Skip n blocks (using the
specified output block size) from the beginning of the
output file before copying. On non-seekable files, existing
blocks shall be read and <br>
space from the current end-of-file to the specified offset,
if any, filled with null bytes; on seekable files, the
implementation shall seek to the specified offset or <br>
read the blocks as described for non-seekable files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">count=n Copy only n input
blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">conv=value[,value ...] <br>
Where values are &lt;comma&gt;-separated symbols from the
following list:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ascii Convert EBCDIC to ASCII;
see Table 4-7, ASCII to EBCDIC Conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ebcdic Convert ASCII to EBCDIC;
see Table 4-7, ASCII to EBCDIC Conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ibm Convert ASCII to a different
EBCDIC set; see Table 4-8, ASCII to IBM EBCDIC
Conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ascii, ebcdic, and ibm
values are mutually-exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">block Treat the input as a
sequence of &lt;newline&gt;-terminated or
end-of-file-terminated variable-length records independent
of the input block boundaries. Each record <br>
shall be converted to a record with a fixed length specified
by the conversion block size. Any &lt;newline&gt; shall be
removed from the input line; &lt;space&gt; charac&acirc;
<br>
ters shall be appended to lines that are shorter than their
conversion block size to fill the block. Lines that are
longer than the conversion block size shall <br>
be truncated to the largest number of characters that fit
into that size; the number of truncated lines shall be
reported (see the STDERR section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The block and unblock values are
mutually-exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unblock Convert fixed-length
records to variable length. Read a number of bytes equal to
the conversion block size (or the number of bytes remaining
in the input, if <br>
less than the conversion block size), delete all trailing
&lt;space&gt; characters, and append a &lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lcase Map uppercase characters
specified by the LC_CTYPE keyword tolower to the
corresponding lowercase character. Characters for which no
mapping is specified shall <br>
not be modified by this conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The lcase and ucase symbols are
mutually-exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ucase Map lowercase characters
specified by the LC_CTYPE keyword toupper to the
corresponding uppercase character. Characters for which no
mapping is specified shall <br>
not be modified by this conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">swab Swap every pair of input
bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noerror Do not stop processing
on an input error. When an input error occurs, a diagnostic
message shall be written on standard error, followed by the
current input <br>
and output block counts in the same format as used at
completion (see the STDERR section). If the sync conversion
is specified, the missing input shall be <br>
replaced with null bytes and processed normally; otherwise,
the input block shall be omitted from the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notrunc Do not truncate the
output file. Preserve blocks in the output file not
explicitly written by this invocation of the dd utility.
(See also the preceding <br>
of=file operand.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sync Pad every input block to
the size of the ibs= buffer, appending null bytes. (If
either block or unblock is also specified, append
&lt;space&gt; characters, rather <br>
than null bytes.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The behavior is unspecified if
operands other than conv= are specified more than once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the bs=, cbs=, ibs=, and
obs= operands, the application shall supply an expression
specifying a size in bytes. The expression, expr, can
be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. A positive decimal number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. A positive decimal number
followed by k, specifying multiplication by 1024</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. A positive decimal number
followed by b, specifying multiplication by 512</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Two or more positive decimal
numbers (with or without k or b) separated by x, specifying
the product of the indicated values</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of the operands are
processed before any input is read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following two tables display
the octal number character values used for the ascii and
ebcdic conversions (first table) and for the ibm conversion
(second table). In both <br>
tables, the ASCII values are the row and column headers and
the EBCDIC values are found at their intersections. For
example, ASCII 0012 (LF) is the second row, third column,
<br>
yielding 0045 in EBCDIC. The inverted tables (for EBCDIC to
ASCII conversion) are not shown, but are in one-to-one
correspondence with these tables. The differences between
the <br>
two tables are highlighted by small boxes drawn around five
entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Table 4-7: ASCII to EBCDIC
Conversion</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Table 4-8: ASCII to IBM EBCDIC
Conversion</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
If no if= operand is specified, the standard input shall be
used. See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The input file can be any file type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of dd:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments <br>
and input files), the classification of characters as
uppercase or lowercase, and the mapping of characters from
one case to the other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error and informative messages written to standard
<br>
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
For SIGINT, the dd utility shall interrupt its current
processing, write status information to standard error, and
exit as though terminated by SIGINT. It shall take the
standard <br>
action for all other signals; see the ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
section in Section 1.4, Utility Description Defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
If no of= operand is specified, the standard output shall be
used. The nature of the output depends on the operands
selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
On completion, dd shall write the number of input and output
blocks to standard error. In the POSIX locale the following
formats shall be used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%u+%u records in0,
&lt;number of whole input blocks&gt;, <br>
&lt;number of partial input blocks&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%u+%u records out0,
&lt;number of whole output blocks&gt;, <br>
&lt;number of partial output blocks&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A partial input block is one for
which read() returned less than the input block size. A
partial output block is one that was written with fewer
bytes than specified by the out&acirc; <br>
put block size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, when there is at
least one truncated block, the number of truncated blocks
shall be written to standard error. In the POSIX locale, the
format shall be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%u truncated %s0,
&lt;number of truncated blocks&gt;, &quot;record&quot; (if
<br>
&lt;number of truncated blocks&gt; is one)
&quot;records&quot; (otherwise)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Diagnostic messages may also be
written to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
If the of= operand is used, the output shall be the same as
described in the STDOUT section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 The input file was copied
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
If an input error is detected and the noerror conversion has
not been specified, any partial output block shall be
written to the output file, a diagnostic message shall be
writ&acirc; <br>
ten, and the copy operation shall be discontinued. If some
other error is detected, a diagnostic message shall be
written and the copy operation shall be discontinued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The input and output block size can be specified to take
advantage of raw physical I/O.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are many different
versions of the EBCDIC codesets. The ASCII and EBCDIC
conversions specified for the dd utility perform conversions
for the version specified by the <br>
tables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dd if=/dev/rmt0h
of=/dev/rmt1h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copies from tape drive 0 to tape
drive 1, using a common historical device naming
convention.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dd ibs=10 skip=1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">strips the first 10 bytes from
standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example reads an EBCDIC
tape blocked ten 80-byte EBCDIC card images per block into
the ASCII file x:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dd if=/dev/tape of=x ibs=800
cbs=80 conv=ascii,lcase</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The OPTIONS section is listed as
&lsquo;&lsquo;None&rsquo;&rsquo; because there are no
options recognized by historical dd utilities. Certainly,
many of the operands could have been designed to use the
<br>
Utility Syntax Guidelines, which would have resulted in the
classic hyphenated option letters. In this version of this
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, dd retains its curious
JCL-like <br>
syntax due to the large number of applications that depend
on the historical implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A suggested implementation
technique for conv=noerror,sync is to zero (or
&lt;space&gt;-fill, if blocking or unblocking) the input
buffer before each read and to write the contents of <br>
the input buffer to the output even after an error. In this
manner, any data transferred to the input buffer before the
error was detected is preserved. Another point is that a
<br>
failed read on a regular file or a disk generally does not
increment the file offset, and dd must then seek past the
block on which the error occurred; otherwise, the input
error <br>
occurs repetitively. When the input is a magnetic tape,
however, the tape normally has passed the block containing
the error when the error is reported, and thus no seek is
nec&acirc; <br>
essary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default ibs= and obs= sizes
are specified as 512 bytes because there are historical
(largely portable) scripts that assume these values. If they
were left unspecified, <br>
unusual results could occur if an implementation chose an
odd block size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical implementations of dd
used creat() when processing of=file. This makes the seek=
operand unusable except on special files. The conv=notrunc
feature was added because <br>
more recent BSD-based implementations use open() (without
O_TRUNC) instead of creat(), but they fail to delete output
file contents after the data copied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The w multiplier (historically
meaning word), is used in System V to mean 2 and in 4.2 BSD
to mean 4. Since word is inherently non-portable, its use is
not supported by this vol&acirc; <br>
ume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard EBCDIC does not have
the characters &rsquo;[&rsquo; and &rsquo;]&rsquo;. The
values used in the table are taken from a common print train
that does contain them. Other than those characters, <br>
the print train values are not filled in, but appear to
provide some of the motivation for the historical choice of
translations reflected here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Standard EBCDIC table
provides a 1:1 translation for all 256 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The IBM EBCDIC table does not
provide such a translation. The marked cells in the tables
differ in such a way that:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. EBCDIC 0112
(&rsquo;&Acirc;&cent;&rsquo;) and 0152 (broken pipe) do not
appear in the table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. EBCDIC 0137
(&rsquo;&Acirc;&not;&rsquo;) translates to/from ASCII 0236
(&rsquo;^&rsquo;). In the standard table, EBCDIC 0232 (no
graphic) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. EBCDIC 0241 (&rsquo;~&rsquo;)
translates to/from ASCII 0176 (&rsquo;~&rsquo;). In the
standard table, EBCDIC 0137 (&rsquo;&Acirc;&not;&rsquo;) is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. 0255 (&rsquo;[&rsquo;) and
0275 (&rsquo;]&rsquo;) appear twice, once in the same place
as for the standard table and once in place of 0112
(&rsquo;&Acirc;&cent;&rsquo;) and 0241
(&rsquo;~&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In net result:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EBCDIC 0275 (&rsquo;]&rsquo;)
displaced EBCDIC 0241 (&rsquo;~&rsquo;) in cell 0345.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That displaced EBCDIC 0137
(&rsquo;&Acirc;&not;&rsquo;) in cell 0176.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That displaced EBCDIC 0232 (no
graphic) in cell 0136.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That replaced EBCDIC 0152
(broken pipe) in cell 0313.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EBCDIC 0255 (&rsquo;[&rsquo;)
replaced EBCDIC 0112 (&rsquo;&Acirc;&cent;&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This translation, however,
reflects historical practice that (ASCII) &rsquo;~&rsquo;
and &rsquo;&Acirc;&not;&rsquo; were often mapped to each
other, as were &rsquo;[&rsquo; and
&rsquo;&Acirc;&cent;&rsquo;; and &rsquo;]&rsquo; and
(EBCDIC) &rsquo;~&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The cbs operand is required if
any of the ascii, ebcdic, or ibm operands are specified. For
the ascii operand, the input is handled as described for the
unblock operand except <br>
that characters are converted to ASCII before the trailing
&lt;space&gt; characters are deleted. For the ebcdic and ibm
operands, the input is handled as described for the block
oper&acirc; <br>
and except that the characters are converted to EBCDIC or
IBM EBCDIC after the trailing &lt;space&gt; characters are
added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The block and unblock keywords
are from historical BSD practice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The consistent use of the word
record in standard error messages matches most historical
practice. An earlier version of System V used block, but
this has been updated in more <br>
recent releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Early proposals only allowed two
numbers separated by x to be used in a product when
specifying bs=, cbs=, ibs=, and obs= sizes. This was changed
to reflect the historical prac&acirc; <br>
tice of allowing multiple numbers in the product as provided
by Version 7 and all releases of System V and BSD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A change to the swab conversion
is required to match historical practice and is the result
of IEEE PASC Interpretations 1003.2 #03 and #04, submitted
for the ISO POSIX&acirc;2:1993 <br>
standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A change to the handling of
SIGINT is required to match historical practice and is the
result of IEEE PASC Interpretation 1003.2 #06 submitted for
the ISO POSIX&acirc;2:1993 standard.</p>
