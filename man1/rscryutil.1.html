<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rscryutil - Manage Encrypted Log Files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rscryutil [OPTIONS] [FILE] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This tool performs various operations on encrypted log
files. Most importantly, it provides the ability to decrypt
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d, --decrypt <br>
Select decryption mode. This is the default mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W,--write-keyfile &lt;file&gt;
<br>
Utility function to write a key to a keyfile. The key can be
obtained via any method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Select verbose mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
Forces operations that otherwise would fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k,--keyfile &lt;file&gt; <br>
Reads the key from &lt;file&gt;. File _must_ contain the
key, only, no headers or other meta information. Keyfiles
can be generated via the --write-keyfile option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p,--key-program
&lt;path-to-program&gt; <br>
In this mode, the key is provided by a so-called &quot;key
program&quot;. This program is executed and must return the
key to (as well as some meta information) via stdout. The
core <br>
idea of key programs is that using this interface the user
can implement as complex (and secure) method to obtain keys
as desired, all without the need to make modifica&acirc;
<br>
tions to rsyslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K,--key &lt;KEY&gt; <br>
TESTING AID, NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE. This uses the KEY
specified on the command line. This is the actual key, and
as such this mode is highly insecure. However, it can be
<br>
useful for intial testing steps. This option may be removed
in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a,--algo &lt;algo&gt; <br>
Sets the encryption algorightm (cipher) to be used. See
below for supported algorithms. The default is
&quot;AES128&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m,--mode &lt;mode&gt; <br>
Sets the ciphermode to be used. See below for supported
modes. The default is &quot;CBC&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r,--generate-random-key
&lt;bytes&gt; <br>
Generates a random key of length &lt;bytes&gt;. This option
is meant to be used together with --write-keyfile (and it is
hard to envision any other valid use for it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATION MODES <br>
The operation mode specifies what exactly the tool does with
the provided files. The default operation mode is
&quot;dump&quot;, but this may change in the future. Thus,
it is recommended <br>
to always set the operations mode explicitely. If multiple
operations mode are set on the command line, results are
unpredictable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">decrypt <br>
The provided log files are decrypted. Note that the .encinfo
side files must exist and be accessible in order for
decryption to to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">write-keyfile <br>
In this mode no log files are processed; thus it is an error
to specify any on the command line. The specified keyfile is
written. The key itself is obtained via the usual key <br>
commands. If --keyfile is used, that file is effectively
copied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For security reasons, existing
key files are _not_ overwritten. To permit this, specify the
--force option. When doing so, keep in mind that lost keys
cannot be recovered and <br>
data encrypted with them may also be considered lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keyfiles are always created with
0400 permission, that is read access for only the user. An
exception is when an existing file is overwritten via the
--force option, in which <br>
case the former permissions still apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODES <br>
The command returns an exit code of 0 if everything went
fine, and some other code in case of failures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED ALGORITHMS <br>
We basically support what libgcrypt supports. This is: <br>
3DES CAST5 BLOWFISH AES128 AES192 AES256 TWOFISH TWOFISH128
ARCFOUR DES SERPENT128 SERPENT192 SERPENT256 RFC2268_40 SEED
CAMELLIA128 CAMELLIA192 CAMELLIA256</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED CIPHER MODES <br>
We basically support what libgcrypt supports. This is: <br>
ECB CFB CBC STREAM OFB CTR AESWRAP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
rscryutil logfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Decrypts &quot;logfile&quot; and
sends data to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rscryutil --generate-random-key
16 --keyfile /some/secured/path/keyfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generates random key and stores
it in the specified keyfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOG SIGNATURES <br>
Encrypted log files can be used together with signing. To
verify such a file, it must be decrypted first, and the
verification tool rsgtutil(1) must be run on the decrypted
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS <br>
Specifying keys directly on the command line (--key option)
is very insecure and should not be done, except for testing
purposes with test keys. Even then it is recommended to <br>
use keyfiles, which are also easy to handle during testing.
Keep in mind that command history is usally be kept by bash
and can also easily be monitored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Local keyfiles are also a
security risk. At a minimum, they should be used with very
restrictive file permissions. For this reason, the rscryutil
tool creates them with read per&acirc; <br>
missions for the user, only, no matter what umask is set
to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When selecting cipher algorithms
and modes, care needs to be taken. The defaults should be
reasonable safe to use, but this tends to change over time.
Keep up with the most cur&acirc; <br>
rent crypto recommendations.</p>
