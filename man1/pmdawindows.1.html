<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Each supported platform has a kernel Performance Metrics
Domain Agent (PMDA) which extracts performance metrics from
the kernel of that platfrom. A variety of platform-specific
<br>
metrics are available, with an equally varied set of access
mechanisms - typically this involves special system calls,
or reading from files in kernel virtual filesystems such as
<br>
the Linux sysfs and procfs filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The platform kernel PMDA is one
of the most critical components of the PCP installation, and
must be as efficient and reliable as possible. In all
installations the default ker&acirc; <br>
nel PMDA will be installed as a shared library and thus
executes directly within the pmcd(1) process. This slightly
reduces overheads associated with querying the metadata and
<br>
values associated with these metrics (no message passing is
required).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike many other PMDAs, the
kernel PMDA exports a number of metric namespace subtrees,
such as kernel, network, swap, mem, ipc, filesys, nfs, disk
and hinv (hardware inventory).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Despite usually running as
shared libraries, most installations also include a
stand-alone executable for the kernel PMDA. This is to aid
profiling and debugging activities, <br>
with dbpmda(1) for example. In this case (but not for shared
libraries), the following command line options are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d It is absolutely crucial that
the performance metrics domain number specified here is
unique and consistent. That is, domain should be different
for every PMDA on the one <br>
host, and the same domain number should be used for the same
PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Location of the log file. By
default, a log file named [platform].log is written in the
current directory of pmcd(1) when pmda[platform] is started,
i.e. <br>
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. If the log file cannot be created or is
not writable, output is written to the standard error
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U User account under which to
run the agent. The default is the unprivileged
&quot;pcp&quot; account in current versions of PCP, but in
older versions the superuser account (&quot;root&quot;) <br>
was used by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
Access to the names, help text and values for the kernel
performance metrics is available by default - unlike most
other agents, no action is required to enable them and they
<br>
should not be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/[platform]/help <br>
default help text file for the the kernel metrics <br>
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/[platform].log <br>
default log file for error messages and other information
from the kernel PMDA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
