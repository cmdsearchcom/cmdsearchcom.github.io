<p>SENDPAGE(1) General Commands Manual SENDPAGE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sendpage - submit a pager job for transmission</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sendpage [ options ] [ message... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
sendpage submits a pager transmission request to a server
using the Simple Network Paging Protocol (SNPP) described in
RFC 1861. Pager requests specified with sendpage are
nor&acirc; <br>
mally processed immediately, although they may also be
queued for transmission at a later time using a syntax
identical to the at(1) command. For each job that is queued,
send&acirc; <br>
page prints a job identifier on the standard output. A job
identifier is the token by which jobs are identified within
HylaFAX. Job identifiers can be supplied to the faxrm(1)
<br>
command to remove the jobs or to the faxalter(1) command to
alter job parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pages may be sent to one or more
destination paging terminals and, optionally, include a text
message (depending on the capability of the receiving
device). Each destination is <br>
identified by a Pager Identification Number (PIN) specified
with the -p option; for example, sendpage -p 12345
&lsquo;&lsquo;Help, the fax machine is on
fire!&rsquo;&rsquo;. A PIN is typically a <br>
numeric string though it may also be an alpha-numeric alias
depending on the capabilities of the SNPP server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text messages can be specified
on the command line or taken from standard input. The -n
option must be used if no text message is to be supplied
with the page request&acirc;as for a <br>
numeric-only pager. Text supplied to the paging system is
sent exactly as submitted including any newline, carriage
return, or non-ASCII data. Message preparation including
<br>
filtering and formatting must be done prior to submitting
the data to sendpage. Note that text supplied on the command
line does not include a trailing newline character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The order of options on the
command line is significant. Each page to be transmitted is
assigned the current value of parameters specified on the
command line; e.g. whether or <br>
not to queue the request. This means that options that
specify parameters for a particular destination must precede
the pager ID specified with the -p option. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sendpage -l 2 -p sam Your
network is hosed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">submits a page to
&lsquo;&lsquo;sam&rsquo;&rsquo; that has service level 2
while</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sendpage -p sam -l 2 Your
network is hosed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">submits the same page but with
the default service level (1). Note also that parameter
values persist across -p options so the following</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sendpage -l 0 -p sam -p 5551212
Your network is hosed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">submits two pages, both of which
have service level 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a time Schedule transmission at the indicated time. Times
are specified using the syntax of the at(1) command; e.g.
&lsquo;&lsquo;now + 30 minutes&rsquo;&rsquo; to schedule
transmission 30 minutes <br>
in the future. By default, sendpage schedules pages for
&lsquo;&lsquo;now&rsquo;&rsquo;. (In SNPP parlance this
option specifies the &lsquo;&lsquo;hold time&rsquo;&rsquo;
for the page; and may result in the page <br>
being delivered to the paging terminal but not delivered to
the user until the specified time.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Enable notification by
electronic mail when the page has been delivered to the
service provider. This option is meaningful only when
communicating with a HylaFAX <br>
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f from Use from as the identity
of the message sender. Otherwise the sender is the user that
invoked sendpage. The sender is an account name to which the
HylaFAX software <br>
should direct email notification messages. The from identity
may be a fullblown &lsquo;&lsquo;From:&rsquo;&rsquo; line,
e.g. e.g. &lsquo;&lsquo;Joe Blow
&lt;joe@foo.com&gt;&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;joe@foo.com (Joe Blow)&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
are acceptable. If no host-part is specified in the from
string the local hostname is used. This option is useful
when sendpage is invoked on behalf of another <br>
user, such as in the implementation of an electronic mail to
pager gateway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h [modem@]host[:port] <br>
Force the jobs to be processed on a specific host and,
optionally, using a particular modem. The host may be either
a symbolic name or a network address. If no -h <br>
option is supplied, sendpage uses the SNPPSERVER environment
variable to identify the SNPP server to which the pages
should be directed. If no server is specified <br>
then sendpage attempts to contact a server on the local
host. If no modem is specified, the job will be submitted to
any available modem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I time If a job must be
requeued because of a communication failure schedule the
retry according to the specified time. Times are given in
seconds. Minutes, hours, and <br>
days can be specified with &lsquo;&lsquo;min&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;hour&rsquo;&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;&lsquo;day&rsquo;&rsquo; suffixes, respectively. By
default HylaFAX reschedules jobs using retry times that
depend on the manner in <br>
which the job failed; this interface permits a user to
override this algorithm and specify a single fixed retry
time for all communication failures. This option is <br>
meaningful only when communicating with a HylaFAX
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l level Specify a particular
service level to use in delivering a page. A service level
defines both a scheduling priority and the time that a
client is willing to wait to <br>
find out if delivery is successful or not. Normal delivery
is obtained with level 1 (default). The SNPP specification
identifies level 0 as the highest priority <br>
service level with levels 1-7 lower priority and levels 8-11
vendor/server-specific. For HylaFAX server machines the
mapping between service level and scheduling <br>
priority is defined by the configuration of the SNPP server
process; see the PriorityMap parameter in hfaxd(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Send to a numeric-only paging
device; i.e. do not send a text message in the paging
request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Do not notify the sender by
electronic mail when the page has been delivered to the
service provider (default). This option is meaningful only
when communicating <br>
with a HylaFAX server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p PIN The Pager Identification
Number (PIN) for a terminal that is to receive the message.
A message can be sent to multiple destinations by specifying
multiple -p <br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Mark pages to be queued on
the server and do not wait for their delivery. By default
sendpage conforms to the SNPP spec by synchronously waiting
for each page to be <br>
delivered. This option instructs sendpage to submit one or
pages and then terminate immediately without waiting for
their completion. When pages are queued it is <br>
advisable to enable email notification with the -D or -R
options. Job queueing is a non-standard function of the SNPP
implementation in HylaFAX and is not available <br>
when submitting pages to non-HylaFAX servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Enable notification by
electronic mail when the message has been delivered and when
it is requeued for retransmission. HylaFAX will always
notify the sender by elec&acirc; <br>
tronic mail if there is problem delivering a page
(irregardless of the email notification setting). This
option is meaningful only when communicating with a HylaFAX
<br>
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s subject Set the
&lsquo;&lsquo;subject&rsquo;&rsquo; for the specified pages
according to subject. For HylaFAX subject is used as the
identifier string returned in any email notification
messages <br>
(instead of the usual job identifier number). This option is
useful for applications that cross reference notification
messages against job submissions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t tries Make no more than tries
attempts to send the page. By default, HylaFAX will
terminate a job if: 3 consecutive attempts to send a
particular message fail, or it <br>
appears the receiver is not a service provider. Otherwise
HylaFAX places no limit on the number of attempts to send a
page, instead terminating a job if it is not <br>
completed within a fixed period of time specified by the
service level. Note that a try is a phone call in which
carrier is established and the IXO/TAP or UCP proto&acirc;
<br>
col is commenced; this is contrasted with a call attempt
that might have failed because the line was busy. This
option is meaningful only when communicating with a <br>
HylaFAX server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T dials Make no more than dials
phone calls when attempting to send a page. By default,
HylaFAX will terminate a job if: 12 attempts to reach a
service provider fail, or it <br>
appears the receiver is not a service provider. Otherwise
HylaFAX terminates a job if it is not completed within a
fixed period of time specified by the service <br>
level. This option is meaningful only when communicating
with a HylaFAX server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Trace the protocol between
sendpage and the SNPP server process that does the delivery
work on the remote machine. This information is directed to
the standard out&acirc; <br>
put.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS <br>
sendpage reads configuration information from the files
/etc/hylafax/hyla.conf, /etc/hylafax/sendpage.conf, and
~/.hylarc; in that order. Configuration files follow the
conven&acirc; <br>
tions described in hylafax-client(1). The following
configuration parameters are recognized: <br>
Tag Type Default Description <br>
HoldTime string - hold time to assign to pages <br>
Host string localhost host to contact for service <br>
MailAddr string - mail address for notification messages
<br>
MaxDials integer 12 times to retry dialing <br>
MaxTries integer 3 times to retry transmission <br>
Notify string none control email notification <br>
Port integer 444 port to use in contacting server <br>
Protocol string tcp protocol to use in contacting server
<br>
QueueSend boolean No whether or not to queue pages <br>
RetryTime string - delay between failed attempts to send
<br>
ServiceLevel integer SNPP service level for pages <br>
Verbose boolean No whether or not to enable protocol
tracing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration parameters are
explained below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HoldTime The hold time to assign
to pages. (Equivalent to the -a option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Host The host to contact for
service. (Equivalent to the -h option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MailAddr The electronic mail
address to direct notification messages from the server. If
this string is specified without an
&lsquo;&lsquo;@hostname&rsquo;&rsquo; part then the local
hostname <br>
will automatically be appended. (Equivalent to the -f
option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MaxDials The maximum number of
times to dial the phone for each job. (Equivalent to the -T
option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MaxTries The maximum number of
times to retry sending a job. (Equivalent to the -t
option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notify Control the email
notification messages from the server. This string may be
one of &lsquo;&lsquo;done&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;none&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;requeued&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;default&rsquo;&rsquo; with an optionally
preceding <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;when &rsquo;&rsquo; (e.g. &lsquo;&lsquo;when
done&rsquo;&rsquo;). Note that &lsquo;&lsquo;when
requeued&rsquo;&rsquo; implies &lsquo;&lsquo;when
done&rsquo;&rsquo;. (Equivalent to the -D, -R, and -N
options.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Port The network port to contact
for service. (Equivalent to the -h option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Protocol The name of the
communication protocol to use when contacting a server.
(Equivalent to the SNPPSERVICE environment variable.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QueueSend Control whether or not
to wait for the pages to be delivered. (Equivalent to the -q
option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RetryTime The time to delay
between job retries due to a communication failure.
(Equivalent to the -I option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ServiceLevel The SNPP service
level to assign to each page. (Equivalent to the -l
option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verbose Control protocol
tracing. (Equivalent to the -v option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The following environment variables are used by
sendpage:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SNPPSERVER The identity of the
SNPP server to contact for service. This value is specified
as &lsquo;&lsquo;[modem@]host[:port]&rsquo;&rsquo; where
host is either a host name or the Internet
&lsquo;&lsquo;.&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
(dot) address of the host; port is the TCP port number or
service name to use (default is
&lsquo;&lsquo;snpp&rsquo;&rsquo; or 444); and modem is an
optional modem name or class on the <br>
server machine to use in processing the requests (this is
meaningful only when the server is running HylaFAX).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SNPPSERVICE The communication
service specification for communicating with the SNPP
server. This value is specified as
&lsquo;&lsquo;port[/protocol]&rsquo;&rsquo;; by default
&lsquo;&lsquo;444/tcp&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/spool/hylafax/tmp/sndpageXXXXXX temporary files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The phone number of the pager service provider is stored on
the server machine and is not specified by the user; this is
a departure from pager support that was supplied with <br>
HylaFAX version 3.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HylaFAX version 3.0 used to
recognize a null text message and assume the destination
paging device was numeric-only. This is no longer true; if a
null text message is submitted <br>
then a null message will be included in the paging request.
This may cause paging requests submitted to
&lsquo;&lsquo;real SNPP&rsquo;&rsquo; servers to be rejected
if the paging device is in fact <br>
numeric-only. When sending to a numeric-only paging device
the -n option should be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
It is not possible to page text- and non-text devices
together; sendpage must be run twice, once to send to
text-capable devices and once to send to non-text
devices.</p>
