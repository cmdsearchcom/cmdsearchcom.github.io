<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
OpenSTV - Single Transferable Vote and Instant Runoff Voting
Software</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
openstv</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
OpenSTV is open-source software for implementing the single
transferable vote and other voting methods such as instant
runoff voting, condorcet voting, and approval voting. <br>
OpenSTV is the only open-source software that implements the
single transferable vote exactly as used by governments,
including Scotland and the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts.
<br>
These methods have been extensively verified against other
software and/or actual election results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Organizations can use OpenSTV to
implement their own elections. First, the organization must
adopt a voting method. Second, the organization must conduct
the vote, and this will <br>
most likely be done with paper ballots. Third, the ballots
must be entered into the OpenSTV program. Finally, you can
use OpenSTV to count the votes and determine the winners of
<br>
the election.</p>
