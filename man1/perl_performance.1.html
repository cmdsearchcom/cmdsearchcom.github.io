makepp_perl_performance -- How to make Perl faster
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The biggest tuning gains will usually come from algorithmic improvements. But
  while these can be hard to find, there is also a lot you can do mechanically.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Makepp is a big heavy-duty program, where speed is a must. A lot of effort has
  been put into optimizing it. This documents some general things we have found.
  Currently the concrete tests leading to these results have mostly been
  discarded, but I plan to gradually add them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are looking at how to speedup makepp (beyond the Perl programming you put
  into your makefiles), look at makepp_speedup. This page is completely
  independent of makepp, only intended to make our results available to the Perl
  community. Some of these measures are common sence, but you sometimes forget
  them. Others need measuring to believe them, so:

  don't guess</a></h2>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Profile your program</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Makepp comes with a module <i>profiler.pm</i> in its cvs
      repository. This is first run as a program on a copy(!) of your code,
      which it instruments. Then you run your copy and get configurable
      statistics per interval and a final total on the most frequently called
      functions and on the most time spent in functions (minus subcalls). Both
      are provided absolutely and in caller-callee pairs. (Documentation
      within.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This tells you which functions are the most promising candidates for tuning.
      It also gives you a hint where your algorithm might be wrong, either
      within surprisingly expensive functions, or through surprisingly frequent
      calls.</dd>

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    when run on different variants of code you can think of, can give surprising
      results. Even small modifications can matter a lot. Be careful not to
      &quot;measure&quot; code that can get optimized away, because you discard
      the result, or because it depends on constants.

  <dd class="It-tag">Dynamic method lookup is slower in any language, and Perl,
      being loosely typed, can never do it at compile time. Don't use it, unless
      you need the benefit of polymorphism through inheritance. The following
      call methods are ordered from slowest to fastest:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    $o-&gt;method( ... );          # searched in class of $o and its @ISA

    Class::method $o, ...;      # static function, new stack, checked at compile time
    &amp;Class::method;             # static function, reuse stack
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This last form always possible if method (or normal function) takes no
      arguments. If it does take arguments, watch out that you don't
      inadvertently supply any optional ones! If you use this form a lot, it is
      best to keep track of the minimum and maximum number of arguments each
      function can take. Reusing a stack with extra arguments is no problem,
      they'll get ignored.</dd>

      can use numeric constants to name the members. For the sake of
      comparability we use plain numeric keys here:

  <dd class="It-tag">When you need a unique reference representation, e.g. for
      set ops with hashes, using the integer form of refs is three times as fast
      as using the pretty printed default string representation. Caveat: the
      HP/UX 64bitall variant of Perl, at least up to 5.8.8 has a buggy
      &quot;int&quot; function, where this doesn't work reliably. There a hex
      form is still a fair bit faster than default strings. Actually this can
      even be faster than stringified int, depending on the version or maybe
      configuration of perl. As of 5.8.1 there is also the equivalent but
      hopefully reliable Scalar::Util::refaddr
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

  <dd class="It-tag">Perl is awful for always copying strings around, even if
      you're never going to modify them. This wastes CPU and memory. Try to
      avoid that wherever reasonably possible. If the string is a function
      parameter and the function has a modest length, don't copy the string into
      a &quot;my&quot; variable, access it with $_[0] and document the function
      well. Elsewhere, the aliasing feature of &quot;for(each)&quot; can help.
      Or just use references to strings, which are fast to copy. If you somehow
