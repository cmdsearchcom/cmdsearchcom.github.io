<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
makepp_perl_performance -- How to make Perl faster</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The biggest tuning gains will usually come from algorithmic
improvements. But while these can be hard to find, there is
also a lot you can do mechanically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makepp is a big heavy-duty
program, where speed is a must. A lot of effort has been put
into optimizing it. This documents some general things we
have found. Currently the <br>
concrete tests leading to these results have mostly been
discarded, but I plan to gradually add them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are looking at how to
speedup makepp (beyond the Perl programming you put into
your makefiles), look at makepp_speedup. This page is
completely independent of makepp, <br>
only intended to make our results available to the Perl
community. Some of these measures are common sence, but you
sometimes forget them. Others need measuring to believe <br>
them, so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Measure, don&rsquo;t guess <br>
Profile your program <br>
Makepp comes with a module profiler.pm in its cvs
repository. This is first run as a program on a copy(!) of
your code, which it instruments. Then you run your copy and
get <br>
configurable statistics per interval and a final total on
the most frequently called functions and on the most time
spent in functions (minus subcalls). Both are provided <br>
absolutely and in caller-callee pairs. (Documentation
within.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tells you which functions
are the most promising candidates for tuning. It also gives
you a hint where your algorithm might be wrong, either
within surprisingly <br>
expensive functions, or through surprisingly frequent
calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Time your solution <br>
Either one of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -Mstrict -MBenchmark -we
&rsquo;my &lt;initialization&gt;; timethis -10, sub {
&lt;code&gt; }&rsquo; <br>
time perl -Mstrict -we &rsquo;my &lt;initialization&gt;;
for( 0..999_999 ) { &lt;code&gt; }&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">when run on different variants
of code you can think of, can give surprising results. Even
small modifications can matter a lot. Be careful not to
&quot;measure&quot; code that can <br>
get optimized away, because you discard the result, or
because it depends on constants.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Depending on your system, this
will tell you in kb how fat Perl got:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -Mstrict -we
&rsquo;&lt;build huge data&gt;; system &quot;ps -ovsz
$$&quot;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Below we only show the code
within the &quot;-e&quot; option as one liners.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regexps <br>
Use simple regexps <br>
Several matches combined with &quot;||&quot; are faster than
a big one with &quot;|&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use precompiled regexps <br>
Instead of interpolating strings into regexps (except if the
string will never change and you use the &quot;o&quot;
modifier), precompile the regexp with &quot;qr//&quot; and
interpolate that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use (?:...) <br>
If you don&rsquo;t use what the grouping matches,
don&rsquo;t make Perl save it with &quot;(...)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anchor at beginning of string
<br>
Don&rsquo;t make Perl look through your whole string, if you
want a match only at the beginning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t anchor at end after
greedy <br>
If you have a &quot;*&quot; or &quot;+&quot; that will match
till the end of string, don&rsquo;t put a &quot;$&quot;
after it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use tr/// <br>
This is twice as fast as s/// when it is applicable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Functions <br>
Avoid object orientation <br>
Dynamic method lookup is slower in any language, and Perl,
being loosely typed, can never do it at compile time.
Don&rsquo;t use it, unless you need the benefit of
polymorphism <br>
through inheritance. The following call methods are ordered
from slowest to fastest:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$o-&gt;method( ... ); # searched
in class of $o and its @ISA <br>
Class::method( $o, ... ); # static function, new stack <br>
Class::method $o, ...; # static function, new stack, checked
at compile time <br>
&amp;Class::method; # static function, reuse stack</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This last form always possible
if method (or normal function) takes no arguments. If it
does take arguments, watch out that you don&rsquo;t
inadvertently supply any optional ones! <br>
If you use this form a lot, it is best to keep track of the
minimum and maximum number of arguments each function can
take. Reusing a stack with extra arguments is no <br>
problem, they&rsquo;ll get ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t modify stack <br>
The following sin is frequently found even in the Perl
doc:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $self = shift;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless you have a pertinent
reason for this, use this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my( $self, $x, $y, @z ) =
@_;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use few functions and modules
<br>
Every function (and that alas includes constants) takes up
over 1kb for it&rsquo;s mere existence. With each module
requiring other ones, most of which you never need, that can
<br>
add up. Don&rsquo;t pull in a big module, just to replace
two lines of Perl code with a single more elegant looking
function call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have a function only
called in one place, and the two combined would still be
reasonably short, merge them with due comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t have one function
only call another with the same arguments. Alias it
instead:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*alias = function;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Group calls to print <br>
Individual calls to print, or print with separate arguments
are very expensive. Build up the string in memory and print
it in one go. If you can accumulate over 3kb, <br>
syswrite is more efficient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -MBenchmark -we
&rsquo;timethis -10, sub { print STDERR $_ for 1..5 }&rsquo;
2&gt;/dev/null <br>
perl -MBenchmark -we &rsquo;timethis -10, sub { print STDERR
1..5 }&rsquo; 2&gt;/dev/null <br>
perl -MBenchmark -we &rsquo;timethis -10, sub { my $str =
&quot;&quot;; $str .= $_ for 1..5; print STDERR $str
}&rsquo; 2&gt;/dev/null</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous <br>
Avoid hashes <br>
Perl becomes quite slow with many small hashes. If you
don&rsquo;t need them, use something else. Object
orientation works just as well on an array, except that the
members can&rsquo;t <br>
be accessed by name. But you can use numeric constants to
name the members. For the sake of comparability we use plain
numeric keys here:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $i = 0; our %a = map +($i++,
$_), &quot;a&quot;..&quot;j&quot;; timethis -10, sub { $b =
$a{int rand 10} } <br>
our @a = &quot;a&quot;..&quot;j&quot;; timethis -10, sub {
$b = $a[rand 10] }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $i = 0; my %a = map +($i++,
$_), &quot;a&quot;..&quot;j&quot;; timethis -10, sub { $b =
$a{int rand 10} } <br>
my @a = &quot;a&quot;..&quot;j&quot;; timethis -10, sub { $b
= $a[rand 10] }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use int keys for ref sets <br>
When you need a unique reference representation, e.g. for
set ops with hashes, using the integer form of refs is three
times as fast as using the pretty printed default <br>
string representation. Caveat: the HP/UX 64bitall variant of
Perl, at least up to 5.8.8 has a buggy &quot;int&quot;
function, where this doesn&rsquo;t work reliably. There a
hex form is <br>
still a fair bit faster than default strings. Actually this
can even be faster than stringified int, depending on the
version or maybe configuration of perl. As of 5.8.1 <br>
there is also the equivalent but hopefully reliable
Scalar::Util::refaddr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my @list = map { bless { $_
=&gt; 1 }, &quot;someclass&quot; } 0..9; my( %a, %b ); <br>
timethis -10, sub { $a{$_} = 1 for @list }; <br>
timethis -10, sub { $b{int()} = 1 for @list }; <br>
timethis -10, sub { $b{sprintf &rsquo;%x&rsquo;, $_} = 1 for
@list }; <br>
timethis -10, sub { $b{refaddr $_} = 1 for @list };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also sprintf
&rsquo;%p&rsquo; which supposedly outputs a pointer, but
depending on which expression leads to the same ref, you get
different values, so it&rsquo;s useless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beware of strings <br>
Perl is awful for always copying strings around, even if
you&rsquo;re never going to modify them. This wastes CPU and
memory. Try to avoid that wherever reasonably possible. If
<br>
the string is a function parameter and the function has a
modest length, don&rsquo;t copy the string into a
&quot;my&quot; variable, access it with $_[0] and document
the function well. <br>
Elsewhere, the aliasing feature of &quot;for(each)&quot; can
help. Or just use references to strings, which are fast to
copy. If you somehow ensure that same strings get stored
only <br>
once, you can do numerical comparison for equality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Avoid bit operations <br>
If you have disjoint bit patterns you can add them instead
of or&lsquo;ing them. Shifting can be performed my
multiplication or integer division. Retaining only the
lowest bits <br>
can be achieved with modulo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Separate boolean hash members
are faster than stuffing everything into an integer with bit
operations or into a string with &quot;vec&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use order of boolean operations
<br>
If you only care whether an expression is true or false,
check the cheap things, like boolean variables, first, and
call functions last.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use undef instead of 0 <br>
It takes up a few percent less memory, at least as hash or
list values. You can still query it as a boolean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my %x; $x{$_} = 0 for
0..999_999; system &quot;ps -ovsz $$&quot; <br>
my %x; undef $x{$_} for 0..999_999; system &quot;ps -ovsz
$$&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my @x = (0) x 999_999; system
&quot;ps -ovsz $$&quot; <br>
my @x = (undef) x 999_999; system &quot;ps -ovsz
$$&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Choose for or map <br>
These are definitely not equivalent. Depending on your use
(i.e. the list and the complexity of your code), one or the
other may be faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my @l = 0..99; <br>
for( 0..99_999 ) { map $a = &quot; $_ &quot;, @l } <br>
for( 0..99_999 ) { map $a = &quot; $_ &quot;, 0..99 } <br>
for( 0..99_999 ) { $a = &quot; $_ &quot; for @l } <br>
for( 0..99_999 ) { $a = &quot; $_ &quot; for 0..99 }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t alias $_ <br>
While it is convenient, it is rather expensive, even copying
reasonable strings is faster. The last example is twice as
fast as the first &quot;for&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $x = &quot;abcdefg&quot;; my
$b = 0; <br>
for( &quot;$x&quot; ) { $b = 1 - $b if /g/ } # Copy needed
only if modifying. <br>
for( $x ) { $b = 1 - $b if /g/ } <br>
local *_ = ; $b = 1 - $b if /g/; <br>
local $_ = $x; $b = 1 - $b if /g/; # Copy cheaper than
alias. <br>
my $y = $x; $b = 1 - $b if $y =~ /g/;</p>
