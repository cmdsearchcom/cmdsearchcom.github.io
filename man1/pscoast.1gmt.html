<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: No space is allowed

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pscoast plots grayshaded, colored, or textured land-masses
[or water-masses] on maps and [optionally] draws coastlines,
rivers, and political boundaries. Alternatively, it can <br>
(1) issue clip paths that will contain all land or all water
areas, or (2) dump the data to an ASCII table. The data
files come in 5 different resolutions: (f)ull, (h)igh, <br>
(i)ntermediate, (l)ow, and (c)rude. The full resolution
files amount to more than 55 Mb of data and provide great
detail; for maps of larger geographical extent it is more
eco&acirc; <br>
nomical to use one of the other resolutions. If the user
selects to paint the land-areas and does not specify fill of
water-areas then the latter will be transparent (i.e.,
ear&acirc; <br>
lier graphics drawn in those areas will not be overwritten).
Likewise, if the water-areas are painted and no land fill is
set then the land-areas will be transparent. A map
pro&acirc; <br>
jection must be supplied. The PostScript code is written to
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIRED ARGUMENTS <br>
-Jparameters (more ...) <br>
Select map projection.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R[unit]west/east/south/north[/zmin/zmax][r]
<br>
west, east, south, and north specify the region of interest,
and you may specify them in decimal degrees or in
[+-]dd:mm[:ss.xxx][W|E|S|N] format. Append r if lower left
<br>
and upper right map coordinates are given instead of
w/e/s/n. The two shorthands -Rg and -Rd stand for global
domain (0/360 and -180/+180 in longitude respectively, with
<br>
-90/+90 in latitude). Alternatively for grid creation, give
Rcodelon/lat/nx/ny, where code is a 2-character combination
of L, C, R (for left, center, or right) and T, M, <br>
B for top, middle, or bottom. e.g., BL for lower left. This
indicates which point on a rectangular region the lon/lat
coordinate refers to, and the grid dimensions nx and <br>
ny with grid spacings via -I is used to create the
corresponding region. Alternatively, specify the name of an
existing grid file and the -R settings (and grid spacing,
<br>
if applicable) are copied from the grid. Using -Runit
expects projected (Cartesian) coordinates compatible with
chosen -J and we inversely project to determine actual
rec&acirc; <br>
tangular geographic region. For perspective view (-p),
optionally append /zmin/zmax. In case of perspective view
(-p), a z-range (zmin, zmax) can be appended to indicate
<br>
the third dimension. This needs to be done only when using
the -Jz option, not when using only the -p option. In the
latter case a perspective view of the plane is plot&acirc;
<br>
ted, with no third dimension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For perspective view p,
optionally append /zmin/zmax. (more ...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS <br>

-Amin_area[/min_level/max_level][+ag|i|s|S][+r|l][+ppercent]
<br>
Features with an area smaller than min_area in km^2 or of
hierarchical level that is lower than min_level or higher
than max_level will not be plotted [Default is 0/0/4 <br>
(all features)]. Level 2 (lakes) contains regular lakes and
wide river bodies which we normally include as lakes; append
+r to just get river-lakes or +l to just get reg&acirc; <br>
ular lakes. By default (+ai) we select the ice shelf
boundary as the coastline for Antarctica; append +ag to
instead select the ice grounding line as coastline. For <br>
expert users who wish to print their own Antarctica
coastline and islands via psxy you can use +as to skip all
GSHHG features below 60S or +aS to instead skip all features
<br>
north of 60S. Finally, append +ppercent to exclude polygons
whose percentage area of the corresponding full-resolution
feature is less than percent. See GSHHG INFORMATION <br>
below for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B[p|s]parameters (more ...)
<br>
Set map boundary intervals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C[l|r/]fill <br>
Set the shade, color, or pattern for lakes and river-lakes
[Default is the fill chosen for &quot;wet&quot; areas (-S)].
Optionally, specify separate fills by prepending l/ for
lakes <br>
and r/ for river-lakes, repeating the -C option as
needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dresolution[+] <br>
Selects the resolution of the data set to use ((f)ull,
(h)igh, (i)ntermediate, (l)ow, and (c)rude). The resolution
drops off by 80% between data sets [Default is l]. <br>
Append + to automatically select a lower resolution should
the one requested not be available [abort if not found].
Alternatively, choose (a)uto to automatically select <br>
the best resolution given the chosen map scale.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ecode1,code2,...[+l|L][+gfill][+ppen][+r|R[incs]]
<br>
Select painting or dumping country polygons from the Digital
Chart of the World. This is another dataset independent of
GSHHG and hence the -A and -D options do not <br>
apply. Append one or more comma-separated countries using
the 2-character ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 convention. To select a
state of a country (if available), append .state, <br>
e.g, US.TX for Texas. To specify a whole continent, prepend
= to any of the continent codes AF (Africa), AN
(Antarctica), AS (Asia), EU (Europe), OC (Oceania), NA
(North <br>
America), or SA (South America). Append +l to just list the
countries and their codes [no data extraction or plotting
takes place]. Use +L to see states/territories for <br>
Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, and the US. Use +r to
obtain the bounding box coordinates from the polygon(s).
Append inc, xinc/yinc, or winc/einc/sinc/ninc to <br>
adjust the region to be a multiple of these steps [no
adjustment]. Use +R to extend the region outward by adding
these increments instead [no extension]. Append +ppen to
<br>
draw polygon outlines [no outline] and +gfill to fill them
[no fill]. One of +p|g must be specified unless +r, +R, or
-M is in effect, and only one -E option can be <br>
given. You may repeat -E to give different groups of items
separate pen/fill settings. If modifiers +r or +R are used
and neither -J nor -M is set then we just print the <br>
-Rwesn string.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F[+cclearances][+gfill][+i[[gap/]pen]][+p[pen]][+r[radius]][+s[[dx/dy/][shade]]]
<br>
Without further options, draws a rectangular border around
the map scale or rose using MAP_FRAME_PEN; specify a
different pen with +ppen. Add +gfill to fill the logo box
<br>
[no fill]. Append +cclearance where clearance is either gap,
xgap/ygap, or lgap/rgap/bgap/tgap where these items are
uniform, separate in x- and y-direction, or individ&acirc;
<br>
ual side spacings between logo and border. Append +i to draw
a secondary, inner border as well. We use a uniform gap
between borders of 2p and the MAP_DEFAULT_PEN unless <br>
other values are specified. Append +r to draw rounded
rectangular borders instead, with a 6p corner radius. You
can override this radius by appending another value. <br>
Finally, append +s to draw an offset background shaded
region. Here, dx/dy indicates the shift relative to the
foreground frame [4p/-4p] and shade sets the fill style to
<br>
use for shading [gray50]. Requires -L or -T. If both -L or
-T, you may repeat -F after each of these.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Gfill|c <br>
Select filling or clipping of &quot;dry&quot; areas. Append
the shade, color, or pattern; or use -Gc for clipping
[Default is no fill].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Iriver[/pen] <br>
Draw rivers. Specify the type of rivers and [optionally]
append pen attributes [Default pen: width = default, color =
black, style = solid].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Choose from the list of river
types below; repeat option -I as often as necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 = Double-lined rivers
(river-lakes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 = Permanent major rivers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 = Additional major rivers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c = All canals (8-10)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Jz|Zparameters (more ...) <br>
Set z-axis scaling; same syntax as -Jx.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K (more ...) <br>
Do not finalize the PostScript plot.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L[g|j|J|n|x]refpoint+c[slon/]slat+wlength[e|f|k|M|n|u][+aalign][+f][+l[label]][+u]
<br>
Draws a simple map scale centered on the reference point
specified using one of four coordinate systems: (1) Use -Dg
for map (user) coordinates, (2) use -Dj or -DJ for <br>
setting refpoint via a 2-char justification code that refers
to the (invisible) map domain rectangle, (3) use -Dn for
normalized (0-1) coordinates, or (4) use -Dx for plot <br>
coordinates (inches, cm, etc.). Scale is calculated for
latitude slat (optionally supply longitude slon for oblique
projections [Default is central meridian]), length is <br>
in km, or append unit from e|f|k|M|n|u. Change the label
alignment with +aalign (choose among l(eft), r(ight), t(op),
and b(ottom)). Append +f to get a &quot;fancy&quot; scale
<br>
[Default is plain]. Append +l to select the default label,
which equals the distance unit (meter, foot, km, mile,
nautical mile, US survey foot) and is justified on top <br>
of the scale [t]. Change this by giving your own label
(append +llabel). Select +u to append the unit to all
distance annotations along the scale (for the plain scale,
+u <br>
will instead select the unit to be appended to the distance
length). Note: Use FONT_LABEL to change the label font and
FONT_ANNOT_PRIMARY to change the annotation font. <br>
The height of the map scale is controlled by
MAP_SCALE_HEIGHT, and the pen thickness is set by
MAP_TICK_PEN_PRIMARY. See -F on how to place a panel behind
the scale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Dumps a single multisegment
ASCII (or binary, see -bo) file to standard output. No
plotting occurs. Specify one of -E, -I, -N or -W. Note: if
-M is used with -E then -R <br>
or the +r modifier to -E are not required as we
automatically determine the region given the selected
geographic entities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Nborder[/pen] <br>
Draw political boundaries. Specify the type of boundary and
[optionally] append pen attributes [Default pen: width =
default, color = black, style = solid].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Choose from the list of
boundaries below. Repeat option -N as often as
necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 = National boundaries</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 = State boundaries within the
Americas</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 = Marine boundaries</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a = All boundaries (1-3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O (more ...) <br>
Append to existing PostScript plot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P (more ...) <br>
Select &quot;Portrait&quot; plot orientation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Mark end of existing clip
path. No projection information is needed. Also supply -X
and -Y settings if you have moved since the clip
started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sfill|c <br>
Select filling or clipping of &quot;wet&quot; areas. Append
the shade, color, or pattern; or use -Sc for clipping
[Default is no fill].</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Td[g|j|J|n|x]refpoint+wwidth[+f[level]][+jjustify][+lw,e,s,n][+odx[/dy]]
<br>
-Td draws a map directional rose on the map at the location
defined by the reference and anchor points: Give the
reference point on the map for the rose using one of four
<br>
coordinate systems: (1) Use g for map (user) coordinates,
(2) use j for setting refpoint via a 2-char justification
code that refers to the (invisible) map domain rectan&acirc;
<br>
gle, (3) use n for normalized (0-1) coordinates, or (4) use
x for plot coordinates (inches, cm, etc.) [Default]. You can
offset the reference point by dx/dy in the direc&acirc; <br>
tion implied by justify. By default, the anchor point on the
scale is assumed to be the center of the rose (MC), but this
can be changed by appending +j followed by a <br>
2-char justification code justify (see pstext). Note: If -Dj
is used then justify defaults to the same as refpoint, if
-DJ is used then justify defaults to the mirror <br>
opposite of refpoint. Add +o to offset the color scale by
dx/dy away from the refpoint point in the direction implied
by justify (or the direction implied by -Dj or -DJ). <br>
Append +wwidthto set the width of the rose in plot
coordinates (inches, cm, etc.). Add +f to get a
&quot;fancy&quot; rose, and specify in level what you want
drawn. The default [1] <br>
draws the two principal E-W, N-S orientations, 2 adds the
two intermediate NW-SE and NE-SW orientations, while 3 adds
the eight minor orientations WNW-ESE, NNW-SSE, <br>
NNE-SSW, and ENE-WSW. Label the cardinal points W,E,S,N by
adding +l and append your own four comma-separated strings
to override the default. See Placing-dir-map-roses <br>
and -F on how to place a panel behind the scale.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Tm[g|j|J|n|x]refpoint+wwidth[+ddec[/dlabel]]][+ipen][+jjustify][+lw,e,s,n][+ppen][+tints][+odx[/dy]]
<br>
-Tm draws a map magnetic rose on the map at the location
defined by the reference and anchor points: Give the
reference point on the map for the rose using one of four
coordi&acirc; <br>
nate systems: (1) Use g for map (user) coordinates, (2) use
j for setting refpoint via a 2-char justification code that
refers to the (invisible) map domain rectangle, (3) use <br>
n for normalized (0-1) coordinates, or (4) use x for plot
coordinates (inches, cm, etc.) [Default]. You can offset the
reference point by dx/dy in the direction implied by <br>
justify. By default, the anchor point on the scale is
assumed to be the center of the rose (MC), but this can be
changed by appending +j followed by a 2-char justification
<br>
code justify (see pstext). Note: If -Dj is used then justify
defaults to the same as refpoint, if -DJ is used then
justify defaults to the mirror opposite of refpoint. Add
<br>
+o to offset the color scale by dx/dy away from the refpoint
point in the direction implied by justify (or the direction
implied by -Dj or -DJ). Append +wwidthto set the <br>
width of the rose in plot coordinates (inches, cm, etc.).
Use +d to assign the magnetic declination and set dlabel,
which is a label for the magnetic compass needle (Leave <br>
empty to format a label from dec, or give - to bypass
labeling). With +d, both directions to geographic and
magnetic north are plotted [Default is geographic only]. If
the <br>
north label is * then a north star is plotted instead of the
north label. Annotation and two levels of tick intervals for
both geographic and magnetic directions are 30/5/1 <br>
degrees; override these settings by appending +tints, and
append six intervals to set both the geographic and magnetic
intervals. Label the cardinal points W,E,S,N by adding <br>
+l and append your own four comma-separated strings to
override the default. Number GMT default parameters control
pens, fonts, and color; see the Placing-mag-map-roses
sec&acirc; <br>
tion in the Cookbook. See -F on how to place a panel behind
the scale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W[level/]pen (more ...) <br>
Draw shorelines [Default is no shorelines]. Append pen
attributes [Defaults: width = default, color = black, style
= solid] which apply to all four levels. To set the pen <br>
for each level differently, prepend level/, where level is
1-4 and represent coastline, lakeshore, island-in-lake
shore, and lake-in-island-in-lake shore. Repeat -W as <br>
needed. When specific level pens are set, those not listed
will not be drawn [Default draws all levels; but see
-A].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GSHHS INFORMATION <br>
The coastline database is GSHHG (formerly GSHHS) which is
compiled from three sources: World Vector Shorelines (WVS),
CIA World Data Bank II (WDBII), and Atlas of the Cryosphere
<br>
(AC, for Antarctica only). Apart from Antarctica, all
level-1 polygons (ocean-land boundary) are derived from the
more accurate WVS while all higher level polygons (level
2-4, <br>
representing land/lake, lake/island-in-lake, and
island-in-lake/lake-in-island-in-lake boundaries) are taken
from WDBII. The Antarctica coastlines come in two flavors:
ice-front <br>
or grounding line, selectable via the -A option. Much
processing has taken place to convert WVS, WDBII, and AC
data into usable form for GMT: assembling closed polygons
from <br>
line segments, checking for duplicates, and correcting for
crossings between polygons. The area of each polygon has
been determined so that the user may choose not to draw
fea&acirc; <br>
tures smaller than a minimum area (see -A); one may also
limit the highest hierarchical level of polygons to be
included (4 is the maximum). The 4 lower-resolution
databases were <br>
derived from the full resolution database using the
Douglas-Peucker line-simplification algorithm. The
classification of rivers and borders follow that of the
WDBII. See the GMT <br>
Cookbook and Technical Reference Appendix K for further
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The options to fill (-C -G -S) may not always work if the
Azimuthal equidistant projection is chosen (-Je|E). If the
antipole of the projection is in the oceans it will most
<br>
likely work. If not, try to avoid using projection center
coordinates that are even multiples of the coastline bin
size (1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 degrees for f, h, i, l, c,
respec&acirc; <br>
tively). This projection is not supported for clipping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The political borders are for
the most part 1970s-style but have been updated to reflect
more recent border rearrangements in Europe and elsewhere.
Let us know if you find some&acirc; <br>
thing out of date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The full-resolution coastlines
are also from a digitizing effort in the 1970-80s and it is
difficult to assess the accuracy. Users who zoom in close
enough may find that the <br>
GSHHG coastline is not matching other data, e.g., satellite
images, more recent coastline data, etc. We are aware of
such mismatches but cannot undertake band-aid solutions each
<br>
time this occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some users of pscoast will not
be satisfied with what they find for the Antarctic
shoreline. In Antarctica, the boundary between ice and ocean
varies seasonally and inter-annu&acirc; <br>
ally. There are some areas of permanent shelf ice. In
addition to these time-varying ice-ocean boundaries, there
are also shelf ice grounding lines where ice goes from
floating <br>
