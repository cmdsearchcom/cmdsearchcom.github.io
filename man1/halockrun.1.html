<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
halockrun - Run command while holding exclusive lock on
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
halockrun [-ancfv] [-e exitcode] [-E nexitcode] lockfile
command [args] halockrun -t|-N [-nc] [-e exitcode] [-E
nexitcode] lockfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Executes command with args while holding an exclusive lock
on the file lockfile. If the file is locked by another
process, halockrun will wait until the lock becomes
available <br>
and executes the command then.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">halockrun is often used to avoid
cron job overruns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">halockrun uses operating system
locks (POSIX -- fcntl(2)) that makes it very resistant to
stale locks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Async mode. Starts command in
the background. halockrun itself exits immediately. The
exitcode of the executed command is lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Create mode. Creates the
lockfile if it doesn&rsquo;t exist. The default behavior is
to exit with exitcode if the specified lockfile
doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e exitcode <br>
Changes the exitcode returned by halockrun on fail to
exitcode The default value is 99.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E nexitcode <br>
Changes the &quot;lock busy&quot; exitcode returned by
halockrun</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value for this
option is exitcode in non-blocking mode and 1 in testing-,
and noop-mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Non-blocking mode. Exits
immediately with nexitcode if the lockfile is locked by
another process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Fork mode. The normal
behavior of halockrun is to get the lock and call execvp(2)
to execute the command specified. If fork mode, halockrun
will do a fork(2) and run the <br>
command in its own process. In this case the
parent--halockrun itself--holds the lock on lockfile. The
split in two processes opens the risk that the parent
halock&acirc; <br>
run--that holds the lock--dies and leaves command
unprotected. To minimize this risk, halockrun ignores the
following signals: TERM, HUP, INT, PIPE, QUIT, USR1, and
USR2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is useful to make
sure that the command does not see any difference when
running under protection of halockrun. In other words, the
fork mode makes sure that <br>
the open file handle to lockfile is not visible to
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fork mode has also influence on
the -t switch, because that will not return the PID of
command but of the parent halockrun process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is new to version
V0.99.08, prior this version halockrun has always fork(2)ed.
The default was changed because reliability is more
important than trans&acirc; <br>
parency--in that case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are in doubt about this
option: don&rsquo;t use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Test mode. Checks if lockfile
is currently busy, and prints the PID of the process that
holds the lock--if any. See also -N for that purpose. The
exitcode is 0 if the <br>
lock is free or nexitcode if it is busy. Any other
error--such as &quot;lockfile not found&quot;--will result
in exitcode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regardless of the lock status,
halockrun will not run any command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -t flags is specified
the flags -a, -n and -f are meaningless and will be ignored
if they are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N No-op mode. The -N flag is
semantically equivalent to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">halockrun lockfile /bin/true</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It supplements the -t switch
because it blocks. It can be combined with the -n option to
change the blocking behavior. However, it doesn&rsquo;t
print the PID of the the lock <br>
holder if it is busy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -N switch is more portable
and used to synchronize with a running process. The -t
switch is used to obtain the PID of the running process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -N flag is specified,
the -a and -f flags are meaningless and will be ignored if
they are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v[v] Verbose mode and more
verbose mode--almost debug mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUE <br>
On success, if command was executed, halockrun returns the
return value of command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -t or -N was used, 0 is
returned if the lock is not currently busy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On failure--if lockfile
doesn&rsquo;t exist or command can&rsquo;t be
executed--halockrun returns the value specified by the -e
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On failure to obtain the lock in
testing mode or in noop mode ( -t or -N ) the value
specified by the -E option is returned or 1 per default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On failure to obtain the lock in
non-blocking mode halockrun returns the values specified by
the -E option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The most prominent use of halockrun is to protect from cron
overrun. A typical 5 minutes cron job like that</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*/5 * * * * /path/script</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would be transformed to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*/5 * * * * halockrun -cn
/path/lock /path/script</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will prevent multiple
parallel instances of /path/script. Additionally, you might
use hatimerun to kill script when it takes longer then 5
minutes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*/5 * * * * hatimerun -t 5:00
halockrun -cn /path/lock /path/script</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can configure hatimerun for
many different actions, please refer to the hatimerun(1)
manpage for the full documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY <br>
halockrun uses fcntl(2) advisory locking. Similar tools that
use a different locking appraoch like flock(2) of lockf(3)
may or may not work together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, locks placed by
flock(2) on Linux are independend from locks placed by
fcntl(2) on the same system. That means, if you mix those
two methods, they don&rsquo;t lock each <br>
other.</p>
