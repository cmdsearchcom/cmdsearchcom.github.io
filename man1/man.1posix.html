<p>MAN(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
MAN(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
man &acirc; display system documentation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
man [&acirc;k] name...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The man utility shall write information about each of the
name operands. If name is the name of a standard utility,
man at a minimum shall write a message describing the syntax
<br>
used by the standard utility, its options, and operands. If
more information is available, the man utility shall provide
it in an implementation-defined manner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An implementation may provide
information for values of name other than the standard
utilities. Standard utilities that are listed as optional
and that are not supported by the <br>
implementation either shall cause a brief message indicating
that fact to be displayed or shall cause a full display of
information as described previously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The man utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following option shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;k Interpret name operands
as keywords to be used in searching a utilities summary
database that contains a brief purpose entry for each
standard utility and write lines <br>
from the summary database that match any of the keywords.
The keyword search shall produce results that are the
equivalent of the output of the following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grep &acirc;Ei &rsquo; <br>
name <br>
name <br>
... <br>
&rsquo; summary-database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This assumes that the
summary-database is a text file with a single entry per
line; this organization is not required and the example
using grep &acirc;Ei is merely illustra&acirc; <br>
tive of the type of search intended. The purpose entry to be
included in the database shall consist of a terse
description of the purpose of the utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name A keyword or the name of a
standard utility. When &acirc;k is not specified and name
does not represent one of the standard utilities, the
results are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of man:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments <br>
and in the summary database). The value of LC_CTYPE need not
affect the format of the information written about the name
operands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error and informative messages written to standard
<br>
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAGER Determine an output
filtering command for writing the output to a terminal. Any
string acceptable as a command_string operand to the sh
&acirc;c command shall be valid. When <br>
standard output is a terminal device, the reference page
output shall be piped through the command. If the PAGER
variable is null or not set, the command shall be <br>
either more or another paginator utility documented in the
system documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The man utility shall write text describing the syntax of
the utility name, its options and its operands, or, when
&acirc;k is specified, lines from the summary database. The
format of <br>
this text is implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used for diagnostic messages,
and may also be used for informational messages of
unspecified format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
It is recognized that the man utility is only of minimal
usefulness as specified. The opinion of the standard
developers was strongly divided as to how much or how little
infor&acirc; <br>
mation man should be required to provide. They considered,
however, that the provision of some portable way of
accessing documentation would aid user portability. The
arguments <br>
against a fuller specification were:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Large quantities of
documentation should not be required on a system that does
not have excess disk space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The current manual system does
not present information in a manner that greatly aids user
portability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A &lsquo;&lsquo;better help
system&rsquo;&rsquo; is currently an area in which vendors
feel that they can add value to their POSIX
implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;f option was
considered, but due to implementation differences, it was
not included in this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The description was changed to
be more specific about what has to be displayed for a
utility. The standard developers considered it insufficient
to allow a display of only the <br>
synopsis without giving a short description of what each
option and operand does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The
&lsquo;&lsquo;purpose&rsquo;&rsquo; entry to be included in
the database can be similar to the section title (less the
numeric prefix) from this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 for
each utility. These <br>
titles are similar to those used in historical systems for
this purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See mailx for rationale
concerning the default paginator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The caveat in the LC_CTYPE
description was added because it is not a requirement that
an implementation provide reference pages for all of its
supported locales on each system; <br>
changing LC_CTYPE does not necessarily translate the
reference page into another language. This is equivalent to
the current state of LC_MESSAGES in
POSIX.1&acirc;2008&acirc;locale-specific <br>
messages are not yet a requirement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The historical MANPATH variable
is not included in POSIX because no attempt is made to
specify naming conventions for reference page files, nor
even to mandate that they are <br>
files at all. On some implementations they could be a true
database, a hypertext file, or even fixed strings within the
man executable. The standard developers considered the <br>
portability of reference pages to be outside their scope of
work. However, users should be aware that MANPATH is
implemented on a number of historical systems and that it
can be <br>
used to tailor the search pattern for reference pages from
the various categories (utilities, functions, file formats,
and so on) when the system administrator reveals the
loca&acirc; <br>
tion and conventions for reference pages on the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The keyword search can rely on
at least the text of the section titles from these utility
descriptions, and the implementation may add more keywords.
The term &lsquo;&lsquo;section titles&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
refers to the strings such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">man &acirc; Display system
documentation <br>
ps &acirc; Report process status</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
