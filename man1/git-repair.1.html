git-repair - Fix a broken git repository
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
git-repair [--force]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This can fix a corrupt or broken git repository, which git fsck would only
  complain has problems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It does by deleting all corrupt objects, and retreiving all missing objects that
  it can from the remotes of the repository.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If that is not sufficient to fully recover the repository, it can also reset
  branches back to commits before the corruption happened, delete branches that
  are no longer available due to the lost data, and remove any missing files
  from the index. It will only do this if run with the <b>--force</b> option,
  since that rewrites history and throws out missing data. Note that the
  <b>--force</b> option never touches tags, even if they are no longer usable
  due to missing data.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After running this command, you will probably want to run <b>git fsck</b> to
  verify it fixed the repository. Note that fsck may still complain about
  objects referenced by the reflog, or the stash, if they were unable to be
  recovered. This command does not try to clean up either the reflog or the
  stash.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since this command unpacks all packs in the repository, you may want to run
  <b>git gc</b> afterwards.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TESTING"><a class="selflink" href="#TESTING">TESTING</a></h1>
git-repair is able to test itself, by making a temporary copy of the git
  reposiory it's run in, damaging it in random ways, and checking that it can
  repair it so that git fsck reports no problems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is done using the --test parameter and associated --numtests and --retry
  parameters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the testing will sometimes find repositories that can only be repaired
  when --force is used; this is expected. On the other hand, if it fails to
  recover a repository with --force, then the testing has found a bug!
