The &quot;cmake&quot; executable is the CMake command-line interface. It may be
  used to configure projects in scripts. Project configuration settings may be
  specified on the command line with the -D option. The -i option will cause
  cmake to interactively prompt for such settings.

CMake is a cross-platform build system generator. Projects specify their build
  process with platform-independent CMake listfiles included in each directory
  of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt. Users build a project by using
  CMake to generate a build system for a native tool on their platform.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    CMake requires that projects specify the version of CMake to which they have
      been written. This policy has been put in place so users trying to build
      the project may be told when they need to update their CMake. Specifying a
      version also helps the project build with CMake versions newer than that
      specified. Use the cmake_minimum_required command at the top of your main
      CMakeLists.txt file:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    where &quot;&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;&quot; is the version of CMake you
      want to support (such as &quot;2.6&quot;). The command will ensure that at
      least the given version of CMake is running and help newer versions be
      compatible with the project. See documentation of cmake_minimum_required
      for details.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that the command invocation must appear in the CMakeLists.txt file
      itself; a call in an included file is not sufficient. However, the
      cmake_policy command may be called to set policy CMP0000 to OLD or NEW
      behavior explicitly. The OLD behavior is to silently ignore the missing
      invocation. The NEW behavior is to issue an error instead of a warning. An
      included file may set CMP0000 explicitly to affect how this policy is
      enforced for the main CMakeLists.txt file.

    Targets names created with add_executable, add_library, or add_custom_target
      are logical build target names. Logical target names must be globally
      unique because:

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The logical name of executable and library targets does not have to
      correspond to the physical file names built. Consider using the
      OUTPUT_NAME target property to create two targets with the same physical
      name while keeping logical names distinct. Custom targets must simply have
      globally unique names (unless one uses the global property
      ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS with a Makefiles generator).

  <dd class="It-tag">Libraries linked via full path no longer produce linker
      search paths.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This policy affects how libraries whose full paths are NOT known are found
      at link time, but was created due to a change in how CMake deals with
      libraries whose full paths are known. Consider the code
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    CMake 2.4 and below implemented linking to libraries whose full paths are
      known by splitting them on the link line into separate components
      consisting of the linker search path and the library name. The example
      code might have produced something like
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  ... -L/path/to -lA ...
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    in order to link to library A. An analysis was performed to order multiple
      link directories such that the linker would find library A in the desired
      location, but there are cases in which this does not work. CMake versions
      2.6 and above use the more reliable approach of passing the full path to
      libraries directly to the linker in most cases. The example code now
      produces something like
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  ... /path/to/libA.so ....
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Unfortunately this change can break code like
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    where &quot;B&quot; is meant to find &quot;/path/to/libB.so&quot;. This code
      is wrong because the user is asking the linker to find library B but has
      not provided a linker search path (which may be added with the
      link_directories command). However, with the old linking implementation
      the code would work accidentally because the linker search path added for
      library A allowed library B to be found.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In order to support projects depending on linker search paths added by
      linking to libraries with known full paths, the OLD behavior for this
      policy will add the linker search paths even though they are not needed
      for their own libraries. When this policy is set to OLD, CMake will
      produce a link line such as
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  ... -L/path/to /path/to/libA.so -lB ...
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    which will allow library B to be found as it was previously. When this
      policy is set to NEW, CMake will produce a link line such as
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  ... /path/to/libA.so -lB ...
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    which more accurately matches what the project specified.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The setting for this policy used when generating the link line is that in
      effect when the target is created by an add_executable or add_library
      command. For the example described above, the code
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 OLD) # or cmake_policy(VERSION 2.4)
  add_executable(myexe myexe.c)
  target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    will work and suppress the warning for this policy. It may also be updated
      to work with the corrected linking approach:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 NEW) # or cmake_policy(VERSION 2.6)
  link_directories(/path/to) # needed to find library B
  add_executable(myexe myexe.c)
  target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Even better, library B may be specified with a full path:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  add_executable(myexe myexe.c)
  target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so /path/to/libB.so)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When all items on the link line have known paths CMake does not check this
      policy so it has no effect.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that the warning for this policy will be issued for at most one target.
      This avoids flooding users with messages for every target when setting the
      policy once will probably fix all targets.

    In CMake 2.6.2 and below, CMake Policy settings in scripts loaded by the

      the policy stack around an included script, but provide a NO_POLICY_SCOPE

      were recognized only in boolean expressions like &quot;if(NOT 2)&quot;
      (leading to false) but not as a single-argument like &quot;if(2)&quot;

    CMake 2.8.11 constructed the 'link interface' of a target from properties
      matching (IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_&lt;CONFIG&gt;)?. The
      modern way to specify config-sensitive content is to use generator
      expressions and the IMPORTED_ prefix makes uniform processing of the link
      interface with generator expressions impossible. The
      INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES target property was introduced as a replacement
      in CMake 2.8.12. This new property is named consistently with the
      INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS, INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES and
      INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS properties. For in-build targets, CMake will use
      the INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property as the source of the link interface
      only if policy CMP0022 is NEW. When exporting a target which has this
      policy set to NEW, only the INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property will be
      processed and generated for the IMPORTED target by default. A new option
      to the install(EXPORT) and export commands allows export of the old-style
      properties for compatibility with downstream users of CMake versions older
      than 2.8.12. The target_link_libraries command will no longer populate the
      properties matching LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_&lt;CONFIG&gt;)? if this

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    CMake 2.8.12 introduced the target_link_libraries signature using the
      PUBLIC, PRIVATE, and INTERFACE keywords to generalize the LINK_PUBLIC and
      LINK_PRIVATE keywords introduced in CMake 2.8.7. Use of signatures with
      any of these keywords sets the link interface of a target explicitly, even
      if empty. This produces confusing behavior when used in combination with
      the historical behavior of the plain target_link_libraries signature. For
      example, consider the code:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
 target_link_libraries(mylib A)
 target_link_libraries(mylib PRIVATE B)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    After the first line the link interface has not been set explicitly so CMake
      would use the link implementation, A, as the link interface. However, the
      second line sets the link interface to empty. In order to avoid this
      subtle behavior CMake now prefers to disallow mixing the plain and keyword
      signatures of target_link_libraries for a single target.
