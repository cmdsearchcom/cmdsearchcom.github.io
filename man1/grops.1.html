<p>GROPS(1) General Commands Manual GROPS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
grops - PostScript driver for groff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
grops [-glmv] [-b n] [-c n] [-F dir] [-I dir] [-p papersize]
[-P prologue] [-w n] [files ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
grops translates the output of GNU troff to PostScript.
Normally grops should be invoked by using the groff command
with a -Tps option. (Actually, this is the default for <br>
groff.) If no files are given, grops reads the standard
input. A filename of - also causes grops to read the
standard input. PostScript output is written to the standard
out&acirc; <br>
put. When grops is run by groff options can be passed to
grops using groff&rsquo;s -P option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that grops doesn&rsquo;t
produce a valid document structure (conforming to the
Document Structuring Convention) if called with multiple
file arguments. To print such concatenated <br>
output it is necessary to deactivate DSC handling in the
printing program or previewer. See section FONT INSTALLATION
below for a guide how to install fonts for grops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
It is possible to have whitespace between a command line
option and its parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bn Provide workarounds for
older printers, broken spoolers, and previewers. Normally
grops produces output at PostScript LanguageLevel 2 that
conforms to the Document Struc&acirc; <br>
turing Conventions version 3.0. Some older printers,
spoolers, and previewers can&rsquo;t handle such output. The
value of n controls what grops does to make its output <br>
acceptable to such programs. A value of 0 causes grops not
to employ any workarounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add 1 if no %%BeginDocumentSetup
and %%EndDocumentSetup comments should be generated; this is
needed for early versions of TranScript that get confused by
anything between <br>
the %%EndProlog comment and the first %%Page comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add 2 if lines in included files
beginning with %! should be stripped out; this is needed for
Sun&rsquo;s pageview previewer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add 4 if %%Page, %%Trailer and
%%EndProlog comments should be stripped out of included
files; this is needed for spoolers that don&rsquo;t
understand the %%BeginDocument and <br>
%%EndDocument comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add 8 if the first line of the
PostScript output should be %!PS-Adobe-2.0 rather than
%!PS-Adobe-3.0; this is needed when using Sun&rsquo;s
Newsprint with a printer that <br>
requires page reversal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add 16 if no media size
information should be included in the document (this is,
neither use %%DocumentMedia nor the setpagedevice PostScript
command). This was the be&acirc; <br>
haviour of groff version 1.18.1 and earlier; it is needed
for older printers which don&rsquo;t understand PostScript
LanguageLevel 2. It is also necessary if the output is
fur&acirc; <br>
ther processed to get an encapsulated PS (EPS) file &acirc;
see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value can be
specified by a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">broken n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command in the DESC file.
Otherwise the default value is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cn Print n copies of each
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Fdir Prepend directory
dir/devname to the search path for prologue, font, and
device description files; name is the name of the device,
usually ps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Guess the page length. This
generates PostScript code that guesses the page length. The
guess is correct only if the imageable area is vertically
centered on the page. <br>
This option allows you to generate documents that can be
printed both on letter (8.5&Atilde;11) paper and on A4 paper
without change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Idir This option may be used to
add a directory to the search path for files on the command
line and files named in and escapes. The search path is <br>
initialized with the current directory. This option may be
specified more than once; the directories are then searched
in the order specified (but before the current <br>
directory). If you want to make the current directory be
read before other directories, add -I. at the appropriate
place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No directory search is performed
for files with an absolute file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Print the document in
landscape format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Turn manual feed on for the
document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ppaper-size <br>
Set physical dimension of output medium. This overrides the
papersize, paperlength, and paperwidth commands in the DESC
file; it accepts the same arguments as the paper&acirc; <br>
size command. See groff_font (5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Pprologue-file <br>
Use the file prologue-file (in the font path) as the
prologue instead of the default prologue file prologue. This
option overrides the environment variable GROPS_PRO&acirc;
<br>
LOGUE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wn Lines should be drawn using
a thickness of n thousandths of an em. If this option is not
given, the line thickness defaults to 0.04 em.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print the version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
The input to grops must be in the format output by troff(1).
This is described in groff_out(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, the device and font
description files for the device used must meet certain
requirements: The resolution must be an integer multiple of
72 times the sizescale. The <br>
ps device uses a resolution of 72000 and a sizescale of
1000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The device description file must
contain a valid paper size; see groff_font(5) for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each font description file must
contain a command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">internalname psname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which says that the PostScript
name of the font is psname. It may also contain a
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">encoding enc_file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which says that the PostScript
font should be reencoded using the encoding described in
enc_file; this file should consist of a sequence of lines of
the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pschar code</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where pschar is the PostScript
name of the character, and code is its position in the
encoding expressed as a decimal integer; valid values are in
the range 0 to 255. Lines <br>
starting with # and blank lines are ignored. The code for
each character given in the font file must correspond to the
code for the character in encoding file, or to the code in
<br>
the default encoding for the font if the PostScript font is
not to be reencoded. This code can be used with the escape
sequence in troff to select the character, even if the <br>
character does not have a groff name. Every character in the
font file must exist in the PostScript font, and the widths
given in the font file must match the widths used in the
<br>
PostScript font. grops assumes that a character with a groff
name of space is blank (makes no marks on the page); it can
make use of such a character to generate more efficient <br>
and compact PostScript output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that grops is able to
display all glyphs in a PostScript font, not only 256.
enc_file (or the default encoding if no encoding file
specified) just defines the order of <br>
glyphs for the first 256 characters; all other glyphs are
accessed with additional encoding vectors which grops
produces on the fly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grops can automatically include
the downloadable fonts necessary to print the document. Such
fonts must be in PFA format. Use pfbtops(1) to convert a
Type 1 font in PFB format. <br>
Any downloadable fonts which should, when required, be
included by grops must be listed in the file
/usr/share/groff/1.22.2/font/devps/download; this should
consist of lines of <br>
the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">font filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where font is the PostScript
name of the font, and filename is the name of the file
containing the font; lines beginning with # and blank lines
are ignored; fields may be sepa&acirc; <br>
rated by tabs or spaces; filename is searched for using the
same mechanism that is used for groff font metric files. The
download file itself is also searched for using this <br>
mechanism; currently, only the first found file in the font
path is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file containing a
downloadable font or imported document conforms to the Adobe
Document Structuring Conventions, then grops interprets any
comments in the files suffi&acirc; <br>
ciently to ensure that its own output is conforming. It also
supplies any needed font resources that are listed in the
download file as well as any needed file resources. It is
<br>
also able to handle inter-resource dependencies. For
example, suppose that you have a downloadable font called
Garamond, and also a downloadable font called
Garamond-Outline <br>
which depends on Garamond (typically it would be defined to
copy Garamond&rsquo;s font dictionary, and change the
PaintType), then it is necessary for Garamond to appear
before Gara&acirc; <br>
mond-Outline in the PostScript document. grops handles this
automatically provided that the downloadable font file for
Garamond-Outline indicates its dependence on Garamond by
<br>
means of the Document Structuring Conventions, for example
by beginning with the following lines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%!PS-Adobe-3.0 Resource-Font
<br>
%%DocumentNeededResources: font Garamond <br>
%%EndComments <br>
%%IncludeResource: font Garamond</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case both Garamond and
Garamond-Outline would need to be listed in the download
file. A downloadable font should not include its own name in
a %%DocumentSupplied&acirc; <br>
Resources comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grops does not interpret
%%DocumentFonts comments. The %%DocumentNeededResources,
%%DocumentSuppliedResources, %%IncludeResource,
%%BeginResource, and %%EndResource comments (or <br>
possibly the old %%DocumentNeededFonts,
%%DocumentSuppliedFonts, %%IncludeFont, %%BeginFont, and
%%EndFont comments) should be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the default setup there are
styles called R, I, B, and BI mounted at font positions 1 to
4. The fonts are grouped into families A, BM, C, H, HN, N,
P, and T having members in <br>
each of these styles:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AR AvantGarde-Book <br>
AI AvantGarde-BookOblique <br>
AB AvantGarde-Demi <br>
ABI AvantGarde-DemiOblique <br>
BMR Bookman-Light <br>
BMI Bookman-LightItalic <br>
BMB Bookman-Demi <br>
BMBI Bookman-DemiItalic <br>
CR Courier <br>

CB Courier-Bold <br>
CBI Courier-BoldOblique <br>
HR Helvetica <br>
HI Helvetica-Oblique <br>

HBI Helvetica-BoldOblique <br>
HNR Helvetica-Narrow <br>
HNI Helvetica-Narrow-Oblique <br>
HNB Helvetica-Narrow-Bold <br>
HNBI Helvetica-Narrow-BoldOblique <br>
NR NewCenturySchlbk-Roman <br>

NBI NewCenturySchlbk-BoldItalic <br>
PR Palatino-Roman <br>

PB Palatino-Bold <br>
PBI Palatino-BoldItalic <br>
TR Times-Roman <br>
TI Times-Italic <br>
TB Times-Bold <br>
TBI Times-BoldItalic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also the following font
which is not a member of a family:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZCMI
ZapfChancery-MediumItalic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are also some special
fonts called S for the PS Symbol font, and SS, containing
slanted lowercase Greek letters taken from PS Symbol. Zapf
Dingbats is available as ZD, and <br>
a reversed version of ZapfDingbats (with symbols pointing in
the opposite direction) is available as ZDR; most characters
in these fonts are unnamed and must be accessed using</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default color for and is
black; for colors defined in the &lsquo;rgb&rsquo; color
space setrgbcolor is used, for &lsquo;cmy&rsquo; and
&lsquo;cmyk&rsquo; setcmykcolor, and for &lsquo;gray&rsquo;
setgray. Note that <br>
setcmykcolor is a PostScript LanguageLevel 2 command and
thus not available on some older printers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grops understands various X
commands produced using the sequence; grops only interprets
commands that begin with a ps: tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This executes the arbitrary
PostScript commands in code. The PostScript currentpoint is
set to the position of the before executing code. The origin
is at the <br>
top left corner of the page, and y coordinates increase down
the page. A procedure u is defined that converts groff units
to the coordinate system in effect (provided the <br>
user doesn&rsquo;t change the scale). For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.nr x 1i</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">draws a horizontal line one inch
long. code may make changes to the graphics state, but any
changes persist only to the end of the page. A dictionary
containing the def&acirc; <br>
initions specified by the def and mdef is on top of the
dictionary stack. If your code adds definitions to this
dictionary, you should allocate space for them using <br>
. Any definitions persist only until the end of the page. If
you use the escape sequence with an argument that names a
macro, code can extend over multi&acirc; <br>
ple lines. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.nr x 1i <br>
.de y <br>
ps: exec <br>
0 u 0 rlineto <br>
stroke <br>
..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is another way to draw a
horizontal line one inch long. Note the single backslash
before &lsquo;nx&rsquo; &acirc; the only reason to use a
number register while defining the macro &lsquo;y&rsquo; is
<br>
to convert a user-specified dimension &lsquo;1i&rsquo; to
internal groff units which are in turn converted to PS units
with the u procedure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grops wraps user-specified
PostScript code into a dictionary, nothing more. In
particular, it doesn&rsquo;t start and end the inserted code
with save and restore, respectively. <br>
This must be supplied by the user, if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the same as the exec
command except that the PostScript code is read from file
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Place a PostScript definition
contained in code in the prologue. There should be at most
one definition per Long definitions can be split over
several nary stack when an exec command is executed. If you
use the escape sequence with an argument that names a macro,
code can extend over multiple lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like def, except that code may
contain up to n definitions. grops needs to know how many
definitions code contains so that it can create an
appropriately sized PostScript <br>
dictionary to contain them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Import a PostScript graphic from
file. The arguments llx, lly, urx, and ury give the bounding
box of the graphic in the default PostScript coordinate
system; they should <br>
all be integers; llx and lly are the x and y coordinates of
the lower left corner of the graphic; urx and ury are the x
and y coordinates of the upper right corner of the <br>
graphic; width and height are integers that give the desired
width and height in groff units of the graphic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The graphic is scaled so that it
has this width and height and translated so that the lower
left corner of the graphic is located at the position
associated with com&acirc; <br>
mand. If the height argument is omitted it is scaled
uniformly in the x and y directions so that it has the
specified width.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the contents of the
are not interpreted by troff; so vertical space for the
graphic is not automatically added, and the width and height
arguments are <br>
not allowed to have attached scaling indicators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the PostScript file complies
with the Adobe Document Structuring Conventions and contains
a %%BoundingBox comment, then the bounding box can be
automatically extracted <br>
from within groff by using the psbb request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See groff_tmac(5) for a
description of the PSPIC macro which provides a convenient
high-level interface for inclusion of PostScript
graphics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No output is generated for text
and drawing commands that are bracketed with these These
commands are intended for use when output from troff is
previewed <br>
before being processed with grops; if the previewer is
unable to display certain characters or other constructs,
then other substitute characters or constructs can be used
<br>
for previewing by bracketing them with these</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, gxditview is not
able to display a proper &mdash; character because the
standard X11 fonts do not provide it; this problem can be
overcome by executing the fol&acirc; <br>
lowing request</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.char &mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case, gxditview is
unable to display the &mdash; character and draws the line,
whereas grops prints the &mdash; character and ignores the
line (this code is already in <br>
file Xps.tmac which is loaded if a document intended for
grops is previewed with gxditview).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a PostScript procedure BPhook
has been defined via a &lsquo;ps: def&rsquo; or &lsquo;ps:
mdef&rsquo; device command, it is executed at the beginning
of every page (before anything is drawn or written <br>
by groff). For example, to underlay the page contents with
the word &lsquo;DRAFT&rsquo; in light gray, you might
use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.de XX <br>
ps: def <br>
/BPhook <br>
{ gsave .9 setgray clippath pathbbox exch 2 copy <br>
.5 mul exch .5 mul translate atan rotate pop pop <br>
/NewCenturySchlbk-Roman findfont 200 scalefont setfont <br>
(DRAFT) dup stringwidth pop -.5 mul -70 moveto show <br>
grestore } <br>
def <br>
.. <br>
.devicem XX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or, to cause lines and polygons
to be drawn with square linecaps and mitered linejoins
instead of the round linecaps and linejoins normally used by
grops, use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.de XX <br>
ps: def <br>
/BPhook { 2 setlinecap 0 setlinejoin } def <br>
.. <br>
.devicem XX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(square linecaps, as opposed to
butt linecaps (0 setlinecap), give true corners in boxed
tables even though the lines are drawn unconnected).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encapsulated PostScript <br>
grops itself doesn&rsquo;t emit bounding box information.
With the help of Ghostscript the following simple script,
groff2eps, produces an encapsulated PS file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#! /bin/sh <br>
groff -P-b16 $1 &gt;$1.ps <br>
gs -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=bbox -- $1.ps 2&gt;$1.bbox <br>
cat $1.ps | sed -e &quot;/^%%Orientation/r$1.bbox&quot; -e
&quot;/^%!PS-Adobe-3.0/s/$/ EPSF-3.0/&quot; &gt;$1.eps <br>
rm $1.ps $1.bbox</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Just say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">groff2eps foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to convert file foo to
foo.eps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TrueType and other font formats
<br>
TrueType fonts can be used with grops if converted first to
Type 42 format, a special PostScript wrapper equivalent to
the PFA format mentioned in pfbtops(1). There are several
<br>
different methods to generate a type42 wrapper and most of
them involve the use of a PostScript interpreter such as
Ghostscript &acirc; see gs(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Yet, the easiest method involves
the use of the application ttftot42(1). This program uses
freetype(3) (version 1.3.1) to generate type42 font wrappers
and well-formed AFM files <br>
that can be fed to the afmtodit(1) script to create
appropriate metric files. The resulting font wrappers should
be added to the download file. ttftot42 source code can be
<br>
downloaded from ftp://www.giga.or.at/pub/nih/ttftot42/
&acirc;&uml;ftp://www.giga.or.at/pub/nih/ttftot42/&acirc;&copy;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another solution for creating
type42 wrappers is to use FontForge, available from
http://fontforge.sf.net
&acirc;&uml;http://fontforge.sf.net&acirc;&copy;. This font
editor can convert most outline <br>
font formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FONT INSTALLATION <br>
This section gives a summary of the above explanations; it
can serve as a step-by-step font installation guide for
grops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Convert your
font to something groff understands. This is either a
PostScript Type 1 font in PFA format or a PostScript Type 42
font, together with an AFM file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The very first characters in a
PFA file look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%!PS-AdobeFont-1.0:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A PFB file has this also in the
first line, but the string is preceded with some binary
bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The very first characters in a
Type 42 font file look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%!PS-TrueTypeFont</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a wrapper format for
TrueType fonts. Old PS printers might not support it (this
is, they don&rsquo;t have a built-in TrueType font
interpreter).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your font is in PFB format
(such fonts normally have &lsquo;.pfb&rsquo; as the file
extension), you might use groff&rsquo;s pfbtops(1) program
to convert it to PFA. For TrueType fonts, try <br>
ttftot42 or fontforge. For all other font formats use
fontforge which can convert most outline font formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Convert the AFM
file to a groff font description file with the afmtodit(1)
program. An example call is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">afmtodit Foo-Bar-Bold.afm
textmap FBB</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which converts the metric file
&lsquo;Foo-Bar-Bold.afm&rsquo; to the groff font
&lsquo;FBB&rsquo;. If you have a font family which comes
with normal, bold, italic, and bold italic faces, it is
rec&acirc; <br>
ommended to use the letters R, B, I, and BI, respectively,
as postfixes in the groff font names to make groff&rsquo;s
&lsquo;.fam&rsquo; request work. An example is groff&rsquo;s
built-in Times- <br>
Roman font: The font family name is T, and the groff font
names are TR, TB, TI, and TBI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Install both the
groff font description files and the fonts in a
&lsquo;devps&rsquo; subdirectory of the font path which
groff finds. See the ENVIRONMENT section in the troff(1) man
<br>
page which lists the actual value of the font path. Note
that groff doesn&rsquo;t use the AFM files (but it is a good
idea to store them anyway).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Register all
fonts which must be downloaded to the printer in the
&lsquo;devps/download&rsquo; file. Only the first occurrence
of this file in the font path is read. This means that <br>
you should copy the default &lsquo;download&rsquo; file to
the first directory in your font path and add your fonts
there. To continue the above example we assume that the PS
font name <br>
for Foo-Bar-Bold.pfa is &lsquo;XY-Foo-Bar-Bold&rsquo; (the
PS font name is stored in the internalname field in the
&lsquo;FBB&rsquo; file), thus the following line should be
added to &lsquo;download&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XY-Foo-Bar-Bold
Foo-Bar-Bold.pfa</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OLD FONTS <br>
groff versions 1.19.2 and earlier contain a slightly
different set of the 35 Adobe core fonts; the difference is
mainly the lack of the &lsquo;Euro&rsquo; glyph and a
reduced set of kerning <br>
pairs. For backwards compatibility, these old fonts are
installed also in the</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/share/groff/1.22.2/oldfont/devps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use them, make sure that
grops finds the fonts before the default system fonts (with
the same names): Either add command line option -F to
grops</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">groff -Tps -P-F
