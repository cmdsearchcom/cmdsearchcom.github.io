<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
guestfs-internals - architecture and internals of
libguestfs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page is for hackers who want to understand how
libguestfs works internally. This is just a description of
how libguestfs works now, and it may change at any time in
<br>
the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARCHITECTURE <br>
Internally, libguestfs is implemented by running an
appliance (a special type of small virtual machine) using
qemu(1). Qemu runs as a child process of the main
program.</p>

<br>
&acirc; Device or &acirc; <br>
&acirc; disk image &acirc; <br>

&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The library, linked to the main
program, creates the child process and hence the appliance
in the &quot;guestfs_launch&quot; in guestfs(3)
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inside the appliance is a Linux
kernel and a complete stack of userspace tools (such as LVM
and ext2 programs) and a small controlling daemon called
&quot;guestfsd&quot;. The library <br>
talks to &quot;guestfsd&quot; using remote procedure calls
(RPC). There is a mostly one-to-one correspondence between
libguestfs API calls and RPC calls to the daemon. Lastly the
disk <br>
image(s) are attached to the qemu process which translates
device access by the appliance&rsquo;s Linux kernel into
accesses to the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A common misunderstanding is
that the appliance &quot;is&quot; the virtual machine.
Although the disk image you are attached to might also be
used by some virtual machine, libguestfs <br>
doesn&rsquo;t know or care about this. (But you will care if
both libguestfs&rsquo;s qemu process and your virtual
machine are trying to update the disk image at the same
time, since these <br>
usually results in massive disk corruption).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATE MACHINE <br>
libguestfs uses a state machine to model the child
process:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">| <br>
guestfs_create / guestfs_create_flags <br>
| <br>
| <br>
____V_____ <br>
/ | CONFIG | <br>
__________/ <br>
^ ^ | &nbsp; &nbsp;guestfs_launch <br>
| ___V______ <br>
| / | | LAUNCHING | <br>
| ___________/ <br>
| / <br>
| guestfs_launch <br>
| / <br>
__|____V <br>
/ | READY | <br>
________/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The normal transitions are (1)
CONFIG (when the handle is created, but there is no child
process), (2) LAUNCHING (when the child process is booting
up), (3) READY meaning the <br>
appliance is up, actions can be issued to, and carried out
by, the child process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The guest may be killed by
&quot;guestfs_kill_subprocess&quot; in guestfs(3), or may
die asynchronously at any time (eg. due to some internal
error), and that causes the state to <br>
transition back to CONFIG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration commands for qemu
such as &quot;guestfs_set_path&quot; in guestfs(3) can only
be issued when in the CONFIG state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The API offers one call that
goes from CONFIG through LAUNCHING to READY.
&quot;guestfs_launch&quot; in guestfs(3) blocks until the
child process is READY to accept commands (or until <br>
some failure or timeout). &quot;guestfs_launch&quot; in
guestfs(3) internally moves the state from CONFIG to
LAUNCHING while it is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">API actions such as
&quot;guestfs_mount&quot; in guestfs(3) can only be issued
when in the READY state. These API calls block waiting for
the command to be carried out. There are no non- <br>
blocking versions, and no way to issue more than one command
per handle at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, the child process sends
asynchronous messages back to the main program, such as
kernel log messages. You can register a callback to receive
these messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERNALS <br>
APPLIANCE BOOT PROCESS <br>
This process has evolved and continues to evolve. The
description here corresponds only to the current version of
libguestfs and is provided for information only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to follow the stages
involved below, enable libguestfs debugging (set the
environment variable &quot;LIBGUESTFS_DEBUG=1&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create the appliance <br>
&quot;supermin --build&quot; is invoked to create the
kernel, a small initrd and the appliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The appliance is cached in
/var/tmp/.guestfs-&lt;UID&gt; (or in another directory if
&quot;LIBGUESTFS_CACHEDIR&quot; or &quot;TMPDIR&quot; are
set).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a complete description of
how the appliance is created and cached, read the
supermin(1) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Start qemu and boot the kernel
<br>
qemu is invoked to boot the kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run the initrd <br>
&quot;supermin --build&quot; builds a small initrd. The
initrd is not the appliance. The purpose of the initrd is to
load enough kernel modules in order that the appliance
itself can <br>
be mounted and started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The initrd is a cpio archive
called /var/tmp/.guestfs-&lt;UID&gt;/appliance.d/initrd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the initrd has started you
will see messages showing that kernel modules are being
loaded, similar to this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">supermin: ext2 mini initrd
starting up <br>
supermin: mounting /sys <br>
supermin: internal insmod libcrc32c.ko <br>
supermin: internal insmod crc32c-intel.ko</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Find and mount the appliance
device <br>
The appliance is a sparse file containing an ext2 filesystem
which contains a familiar (although reduced in size) Linux
operating system. It would normally be called <br>
/var/tmp/.guestfs-&lt;UID&gt;/appliance.d/root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The regular disks being
inspected by libguestfs are the first devices exposed by
qemu (eg. as /dev/vda).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last disk added to qemu is
the appliance itself (eg. /dev/vdb if there was only one
regular disk).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus the final job of the initrd
is to locate the appliance disk, mount it, and switch root
into the appliance, and run /init from the appliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this works successfully you
will see messages such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">supermin: picked
/sys/block/vdb/dev as root device <br>
supermin: creating /dev/root as block special 252:16 <br>
supermin: mounting new root on /root <br>
supermin: chroot <br>
Starting /init script ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that &quot;Starting /init
script ...&quot; indicates that the appliance&rsquo;s init
script is now running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Initialize the appliance <br>
The appliance itself now initializes itself. This involves
starting certain processes like &quot;udev&quot;, possibly
printing some debug information, and finally running the
daemon <br>
(&quot;guestfsd&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The daemon <br>
Finally the daemon (&quot;guestfsd&quot;) runs inside the
appliance. If it runs you should see:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbose daemon enabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The daemon expects to see a
named virtio-serial port exposed by qemu and connected on
the other end to the library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The daemon connects to this port
(and hence to the library) and sends a four byte message
&quot;GUESTFS_LAUNCH_FLAG&quot;, which initiates the
communication protocol (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL <br>
Don&rsquo;t rely on using this protocol directly. This
section documents how it currently works, but it may change
at any time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The protocol used to talk
between the library and the daemon running inside the qemu
virtual machine is a simple RPC mechanism built on top of
XDR (RFC 1014, RFC 1832, RFC 4506).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The detailed format of
structures is in src/guestfs_protocol.x (note: this file is
automatically generated).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two broad cases,
ordinary functions that don&rsquo;t have any
&quot;FileIn&quot; and &quot;FileOut&quot; parameters, which
are handled with very simple request/reply messages. Then
there are <br>
functions that have any &quot;FileIn&quot; or
&quot;FileOut&quot; parameters, which use the same request
and reply messages, but they may also be followed by files
sent using a chunked encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ORDINARY FUNCTIONS (NO
FILEIN/FILEOUT PARAMS)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For ordinary functions, the
request message is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">total length (header +
arguments, <br>
but not including the length word itself) <br>
struct guestfs_message_header (encoded as XDR) <br>
struct guestfs_&lt;foo&gt;_args (encoded as XDR)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The total length field allows
the daemon to allocate a fixed size buffer into which it
slurps the rest of the message. As a result, the total
length is limited to <br>
&quot;GUESTFS_MESSAGE_MAX&quot; bytes (currently 4MB), which
means the effective size of any request is limited to
somewhere under this size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note also that many functions
don&rsquo;t take any arguments, in which case the
&quot;guestfs_foo_args&quot; is completely omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The header contains the
procedure number (&quot;guestfs_proc&quot;) which is how the
receiver knows what type of args structure to expect, or
none at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For functions that take optional
arguments, the optional arguments are encoded in the
&quot;guestfs_foo_args&quot; structure in the same way as
ordinary arguments. A bitmask in the header <br>
indicates which optional arguments are meaningful. The
bitmask is also checked to see if it contains bits set which
the daemon does not know about (eg. if more optional <br>
arguments were added in a later version of the library), and
this causes the call to be rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reply message for ordinary
functions is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">total length (header + ret, <br>
but not including the length word itself) <br>
struct guestfs_message_header (encoded as XDR) <br>
struct guestfs_&lt;foo&gt;_ret (encoded as XDR)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As above the
&quot;guestfs_foo_ret&quot; structure may be completely
omitted for functions that return no formal return
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As above the total length of the
reply is limited to &quot;GUESTFS_MESSAGE_MAX&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the case of an error, a flag
is set in the header, and the reply message is slightly
changed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">total length (header + error,
<br>
but not including the length word itself) <br>
struct guestfs_message_header (encoded as XDR) <br>
struct guestfs_message_error (encoded as XDR)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;guestfs_message_error&quot; structure contains the
error message as a string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUNCTIONS THAT HAVE FILEIN
PARAMETERS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;FileIn&quot; parameter
indicates that we transfer a file into the guest. The normal
request message is sent (see above). However this is
followed by a sequence of file chunks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">total length (header +
arguments, <br>
but not including the length word itself, <br>
and not including the chunks) <br>
struct guestfs_message_header (encoded as XDR) <br>
struct guestfs_&lt;foo&gt;_args (encoded as XDR) <br>
sequence of chunks for FileIn param #0 <br>
sequence of chunks for FileIn param #1 etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;sequence of
chunks&quot; is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">length of chunk (not including
length word itself) <br>
struct guestfs_chunk (encoded as XDR) <br>
length of chunk <br>
struct guestfs_chunk (encoded as XDR) <br>
... <br>
length of chunk <br>
struct guestfs_chunk (with data.data_len == 0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The final chunk has the
&quot;data_len&quot; field set to zero. Additionally a flag
is set in the final chunk to indicate either successful
completion or early cancellation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At time of writing there are no
functions that have more than one FileIn parameter. However
this is (theoretically) supported, by sending the sequence
of chunks for each FileIn <br>
parameter one after another (from left to right).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both the library (sender) and
the daemon (receiver) may cancel the transfer. The library
does this by sending a chunk with a special flag set to
indicate cancellation. When the <br>
daemon sees this, it cancels the whole RPC, does not send
any reply, and goes back to reading the next request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The daemon may also cancel. It
does this by writing a special word
&quot;GUESTFS_CANCEL_FLAG&quot; to the socket. The library
listens for this during the transfer, and if it gets it, it
<br>
will cancel the transfer (it sends a cancel chunk). The
special word is chosen so that even if cancellation happens
right at the end of the transfer (after the library has <br>
finished writing and has started listening for the reply),
the &quot;spurious&quot; cancel flag will not be confused
with the reply message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This protocol allows the
transfer of arbitrary sized files (no 32 bit limit), and
also files where the size is not known in advance (eg. from
pipes or sockets). However the <br>
chunks are rather small
(&quot;GUESTFS_MAX_CHUNK_SIZE&quot;), so that neither the
library nor the daemon need to keep much in memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUNCTIONS THAT HAVE FILEOUT
PARAMETERS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The protocol for FileOut
parameters is exactly the same as for FileIn parameters, but
with the roles of daemon and library reversed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">total length (header + ret, <br>
but not including the length word itself, <br>
and not including the chunks) <br>
struct guestfs_message_header (encoded as XDR) <br>
struct guestfs_&lt;foo&gt;_ret (encoded as XDR) <br>
sequence of chunks for FileOut param #0 <br>
sequence of chunks for FileOut param #1 etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INITIAL MESSAGE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the daemon launches it
sends an initial word (&quot;GUESTFS_LAUNCH_FLAG&quot;)
which indicates that the guest and daemon is alive. This is
what &quot;guestfs_launch&quot; in guestfs(3) waits <br>
for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROGRESS NOTIFICATION
MESSAGES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The daemon may send progress
notification messages at any time. These are distinguished
by the normal length word being replaced by
&quot;GUESTFS_PROGRESS_FLAG&quot;, followed by a fixed <br>
size progress message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The library turns them into
progress callbacks (see &quot;GUESTFS_EVENT_PROGRESS&quot;
in guestfs(3)) if there is a callback registered, or
discards them if not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The daemon self-limits the
frequency of progress messages it sends (see
&quot;daemon/proto.c:notify_progress&quot;). Not all calls
generate progress messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FIXED APPLIANCE <br>
When libguestfs (or libguestfs tools) are run, they search a
path looking for an appliance. The path is built into
libguestfs, or can be set using the
&quot;LIBGUESTFS_PATH&quot; <br>
environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally a supermin appliance is
located on this path (see &quot;SUPERMIN APPLIANCE&quot; in
supermin(1)). libguestfs reconstructs this into a full
appliance by running &quot;supermin <br>
--build&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, a simpler &quot;fixed
appliance&quot; can also be used. libguestfs detects this by
looking for a directory on the path containing all the
following files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; kernel</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; initrd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; root</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; README.fixed
(note that it must be present as well)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the fixed appliance is found,
libguestfs skips supermin entirely and just runs the virtual
machine (using qemu or the current backend, see
&quot;BACKEND&quot; in guestfs(3)) with the <br>
kernel, initrd and root disk from the fixed appliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus the fixed appliance can be
used when a platform or a Linux distribution does not
support supermin. You build the fixed appliance on a
platform that does support supermin <br>
using libguestfs-make-fixed-appliance(1), copy it over, and
use that to run libguestfs.</p>
