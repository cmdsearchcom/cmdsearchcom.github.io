perlreapi - perl regular expression plugin interface
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
As of Perl 5.9.5 there is a new interface for plugging and using other regular
  expression engines than the default one.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each engine is supposed to provide access to a constant structure of the
  following format:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    typedef struct regexp_engine {
        REGEXP* (*comp) (pTHX_ const SV * const pattern, const U32 flags);
        I32     (*exec) (pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx, char* stringarg, char* strend,
                         char* strbeg, I32 minend, SV* screamer,
                         void* data, U32 flags);
        char*   (*intuit) (pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx, SV *sv, char *strpos,
                           char *strend, U32 flags,
                           struct re_scream_pos_data_s *data);
        SV*     (*checkstr) (pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx);
        void    (*free) (pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx);
        void    (*numbered_buff_FETCH) (pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx, const I32 paren,
                                 SV * const sv);
        void    (*numbered_buff_STORE) (pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx, const I32 paren,
                                       SV const * const value);
        I32     (*numbered_buff_LENGTH) (pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx, const SV * const sv,
                                        const I32 paren);
        SV*     (*named_buff) (pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx, SV * const key,
                               SV * const value, U32 flags);
        SV*     (*named_buff_iter) (pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx, const SV * const lastkey,
                                    const U32 flags);
        SV*     (*qr_package)(pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx);
    #ifdef USE_ITHREADS
        void*   (*dupe) (pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx, CLONE_PARAMS *param);
    #endif
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a regexp is compiled, its &quot;engine&quot; field is then set to point at
  the appropriate structure, so that when it needs to be used Perl can find the
  right routines to do so.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to install a new regexp handler, $^H{regcomp} is set to an integer
  which (when casted appropriately) resolves to one of these structures. When
  compiling, the &quot;comp&quot; method is executed, and the resulting regexp
  structure's engine field is expected to point back at the same structure.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The pTHX_ symbol in the definition is a macro used by perl under threading to
  provide an extra argument to the routine holding a pointer back to the
  interpreter that is executing the regexp. So under threading all routines get
  an extra argument.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Callbacks"><a class="selflink" href="#Callbacks">Callbacks</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="comp"><a class="selflink" href="#comp">comp</a></h2>
<pre>
    REGEXP* comp(pTHX_ const SV * const pattern, const U32 flags);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Compile the pattern stored in &quot;pattern&quot; using the given
  &quot;flags&quot; and return a pointer to a prepared &quot;REGEXP&quot;
  structure that can perform the match. See &quot;The REGEXP structure&quot;
  below for an explanation of the individual fields in the REGEXP struct.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;pattern&quot; parameter is the scalar that was used as the pattern.
  previous versions of perl would pass two &quot;char*&quot; indicating the
  start and end of the stringified pattern, the following snippet can be used to
  get the old parameters:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    STRLEN plen;
    char*  exp = SvPV(pattern, plen);
    char* xend = exp + plen;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since any scalar can be passed as a pattern it's possible to implement an engine
  that does something with an array (&quot;&quot;ook&quot; =~ [ qw/ eek hlagh /
  ]&quot;) or with the non-stringified form of a compiled regular expression
  (&quot;&quot;ook&quot; =~ qr/eek/&quot;). perl's own engine will always
  stringify everything using the snippet above but that doesn't mean other
  engines have to.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;flags&quot; parameter is a bitfield which indicates which of the
  &quot;msixp&quot; flags the regex was compiled with. It also contains
  additional info such as whether &quot;use locale&quot; is in effect.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;eogc&quot; flags are stripped out before being passed to the comp
  routine. The regex engine does not need to know whether any of these are set
  as those flags should only affect what perl does with the pattern and its
  match variables, not how it gets compiled and executed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By the time the comp callback is called, some of these flags have already had
  effect (noted below where applicable). However most of their effect occurs
  after the comp callback has run in routines that read the
  &quot;rx-&gt;extflags&quot; field which it populates.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In general the flags should be preserved in &quot;rx-&gt;extflags&quot; after
  compilation, although the regex engine might want to add or delete some of
  them to invoke or disable some special behavior in perl. The flags along with
  any special behavior they cause are documented below:
<div class="Pp"></div>
The pattern modifiers:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&quot;/m&quot; - RXf_PMf_MULTILINE</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If this is in &quot;rx-&gt;extflags&quot; it will be passed
      to &quot;Perl_fbm_instr&quot; by &quot;pp_split&quot; which will treat the
      subject string as a multi-line string.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&quot;/s&quot; - RXf_PMf_SINGLELINE</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&quot;/i&quot; - RXf_PMf_FOLD</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&quot;/x&quot; - RXf_PMf_EXTENDED</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If present on a regex &quot;#&quot; comments will be
      handled differently by the tokenizer in some cases.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    TODO: Document those cases.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&quot;/p&quot; - RXf_PMf_KEEPCOPY</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">TODO: Document this</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Character set</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The character set semantics are determined by an enum that
      is contained in this field. This is still experimental and subject to
      change, but the current interface returns the rules by use of the in-line
      function &quot;get_regex_charset(const U32 flags)&quot;. The only
      currently documented value returned from it is REGEX_LOCALE_CHARSET, which
      is set if &quot;use locale&quot; is in effect. If present in
      &quot;rx-&gt;extflags&quot;, &quot;split&quot; will use the locale
      dependent definition of whitespace when RXf_SKIPWHITE or RXf_WHITE is in
      effect. ASCII whitespace is defined as per isSPACE, and by the internal
      macros &quot;is_utf8_space&quot; under UTF-8, and &quot;isSPACE_LC&quot;
      under &quot;use locale&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Additional flags:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">RXf_UTF8</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set if the pattern is <i>SvUTF8()</i>, set by
      Perl_pmruntime.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A regex engine may want to set or disable this flag during compilation. The
      perl engine for instance may upgrade non-UTF-8 strings to UTF-8 if the
      pattern includes constructs such as &quot;\x{...}&quot; that can only
      match Unicode values.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">RXf_SPLIT</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If &quot;split&quot; is invoked as &quot;split ' '&quot; or
      with no arguments (which really means &quot;split(' ', $_)&quot;, see
      split), perl will set this flag. The regex engine can then check for it
      and set the SKIPWHITE and WHITE extflags. To do this the perl engine does:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    if (flags &amp; RXf_SPLIT &amp;&amp; r-&gt;prelen == 1 &amp;&amp; r-&gt;precomp[0] == ' ')
        r-&gt;extflags |= (RXf_SKIPWHITE|RXf_WHITE);
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
These flags can be set during compilation to enable optimizations in the
  &quot;split&quot; operator.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">RXf_SKIPWHITE</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the flag is present in &quot;rx-&gt;extflags&quot;
      &quot;split&quot; will delete whitespace from the start of the subject
      string before it's operated on. What is considered whitespace depends on
      whether the subject is a UTF-8 string and whether the
      &quot;RXf_PMf_LOCALE&quot; flag is set.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If RXf_WHITE is set in addition to this flag &quot;split&quot; will behave
      like &quot;split &quot; &quot;&quot; under the perl engine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">RXf_START_ONLY</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Tells the split operator to split the target string on
      newlines (&quot;\n&quot;) without invoking the regex engine.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Perl's engine sets this if the pattern is &quot;/^/&quot; (&quot;plen == 1
      &amp;&amp; *exp == '^'&quot;), even under &quot;/^/s&quot;, see split. Of
      course a different regex engine might want to use the same optimizations
      with a different syntax.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">RXf_WHITE</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Tells the split operator to split the target string on

      whether RXf_PMf_LOCALE is set.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Perl's engine sets this flag if the pattern is &quot;\s+&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Perl's engine sets this flag on empty patterns, this optimization makes
      &quot;split //&quot; much faster than it would otherwise be. It's even

</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Find the start position where a regex match should be attempted, or possibly
  whether the regex engine should not be run because the pattern can't match.
  This is called as appropriate by the core depending on the values of the
  extflags member of the regexp structure.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="checkstr"><a class="selflink" href="#checkstr">checkstr</a></h2>
<pre>
    SV* checkstr(pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Return a SV containing a string that must appear in the pattern. Used by
  &quot;split&quot; for optimising matches.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="free"><a class="selflink" href="#free">free</a></h2>
<pre>
    void free(pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Called by perl when it is freeing a regexp pattern so that the engine can
  release any resources pointed to by the &quot;pprivate&quot; member of the
  regexp structure. This is only responsible for freeing private data; perl will
  handle releasing anything else contained in the regexp structure.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Numbered_capture_callbacks"><a class="selflink" href="#Numbered_capture_callbacks">Numbered
  capture callbacks</a></h2>
Called to get/set the value of &quot;$`&quot;, &quot;$'&quot;, $&amp; and their
  named equivalents, ${^PREMATCH}, ${^POSTMATCH} and $^{MATCH}, as well as the
  numbered capture groups ($1, $2, ...).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;paren&quot; parameter will be &quot;-2&quot; for &quot;$`&quot;,
  &quot;-1&quot; for &quot;$'&quot;, 0 for $&amp;, 1 for $1 and so forth.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The names have been chosen by analogy with Tie::Scalar methods names with an
  additional <b>LENGTH</b> callback for efficiency. However named capture
  variables are currently not tied internally but implemented via magic.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>numbered_buff_FETCH</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    void numbered_buff_FETCH(pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx, const I32 paren,
                             SV * const sv);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Fetch a specified numbered capture. &quot;sv&quot; should be set to the scalar
  to return, the scalar is passed as an argument rather than being returned from
  the function because when it's called perl already has a scalar to store the
  value, creating another one would be redundant. The scalar can be set with
  &quot;sv_setsv&quot;, &quot;sv_setpvn&quot; and friends, see perlapi.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This callback is where perl untaints its own capture variables under taint mode
  (see perlsec). See the &quot;Perl_reg_numbered_buff_fetch&quot; function in
  <i>regcomp.c</i> for how to untaint capture variables if that's something
  you'd like your engine to do as well.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>numbered_buff_STORE</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    void    (*numbered_buff_STORE) (pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx, const I32 paren,
                                    SV const * const value);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Set the value of a numbered capture variable. &quot;value&quot; is the scalar
  that is to be used as the new value. It's up to the engine to make sure this
  is used as the new value (or reject it).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    if (&quot;ook&quot; =~ /(o*)/) {
        # 'paren' will be '1' and 'value' will be 'ee'
        $1 =~ tr/o/e/;
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl's own engine will croak on any attempt to modify the capture variables, to
  do this in another engine use the following callback (copied from
  &quot;Perl_reg_numbered_buff_store&quot;):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    void
    Example_reg_numbered_buff_store(pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx, const I32 paren,
                                                            SV const * const value)
    {
        PERL_UNUSED_ARG(rx);
        PERL_UNUSED_ARG(paren);
        PERL_UNUSED_ARG(value);
        if (!PL_localizing)
            Perl_croak(aTHX_ PL_no_modify);
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Actually perl will not <i>always</i> croak in a statement that looks like it
  would modify a numbered capture variable. This is because the STORE callback
  will not be called if perl can determine that it doesn't have to modify the
  value. This is exactly how tied variables behave in the same situation:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    package CaptureVar;
    use base 'Tie::Scalar';
    sub TIESCALAR { bless [] }
    sub FETCH { undef }
    sub STORE { die &quot;This doesn't get called&quot; }
    package main;
    tie my $sv =&gt; &quot;CaptureVar&quot;;
    $sv =~ y/a/b/;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Because $sv is &quot;undef&quot; when the &quot;y///&quot; operator is applied
  to it the transliteration won't actually execute and the program won't
  &quot;die&quot;. This is different to how 5.8 and earlier versions behaved
  since the capture variables were READONLY variables then, now they'll just die
  when assigned to in the default engine.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>numbered_buff_LENGTH</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    I32 numbered_buff_LENGTH (pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx, const SV * const sv,
                              const I32 paren);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Get the &quot;length&quot; of a capture variable. There's a special callback for
  this so that perl doesn't have to do a FETCH and run &quot;length&quot; on the
  result, since the length is (in perl's case) known from an offset stored in
  &quot;rx-&gt;offs&quot; this is much more efficient:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    I32 s1  = rx-&gt;offs[paren].start;
    I32 s2  = rx-&gt;offs[paren].end;
    I32 len = t1 - s1;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is a little bit more complex in the case of UTF-8, see what
  &quot;Perl_reg_numbered_buff_length&quot; does with is_utf8_string_loclen.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Named_capture_callbacks"><a class="selflink" href="#Named_capture_callbacks">Named
  capture callbacks</a></h2>
Called to get/set the value of &quot;%+&quot; and &quot;%-&quot; as well as by
  some utility functions in re.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are two callbacks, &quot;named_buff&quot; is called in all the cases the
  FETCH, STORE, DELETE, CLEAR, EXISTS and SCALAR Tie::Hash callbacks would be on
  changes to &quot;%+&quot; and &quot;%-&quot; and &quot;named_buff_iter&quot;
  in the same cases as FIRSTKEY and NEXTKEY.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;flags&quot; parameter can be used to determine which of these
  operations the callbacks should respond to, the following flags are currently
  defined:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Which Tie::Hash operation is being performed from the Perl level on
  &quot;%+&quot; or &quot;%+&quot;, if any:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    RXapif_FETCH
    RXapif_STORE
    RXapif_DELETE
    RXapif_CLEAR
    RXapif_EXISTS
    RXapif_SCALAR
    RXapif_FIRSTKEY
    RXapif_NEXTKEY
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Whether &quot;%+&quot; or &quot;%-&quot; is being operated on, if any.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    RXapif_ONE /* %+ */
    RXapif_ALL /* %- */
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Whether this is being called as &quot;re::regname&quot;,
  &quot;re::regnames&quot; or &quot;re::regnames_count&quot;, if any. The first
  two will be combined with &quot;RXapif_ONE&quot; or &quot;RXapif_ALL&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    RXapif_REGNAME
    RXapif_REGNAMES
    RXapif_REGNAMES_COUNT
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Internally &quot;%+&quot; and &quot;%-&quot; are implemented with a real tied
  interface via Tie::Hash::NamedCapture. The methods in that package will call
  back into these functions. However the usage of Tie::Hash::NamedCapture for
  this purpose might change in future releases. For instance this might be
  implemented by magic instead (would need an extension to mgvtbl).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>named_buff</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    SV*     (*named_buff) (pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx, SV * const key,
                           SV * const value, U32 flags);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>named_buff_iter</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    SV*     (*named_buff_iter) (pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx, const SV * const lastkey,
                                const U32 flags);
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="qr_package"><a class="selflink" href="#qr_package">qr_package</a></h2>
<pre>
    SV* qr_package(pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The package the qr// magic object is blessed into (as seen by &quot;ref
  qr//&quot;). It is recommended that engines change this to their package name
  for identification regardless of whether they implement methods on the object.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The package this method returns should also have the internal &quot;Regexp&quot;
  package in its @ISA. &quot;qr//-&gt;isa(&quot;Regexp&quot;)&quot; should
  always be true regardless of what engine is being used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example implementation might be:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    SV*
    Example_qr_package(pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx)
    {
        PERL_UNUSED_ARG(rx);
        return newSVpvs(&quot;re::engine::Example&quot;);
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any method calls on an object created with &quot;qr//&quot; will be dispatched
  to the package as a normal object.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use re::engine::Example;
    my $re = qr//;
    $re-&gt;meth; # dispatched to re::engine::Example::meth()

<div class="Pp"></div>
On threaded builds a regexp may need to be duplicated so that the pattern can be
  used by multiple threads. This routine is expected to handle the duplication
  of any private data pointed to by the &quot;pprivate&quot; member of the
  regexp structure. It will be called with the preconstructed new regexp
  structure as an argument, the &quot;pprivate&quot; member will point at the
  <b>old</b> private structure, and it is this routine's responsibility to
  construct a copy and return a pointer to it (which perl will then use to
  overwrite the field as passed to this routine.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
This allows the engine to dupe its private data but also if necessary modify the
  final structure if it really must.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On unthreaded builds this field doesn't exist.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="The_REGEXP_structure"><a class="selflink" href="#The_REGEXP_structure">The
  REGEXP structure</a></h1>
The REGEXP struct is defined in <i>regexp.h</i>. All regex engines must be able
  to correctly build such a structure in their &quot;comp&quot; routine.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The REGEXP structure contains all the data that perl needs to be aware of to
  properly work with the regular expression. It includes data about
  optimisations that perl can use to determine if the regex engine should really
  be used, and various other control info that is needed to properly execute
  patterns in various contexts such as is the pattern anchored in some way, or
  what flags were used during the compile, or whether the program contains
  special constructs that perl needs to be aware of.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition it contains two fields that are intended for the private use of the
  regex engine that compiled the pattern. These are the &quot;intflags&quot; and
  &quot;pprivate&quot; members. &quot;pprivate&quot; is a void pointer to an
  arbitrary structure whose use and management is the responsibility of the
  compiling engine. perl will never modify either of these values.
<div class="Pp"></div>

The fields are discussed in more detail below:
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;engine&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;engine&quot;">&quot;engine&quot;</a></h2>
This field points at a regexp_engine structure which contains pointers to the
  subroutines that are to be used for performing a match. It is the compiling
  routine's responsibility to populate this field before returning the regexp
  object.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Internally this is set to &quot;NULL&quot; unless a custom engine is specified
  in $^H{regcomp}, perl's own set of callbacks can be accessed in the struct
  pointed to by &quot;RE_ENGINE_PTR&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;mother_re&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;mother_re&quot;">&quot;mother_re&quot;</a></h2>
TODO, see http://www.mail-archive.com/perl5-changes@perl.org/msg17328.html
  &lt;http://www.mail-archive.com/perl5-changes@perl.org/msg17328.html&gt;
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;extflags&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;extflags&quot;">&quot;extflags&quot;</a></h2>
This will be used by perl to see what flags the regexp was compiled with, this
  will normally be set to the value of the flags parameter by the comp callback.
  See the comp documentation for valid flags.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;minlen&quot;_&quot;minlenret&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;minlen&quot;_&quot;minlenret&quot;">&quot;minlen&quot;
  &quot;minlenret&quot;</a></h2>
The minimum string length required for the pattern to match. This is used to
  prune the search space by not bothering to match any closer to the end of a
  string than would allow a match. For instance there is no point in even
  starting the regex engine if the minlen is 10 but the string is only 5
  characters long. There is no way that the pattern can match.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;minlenret&quot; is the minimum length of the string that would be found in
  $&amp; after a match.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The difference between &quot;minlen&quot; and &quot;minlenret&quot; can be seen
  in the following pattern:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    /ns(?=\d)/
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where the &quot;minlen&quot; would be 3 but &quot;minlenret&quot; would only be
  2 as the \d is required to match but is not actually included in the matched
  content. This distinction is particularly important as the substitution logic
  uses the &quot;minlenret&quot; to tell whether it can do in-place substitution
  which can result in considerable speedup.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;gofs&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;gofs&quot;">&quot;gofs&quot;</a></h2>
Left offset from <i>pos()</i> to start match at.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;substrs&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;substrs&quot;">&quot;substrs&quot;</a></h2>
Substring data about strings that must appear in the final match. This is
  currently only used internally by perl's engine for but might be used in the
  future for all engines for optimisations.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;nparens&quot;,_&quot;lastparen&quot;,_and_&quot;lastcloseparen&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;nparens&quot;,_&quot;lastparen&quot;,_and_&quot;lastcloseparen&quot;">&quot;nparens&quot;,
  &quot;lastparen&quot;, and &quot;lastcloseparen&quot;</a></h2>
These fields are used to keep track of how many paren groups could be matched in
  the pattern, which was the last open paren to be entered, and which was the
  last close paren to be entered.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;intflags&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;intflags&quot;">&quot;intflags&quot;</a></h2>
The engine's private copy of the flags the pattern was compiled with. Usually
  this is the same as &quot;extflags&quot; unless the engine chose to modify one
  of them.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;pprivate&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;pprivate&quot;">&quot;pprivate&quot;</a></h2>
A void* pointing to an engine-defined data structure. The perl engine uses the
  &quot;regexp_internal&quot; structure (see &quot;Base Structures&quot; in
  perlreguts) but a custom engine should use something else.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;swap&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;swap&quot;">&quot;swap&quot;</a></h2>
Unused. Left in for compatibility with perl 5.10.0.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;offs&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;offs&quot;">&quot;offs&quot;</a></h2>
A &quot;regexp_paren_pair&quot; structure which defines offsets into the string
  being matched which correspond to the $&amp; and $1, $2 etc. captures, the
  &quot;regexp_paren_pair&quot; struct is defined as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    typedef struct regexp_paren_pair {
        I32 start;
        I32 end;
    } regexp_paren_pair;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If &quot;-&gt;offs[num].start&quot; or &quot;-&gt;offs[num].end&quot; is
  &quot;-1&quot; then that capture group did not match.
  &quot;-&gt;offs[0].start/end&quot; represents $&amp; (or &quot;${^MATCH&quot;
  under &quot;//p&quot;) and &quot;-&gt;offs[paren].end&quot; matches $$paren
  where $paren = 1&gt;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;precomp&quot;_&quot;prelen&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;precomp&quot;_&quot;prelen&quot;">&quot;precomp&quot;
  &quot;prelen&quot;</a></h2>
Used for optimisations. &quot;precomp&quot; holds a copy of the pattern that was
  compiled and &quot;prelen&quot; its length. When a new pattern is to be
  compiled (such as inside a loop) the internal &quot;regcomp&quot; operator
  checks whether the last compiled &quot;REGEXP&quot;'s &quot;precomp&quot; and
  &quot;prelen&quot; are equivalent to the new one, and if so uses the old
  pattern instead of compiling a new one.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The relevant snippet from &quot;Perl_pp_regcomp&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        if (!re || !re-&gt;precomp || re-&gt;prelen != (I32)len ||
            memNE(re-&gt;precomp, t, len))
        /* Compile a new pattern */
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;paren_names&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;paren_names&quot;">&quot;paren_names&quot;</a></h2>
This is a hash used internally to track named capture groups and their offsets.
  The keys are the names of the buffers the values are dualvars, with the IV
  slot holding the number of buffers with the given name and the pv being an
  embedded array of I32. The values may also be contained independently in the
  data array in cases where named backreferences are used.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;substrs&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;substrs&quot;">&quot;substrs&quot;</a></h2>
Holds information on the longest string that must occur at a fixed offset from
  the start of the pattern, and the longest string that must occur at a floating
  offset from the start of the pattern. Used to do Fast-Boyer-Moore searches on
  the string to find out if its worth using the regex engine at all, and if so
  where in the string to search.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;subbeg&quot;_&quot;sublen&quot;_&quot;saved_copy&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;subbeg&quot;_&quot;sublen&quot;_&quot;saved_copy&quot;">&quot;subbeg&quot;
  &quot;sublen&quot; &quot;saved_copy&quot;</a></h2>
Used during execution phase for managing search and replace patterns.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;wrapped&quot;_&quot;wraplen&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;wrapped&quot;_&quot;wraplen&quot;">&quot;wrapped&quot;
  &quot;wraplen&quot;</a></h2>
Stores the string &quot;qr//&quot; stringifies to. The perl engine for example
  stores &quot;(?^:eek)&quot; in the case of &quot;qr/eek/&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When using a custom engine that doesn't support the &quot;(?:)&quot; construct
  for inline modifiers, it's probably best to have &quot;qr//&quot; stringify to
  the supplied pattern, note that this will create undesired patterns in cases
  such as:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    my $x = qr/a|b/;  # &quot;a|b&quot;
    my $y = qr/c/i;   # &quot;c&quot;
    my $z = qr/$x$y/; # &quot;a|bc&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
There's no solution for this problem other than making the custom engine
  understand a construct like &quot;(?:)&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;seen_evals&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;seen_evals&quot;">&quot;seen_evals&quot;</a></h2>
This stores the number of eval groups in the pattern. This is used for security
  purposes when embedding compiled regexes into larger patterns with
  &quot;qr//&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;refcnt&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;refcnt&quot;">&quot;refcnt&quot;</a></h2>
The number of times the structure is referenced. When this falls to 0 the regexp
  is automatically freed by a call to pregfree. This should be set to 1 in each
  engine's &quot;comp&quot; routine.
