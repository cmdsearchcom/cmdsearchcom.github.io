<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ocamlc - The OCaml bytecode compiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ocamlc [ options ] filename ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ocamlc.opt [ options ] filename
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The OCaml bytecode compiler ocamlc(1) compiles OCaml source
files to bytecode object files and links these object files
to produce standalone bytecode executable files. These <br>
executable files are then run by the bytecode interpreter
ocamlrun(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ocamlc(1) command has a
command-line interface similar to the one of most C
compilers. It accepts several types of arguments and
processes them sequentially:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments ending in .mli are
taken to be source files for compilation unit interfaces.
Interfaces specify the names exported by compilation units:
they declare value names with <br>
their types, define public data types, declare abstract data
types, and so on. From the file x.mli, the ocamlc(1)
compiler produces a compiled interface in the file
x.cmi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments ending in .ml are
taken to be source files for compilation unit
implementations. Implementations provide definitions for the
names exported by the unit, and also con&acirc; <br>
tain expressions to be evaluated for their side-effects.
From the file x.ml, the ocamlc(1) compiler produces compiled
object bytecode in the file x.cmo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the interface file x.mli
exists, the implementation x.ml is checked against the
corresponding compiled interface x.cmi, which is assumed to
exist. If no interface x.mli is <br>
provided, the compilation of x.ml produces a compiled
interface file x.cmi in addition to the compiled object code
file x.cmo. The file x.cmi produced corresponds to an
inter&acirc; <br>
face that exports everything that is defined in the
implementation x.ml.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments ending in .cmo are
taken to be compiled object bytecode. These files are linked
together, along with the object files obtained by compiling
.ml arguments (if any), and <br>
the OCaml standard library, to produce a standalone
executable program. The order in which .cmo and.ml arguments
are presented on the command line is relevant: compilation
units <br>
are initialized in that order at run-time, and it is a
link-time error to use a component of a unit before having
initialized it. Hence, a given x.cmo file must come before
all <br>
.cmo files that refer to the unit x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments ending in .cma are
taken to be libraries of object bytecode. A library of
object bytecode packs in a single file a set of object
bytecode files (.cmo files). Libraries <br>
are built with ocamlc -a (see the description of the -a
option below). The object files contained in the library are
linked as regular .cmo files (see above), in the order
speci&acirc; <br>
fied when the .cma file was built. The only difference is
that if an object file contained in a library is not
referenced anywhere in the program, then it is not linked
in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments ending in .c are
passed to the C compiler, which generates a .o object file.
This object file is linked with the program if the -custom
flag is set (see the description <br>
of -custom below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments ending in .o or .a are
assumed to be C object files and libraries. They are passed
to the C linker when linking in -custom mode (see the
description of -custom below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments ending in .so are
assumed to be C shared libraries (DLLs). During linking,
they are searched for external C functions referenced from
the OCaml code, and their names <br>
are written in the generated bytecode executable. The
run-time system ocamlrun(1) then loads them dynamically at
program start-up time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output of the linking phase
is a file containing compiled bytecode that can be executed
by the OCaml bytecode interpreter: the command ocamlrun(1).
If caml.out is the name <br>
of the file produced by the linking phase, the command
ocamlrun caml.out arg1 arg2 ... argn executes the compiled
code contained in caml.out, passing it as arguments the
charac&acirc; <br>
ter strings arg1 to argn. (See ocamlrun(1) for more
details.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On most systems, the file
produced by the linking phase can be run directly, as in:
./caml.out arg1 arg2 ... argn. The produced file has the
executable bit set, and it manages <br>
to launch the bytecode interpreter by itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ocamlc.opt is the same compiler
as ocamlc, but compiled with the native-code compiler
ocamlopt(1). Thus, it behaves exactly like ocamlc, but
compiles faster. ocamlc.opt may not <br>
be available in all installations of OCaml.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following command-line options are recognized by
ocamlc(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Build a library (.cma file)
with the object files (.cmo files) given on the command
line, instead of linking them into an executable file. The
name of the library must be <br>
set with the -o option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -custom, -cclib or -ccopt
options are passed on the command line, these options are
stored in the resulting .cma library. Then, linking with
this library automatically <br>
adds back the -custom, -cclib and -ccopt options as if they
had been provided on the command line, unless the
-noautolink option is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-absname <br>
Show absolute filenames in error messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-annot Dump detailed information
about the compilation (types, bindings, tail-calls, etc).
The information for file src.ml is put into file src.annot.
In case of a type error, <br>
dump all the information inferred by the type-checker before
the error. The src.annot file can be used with the emacs
commands given in emacs/caml-types.el to display <br>
types and other annotations interactively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bin-annot <br>
Dump detailed information about the compilation (types,
bindings, tail-calls, etc) in binary format. The information
for file src.ml is put into file src.cmt. In case of <br>
a type error, dump all the information inferred by the
type-checker before the error. The annotation files produced
by -bin-annot contain more information and are much <br>
more compact than the files produced by -annot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Compile only. Suppress the
linking phase of the compilation. Source code files are
turned into compiled files, but no executable file is
produced. This option is useful to <br>
compile modules separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cc ccomp <br>
Use ccomp as the C linker when linking in &quot;custom
runtime&quot; mode (see the -custom option) and as the C
compiler for compiling .c source files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cclib -llibname <br>
Pass the -llibname option to the C linker when linking in
&quot;custom runtime&quot; mode (see the -custom option).
This causes the given C library to be linked with the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ccopt option <br>
Pass the given option to the C compiler and linker, when
linking in &quot;custom runtime&quot; mode (see the -custom
option). For instance, -ccopt -Ldir causes the C linker to
<br>
search for C libraries in directory dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-compat-32 <br>
Check that the generated bytecode executable can run on
32-bit platforms and signal an error if it cannot. This is
useful when compiling bytecode on a 64-bit machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-config <br>
Print the version number of ocamlc(1) and a detailed summary
of its configuration, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-custom <br>
Link in &quot;custom runtime&quot; mode. In the default
linking mode, the linker produces bytecode that is intended
to be executed with the shared runtime system, ocamlrun(1).
In <br>
the custom runtime mode, the linker produces an output file
that contains both the runtime system and the bytecode for
the program. The resulting file is larger, but it <br>
can be executed directly, even if the ocamlrun(1) command is
not installed. Moreover, the &quot;custom runtime&quot; mode
enables linking OCaml code with user-defined C
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Never use the strip(1) command
on executables produced by ocamlc -custom, this would remove
the bytecode part of the executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dllib -llibname <br>
Arrange for the C shared library dlllibname.so to be loaded
dynamically by the run-time system ocamlrun(1) at program
start-up time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dllpath dir <br>
Adds the directory dir to the run-time search path for
shared C libraries. At link-time, shared libraries are
searched in the standard search path (the one corresponding
<br>
to the -I option). The -dllpath option simply stores dir in
the produced executable file, where ocamlrun(1) can find it
and use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-for-pack ident <br>
This option is accepted for compatibility with ocamlopt(1) ;
it does nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Add debugging information
while compiling and linking. This option is required in
order to be able to debug the program with ocamldebug(1) and
to produce stack backtraces <br>
when the program terminates on an uncaught exception.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Cause the compiler to print
all defined names (with their inferred types or their
definitions) when compiling an implementation (.ml file). No
compiled files (.cmo and <br>
.cmi files) are produced. This can be useful to check the
types inferred by the compiler. Also, since the output
follows the syntax of interfaces, it can help in writing
<br>
an explicit interface (.mli file) for a file: just redirect
the standard output of the compiler to a .mli file, and edit
that file to remove all declarations of unexported <br>
names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I directory <br>
Add the given directory to the list of directories searched
for compiled interface files (.cmi), compiled object code
files (.cmo), libraries (.cma), and C libraries spec&acirc;
<br>
ified with -cclib -lxxx . By default, the current directory
is searched first, then the standard library directory.
Directories added with -I are searched after the cur&acirc;
<br>
rent directory, in the order in which they were given on the
command line, but before the standard library directory. See
also option -nostdlib.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the given directory starts
with +, it is taken relative to the standard library
directory. For instance, -I +labltk adds the subdirectory
labltk of the standard library <br>
to the search path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-impl filename <br>
Compile the file filename as an implementation file, even if
its extension is not .ml.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-intf filename <br>
Compile the file filename as an interface file, even if its
extension is not .mli.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-intf-suffix string <br>
Recognize file names ending with string as interface files
(instead of the default .mli).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-labels <br>
Labels are not ignored in types, labels may be used in
applications, and labelled parameters can be given in any
order. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-linkall <br>
Force all modules contained in libraries to be linked in. If
this flag is not given, unreferenced modules are not linked
in. When building a library (option -a), setting <br>
the -linkall option forces all subsequent links of programs
involving that library to link all the modules contained in
the library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-make-runtime <br>
Build a custom runtime system (in the file specified by
option -o) incorporating the C object files and libraries
given on the command line. This custom runtime system <br>
can be used later to execute bytecode executables produced
with the option ocamlc -use-runtime runtime-name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-app-funct <br>
Deactivates the applicative behaviour of functors. With this
option, each functor application generates new types in its
result and applying the same functor twice to the <br>
same argument yields two incompatible structures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noassert <br>
Do not compile assertion checks. Note that the special form
assert false is always compiled because it is typed
specially. This flag has no effect when linking already-
<br>
compiled files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noautolink <br>
When linking .cma libraries, ignore -custom, -cclib and
-ccopt options potentially contained in the libraries (if
these options were given when building the libraries). <br>
This can be useful if a library contains incorrect
specifications of C libraries or C options; in this case,
during linking, set -noautolink and pass the correct C <br>
libraries and options on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nolabels <br>
Ignore non-optional labels in types. Labels cannot be used
in applications, and parameter order becomes strict.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nostdlib <br>
Do not automatically add the standard library directory to
the list of directories searched for compiled interface
files (.cmi), compiled object code files (.cmo), <br>
libraries (.cma), and C libraries specified with -cclib
-lxxx . See also option -I.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o exec-file <br>
Specify the name of the output file produced by the linker.
The default output name is a.out, in keeping with the Unix
tradition. If the -a option is given, specify the <br>
name of the library produced. If the -pack option is given,
specify the name of the packed object file produced. If the
-output-obj option is given, specify the name of <br>
the output file produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-output-obj <br>
Cause the linker to produce a C object file instead of a
bytecode executable file. This is useful to wrap OCaml code
as a C library, callable from any C program. The name <br>
of the output object file must be set with the -o option.
This option can also be used to produce a C source file (.c
extension) or a compiled shared/dynamic library (.so <br>
extension).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pack Build a bytecode object
file (.cmo file) and its associated compiled interface
(.cmi) that combines the object files given on the command
line, making them appear as sub- <br>
modules of the output .cmo file. The name of the output .cmo
file must be given with the -o option. For instance, ocamlc
-pack -o p.cmo a.cmo b.cmo c.cmo generates com&acirc; <br>
piled files p.cmo and p.cmi describing a compilation unit
having three sub-modules A, B and C, corresponding to the
contents of the object files a.cmo, b.cmo and c.cmo. <br>
These contents can be referenced as P.A, P.B and P.C in the
remainder of the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pp command <br>
Cause the compiler to call the given command as a
preprocessor for each source file. The output of command is
redirected to an intermediate file, which is compiled. If
<br>
there are no compilation errors, the intermediate file is
deleted afterwards. The name of this file is built from the
basename of the source file with the extension .ppi <br>
for an interface (.mli) file and .ppo for an implementation
(.ml) file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ppx command <br>
After parsing, pipe the abstract syntax tree through the
preprocessor command. The format of the input and ouput of
the preprocessor are not yet documented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-principal <br>
Check information path during type-checking, to make sure
that all types are derived in a principal way. When using
labelled arguments and/or polymorphic methods, this <br>
flag is required to ensure future versions of the compiler
will be able to infer types correctly, even if internal
algorithms change. All programs accepted in -principal <br>
mode are also accepted in the default mode with equivalent
types, but different binary signatures, and this may slow
down type checking; yet it is a good idea to use it <br>
once before publishing source code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rectypes <br>
Allow arbitrary recursive types during type-checking. By
default, only recursive types where the recursion goes
through an object type are supported. Note that once you
<br>
have created an interface using this flag, you must use it
again for all dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-runtime-variant suffix <br>
Add suffix to the name of the runtime library that will be
used by the program. If OCaml was configured with option
-with-debug-runtime, then the d suffix is supported <br>
and gives a debug version of the runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-short-paths <br>
When a type is visible under several module-paths, use the
shortest one when printing the type&rsquo;s name in inferred
interfaces and error and warning messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-strict-sequence <br>
Force the left-hand part of each sequence to have type
unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-thread <br>
Compile or link multithreaded programs, in combination with
the system &quot;threads&quot; library described in The
OCaml user&rsquo;s manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-unsafe <br>
Turn bound checking off for array and string accesses (the
v.(i)ands.[i] constructs). Programs compiled with -unsafe
are therefore slightly faster, but unsafe: anything <br>
can happen if the program accesses an array or string
outside of its bounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-use-runtime runtime-name <br>
Generate a bytecode executable file that can be executed on
the custom runtime system runtime-name, built earlier with
ocamlc -make-runtime runtime-name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print the version number of
the compiler and the location of the standard library
directory, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Print all external commands before they are executed, in
particular invocations of the C compiler and linker in
-custom mode. Useful to debug C library problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vmthread <br>
Compile or link multithreaded programs, in combination with
the VM-level threads library described in The OCaml
user&rsquo;s manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vnum or -version <br>
Print the version number of the compiler in short form (e.g.
&quot;3.11.0&quot;), then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w warning-list <br>
Enable, disable, or mark as fatal the warnings specified by
the argument warning-list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each warning can be enabled or
disabled, and each warning can be fatalor non-fatal. If a
warning is disabled, it isn&rsquo;t displayed and
doesn&rsquo;t affect compilation in any way <br>
(even if it is fatal). If a warning is enabled, it is
displayed normally by the compiler whenever the source code
triggers it. If it is enabled and fatal, the compiler <br>
will also stop with an error after displaying it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The warning-list argument is a
sequence of warning specifiers, with no separators between
them. A warning specifier is one of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+num Enable warning number
num.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-num Disable warning number
num.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@num Enable and mark as fatal
warning number num.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+num1..num2 Enable all warnings
between num1 and num2 (inclusive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-num1..num2 Disable all warnings
between num1 and num2 (inclusive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@num1..num2 Enable and mark as
fatal all warnings between num1 and num2 (inclusive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+letter Enable the set of
warnings corresponding to letter. The letter may be
uppercase or lowercase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-letter Disable the set of
warnings corresponding to letter. The letter may be
uppercase or lowercase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@letter Enable and mark as fatal
the set of warnings corresponding to letter. The letter may
be uppercase or lowercase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uppercase-letter Enable the set
of warnings corresponding to uppercase-letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lowercase-letter Disable the set
of warnings corresponding to lowercase-letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The warning numbers are as
follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Suspicious-looking
start-of-comment mark.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Suspicious-looking
end-of-comment mark.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Deprecated feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 Fragile pattern matching:
matching that will remain complete even if additional
constructors are added to one of the variant types
matched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 Partially applied function:
expression whose result has function type and is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6 Label omitted in function
application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7 Method overridden without

in pattern-matching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9 Missing fields in a record
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10 Expression on the left-hand
side of a sequence that doesn&rsquo;t have type unit (and
that is not a function, see warning number 5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">11 Redundant case in a pattern
matching (unused match case).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">12 Redundant sub-pattern in a
pattern-matching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">13 Override of an instance
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">14 Illegal backslash escape in a
string constant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">15 Private method made public
implicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">16 Unerasable optional
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">17 Undeclared virtual
method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">18 Non-principal type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">19 Type without
principality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">20 Unused function argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">24 Bad module name: the source
file name is not a valid OCaml module name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">25 Pattern-matching with all
clauses guarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">26 Suspicious unused variable:
unused variable that is bound with let or as, and
doesn&rsquo;t start with an underscore (_) character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">27 Innocuous unused variable:
unused variable that is not bound with let nor as, and

of the type checker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-warn-error warning-list <br>
Mark as errors the warnings specified in the argument
warning-list. The compiler will stop with an error when one
of these warnings is emitted. The warning-list has the <br>
same meaning as for the -w option: a + sign (or an uppercase
letter) marks the corresponding warnings as fatal, a - sign
(or a lowercase letter) turns them back into non- <br>
fatal warnings, and a @ sign both enables and marks as fatal
the corresponding warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: it is not recommended to
use the -warn-error option in production code, because it
will almost certainly prevent compiling your program with
later versions of OCaml <br>
when they add new warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default setting is
-warn-error -a (all warnings are non-fatal).</p>
