<b>kdb-introduction</b> - introduction to kdb
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Elektra</b> solves the task of accessing the configuration storage.
  Additionally, a tooling gathered around Elektra helps with minor problems that
  appear every day. Maybe the administrator needs a cron job that periodically
  changes the settings of a service. Maybe the user wants to have an overview of
  the whole configuration to learn what can be tweaked. Maybe the developer
  needs to fully export the configuration the program had when a failure
  occurred. These tasks have in common that they become trivial once a
  programmatic access to a global key database exists.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In this subsection we give an overview of the command-line tool <b>kdb</b>. It
  is part of Elektra&#x00B4;s environment and performs the mentioned tasks.
  <b>kdb</b> consists of individual subprograms. The programs are independent,
  but can access a shared part that provides functionality too specific to be in
  the library -- for example, pretty printing of error messages and warnings.
  Most parts of this suite are short programs which basically call
  <b>kdbGet()</b>, do something with the data structure and eventually write it
  back using <b>kdbSet()</b>. Note that the command-line tool <b>kdb</b> should
  not be confused with the class <b>KDB</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>kdb</b> was rewritten as part of this thesis with a new architecture. Now
  every part of the application suite will be able to accept its own command
  line arguments and will have its own documentation. Also a completely new
  feature <b>mount</b> arose.

Only a few commands are enough for daily use. We can retrieve a key by:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">
  <div class="Pp"></div>
  </dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&gt; kdb get user/keyname
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">
  <div class="Pp"></div>
  </dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We store a key permanently with a value given by:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">
  <div class="Pp"></div>
  </dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&gt; kdb set user/keyname value
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">
  <div class="Pp"></div>
  </dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We list all available keys arranged below a key by:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">
  <div class="Pp"></div>
  </dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&gt; kdb ls user/keyname
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">
  <div class="Pp"></div>
  </dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many other tools beside <b>kdb</b> are possible. They may be more convenient
  depending on the situation. Preference dialogues, graphical editors,
  web-interfaces and web services can all provide access to the global key
  database.</div>
