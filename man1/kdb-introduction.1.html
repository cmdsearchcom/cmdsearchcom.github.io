kdb-introduction - introduction to kdb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Elektra solves the task of
accessing the configuration storage. Additionally, a tooling
gathered around Elektra helps with minor problems that
appear every day. Maybe the admin&acirc; <br>
istrator needs a cron job that periodically changes the
settings of a service. Maybe the user wants to have an
overview of the whole configuration to learn what can be
tweaked. <br>
Maybe the developer needs to fully export the configuration
the program had when a failure occurred. These tasks have in
common that they become trivial once a programmatic <br>
access to a global key database exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this subsection we give an
overview of the command-line tool kdb. It is part of
Elektra&Acirc;&acute;s environment and performs the
mentioned tasks. kdb consists of individual subprograms.
<br>
The programs are independent, but can access a shared part
that provides functionality too specific to be in the
library -- for example, pretty printing of error messages
and <br>
warnings. Most parts of this suite are short programs which
basically call kdbGet(), do something with the data
structure and eventually write it back using kdbSet(). Note
that <br>
the command-line tool kdb should not be confused with the
class KDB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kdb was rewritten as part of
this thesis with a new architecture. Now every part of the
application suite will be able to accept its own command
line arguments and will have its <br>
own documentation. Also a completely new feature mount
arose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only a few commands are enough
for daily use. We can retrieve a key by:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; kdb get user/keyname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We store a key permanently with
a value given by:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; kdb set user/keyname
value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We list all available keys
arranged below a key by:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; kdb ls user/keyname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many other tools beside kdb are
possible. They may be more convenient depending on the
situation. Preference dialogues, graphical editors,
web-interfaces and web services can all <br>
provide access to the global key database.</p>
