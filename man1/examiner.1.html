The <i>examiner</i> is a program used to analyze and comment on ELF executables.
  Its purpose is mainly intended for forensic analysis but can be used for
  general reverse engineering. The goal is to take a foreign executable and
  analyze it without running it. The <i>examiner</i> relies on objdump to do its
  disassembly and then it parses the assembly output and attempts to put human
  readable comments to help facilitate analysis of the binary.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The commented file will be created with the name of the target binary with the
  extension of .commented. By default the Examiner creates
  <i></i><i>$HOME</i><i>/examiner-data</i> directory to store its output. This
  can be overridden with the <b>-d</b> option. Also if The Coroners Toolkit
  (TCT) is installed the <i>examiner</i> will use the directory specified by
  TCT. See below for more information for using the Examiner with TCT. You may
  use the <b>-o</b> option to specify a seperate file for the commented source.
  If you use <b>-o -</b> Then Examiner will print the commented source to
  STDOUT.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>examiner</i> requires that you use the <b>-x</b> option to specify an
  executable to analyze. By default the <i>examiner</i> only reports what Phase
  of analysis it is currently working on. The <i>examiner</i> analyzes binaries
  in four phases.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">PHASE 1 - Initial analysis and parsing</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">PHASE 2 - Passes over the information and collects
    info</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">PHASE 3 - Manipulates collected data to draw
    conclusions</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">PHASE 4 - Generate the commented output</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>-v</b> option is used then the program will report on each step within
  the phase as well. You can also have a brief summary reported that will give
  you some information about the total number of functions found, etc. If you
  don't want any output you can use the <b>-q</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>examiner</i> will attempt to read ASCII strings from the .rodata section
  headers. It will then cross references this information in its output. It
  attempts to only print the printable characters and display hex or C style
  representations for special characters such as '\n'. In the commented output
  the <i>examiner</i> will restrict the length of the string. This feature can
  be overridden with the <b>-L</b> option. This is really not recommended.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can generate additional reports that may help in analysis. If the <b>-H</b>
  option is supplied it will dump each section in the executable. The files are
  stored in the working directory. These files will have the target executables
  name with the section as an extension, eg: binary.rodata.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can generate Reference files with the <b>-R</b> option. These files are
  generated for help in cross referencing information. Currently it will create
  three files: functions, interrupts, and sections. The function file contains
  the guessed function name and it's address. The interrupts file list any
  interrupts that are called and what the stack would look like at the time
  (sort of). The section file contains a list of all section and their memory
  ranges.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For a brief summary of all the options you can use the <b>-h</b> option. If you
  supply the <b>-V</b> option <i>examiner</i> will print its version info and
  then exit.

  EXAMINER WITH TCT</a></h1>
The <i>examiner</i> can optionally be run on a system that has The Coroners
  Toolkit (TCT) installed. The Examiner will use some executables when the are
  installed. The paths to these may be specified in TCT paths.pl file. The
  Examiner will also read in the <i>coroner.conf</i> file to locate the section
  it should use as its working directory. You can specify a different
  <i>coroner.conf</i> file with the <b>-C</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The newer version of the Examiner will read in an optional hash library. This
  library is simply hash references that would normally be generated by parsing
  the <i>net.h</i> and <i>unistd.h</i> files. This file
  <i>examiner_hashes.pl</i> will be parsed if its in the current directory or
  <i>/usr/share/tct</i>. <i>unistd.h</i> is substituted for <i>syscall.h</i> on
  BSD based systems. Check the <i>os</i> directory for some pre-created examiner
  hashes.
