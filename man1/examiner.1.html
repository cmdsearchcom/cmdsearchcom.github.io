<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
examiner - A ELF binary executable analyzer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
examiner [ -hvVsHRLq ] [ -d directory ] [ -C coroner.conf ]
[ -o outfile ] [ -c &rsquo;comment char&rsquo; ] -x
executable</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The examiner is a program used to analyze and comment on ELF
executables. Its purpose is mainly intended for forensic
analysis but can be used for general reverse engineering.
<br>
The goal is to take a foreign executable and analyze it
without running it. The examiner relies on objdump to do its
disassembly and then it parses the assembly output and <br>
attempts to put human readable comments to help facilitate
analysis of the binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The commented file will be
created with the name of the target binary with the
extension of .commented. By default the Examiner creates
$HOME/examiner-data directory to store <br>
its output. This can be overridden with the -d option. Also
if The Coroners Toolkit (TCT) is installed the examiner will
use the directory specified by TCT. See below for more <br>
information for using the Examiner with TCT. You may use the
-o option to specify a seperate file for the commented
source. If you use -o - Then Examiner will print the <br>
commented source to STDOUT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The examiner requires that you
use the -x option to specify an executable to analyze. By
default the examiner only reports what Phase of analysis it
is currently working on. <br>
The examiner analyzes binaries in four phases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PHASE 1 - Initial analysis and
parsing <br>
PHASE 2 - Passes over the information and collects info <br>
PHASE 3 - Manipulates collected data to draw conclusions
<br>
PHASE 4 - Generate the commented output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -v option is used then
the program will report on each step within the phase as
well. You can also have a brief summary reported that will
give you some information about <br>
the total number of functions found, etc. If you don&rsquo;t
want any output you can use the -q option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The examiner will attempt to
read ASCII strings from the .rodata section headers. It will
then cross references this information in its output. It
attempts to only print the <br>
printable characters and display hex or C style
representations for special characters such as &rsquo;0. In
the commented output the examiner will restrict the length
of the string. <br>
This feature can be overridden with the -L option. This is
really not recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can generate additional
reports that may help in analysis. If the -H option is
supplied it will dump each section in the executable. The
files are stored in the working <br>
directory. These files will have the target executables name
with the section as an extension, eg: binary.rodata.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can generate Reference files
with the -R option. These files are generated for help in
cross referencing information. Currently it will create
three files: functions, <br>
interrupts, and sections. The function file contains the
guessed function name and it&rsquo;s address. The interrupts
file list any interrupts that are called and what the stack
<br>
would look like at the time (sort of). The section file
contains a list of all section and their memory ranges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a brief summary of all the
options you can use the -h option. If you supply the -V
option examiner will print its version info and then
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING EXAMINER WITH TCT <br>
The examiner can optionally be run on a system that has The
Coroners Toolkit (TCT) installed. The Examiner will use some
executables when the are installed. The paths to these <br>
may be specified in TCT paths.pl file. The Examiner will
also read in the coroner.conf file to locate the section it
should use as its working directory. You can specify a <br>
different coroner.conf file with the -C option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The newer version of the
Examiner will read in an optional hash library. This library
is simply hash references that would normally be generated
by parsing the net.h and <br>
unistd.h files. This file examiner_hashes.pl will be parsed
if its in the current directory or /usr/share/tct. unistd.h
is substituted for syscall.h on BSD based systems. <br>
Check the os directory for some pre-created examiner
hashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
coroner.conf - (optional conf file) <br>
examiner_hashes.pl - (optional) If present won&rsquo;t parse
header files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LICENSE <br>
