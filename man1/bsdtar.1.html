<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tar &acirc; manipulate tape archives</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tar [bundled-flags &acirc;&uml;args&acirc;&copy;]
[&acirc;&uml;file&acirc;&copy; |
&acirc;&uml;pattern&acirc;&copy; ...] <br>
tar {-c} [options] [files | directories] <br>
tar {-r | -u} -f archive-file [options] [files |
directories] <br>
tar {-t | -x} [options] [patterns]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tar creates and manipulates streaming archive files. This
implementation can extract from tar, pax, cpio, zip, jar,
ar, xar, rpm, 7-zip, and ISO 9660 cdrom images and can
create <br>
tar, pax, cpio, ar, zip, 7-zip, and shar archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first synopsis form shows a
&acirc;bundled&acirc; option word. This usage is provided
for compatibility with historical implementations. See
COMPATIBILITY below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other synopsis forms show
the preferred usage. The first option to tar is a mode
indicator from the following list: <br>
-c Create a new archive containing the specified items. The
long option form is --create. <br>
-r Like -c, but new entries are appended to the archive.
Note that this only works on uncompressed archives stored in
regular files. The -f option is required. The long <br>
option form is --append. <br>
-t List archive contents to stdout. The long option form is
--list. <br>
-u Like -r, but new entries are added only if they have a
modification date newer than the corresponding entry in the
archive. Note that this only works on uncompressed ar&acirc;
<br>
chives stored in regular files. The -f option is required.
The long form is --update. <br>
-x Extract to disk from the archive. If a file with the same
name appears more than once in the archive, each copy will
be extracted, with later copies overwriting (replac&acirc;
<br>
ing) earlier copies. The long option form is --extract.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In -c, -r, or -u mode, each
specified file or directory is added to the archive in the
order specified on the command line. By default, the
contents of each directory are also <br>
archived.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In extract or list mode, the
entire command line is read and parsed before the archive is
opened. The pathnames or patterns on the command line
indicate which items in the archive <br>
should be processed. Patterns are shell-style globbing
patterns as documented in tcsh(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Unless specifically stated otherwise, options are applicable
in all operating modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@archive <br>
(c and r mode only) The specified archive is opened and the
entries in it will be appended to the current archive. As a
simple example, <br>
tar -c -f - newfile @original.tar <br>
writes a new archive to standard output containing a file
newfile and all of the entries from original.tar. In
contrast, <br>
tar -c -f - newfile original.tar <br>
creates a new archive with only two entries. Similarly, <br>
tar -czf - --format pax @- <br>
reads an archive from standard input (whose format will be
determined automatically) and converts it into a
gzip-compressed pax-format archive on stdout. In this way,
tar <br>
can be used to convert archives from one format to
another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --auto-compress <br>
(c mode only) Use the archive suffix to decide a set of the
format and the compressions. As a simple example, <br>
tar -a -cf archive.tgz source.c source.h <br>
creates a new archive with restricted pax format and gzip
compression, <br>
tar -a -cf archive.tar.bz2.uu source.c source.h <br>
creates a new archive with restricted pax format and bzip2
compression and uuencode compression, <br>
tar -a -cf archive.zip source.c source.h <br>
creates a new archive with zip format, <br>
tar -a -jcf archive.tgz source.c source.h <br>
ignores the &acirc;-j&acirc; option, and creates a new
archive with restricted pax format and gzip compression,
<br>
tar -a -jcf archive.xxx source.c source.h <br>
if it is unknown suffix or no suffix, creates a new archive
with restricted pax format and bzip2 compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --read-full-blocks <br>
Ignored for compatibility with other tar(1)
implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b blocksize, --block-size
blocksize <br>
Specify the block size, in 512-byte records, for tape drive
I/O. As a rule, this argument is only needed when reading
from or writing to tape drives, and usually not even <br>
then as the default block size of 20 records (10240 bytes)
is very common.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C directory, --cd directory,
--directory directory <br>
In c and r mode, this changes the directory before adding
the following files. In x mode, change directories after
opening the archive but before extracting entries from <br>
the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--chroot <br>
(x mode only) chroot() to the current directory after
processing any -C options and before extracting any
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-copyfile <br>
Mac OS X specific. Disable the use of copyfile(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude pattern <br>
Do not process files or directories that match the specified
pattern. Note that exclusions take precedence over patterns
or filenames specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--format format <br>
(c, r, u mode only) Use the specified format for the created
archive. Supported formats include &acirc;cpio&acirc;,
&acirc;pax&acirc;, &acirc;shar&acirc;, and
&acirc;ustar&acirc;. Other formats may also be supported;
<br>
see libarchive-formats(5) for more information about
currently-supported formats. In r and u modes, when
extending an existing archive, the format specified here
must be <br>
compatible with the format of the existing archive on
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f file, --file file <br>
Read the archive from or write the archive to the specified
file. The filename can be - for standard input or standard
output. The default varies by system; on FreeBSD, <br>
the default is /dev/sa0; on Linux, the default is
/dev/st0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gid id <br>
Use the provided group id number. On extract, this overrides
the group id in the archive; the group name in the archive
will be ignored. On create, this overrides the <br>
group id read from disk; if --gname is not also specified,
the group name will be set to match the group id.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gname name <br>
Use the provided group name. On extract, this overrides the
group name in the archive; if the provided group name does
not exist on the system, the group id (from the ar&acirc;
<br>
chive or from the --gid option) will be used instead. On
create, this sets the group name that will be stored in the
archive; the name will not be verified against the <br>
system group database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H (c and r mode only) Symbolic
links named on the command line will be followed; the target
of the link will be archived, not the link itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h (c and r mode only) Synonym
for -L.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Synonym for -T.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Show usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hfsCompression <br>
(x mode only) Mac OS X specific(v10.6 or later). Compress
extracted regular files with HFS+ compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include pattern <br>
Process only files or directories that match the specified
pattern. Note that exclusions specified with --exclude take
precedence over inclusions. If no inclusions are <br>
explicitly specified, all entries are processed by default.
The --include option is especially useful when filtering
archives. For example, the command <br>
tar -c -f new.tar --include=&rsquo;*foo*&rsquo; @old.tgz
<br>
creates a new archive new.tar containing only the entries
from old.tgz containing the string &acirc;foo&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J, --xz <br>
(c mode only) Compress the resulting archive with xz(1). In
extract or list modes, this option is ignored. Note that,
unlike other tar implementations, this implementa&acirc;
<br>
tion recognizes XZ compression automatically when reading
archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j, --bzip, --bzip2, --bunzip2
<br>
(c mode only) Compress the resulting archive with bzip2(1).
In extract or list modes, this option is ignored. Note that,
unlike other tar implementations, this implemen&acirc; <br>
tation recognizes bzip2 compression automatically when
reading archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --keep-old-files <br>
(x mode only) Do not overwrite existing files. In
particular, if a file appears more than once in an archive,
later copies will not overwrite earlier copies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keep-newer-files <br>
(x mode only) Do not overwrite existing files that are newer
than the versions appearing in the archive being
extracted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --dereference <br>
(c and r mode only) All symbolic links will be followed.
Normally, symbolic links are archived as such. With this
option, the target of the link will be archived instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --check-links <br>
(c and r modes only) Issue a warning message unless all
links to each file are archived.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lrzip <br>
(c mode only) Compress the resulting archive with lrzip(1).
In extract or list modes, this option is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lzma (c mode only) Compress
the resulting archive with the original LZMA algorithm. Use
of this option is discouraged and new archives should be
created with --xz instead. <br>
Note that, unlike other tar implementations, this
implementation recognizes LZMA compression automatically
when reading archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lzop (c mode only) Compress
the resulting archive with lzop(1). In extract or list
modes, this option is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --modification-time <br>
(x mode only) Do not extract modification time. By default,
the modification time is set to the time stored in the
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --norecurse, --no-recursion
<br>
(c, r, u modes only) Do not recursively archive the contents
of directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--newer date <br>
(c, r, u modes only) Only include files and directories
newer than the specified date. This compares ctime
entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--newer-mtime date <br>
(c, r, u modes only) Like --newer, except it compares mtime
entries instead of ctime entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--newer-than file <br>
(c, r, u modes only) Only include files and directories
newer than the specified file. This compares ctime
entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--newer-mtime-than file <br>
(c, r, u modes only) Like --newer-than, except it compares
mtime entries instead of ctime entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nodump <br>
(c and r modes only) Honor the nodump file flag by skipping
this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nopreserveHFSCompression <br>
(x mode only) Mac OS X specific(v10.6 or later). Do not
compress extracted regular files which were compressed with
HFS+ compression before archived. By default, compress <br>
the regular files again with HFS+ compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--null (use with -I or -T)
Filenames or patterns are separated by null characters, not
by newlines. This is often used to read filenames output by
the -print0 option to find(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-same-owner <br>
(x mode only) Do not extract owner and group IDs. This is
the reverse of --same-owner and the default behavior if tar
is run as non-root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-same-permissions <br>
(x mode only) Do not extract full permissions (SGID, SUID,
sticky bit, ACLs, extended attributes or extended file
flags). This is the reverse of -p and the default
behav&acirc; <br>
ior if tar is run as non-root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--numeric-owner <br>
This is equivalent to --uname &quot;&quot; --gname
&quot;&quot;. On extract, it causes user and group names in
the archive to be ignored in favor of the numeric user and
group ids. On cre&acirc; <br>
ate, it causes user and group names to not be stored in the
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --to-stdout <br>
(x, t modes only) In extract (-x) mode, files will be
written to standard out rather than being extracted to disk.
In list (-t) mode, the file listing will be written to <br>
stderr rather than the usual stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o (x mode) Use the user and
group of the user running the program rather than those
specified in the archive. Note that this has no significance
unless -p is specified, and <br>
the program is being run by the root user. In this case, the
file modes and flags from the archive will be restored, but
ACLs or owner information in the archive will be <br>
discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o (c, r, u mode) A synonym for
--format ustar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--older date <br>
(c, r, u modes only) Only include files and directories
older than the specified date. This compares ctime
entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--older-mtime date <br>
(c, r, u modes only) Like --older, except it compares mtime
entries instead of ctime entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--older-than file <br>
(c, r, u modes only) Only include files and directories
older than the specified file. This compares ctime
entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--older-mtime-than file <br>
(c, r, u modes only) Like --older-than, except it compares
mtime entries instead of ctime entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--one-file-system <br>
(c, r, and u modes) Do not cross mount points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--options options <br>
Select optional behaviors for particular modules. The
argument is a text string containing comma-separated
keywords and values. These are passed to the modules that
han&acirc; <br>
dle particular formats to control how those formats will
behave. Each option has one of the following forms: <br>
key=value <br>
The key will be set to the specified value in every module
that supports it. Modules that do not support this key will
ignore it. <br>
key The key will be enabled in every module that supports
it. This is equivalent to key=1. <br>
!key The key will be disabled in every module that supports
it. <br>
module:key=value, module:key, module:!key <br>
As above, but the corresponding key and value will be
provided only to modules whose name matches module. <br>
The currently supported modules and keys are: <br>
iso9660:joliet <br>
Support Joliet extensions. This is enabled by default, use
!joliet or iso9660:!joliet to disable. <br>
iso9660:rockridge <br>
Support Rock Ridge extensions. This is enabled by default,
use !rockridge or iso9660:!rockridge to disable. <br>
gzip:compression-level <br>
A decimal integer from 1 to 9 specifying the gzip
compression level. <br>
gzip:timestamp <br>
Store timestamp. This is enabled by default, use !timestamp
or gzip:!timestamp to disable. <br>
lrzip:compression=type <br>
Use type as compression method. Supported values are bzip2,
gzip, lzo (ultra fast), and zpaq (best, extremely slow).
<br>
lrzip:compression-level <br>
A decimal integer from 1 to 9 specifying the lrzip
compression level. <br>
lzop:compression-level <br>
A decimal integer from 1 to 9 specifying the lzop
compression level. <br>
xz:compression-level <br>
A decimal integer from 0 to 9 specifying the xz compression
level. <br>
mtree:keyword <br>
The mtree writer module allows you to specify which mtree
keywords will be included in the output. Supported keywords
include: cksum, device, flags, gid, gname, <br>
indent, link, md5, mode, nlink, rmd160, sha1, sha256,
sha384, sha512, size, time, uid, uname. The default is
equivalent to: &acirc;device, flags, gid, gname, link, mode,
<br>
nlink, size, time, type, uid, uname&acirc;. <br>
mtree:all <br>
Enables all of the above keywords. You can also use
mtree:!all to disable all keywords. <br>
mtree:use-set <br>
Enable generation of /set lines in the output. <br>
mtree:indent <br>
Produce human-readable output by indenting options and
splitting lines to fit into 80 columns. <br>
zip:compression=type <br>
Use type as compression method. Supported values are store
(uncompressed) and deflate (gzip algorithm). <br>
If a provided option is not supported by any module, that is
a fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --absolute-paths <br>
Preserve pathnames. By default, absolute pathnames (those
that begin with a / character) have the leading slash
removed both when creating archives and extracting from <br>
them. Also, tar will refuse to extract archive entries whose
pathnames contain .. or whose target directory would be
altered by a symlink. This option suppresses these <br>
behaviors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --insecure,
--preserve-permissions <br>
(x mode only) Preserve file permissions. Attempt to restore
the full permissions, including owner, file modes, file
flags and ACLs, if available, for each item extracted <br>
from the archive. This is the default, if tar is being run
by root and can be overridden by also specifying
--no-same-owner and --no-same-permissions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--posix <br>
(c, r, u mode only) Synonym for --format pax</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --fast-read <br>
(x and t mode only) Extract or list only the first archive
entry that matches each pattern or filename operand. Exit as
soon as each specified pattern or filename has been <br>
matched. By default, the archive is always read to the very
end, since there can be multiple entries with the same name
and, by convention, later entries overwrite earlier <br>
entries. This option is provided as a performance
optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S (x mode only) Extract files
as sparse files. For every block on disk, check first if it
contains only NULL bytes and seek over it otherwise. This
works similar to the <br>
conv=sparse option of dd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s pattern <br>
Modify file or archive member names according to pattern.
The pattern has the format /old/new/[ghHprRsS] where old is
a basic regular expression, new is the replacement <br>
string of the matched part, and the optional trailing
letters modify how the replacement is handled. If old is not
matched, the pattern is skipped. Within new, ~ is sub&acirc;
<br>
stituted with the match, 1 to 9 with the content of the
corresponding captured group. The optional trailing g
specifies that matching should continue after the matched
<br>
part and stop on the first unmatched pattern. The optional
trailing s specifies that the pattern applies to the value
of symbolic links. The optional trailing p specifies <br>
that after a successful substitution the original path name
and the new path name should be printed to standard error.
Optional trailing H, R, or S characters suppress <br>
substitutions for hardlink targets, regular filenames, or
symlink targets, respectively. Optional trailing h, r, or s
characters enable substitutions for hardlink targets, <br>
regular filenames, or symlink targets, respectively. The
default is hrs which applies substitutions to all names. In
particular, it is never necessary to specify h, r, or <br>
s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--same-owner <br>
(x mode only) Extract owner and group IDs. This is the
reverse of --no-same-owner and the default behavior if tar
is run as root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--strip-components count <br>
Remove the specified number of leading path elements.
Pathnames with fewer elements will be silently skipped. Note
that the pathname is edited after checking inclu&acirc; <br>
sion/exclusion patterns but before security checks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T filename, --files-from
filename <br>
In x or t mode, tar will read the list of names to be
extracted from filename. In c mode, tar will read names to
be archived from filename. The special name &acirc;-C&acirc;
on a <br>
line by itself will cause the current directory to be
changed to the directory specified on the following line.
Names are terminated by newlines unless --null is
speci&acirc; <br>
fied. Note that --null also disables the special handling of
lines containing &acirc;-C&acirc;. Note: If you are
generating lists of files using find(1), you probably want
to use -n <br>
as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--totals <br>
(c, r, u mode only) After archiving all files, print a
summary to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U, --unlink, --unlink-first
<br>
(x mode only) Unlink files before creating them. This can be
a minor performance optimization if most files already
exist, but can make things slower if most files do not <br>
already exist. This flag also causes tar to remove
intervening directory symlinks instead of reporting an
error. See the SECURITY section below for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--uid id <br>
Use the provided user id number and ignore the user name
from the archive. On create, if --uname is not also
specified, the user name will be set to match the user
id.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--uname name <br>
Use the provided user name. On extract, this overrides the
user name in the archive; if the provided user name does not
exist on the system, it will be ignored and the <br>
user id (from the archive or from the --uid option) will be
used instead. On create, this sets the user name that will
be stored in the archive; the name is not verified <br>
against the system user database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-compress-program program
<br>
Pipe the input (in x or t mode) or the output (in c mode)
through program instead of using the builtin compression
support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Produce verbose output. In create and extract modes, tar
will list each file name as it is read from or written to
the archive. In list mode, tar will produce output
sim&acirc; <br>
ilar to that of ls(1). Additional -v options will provide
additional detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print version of tar and libarchive, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --confirmation,
--interactive <br>
Ask for confirmation for every action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X filename, --exclude-from
filename <br>
Read a list of exclusion patterns from the specified file.
See --exclude for more information about the handling of
exclusions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y (c mode only) Compress the
resulting archive with bzip2(1). In extract or list modes,
this option is ignored. Note that, unlike other tar
implementations, this implemen&acirc; <br>
tation recognizes bzip2 compression automatically when
reading archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z, --compress, --uncompress
<br>
(c mode only) Compress the resulting archive with
compress(1). In extract or list modes, this option is
ignored. Note that, unlike other tar implementations, this
imple&acirc; <br>
mentation recognizes compress compression automatically when
reading archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --gunzip, --gzip <br>
(c mode only) Compress the resulting archive with gzip(1).
In extract or list modes, this option is ignored. Note that,
unlike other tar implementations, this implementa&acirc;
<br>
tion recognizes gzip compression automatically when reading
archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The following environment variables affect the execution of
tar:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TAR_READER_OPTIONS <br>
The default options for format readers and compression
readers. The --options option overrides this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TAR_WRITER_OPTIONS <br>

or more traditionally <br>
cd srcdir ; tar -cf - . | (cd destdir ; tar -xpf -)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In create mode, the list of
files and directories to be archived can also include
directory change instructions of the form -Cfoo/baz and
archive inclusions of the form <br>
@archive-file. For example, the command line <br>
tar -c -f new.tar foo1 @old.tgz -C/tmp foo2 <br>
will create a new archive new.tar. tar will read the file
foo1 from the current directory and add it to the output
archive. It will then read each entry from old.tgz and add
<br>
those entries to the output archive. Finally, it will switch
to the /tmp directory and add foo2 to the output
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An input file in mtree(5) format
can be used to create an output archive with arbitrary
ownership, permissions, or names that differ from existing
data on disk:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ cat input.mtree <br>
#mtree <br>
usr/bin uid=0 gid=0 mode=0755 type=dir <br>
usr/bin/ls uid=0 gid=0 mode=0755 type=file content=myls <br>
$ tar -cvf output.tar @input.mtree</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --newer and --newer-mtime
switches accept a variety of common date and time
specifications, including &acirc;12 Mar 2005
7:14:29pm&acirc;, &acirc;2005-03-12 19:14&acirc;, &acirc;5
minutes ago&acirc;, and &acirc;19:14 <br>
PST May 1&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --options argument can be
used to control various details of archive generation or
reading. For example, you can generate mtree output which
only contains type, time, and uid <br>
keywords: <br>
tar -cf file.tar --format=mtree
--options=&rsquo;!all,type,time,uid&rsquo; dir <br>
or you can set the compression level used by gzip or xz
compression: <br>
tar -czf file.tar
--options=&rsquo;compression-level=9&rsquo;. <br>
For more details, see the explanation of the
archive_read_set_options() and archive_write_set_options()
API calls that are described in archive_read(3) and
archive_write(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY <br>
The bundled-arguments format is supported for compatibility
with historic implementations. It consists of an initial
word (with no leading - character) in which each character
<br>
indicates an option. Arguments follow as separate words. The
order of the arguments must match the order of the
corresponding characters in the bundled command word. For
exam&acirc; <br>
ple, <br>
tar tbf 32 file.tar <br>
specifies three flags t, b, and f. The b and f flags both
require arguments, so there must be two additional items on
the command line. The 32 is the argument to the b flag, and
<br>
file.tar is the argument to the f flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mode options c, r, t, u, and
x and the options b, f, l, m, o, v, and w comply with
SUSv2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For maximum portability, scripts
that invoke tar should use the bundled-argument format
above, should limit themselves to the c, t, and x modes, and
the b, f, m, v, and w options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional long options are
provided to improve compatibility with other tar
implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
Certain security issues are common to many archiving
programs, including tar. In particular, carefully-crafted
archives can request that tar extract files to locations
outside of <br>
the target directory. This can potentially be used to cause
unwitting users to overwrite files they did not intend to
overwrite. If the archive is being extracted by the
supe&acirc; <br>
ruser, any file on the system can potentially be
overwritten. There are three ways this can happen. Although
tar has mechanisms to protect against each one, savvy users
should be <br>
aware of the implications:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Archive entries
can have absolute pathnames. By default, tar removes the
leading / character from filenames before restoring them to
guard against this problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Archive entries
can have pathnames that include .. components. By default,
tar will not extract files containing .. components in their
pathname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Archive entries
can exploit symbolic links to restore files to other
directories. An archive can restore a symbolic link to
another directory, then use that link to <br>
restore a file into that directory. To guard against this,
tar checks each extracted path for symlinks. If the final
path element is a symlink, it will be removed and <br>
replaced with the archive entry. If -U is specified, any
intermediate symlink will also be unconditionally removed.
If neither -U nor -P is specified, tar will refuse to <br>
extract the entry. <br>
To protect yourself, you should be wary of any archives that
come from untrusted sources. You should examine the contents
of an archive with <br>
tar -tf filename <br>
before extraction. You should use the -k option to ensure
that tar will not overwrite any existing files or the -U
option to remove any pre-existing files. You should
generally <br>
not extract archives while running with super-user
privileges. Note that the -P option to tar disables the
security checks above and allows you to extract an archive
while pre&acirc; <br>
serving any absolute pathnames, .. components, or symlinks
to other directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARDS <br>
There is no current POSIX standard for the tar command; it
appeared in ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996 (&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;) but
was dropped from IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
(&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;). The options supported <br>
by this implementation were developed by surveying a number
of existing tar implementations as well as the old POSIX
specification for tar and the current POSIX specification
for <br>
pax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ustar and pax interchange
file formats are defined by IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
(&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;) for the pax command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
A tar command appeared in Seventh Edition Unix, which was
released in January, 1979. There have been numerous other
implementations, many of which extended the file format.
John <br>
Gilmore&rsquo;s pdtar public-domain implementation (circa
November, 1987) was quite influential, and formed the basis
of GNU tar. GNU tar was included as the standard system tar
in <br>
FreeBSD beginning with FreeBSD 1.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a complete
re-implementation based on the libarchive(3) library. It was
first released with FreeBSD 5.4 in May, 2005.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
This program follows ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996
(&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;) for the definition of the -l option.
Note that GNU tar prior to version 1.15 treated -l as a
synonym for the --one-file-system <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -C dir option may differ
from historic implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All archive output is written in
correctly-sized blocks, even if the output is being
compressed. Whether or not the last output block is padded
to a full block size varies depend&acirc; <br>
ing on the format and the output device. For tar and cpio
formats, the last block of output is padded to a full block
size if the output is being written to standard output or to
<br>
a character or block device such as a tape drive. If the
output is being written to a regular file, the last block
will not be padded. Many compressors, including gzip(1) and
<br>
bzip2(1), complain about the null padding when decompressing
an archive created by tar, although they still extract it
correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compression and
decompression is implemented internally, so there may be
insignificant differences between the compressed output
generated by <br>
tar -czf - file <br>
and that generated by <br>
tar -cf - file | gzip</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default should be to read
and write archives to the standard I/O paths, but tradition
(and POSIX) dictates otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The r and u modes require that
the archive be uncompressed and located in a regular file on
disk. Other archives can be modified using c mode with the
@archive-file extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To archive a file called @foo or
-foo you must specify it as ./@foo or ./-foo,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In create mode, a leading ./ is
always removed. A leading / is stripped unless the -P option
is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There needs to be better support
for file selection on both create and extract.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is not yet any support for
multi-volume archives or for archiving sparse files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Converting between dissimilar
archive formats (such as tar and cpio) using the @-
convention can cause hard link information to be lost. (This
is a consequence of the incompatible <br>
ways that different archive formats store hardlink
information.)</p>
