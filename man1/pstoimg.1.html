<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The command line options may be abbreviated to the shortest
unique prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help <br>
Show this help page and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Show the release and version of pstoimg and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-antialias <br>
Use Ghostscript&rsquo;s anti-aliasing feature for rendering
&quot;softer&quot; images. This applies to lines and edges
of polygonal and oval or circular shapes. Only valid if
Ghostscipt <br>
4.03 or higher is installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-aaliastext <br>
Use Ghostscript&rsquo;s anti-aliasing feature for
&quot;smoother&quot; font characters, without the jagged
edges. Similar to -antialias for graphic components. Only
valid if Ghostscipt 4.03 <br>
or higher is installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-center num <br>
Add the appropriate amount of whitespace to the left of the
image so that the image appears to be centered in a total
width of num pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-crop code <br>
Crop the bitmap from the given directions. code may be a
string of several cropping instructions, which are executed
strictly in the given order. Possible values are: h
(hor&acirc; <br>
izontal, i.e. crop top and bottom), v (vertical), tblr (top,
bottom, left, right) and a (all directions). A special case
is s: &quot;shave&quot; the image at the bottom, but only if
a <br>
single line of whitespace exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-debug <br>
Turn on debugging output. This can get rather verbose. Any
intermediate files generated are not removed to help
debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-density num <br>
The density (resolution) in DPI in which to render the
bitmap. The default is 72.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-depth num or -color num <br>
Specify the color depth of the bitmap. Legal values are 1
(black &amp; white), 8 (256 colors) and 24 (true color).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-discard <br>
Delete the input postscript file if the conversion was
successful. Setting the environment DISCARD to a true value
(as perl sees it) has the same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flip code <br>
Flip all generated output bitmaps. The following codes are
recognized: lr (flip left-right), tb (flip top-bottom), xy
(flip bottom/left-top/right), r90 and ccw (rotate by 90 <br>
degrees counterclockwise), r270 and cw (rotate 90 degrees
clockwise) and r180 (rotate 180 degrees).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-geometry XxY <br>
Render only this &quot;window&quot; of the PostScript file.
If given, this option can dramatically reduce memory
requirements and speed up conversion. The geometry is
automatically <br>
detected in case of EPS files (Encapsulated PostScript).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-interlaced <br>
Generate an interlaced bitmap. Interlaced images build up
from coarse to fine as they are loaded. This option may not
work on every installation and/or bitmap type, depending
<br>
of the capabilities of external programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-margins X,Y <br>
The offset of the rectangle in the postscript file that is
going to be rendered from top/left. Can be used together
with -geometry to further reduce the size of the
interme&acirc; <br>
diate bitmap file generated by Ghostscript.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-multipage <br>
Process a multi-page PostScript file, i.e. create an
individual bitmap for every page. The resulting files are
numbered: The decimal number (starting with 1) is appended
to <br>
the basename of the PostScript input file (or the basename
of the filename specified with -out), while keeping the
extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-out file <br>
The file where to write the bitmap. If multiple PostScript
files are supplied on the command line, this option is
ignored. The bitmap type extension is appended automatically
<br>
if file does not contain a dot. In connection with
-multipage file is extended by the page number as shown in
this example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-outfile foo.gif --------&gt;
foo1.gif, foo2.gif, ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quiet <br>
Do not print anything except error messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rightjustify num <br>
Add the appropriate amount of whitespace to the left of the
image so that it appears to be aligned to the right in a
total width of num pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-scale factor <br>
Scale the image by factor. Valid choices are any numbers
greater than zero. Useful choices are numbers between 0.1 -
5. Large numbers may generate very large intermediate <br>
files and will take longer to process. If this option is
omitted, the environment SCALE is considered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-shoreup num[d] <br>
Make height and width of the bitmap(s) an exact multiple of
num. If num is followed by a &quot;d&quot;, then half the
extra vertical space is placed underneath. This option is
useful, <br>
if you want to have &quot;blown-up&quot; images of high
quality for print, but downscale them in HTML using
&quot;&lt;IMG WIDTH=x HEIGHT=y&gt;&quot;. If the actual
image is is not an integer multiple <br>
of x,y then browsers tend to display distorted images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tmp path <br>
Use path to store temporary files. Defaults to /tmp on this
installation. This parameter can be set by the environment
TMP or TEMP, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-topjustify [x]num <br>
Add padding whitespace to the image so that it gets a
defined height. If an integer value is given, it defines the
total height. The whitespace is added at the bottom. If <br>
the number is preceded by &quot;x&quot;, then this multiple
of the image height is added as whitespace at the
bottom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-transparent <br>
Generate transparent bitmaps, i.e. the background color
(white) is transparent if viewed with certain viewers (e.g.
browsers). This option may not be available due to missing
<br>
capabilities of external programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-type type <br>
Instruct pstoimg to render the bitmap in type format.
Depending on the local installation, pstoimg is capable of
generating either GIF or PNG bitmaps. This site features the
<br>
following types: png gif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If omitted, the first type in
this list is taken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-white <br>
Remove TeX&rsquo;s page color information from the
PostScript file before converting so that a white background
is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pstoimg iterates over the given input files and runs them
through Ghostscipt. The resulting pnm (portable anymap
files) are processed with different Netpbm tools (cropping,
color <br>
mapping, aligning, ...) and finally converted into
(currently) either GIF or PNG format. The bitmaps can now be
included e.g. in WWW pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PostScript file is converted
as is. If a valid bounding box is found (EPS format), then
only this area is converted. The image is not cropped by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUE <br>
0 if everything went all right</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x (x != 0) something went wrong.
See the message output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
&quot;pstoimg foo.ps&quot; <br>
Convert the first page of foo.ps to the default bitmap
type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;pstoimg -type png -crop a
-trans -interlace foo.ps&quot; <br>
Same as above, but force png output and crop all the
whitespace around the image and make the color white
transparent and generate an interlaced bitmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;pstoimg -multi -out bar
-type gif -crop a foo.ps&quot; <br>
Consider foo.ps a multiple page PostScript file and create
output files bar1.gif, bar2.gif, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DENSITY, DEPTH, DEBUG, DISCARD <br>
See -density, -depth, -debug, -discard, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GS_LIB <br>
This variable is set to the path(s) where Ghostscript
libraries have been found on this system during
configuration, but only if the built-in paths are not
correct. This <br>
fixes the problem of relocation that is quite common on
Win32 installations. This behavior can be overridden by
setting GS_LIB manually before starting pstoimg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LATEX2HTMLDIR <br>
The directory where the LaTeX2HTML library and perl modules
are found. Defaults to &quot;/usr/share/latex2html&quot; on
this installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTFILE <br>
Setting this has the same effect as specifying -out. Please
do not rely on this feature any more, it will disappear from
the next releases!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAPERSIZE <br>
The papersize to use by Ghostscript to render the image.
pstoimg tries hard to optimize for rendering on the smallest
possible bitmap size. Still this option is there to <br>
enable tuning by hand, although it is deprecated. If pstoimg
finds a better setting, this parameter is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCALE <br>
See the discussion of -scale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMP and TEMP <br>
Unless overridden by -tmp, these variables denote a
directory where to store temporary files. TMP is considered
first, then TEMP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
gs, pnmcrop, pnmquant, pbmmake, pnmcat, pnmfile, pnmflip,
ppmtogif, pnmtopng, giftool, giftrans.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Several people have suggested to use ImageMagick&rsquo;s
convert instead of pstoimg. A few comments on this: convert
uses (of course) Ghostscript for conversion of PostScript to
bit&acirc; <br>
map, so one still needs gs. And for the special requirements
of LaTeX2HTML convert&rsquo;s features are not sufficient.
The ImageMagick toolset has everything in place, but it has
some <br>
overhead that can prove killing when processing some 100
images. pstoimg only does what it really has to, so it
should be quite efficient. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong - I like
ImageMag&acirc; <br>
ick, but not in the context of LaTeX2HTML.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
This utility is automatically configured and built to work
on the local setup. If this setup changes (e.g. some of the
external commands are moved), the script has be be
recon&acirc; <br>
figured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Despite the portability of perl,
a pstoimg configured on UNIX will probably not work on Win32
and vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
This is a major enhancement release, so there may be a few
bugs. As the user inteface changed a bit, some of your tools
that were using pstoimg may not work any more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please report bugs to
latex2html@tug.org, stating the (debug) output of pstoimg,
your perl version and the versions of the external tools.
Best is to include the cfgcache.pm <br>
file from the configuration procedure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
This script went through a long evolution, beginning with a
modification of Doug Crabill&rsquo;s
&lt;dgc@cs.purdue.edu&gt; ps2epsi script. The first perl
version was done by Nikos Drakos <br>
&lt;nikos@cbl.leeds.ac.uk&gt;. It was gradually improved by
numerous LaTeX2HTML developers: Ross Moore
&lt;ross@mpce.mq.edu.au&gt;, Jens Lippmann
&lt;lippmann@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de&gt; <br>
and others (sorry for not mentioning everyone and thanks for
your contributions).</p>
