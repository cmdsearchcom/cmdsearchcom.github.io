ECaccess Tools (ECTools) - The ECaccess Tools gives Member States (in the
  following &quot;Member States&quot; (MS) includes &quot;Co-operating
  States&quot;) and other ECMWF users batch access to the ECMWF computing and
  archiving facilities for the management of files, file transfers and jobs.
  Access is available via the Internet as well as via RMDCN.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="ECaccess_Certificate"><a class="selflink" href="#ECaccess_Certificate">ECaccess
  Certificate</a></h2>
Using the ECaccess Tools requires a valid ECaccess Certificate.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The ECaccess Certificate is a standard X509 digital Certificate saved on the
  user's computer as a file. It identifies a user to the ECaccess Gateway. The
  ECaccess Certification Authority (ECCA) signs each Certificate. Therefore,
  when a user provides his Certificate to the gateway, its signature is checked
  using the ECCA public key for verification.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The ECaccess certificate is by default valid for 7 days for all services.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The ECaccess Tools are also available at ECMWF. As you have already been
  validated to enter ECMWF, you will not need a Certificate when using these
  ECaccess shell commands localy.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Creating_a_Certificate"><a class="selflink" href="#Creating_a_Certificate">Creating
  a Certificate</a></h2>
The ECaccess Certificate must be stored in the &quot;$HOME/.eccert.crt&quot;
  file and can be created with one of the following method (both methods
  requires an ECMWF user identifier and token PASSCODE):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Using the &quot;ecaccess-certificate-create&quot; command:</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Please refer to the man page of the command for more details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Using the Web interface:</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Login to the Web server and in the menu click the &quot;Get Certificate&quot;
  option to download the new ECaccess Certificate.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ECACCESS_FILE_SYSTEM"><a class="selflink" href="#ECACCESS_FILE_SYSTEM">ECACCESS
  FILE SYSTEM</a></h1>
When accessing FILEs at ECMWF through the ECtools, the following domains are
  available:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   HOME: the $HOME directory (home:)
   SCRATCH: the $SCRATCH directory (scratch:)
   ECFS: the ECFS directory (ec:)
   ECTMP: the ECTMP directory (ectmp:)
   HOST: any server at ECMWF ({host-name}:)
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Path"><a class="selflink" href="#Path">Path</a></h2>
The format of the path is the following: &quot;[domain:][/user-id/]path&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
If no user-id is specified then the current user-id is selected by default. The
  user-id parameter is not valid with the HOST domain.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If no domain is specified then an absolute path will translate to an absolute
  path on the ecgate server and a relative path will translate to a path in the
  HOME directory of the current user.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Exemples"><a class="selflink" href="#Exemples">Exemples</a></h2>
<pre>
   &quot;bin/a.out&quot;                           a.out file in the $HOME/bin directory of the current user
   &quot;home:bin/a.out&quot;                      a.out file in the $HOME/bin directory of the current user
   &quot;/tmp/a.out&quot;                          a.out file in the /tmp directory on ecgate

   &quot;ec:bin/a.out&quot;                        a.out file in the ECFS bin directory of the current user

In the DESCRIPTION section you will find the FILEs commands which can be used to
  manage the files at ECMWF. Whenever a parameter or an option refer to an
  ECaccess File then the &quot;[domain:][/user-id/]path&quot; syntax apply.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ECTRANS"><a class="selflink" href="#ECTRANS">ECTRANS</a></h1>
ECtrans refers to unattended file transfers initiated from ECMWF.
<div class="Pp"></div>
ECtrans allows transfering files between ECMWF and remote sites. Like the UNIX
  &quot;rcp&quot; command, ECtrans requires no password to be specified on the
  command line for the remote host: the ECaccess gateway performs the security
  checking. Unlike standard FTP, ECtrans is suitable for unattended file
  transfers in scripts, cron jobs, etc., as it avoids the problems inherent in
  storing passwords in text files and sending passwords across networks.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Even if you don't have a local gateway installed, you can benefit from ECtrans
  by using the ECMWF ECaccess gateway. Please note that in this case the
  transfer is not as secured as when a Member State ECaccess gateway is used.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Target_location"><a class="selflink" href="#Target_location">Target
  location</a></h2>
Users who wish to transfer files between ECMWF and Member State servers need to
  declare one or more remote Member State users (msuser association) for the
  storage/retrieval of the remote file. This can be done through the ECaccess
  Web interface of the target gateway. For every &quot;msuser&quot; declaration,
  the hostname and the login username and password need to be specified.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After the ECaccess gateway installation, the Member State ECaccess system
  administrator can customise the access methods for file transfers. These will
  be displayed through the ECaccess Web interface. Several schemes can be
  implemented, such as:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>1</b> - The target directory for a particular destination is a sub-directory
  of a central directory configured by the administrator, with the sub-directory
  name matching the msuser name. <b>2</b> - The target directory for all file
  transfers to a given destination is a sub-directory of the msusers home
  directory. The administrator configures the sub-directory name. <b>3</b> - The
  target directory for a given destination is configurable by the user. The
  administrator determines whether or not the user is allowed to include
  &quot;..&quot; in the directory path.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Target directories can be located on:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>1</b> - Member State servers running a standard FTP service accessible from
  the ECaccess gateway. This is known as a &quot;genericFtp&quot; destination
  and is the most convenient way of getting the files to the system you want,
  under the specified user ID. <b>2</b> - The server running the ECaccess
  gateway. This is known as a &quot;genericFile&quot; destination. All users
  will share in a common directory the files transferred using this destination.
  <b>3</b> - Member State servers running a proprietary application. The
  administrator provides ectrans with the implementation of the access protocol.
  The administrator can also use more complex rules to define special target
  locations for ECMWF users, Member State users or groups of Member State users.
  The command &quot;ectinfo&quot; described in the next section can be used to
  get the translated URL of a target location, giving a Member State user
  identifier and a destination name (passwords are displayed as ***).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Commands"><a class="selflink" href="#Commands">Commands</a></h2>
In the DESCRIPTION section you will find the ECtrans Association and Transfer
  Management commands which can be used to manage the ECtrans Associations and
  associated Transfers.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EVENTS"><a class="selflink" href="#EVENTS">EVENTS</a></h1>
ECMWF maintains some notifications (events) which are linked to ECMWF's
  operational activity and offers the service for time-critical jobs. This
  service is also available to MS users who maintain their own notifications and
  can therefore create simple dependencies between different activities, at
  ECMWF and remote sites.

In the DESCRIPTION section you will find the Events Management commands which
  can be used to manage such Events.

The ECaccess Tools are organized under nine categories covering access to the
  whole computing and archiving facilities of ECMWF. Each command is documented
  with its own man page which provide explanation as well as examples on how to
  use it.
