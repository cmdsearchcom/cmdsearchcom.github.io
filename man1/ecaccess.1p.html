<p>ECACCESS(1p) User Contributed Perl Documentation
ECACCESS(1p)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ECaccess Tools (ECTools) - The ECaccess Tools gives Member
States (in the following &quot;Member States&quot; (MS)
includes &quot;Co-operating States&quot;) and other ECMWF
users batch access to the <br>
ECMWF computing and archiving facilities for the management
of files, file transfers and jobs. Access is available via
the Internet as well as via RMDCN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHENTICATION <br>
ECaccess Certificate <br>
Using the ECaccess Tools requires a valid ECaccess
Certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ECaccess Certificate is a
standard X509 digital Certificate saved on the user&rsquo;s
computer as a file. It identifies a user to the ECaccess
Gateway. The ECaccess Certification <br>
Authority (ECCA) signs each Certificate. Therefore, when a
user provides his Certificate to the gateway, its signature
is checked using the ECCA public key for verification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ECaccess certificate is by
default valid for 7 days for all services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ECaccess Tools are also
available at ECMWF. As you have already been validated to
enter ECMWF, you will not need a Certificate when using
these ECaccess shell commands <br>
localy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Creating a Certificate <br>
The ECaccess Certificate must be stored in the
&quot;$HOME/.eccert.crt&quot; file and can be created with
one of the following method (both methods requires an ECMWF
user identifier and <br>
token PASSCODE):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the
&quot;ecaccess-certificate-create&quot; command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please refer to the man page of
the command for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the Web interface:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Login to the Web server and in
the menu click the &quot;Get Certificate&quot; option to
download the new ECaccess Certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ECACCESS FILE SYSTEM <br>
When accessing FILEs at ECMWF through the ECtools, the
following domains are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME: the $HOME directory
(home:) <br>
SCRATCH: the $SCRATCH directory (scratch:) <br>
ECFS: the ECFS directory (ec:) <br>
ECTMP: the ECTMP directory (ectmp:) <br>
HOST: any server at ECMWF ({host-name}:)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Path <br>
The format of the path is the following:
&quot;[domain:][/user-id/]path&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no user-id is specified then
the current user-id is selected by default. The user-id
parameter is not valid with the HOST domain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no domain is specified then
an absolute path will translate to an absolute path on the
ecgate server and a relative path will translate to a path
in the HOME directory of the <br>
current user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exemples <br>
&quot;bin/a.out&quot; a.out file in the $HOME/bin directory
of the current user <br>
&quot;home:bin/a.out&quot; a.out file in the $HOME/bin
directory of the current user <br>
&quot;/tmp/a.out&quot; a.out file in the /tmp directory on
ecgate <br>
&quot;home:/xyz/bin/a.out&quot; a.out file in the $HOME/bin
directory of user xyz <br>
&quot;ec:bin/a.out&quot; a.out file in the ECFS bin
directory of the current user <br>
&quot;ec:/xyz/bin/a.out&quot; a.out file in the ECFS bin
directory of user xyz <br>
&quot;c1a:/c1a/tmp/systems/xyz/a.out&quot; a.out file in the
/c1a/tmp/systems/xyz/ directory of c1a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands <br>
In the DESCRIPTION section you will find the FILEs commands
which can be used to manage the files at ECMWF. Whenever a
parameter or an option refer to an ECaccess File then the
<br>
&quot;[domain:][/user-id/]path&quot; syntax apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ECTRANS <br>
ECtrans refers to unattended file transfers initiated from
ECMWF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ECtrans allows transfering files
between ECMWF and remote sites. Like the UNIX
&quot;rcp&quot; command, ECtrans requires no password to be
specified on the command line for the remote <br>
host: the ECaccess gateway performs the security checking.
Unlike standard FTP, ECtrans is suitable for unattended file
transfers in scripts, cron jobs, etc., as it avoids the <br>
problems inherent in storing passwords in text files and
sending passwords across networks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even if you don&rsquo;t have a
local gateway installed, you can benefit from ECtrans by
using the ECMWF ECaccess gateway. Please note that in this
case the transfer is not as secured <br>
as when a Member State ECaccess gateway is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Target location <br>
Users who wish to transfer files between ECMWF and Member
State servers need to declare one or more remote Member
State users (msuser association) for the storage/retrieval
of <br>
the remote file. This can be done through the ECaccess Web
interface of the target gateway. For every
&quot;msuser&quot; declaration, the hostname and the login
username and password need <br>
to be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the ECaccess gateway
installation, the Member State ECaccess system administrator
can customise the access methods for file transfers. These
will be displayed through the <br>
ECaccess Web interface. Several schemes can be implemented,
such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 - The target directory for a
particular destination is a sub-directory of a central
directory configured by the administrator, with the
sub-directory name matching the msuser <br>
name. 2 - The target directory for all file transfers to a
given destination is a sub-directory of the msusers home
directory. The administrator configures the sub-directory
<br>
name. 3 - The target directory for a given destination is
configurable by the user. The administrator determines
whether or not the user is allowed to include &quot;..&quot;
in the <br>
directory path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Target directories can be
located on:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 - Member State servers running
a standard FTP service accessible from the ECaccess gateway.
This is known as a &quot;genericFtp&quot; destination and is
the most convenient way of <br>
getting the files to the system you want, under the
specified user ID. 2 - The server running the ECaccess
gateway. This is known as a &quot;genericFile&quot;
destination. All users will <br>
share in a common directory the files transferred using this
destination. 3 - Member State servers running a proprietary
application. The administrator provides ectrans with the
<br>
implementation of the access protocol. The administrator can
also use more complex rules to define special target
locations for ECMWF users, Member State users or groups of
<br>
Member State users. The command &quot;ectinfo&quot;
described in the next section can be used to get the
translated URL of a target location, giving a Member State
user identifier and a <br>
destination name (passwords are displayed as ***).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands <br>
In the DESCRIPTION section you will find the ECtrans
Association and Transfer Management commands which can be
used to manage the ECtrans Associations and associated
Transfers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EVENTS <br>
ECMWF maintains some notifications (events) which are linked
to ECMWF&rsquo;s operational activity and offers the service
for time-critical jobs. This service is also available to MS
<br>
users who maintain their own notifications and can therefore
create simple dependencies between different activities, at
ECMWF and remote sites.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands <br>
In the DESCRIPTION section you will find the Events
Management commands which can be used to manage such
Events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ECaccess Tools are organized under nine categories
covering access to the whole computing and archiving
facilities of ECMWF. Each command is documented with its own
man page <br>
which provide explanation as well as examples on how to use
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are common
to all the ECtools:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help Print a brief help message
and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-manual Prints the manual page
and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-retry count <br>
Number of SSL connection retries per 5s to ECMWF. This
parameter only apply to the initial SSL connection initiated
by the command to the ECMWF server. It does not apply <br>
to all the subsequent requests made afteward as it is mainly
targeting errors that can happen from time to time during
the SSL handshake. Default is no retry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-debug Display the SOAP and SSL
messages exchanged.</p>
