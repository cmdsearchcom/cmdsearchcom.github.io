They say &quot;A picture is worth a thousand words&quot;. So let's draw your
  dependency or include graph from various viewpoints. Check out the gallery
  &lt;http://makepp.sourceforge.net/gallery/&gt; to get some ideas of what you
  can do.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each node represents a source file or a target, colored according to file name
  patterns. A file's node is rectangular. A phony target's node is oval. Each
  solid edge represents a direct dependency. Alternately or additionally you can
  display include relationships as dotted lines. For a more detailed but not so
  pretty textual view see makepplog.
<div class="Pp"></div>
But beware, even for a small build the complexity can be staggering! This is
  because with <i>.o</i> files and system includes you easily have twice as many
  nodes as source files. But that is nothing -- the number of edges often far
  exceeds that of nodes, due to multiple include statements. A crossing-free
  layout is usually impossible.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In real projects the complexity becomes insane. Techniques like template based
  source file generation, preprocessors (e.g. embedded SQL, interface definition
  languages, Qt library) or publishing of files to central directories (e.g. to
  have only one &quot;-I&quot; or &quot;-L&quot; option) make the graph explode.
  Even if edges are just one pixel wide, you end up with broad black stripes of
  criss-crossing edges.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once you realize what really goes on, if you're lucky, you may be able to find a
  way of simplifying your build setup. But before you get there, you must
  drastically reduce the amount of information you display. To that end there
  are various selection, renaming and merging possibilities in
  &quot;makeppgraph&quot;. When you fail to strike a balance between reducing
  the graph so far that it becomes sensibly displayable, while still showing
  what you want to see, you may fall back to a textual graph.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OUTPUT_FORMATS"><a class="selflink" href="#OUTPUT_FORMATS">OUTPUT
  FORMATS</a></h1>
Graph layouting, display and manipulation are complex tasks, which are beyond
  the scope of &quot;makeppgraph&quot;. Instead it produces input files for
  specialized tools. It creates an output file replacing or adding the
  appropriate suffix to its first input file. If that is <i>.makepp/log</i>, the
  default, the output file will skip the <i>.makepp</i> directory, leading to
  <i>log.udg</i>. If the first input is <i>-</i> (stdin), the output goes to
  stdout.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="uDraw(Graph)"><a class="selflink" href="#uDraw(Graph)">uDraw(Graph)</a></h2>
With uDraw(Graph) &lt;http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uDrawGraph/&gt; you
  get a fairly modern GUI, which allows to select parents or children, find the
  other end of an edge, or hide subgraphs. Tweaking the options like the node
  distances, and using splines for edges can make the graph prettier.
<div class="Pp"></div>
While the above features make this a tremendously useful tool, there are a few
  small hitches:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">It is quite memory hungry, such that, after a longish
      meditation, it may crash without having displayed anything -- a clear sign
      that you must reduce the number of nodes and/or edges further.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">It strongly separates graph attributes and display options.
      This means that you can't put into a generated graph the fact that it is
      to be oriented sideways (which is generally necessary here because, even
      when renamed to something short, filenames are much wider than tall). As a
      workaround, if you don't want to make it your default, or choose
      orientation from the menu every time, they propose a little starter
      script:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    export UDG_HOME=/where/ever/uDrawGraph-3.1
    TMP=`mktemp -t udg.XXXXXX` || exit 1
    trap &quot;rm -f $TMP&quot; EXIT
    echo &quot;[menu(file(open_graph(\&quot;${1-log.udg}\&quot;))),menu(layout(orientation(left_right)))]&quot; &gt;$TMP
    $UDG_HOME/bin/uDrawGraph -init $TMP
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">It doesn't yet support node border colors. Due to this
      &quot;--because&quot; displays double borders when they should be
    red.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When merging several files into one node leads to self
      edges both with &quot;--dependencies&quot; and &quot;--includes&quot;,
      only one of these will be displayed, randomly dotted or drawn through and
      with a label of &quot;2*&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Graphviz"><a class="selflink" href="#Graphviz">Graphviz</a></h2>
Graphviz &lt;http://www.graphviz.org/&gt; consists of several command line
  tools, which allow many more export formats than uDraw(Graph). That includes
  not only static image formats but also input for designer programs like dia.
  There is a utility &quot;twopi&quot; for creating a radial layout, which is
  nice if your graph comes close to a true tree, i.e. your dependencies fan out,
  but few nodes have common dependencies with others. There are a few viewers
  available, none of which helps you to navigate along the structure of the
  graph:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">dotty</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Its own display tool, dotty, has the advantage over
      uDraw(Graph) that you can freely drag the nodes, without being restricted
      to the level assigned by the layout. When your screen is full of edges,
      dragging one node gives you a nice impression of where the edges of that
      node lead to. But it also loses information when you modify it. Apart from
      that it is an antiquated Xlib tool. It also displays an annoying little
      circle on the middle of each edge, and no option seems to get rid of
    it.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">ZGRViewer</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">ZGRViewer
      &lt;http://zvtm.sourceforge.net/zgrviewer.html&gt; is a separately
      downloadable Java viewer which has comfortable zooming and panning. The
      graph is only viewable, no moving of nodes. There are five buttons in the
      view area, which offer additional fancy semi-3D zoom variations, but,
      unlike the basic functionality, they can be extremely slow depending on
      your Java setup. For my Sun Linux Java, the following gave a tremendous
      boost:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    export J2D_PIXMAPS=shared USE_DGA_PIXMAPS=1
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Grappa</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Grappa is a separately downloadable Java 1.2 viewer. There
      is no wrapper shell script, the jar contains no manifest, none of the
      sources contain a main function, and with the appletviewer it produced two
      tall windows which hang with a &quot;starting applet&quot; message, so I
      don't know how to test this. It can be tried on a demo web site as an
      applet.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Selecting an edge makes it bold red, so you can manually scroll its other
      end into view without loosing it out of sight. Other than that and zooming
      and deleting nodes it seems to have no useful features. It ignores valid
      hexadecimal color specifications.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">SVG</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">SVG, one of the file types the backends can export to, is
      already quite old. But some browsers still have problems with it. When
      embedding it with an object tag only Opera scales it, others clip it,
      which is useless for a thumbnail. When viewed as a document of it's own,
      only Opera and Konqueror allow scaling it, while Firefox scales only the
      labels. Even though the labels are text, no browser can search for them.
      IE6 doesn't have a clue, unless you install a plugin. A dedicated
      application, like Inkscape, can serve you better.</dd>

This is a simple unordered list tree format that can be perused with any
  browser. You should have JavaScript and CSS, which allows folding subtrees and
  seeing colors. Usually your graph will not be a tree, which is worked around
  by repeating nodes in every subtree needed, but as a link to the first
  occurrence where you can see all its attributes. Due to IE's limited Unicode
  support, vertical arrows are used for include relations, instead of the usual
  dotted arrows.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Textual_Graph"><a class="selflink" href="#Textual_Graph">Textual
  Graph</a></h2>
This is a simple indentation-based format that can be perused with any text
  viewer. This means you can usually study much bigger graphs than with the
  other formats. In Emacs you can use outline and foldout for very powerful
  graph navigation with this little wrapper mode:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    (define-derived-mode textgraph-mode outline-mode &quot;Graph&quot;
      (view-mode)
      (set (make-local-variable 'outline-regexp) &quot; *.&quot;)
      (set (make-local-variable 'outline-level)
           (lambda () (/ (- (match-end 0) (match-beginning 0) -1) 2)))
      (set (make-local-variable 'outline-font-lock-keywords)
           '((&quot;^ *\\(?:{[a-z,]+} \\)?\\([^{\n]+\\)&quot; (1 (outline-font-lock-face) nil t))))
      (setq imenu-generic-expression
            '((nil &quot;^ *\\(?:{[a-z,]+} \\)?\\(.+?\\)\\(?:{[a-z,]+}\\)?$&quot; 1))))
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The lines can have comma separated annotations between braces, unless you also
  give the &quot;-p, --plain&quot; option. When these come before the target
  they pertain to the relationship with the parent, i.e. the previous line
  indented less. When they come after the target, they pertain to the target
  itself. They are as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">because</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When this comes before a target, the parent was built
      because of this one. When it comes after, the target had some inherent
      reason for being rebuilt.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">bidirectional</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This dependency or inclusion goes in both directions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">include</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The parent includes this file. This annotation is only
      given when also showing dependencies.</dd>
</dl>

  <dd class="It-tag">This is a phony target.</dd>
</dl>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
If you give no patterns, makeppgraph will start operating with all the nodes it
  can extract from makepp's log. When given one or more patterns (using
  &quot;?&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;**&quot; and/or &quot;[...]&quot;), it
  will match those in the file system and operate on any that also occur in the
  log. For these it will by default select &quot;upwards&quot;, i.e. all targets
  that depend on and/or include any of them and &quot;downwards&quot;, i.e. all
  targets and/or sources, which any of them depends on and/or includes. (The
  directions are metaphorical, because the graph is best displayed from left
  &quot;top&quot; to right &quot;bottom&quot; due to the width of the nodes.)

The techniques in this chapter are usually essential to get a reasonably sized
  graph. As they are formulated as Perl code, knowing the language is helpful.
  But you should be able to achieve quite a lot with the examples here or in the
  gallery &lt;http://makepp.sourceforge.net/gallery/&gt;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Renaming"><a class="selflink" href="#Renaming">Renaming</a></h2>
This is the first name rewriting that occurs, if the &quot;-r, --rename&quot;
  option is given. For every name encountered, perlcode gets called. It gets a
  filename in $_, and it may modify it. This is often needed, because makepp
  logs fully qualified file names, so one node can easily be half a screen wide.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For one thing, you can rewrite names to &quot;undef&quot; or the empty string.
  This will eliminate the node from the graph. Note that eliminating a node in
  this first stage will break a chain of dependency if this node was in the
  middle.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also rewrite various names to the same string, coercing them all into
  the same node, which accumulates the combined dependencies and dependents.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On the other hand you can just rename names to (usually) shorter names, so as to
  reduce the width of nodes, which can be far to wide with absolute filenames.
  There are a few predefined functions in package &quot;Mpp::Rewrite&quot;, in
  which your code also runs, you can use for this. These return true if they did
  something so you can combine them as in:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    --rename='cwd( 1 ) || &amp;home || &amp;usr'
</pre>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&amp;cwd</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">cwd <i>number</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">cwd <i>number, name[, separator]</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Removes the current working directory from the beginning of
      path. With a number, also replaces parent directories that many levels up
      with the right number of <i>../</i> directories, where applicable. In this
      case you can give an alternate <i>name</i>, like a piled up ':' instead of
      '..' and additionally an alternate <i>separator</i> like '' instead of
      '/'. In the first case you might get <i>:/:/a/b</i>, in the second an even
      shorter <i>::a/b</i> instead of <i>../../a/b</i>. Passing a number is
      useful if you draw in stuff from neighbouring trees. Or you have a
      <i>src</i> directory, where most of the action is, so you call makeppgraph
      there, but want to see the relation to your other directories too.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you give no &quot;--rename&quot; option, &amp;cwd is the default. Should
      you want no renaming, you can give some <i>perlcode</i> like
      &quot;--rename=1&quot; that does nothing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&amp;dir</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This one is a great reducer of graph complexity. It reduces
      every file to its directory. That amounts to the question: &quot;Files
      from which directory depend on files from which other directory?&quot;
      Note that while the dependency graph is always acyclic (else makepp
      wouldn't know where to start building), that is not true of this reduced
      view. E.g. if <i>dir1/a</i> depends on <i>dir2/b</i> and <i>dir2/a</i> on
      <i>dir1/b</i> that will display as a mutual dependency between <i>dir1</i>
      and <i>dir2</i>. Since a cyclic graph has no obvious starting point, the
      layout may be odd.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Unlike the other functions in this section, this is not exclusive with the
      others. So you may not want to logically combine it:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    --rename='&amp;dir; &amp;cwd || &amp;home'
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&amp;home</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Replaces your home directory with <i>~/</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&amp;makepp</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Replaces the makepp installation directory with
    <i>|m|</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&amp;suf</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">suf <i>number</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This one is also a great reducer of graph complexity. It
      reduces every file that has a suffix to an asterisk and that suffix. So
      you can see which kinds of files depend on which other kinds. With an
      argument of 0 it leaves the first character of the directory, provided it
      is one of &quot;/&quot;, &quot;~&quot; or &quot;|&quot; (as put in by
      &amp;home or &amp;usr if you called those first). With a positive
      argument, it leaves that many directory levels at the beginning. With a
      negative argument, it removes that many directory levels at the end. So
      for <i>/a/b/c/d/e/x.y</i> you get:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    &amp;suf        *.y
    suf 0       /*.y
    suf 1       /a/*.y
    suf 2       /a/b/*.y
    suf -1      /a/b/c/d/*.y
    suf -2      /a/b/c/*.y
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For a relative <i>a/b/c/d/e/x.y</i> you get:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    &amp;suf        *.y
    suf 0       *.y
    suf 1       a/*.y
    suf -1      a/b/c/d/*.y
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&amp;usr</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Under <i>/</i>, <i>/</i><b><i>u</i></b><i>sr</i>,
      <i>/</i><b><i>u</i></b><i>sr/</i><b><i>l</i></b><i>ocal</i>,
      <i>/</i><b><i>u</i></b><i>sr/</i><b><i>X</i></b><i>11</i>,

      concatenated between bars.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    E.g.
      <i>/</i><b><i>u</i></b><i>sr/</i><b><i>l</i></b><i>ocal/</i><b><i>b</i></b>
      <i>in/foobar</i> becomes <i>|ulb|foobar</i> or
      <i>/</i><b><i>u</i></b><i>sr/</i> <b><i>i</i></b><i>nclude/net/if.h</i>
      becomes <i>|ui|net/if.h</i>. Note that `l' stands for `local' when between
      two letters and for `lib' as the last letter.</dd>

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Merging"><a class="selflink" href="#Merging">Merging</a></h2>
This is the second name rewriting that occurs, if the &quot;-m, --merge&quot;
  option is given. This API is still under development! Currently the target is
  passed in $_ and the dependency as an argument. If perlcode returns a value,
  that value replaces both the target and the dependency, merging them into one
  node. A few predefined functions can help you:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">c2o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">For any C/C++ source and the resulting <i>.o</i> file,
      merge them into one node, by adding to the source path a suffix of
      &quot;&gt;o&quot; like <i>some/where/foo.cc&gt;o</i>, even if the
      <i>.o</i> file is in another directory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">exe</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">For any <i>.o</i> file and the resulting executable of the
      same notdir basename without a suffix or with <i>.exe</i>, merge them into
      one node, by adding an asterisk to the <i>.o</i> file. This will not
      currently work together with <i>c2o</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">x2</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">For any pair of files with the same name, usually a header
      or library published to a central directory, merge them into one node, by
      adding <i>*2</i> to the dependency.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
Makeppgraph looks at the following environment variable:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">$MAKEPPGRAPHFLAGS</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Any flags in this environment variable are interpreted as
      command line options before any explicit options. Quotes are interpreted
      like in makefiles.</dd>
