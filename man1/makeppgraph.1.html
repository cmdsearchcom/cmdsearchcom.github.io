<p style="margin-top: 1em">They say &quot;A picture is
worth a thousand words&quot;. So let&rsquo;s draw your
dependency or include graph from various viewpoints. Check
out the gallery <br>
&lt;http://makepp.sourceforge.net/gallery/&gt; to get some
ideas of what you can do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each node represents a source
file or a target, colored according to file name patterns. A
file&rsquo;s node is rectangular. A phony target&rsquo;s
node is oval. Each solid edge <br>
represents a direct dependency. Alternately or additionally
you can display include relationships as dotted lines. For a
more detailed but not so pretty textual view see <br>
makepplog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But beware, even for a small
build the complexity can be staggering! This is because with
.o files and system includes you easily have twice as many
nodes as source files. But <br>
that is nothing -- the number of edges often far exceeds
that of nodes, due to multiple include statements. A
crossing-free layout is usually impossible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In real projects the complexity
becomes insane. Techniques like template based source file
generation, preprocessors (e.g. embedded SQL, interface
definition languages, Qt <br>
library) or publishing of files to central directories (e.g.
to have only one &quot;-I&quot; or &quot;-L&quot; option)
make the graph explode. Even if edges are just one pixel
wide, you end up with <br>
broad black stripes of criss-crossing edges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you realize what really
goes on, if you&rsquo;re lucky, you may be able to find a
way of simplifying your build setup. But before you get
there, you must drastically reduce the <br>
amount of information you display. To that end there are
various selection, renaming and merging possibilities in
&quot;makeppgraph&quot;. When you fail to strike a balance
between <br>
reducing the graph so far that it becomes sensibly
displayable, while still showing what you want to see, you
may fall back to a textual graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FORMATS <br>
Graph layouting, display and manipulation are complex tasks,
which are beyond the scope of &quot;makeppgraph&quot;.
Instead it produces input files for specialized tools. It
creates an <br>
output file replacing or adding the appropriate suffix to
its first input file. If that is .makepp/log, the default,
the output file will skip the .makepp directory, leading to
<br>
log.udg. If the first input is - (stdin), the output goes to
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uDraw(Graph) <br>
With uDraw(Graph)
&lt;http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uDrawGraph/&gt; you
get a fairly modern GUI, which allows to select parents or
children, find the other end of an edge, or <br>
hide subgraphs. Tweaking the options like the node
distances, and using splines for edges can make the graph
prettier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While the above features make
this a tremendously useful tool, there are a few small
hitches:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It is quite
memory hungry, such that, after a longish meditation, it may
crash without having displayed anything -- a clear sign that
you must reduce the number of nodes <br>
and/or edges further.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It strongly
separates graph attributes and display options. This means
that you can&rsquo;t put into a generated graph the fact
that it is to be oriented sideways (which is <br>
generally necessary here because, even when renamed to
something short, filenames are much wider than tall). As a
workaround, if you don&rsquo;t want to make it your default,
or <br>
choose orientation from the menu every time, they propose a
little starter script:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export
UDG_HOME=/where/ever/uDrawGraph-3.1 <br>
TMP=&lsquo;mktemp -t udg.XXXXXX&lsquo; || exit 1 <br>
trap &quot;rm -f $TMP&quot; EXIT <br>
echo &quot;[menu(file(open_graph( <br>
$UDG_HOME/bin/uDrawGraph -init $TMP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It doesn&rsquo;t
yet support node border colors. Due to this
&quot;--because&quot; displays double borders when they
should be red.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When merging
several files into one node leads to self edges both with
&quot;--dependencies&quot; and &quot;--includes&quot;, only
one of these will be displayed, randomly dotted or drawn
<br>
through and with a label of &quot;2*&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Graphviz <br>
Graphviz &lt;http://www.graphviz.org/&gt; consists of
several command line tools, which allow many more export
formats than uDraw(Graph). That includes not only static
image formats <br>
but also input for designer programs like dia. There is a
utility &quot;twopi&quot; for creating a radial layout,
which is nice if your graph comes close to a true tree, i.e.
your <br>
dependencies fan out, but few nodes have common dependencies
with others. There are a few viewers available, none of
which helps you to navigate along the structure of the <br>
graph:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dotty <br>
Its own display tool, dotty, has the advantage over
uDraw(Graph) that you can freely drag the nodes, without
being restricted to the level assigned by the layout. When
your <br>
screen is full of edges, dragging one node gives you a nice
impression of where the edges of that node lead to. But it
also loses information when you modify it. Apart from <br>
that it is an antiquated Xlib tool. It also displays an
annoying little circle on the middle of each edge, and no
option seems to get rid of it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZGRViewer <br>
ZGRViewer &lt;http://zvtm.sourceforge.net/zgrviewer.html&gt;
is a separately downloadable Java viewer which has
comfortable zooming and panning. The graph is only viewable,
no <br>
moving of nodes. There are five buttons in the view area,
which offer additional fancy semi-3D zoom variations, but,
unlike the basic functionality, they can be extremely <br>
slow depending on your Java setup. For my Sun Linux Java,
the following gave a tremendous boost:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export J2D_PIXMAPS=shared
USE_DGA_PIXMAPS=1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grappa <br>
Grappa is a separately downloadable Java 1.2 viewer. There
is no wrapper shell script, the jar contains no manifest,
none of the sources contain a main function, and with <br>
the appletviewer it produced two tall windows which hang
with a &quot;starting applet&quot; message, so I don&rsquo;t
know how to test this. It can be tried on a demo web site as
an applet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selecting an edge makes it bold
red, so you can manually scroll its other end into view
without loosing it out of sight. Other than that and zooming
and deleting nodes it <br>
seems to have no useful features. It ignores valid
hexadecimal color specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SVG SVG, one of the file types
the backends can export to, is already quite old. But some
browsers still have problems with it. When embedding it with
an object tag only Opera <br>
scales it, others clip it, which is useless for a thumbnail.
When viewed as a document of it&rsquo;s own, only Opera and
Konqueror allow scaling it, while Firefox scales only the
<br>
labels. Even though the labels are text, no browser can
search for them. IE6 doesn&rsquo;t have a clue, unless you
install a plugin. A dedicated application, like Inkscape,
can <br>
serve you better.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTML <br>
This is a simple unordered list tree format that can be
perused with any browser. You should have JavaScript and
CSS, which allows folding subtrees and seeing colors.
Usually <br>
your graph will not be a tree, which is worked around by
repeating nodes in every subtree needed, but as a link to
the first occurrence where you can see all its attributes.
Due <br>
to IE&rsquo;s limited Unicode support, vertical arrows are
used for include relations, instead of the usual dotted
arrows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Textual Graph <br>
This is a simple indentation-based format that can be
perused with any text viewer. This means you can usually
study much bigger graphs than with the other formats. In
Emacs <br>
you can use outline and foldout for very powerful graph
navigation with this little wrapper mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(define-derived-mode
textgraph-mode outline-mode &quot;Graph&quot; <br>
(view-mode) <br>
(set (make-local-variable &rsquo;outline-regexp) &quot;
*.&quot;) <br>
(set (make-local-variable &rsquo;outline-level) <br>
(lambda () (/ (- (match-end 0) (match-beginning 0) -1) 2)))
<br>
(set (make-local-variable &rsquo;outline-font-lock-keywords)
<br>
&rsquo;((&quot;^ *\(?:{[a-z,]+} \)?\([^{0+\)&quot; (1
(outline-font-lock-face) nil t)))) <br>
(setq imenu-generic-expression <br>
&rsquo;((nil &quot;^ *\(?:{[a-z,]+}
\)?\(.+?\)\(?:{[a-z,]+}\)?$&quot; 1))))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The lines can have comma
separated annotations between braces, unless you also give
the &quot;-p, --plain&quot; option. When these come before
the target they pertain to the relationship <br>
with the parent, i.e. the previous line indented less. When
they come after the target, they pertain to the target
itself. They are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">because <br>
When this comes before a target, the parent was built
because of this one. When it comes after, the target had
some inherent reason for being rebuilt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bidirectional <br>
This dependency or inclusion goes in both directions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include <br>
The parent includes this file. This annotation is only given
when also showing dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">phony <br>
This is a phony target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">repeated <br>
The information about this target and its children was
already given earlier on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
If you give no patterns, makeppgraph will start operating
with all the nodes it can extract from makepp&rsquo;s log.
When given one or more patterns (using &quot;?&quot;,
&quot;*&quot;, &quot;**&quot; and/or <br>
&quot;[...]&quot;), it will match those in the file system
and operate on any that also occur in the log. For these it
will by default select &quot;upwards&quot;, i.e. all targets
that depend on <br>
and/or include any of them and &quot;downwards&quot;, i.e.
all targets and/or sources, which any of them depends on
and/or includes. (The directions are metaphorical, because
the graph is <br>
best displayed from left &quot;top&quot; to right
&quot;bottom&quot; due to the width of the nodes.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A filename <br>
--args-file=filename <br>
--arguments-file=filename <br>
Read the file and parse it as possibly quoted whitespace-
and/or newline-separated options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b <br>
--because <br>
--build-reasons <br>
If a node was rebuilt because of a dependency, then that
edge is shown in red. Alas makepp applies optimizations to
detect when a target needs rebuilding, such that it often
<br>
can&rsquo;t say which file triggered the rebuild. If the
node was rebuilt for a reason not attributed to another
file, then the node&rsquo;s border is red. With uDraw(Graph)
a double <br>
border is used instead, as it doesn&rsquo;t support border
color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D <br>
--dependencies <br>
Draw a graph of the dependency relationship determined by
makepp. This is the default unless &quot;-i,
--includes&quot; is also given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d <br>
--down <br>
--downwards <br>
This option is only meaningful if you provide one or more
patterns. It will then only select the targets and/or
sources which the matched files depend on, or which they
<br>
include.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g <br>
--graphviz <br>
--dot <br>
Produce a Graphviz .dot file, instead of the default
uDraw(Graph) .udg file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
--html <br>
Produce a browser .html file, instead of the default
uDraw(Graph) .udg file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? <br>
--help <br>
Print out a brief summary of the options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I directory <br>
--include=directory <br>
--include-dir=directory <br>
Add directory to Perl load path @INC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i <br>
--includes <br>
Instead of dependencies (or with &quot;-D,
--dependencies&quot; additionally to them) draw a graph of
include relationships. This will only have been logged as
far as it needed to be <br>
analyzed. To get the full picture you need a fresh full
build.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l filename <br>
--log=filename <br>
--log-file=filename <br>
The filename is to where makepp wrote its log. It may also
be a directory, in which a file called .makepp/log or log
will be searched. To read from stdin, you must give - <br>
as a filename. When this option is not given, it defaults to
the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be given
multiple times, e.g. for merging all the logs from
&quot;--traditional-recursive-make&quot;. But the
dependencies you hid from makepp through the evil <br>
recursion paradigm can&rsquo;t of course show up here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M module[=arg,...] <br>
--module=module[=arg,...] <br>
Load module and import any functions it exports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m perlcode <br>
--merge=perlcode <br>
Perform perlcode for every target and its dependencies. See
merging for details about this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o filename <br>
--output=filename <br>
Write the output to this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p <br>
--plain <br>
Don&rsquo;t use attributes like colors or dotted lines. This
is especially useful for uncluttering &quot;-t, --text&quot;
output. In that format bidirectional edges will be lost
unless you <br>
combine this with &quot;-s, --separate-directions&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r perlcode <br>
--rename=perlcode <br>
Perform perlcode for every target and its dependencies. See
renaming for details about this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s <br>
--separate-directions <br>
Draw two separate arrows, instead of each double ended
arrow, to make them easier to spot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t <br>
--text <br>
Produce a human readable .txt file, instead of the default
uDraw(Graph) .udg file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u <br>
--up <br>
--upwards <br>
This option is only meaningful if you provide one or more
patterns. It will then only select the targets which depend
on and/or include the matched files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
--version <br>
Print out the version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REWRITING <br>
The techniques in this chapter are usually essential to get
a reasonably sized graph. As they are formulated as Perl
code, knowing the language is helpful. But you should be
<br>
able to achieve quite a lot with the examples here or in the
gallery &lt;http://makepp.sourceforge.net/gallery/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Renaming <br>
This is the first name rewriting that occurs, if the
&quot;-r, --rename&quot; option is given. For every name
encountered, perlcode gets called. It gets a filename in $_,
and it may <br>
modify it. This is often needed, because makepp logs fully
qualified file names, so one node can easily be half a
screen wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For one thing, you can rewrite
names to &quot;undef&quot; or the empty string. This will
eliminate the node from the graph. Note that eliminating a
node in this first stage will break a <br>
chain of dependency if this node was in the middle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also rewrite various
names to the same string, coercing them all into the same
node, which accumulates the combined dependencies and
dependents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the other hand you can just
rename names to (usually) shorter names, so as to reduce the
width of nodes, which can be far to wide with absolute
filenames. There are a few <br>
predefined functions in package &quot;Mpp::Rewrite&quot;, in
which your code also runs, you can use for this. These
return true if they did something so you can combine them as
in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rename=&rsquo;cwd( 1 ) ||
&amp;home || &amp;usr&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;cwd <br>
cwd number <br>
cwd number, name[, separator] <br>
Removes the current working directory from the beginning of
path. With a number, also replaces parent directories that
many levels up with the right number of ../ <br>
directories, where applicable. In this case you can give an
alternate name, like a piled up &rsquo;:&rsquo; instead of
&rsquo;..&rsquo; and additionally an alternate separator
like &rsquo;&rsquo; instead of <br>
&rsquo;/&rsquo;. In the first case you might get :/:/a/b, in
the second an even shorter ::a/b instead of ../../a/b.
Passing a number is useful if you draw in stuff from
neighbouring <br>
trees. Or you have a src directory, where most of the action
is, so you call makeppgraph there, but want to see the
relation to your other directories too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you give no
&quot;--rename&quot; option, &amp;cwd is the default. Should
you want no renaming, you can give some perlcode like
&quot;--rename=1&quot; that does nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;dir <br>
This one is a great reducer of graph complexity. It reduces
every file to its directory. That amounts to the question:
&quot;Files from which directory depend on files from <br>
which other directory?&quot; Note that while the dependency
graph is always acyclic (else makepp wouldn&rsquo;t know
where to start building), that is not true of this reduced
view. <br>
E.g. if dir1/a depends on dir2/b and dir2/a on dir1/b that
will display as a mutual dependency between dir1 and dir2.
Since a cyclic graph has no obvious starting point, the <br>
layout may be odd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike the other functions in
this section, this is not exclusive with the others. So you
may not want to logically combine it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rename=&rsquo;&amp;dir;
&amp;cwd || &amp;home&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;home <br>
Replaces your home directory with ~/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;makepp <br>
Replaces the makepp installation directory with |m|.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;suf <br>
suf number <br>
This one is also a great reducer of graph complexity. It
reduces every file that has a suffix to an asterisk and that
suffix. So you can see which kinds of files depend on <br>
which other kinds. With an argument of 0 it leaves the first
character of the directory, provided it is one of
&quot;/&quot;, &quot;~&quot; or &quot;|&quot; (as put in by
&amp;home or &amp;usr if you called <br>
those first). With a positive argument, it leaves that many
directory levels at the beginning. With a negative argument,
it removes that many directory levels at the end. <br>
So for /a/b/c/d/e/x.y you get:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;suf *.y <br>
suf 0 /*.y <br>
suf 1 /a/*.y <br>
suf 2 /a/b/*.y <br>
suf -1 /a/b/c/d/*.y <br>
suf -2 /a/b/c/*.y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a relative a/b/c/d/e/x.y you
get:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;suf *.y <br>
suf 0 *.y <br>
suf 1 a/*.y <br>
suf -1 a/b/c/d/*.y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;usr <br>
Under /, /usr, /usr/local, /usr/X11, /usr/X11R6, /usr/X11R7
or /opt, for any of the directories bin, etc, include, lib
or share, the initials of these words are concatenated <br>
between bars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E.g. /usr/local/bin/foobar
becomes |ulb|foobar or /usr/include/net/if.h becomes
|ui|net/if.h. Note that &lsquo;l&rsquo; stands for
&lsquo;local&rsquo; when between two letters and for
&lsquo;lib&rsquo; as the <br>
last letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Merging <br>
This is the second name rewriting that occurs, if the
&quot;-m, --merge&quot; option is given. This API is still
under development! Currently the target is passed in $_ and
the <br>
dependency as an argument. If perlcode returns a value, that
value replaces both the target and the dependency, merging
them into one node. A few predefined functions can help <br>
you:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c2o For any C/C++ source and the
resulting .o file, merge them into one node, by adding to
the source path a suffix of &quot;&gt;o&quot; like
some/where/foo.cc&gt;o, even if the .o file is in <br>
another directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exe For any .o file and the
resulting executable of the same notdir basename without a
suffix or with .exe, merge them into one node, by adding an
asterisk to the .o file. This <br>
will not currently work together with c2o.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x2 For any pair of files with
the same name, usually a header or library published to a
central directory, merge them into one node, by adding *2 to
the dependency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Makeppgraph looks at the following environment variable:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$MAKEPPGRAPHFLAGS <br>
Any flags in this environment variable are interpreted as
command line options before any explicit options. Quotes are
interpreted like in makefiles.</p>
