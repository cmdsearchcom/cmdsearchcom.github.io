<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlnewmod - preparing a new module for distribution</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document gives you some suggestions about how to go
about writing Perl modules, preparing them for distribution,
and making them available via CPAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One of the things that makes
Perl really powerful is the fact that Perl hackers tend to
want to share the solutions to problems they&rsquo;ve faced,
so you and I don&rsquo;t have to battle <br>
with the same problem again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main way they do this is by
abstracting the solution into a Perl module. If you
don&rsquo;t know what one of these is, the rest of this
document isn&rsquo;t going to be much use to you. <br>
You&rsquo;re also missing out on an awful lot of useful
code; consider having a look at perlmod, perlmodlib and
perlmodinstall before coming back here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you&rsquo;ve found that
there isn&rsquo;t a module available for what you&rsquo;re
trying to do, and you&rsquo;ve had to write the code
yourself, consider packaging up the solution into a module
<br>
and uploading it to CPAN so that others can benefit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning <br>
We&rsquo;re going to primarily concentrate on Perl-only
modules here, rather than XS modules. XS modules serve a
rather different purpose, and you should consider different
things <br>
before distributing them - the popularity of the library you
are gluing, the portability to other operating systems, and
so on. However, the notes on preparing the Perl side of <br>
the module and packaging and distributing it will apply
equally well to an XS module as a pure-Perl one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What should I make into a
module? <br>
You should make a module out of any code that you think is
going to be useful to others. Anything that&rsquo;s likely
to fill a hole in the communal library and which someone
else can <br>
slot directly into their program. Any part of your code
which you can isolate and extract and plug into something
else is a likely candidate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Let&rsquo;s take an example.
Suppose you&rsquo;re reading in data from a local format
into a hash-of-hashes in Perl, turning that into a tree,
walking the tree and then piping each node to <br>
an Acme Transmogrifier Server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, quite a few people have the
Acme Transmogrifier, and you&rsquo;ve had to write something
to talk the protocol from scratch - you&rsquo;d almost
certainly want to make that into a <br>
module. The level at which you pitch it is up to you: you
might want protocol-level modules analogous to Net::SMTP
which then talk to higher level modules analogous to <br>
Mail::Send. The choice is yours, but you do want to get a
module out for that server protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nobody else on the planet is
going to talk your local data format, so we can ignore that.
But what about the thing in the middle? Building tree
structures from Perl variables and <br>
then traversing them is a nice, general problem, and if
nobody&rsquo;s already written a module that does that, you
might want to modularise that code too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So hopefully you&rsquo;ve now
got a few ideas about what&rsquo;s good to modularise.
Let&rsquo;s now see how it&rsquo;s done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Step-by-step: Preparing the
ground <br>
Before we even start scraping out the code, there are a few
things we&rsquo;ll want to do in advance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Look around <br>
Dig into a bunch of modules to see how they&rsquo;re
written. I&rsquo;d suggest starting with Text::Tabs, since
it&rsquo;s in the standard library and is nice and simple,
and then looking at <br>
something a little more complex like File::Copy. For object
oriented code, &quot;WWW::Mechanize&quot; or the
&quot;Email::*&quot; modules provide some good examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These should give you an overall
feel for how modules are laid out and written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Check it&rsquo;s new <br>
There are a lot of modules on CPAN, and it&rsquo;s easy to
miss one that&rsquo;s similar to what you&rsquo;re planning
on contributing. Have a good plough through the
&lt;http://search.cpan.org&gt; <br>
and make sure you&rsquo;re not the one reinventing the
wheel!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Discuss the need <br>
You might love it. You might feel that everyone else needs
it. But there might not actually be any real demand for it
out there. If you&rsquo;re unsure about the demand your
module <br>
will have, consider sending out feelers on the
&quot;comp.lang.perl.modules&quot; newsgroup, or as a last
resort, ask the modules list at
&quot;modules@perl.org&quot;. Remember that this is a <br>
closed list with a very long turn-around time - be prepared
to wait a good while for a response from them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Choose a name <br>
Perl modules included on CPAN have a naming hierarchy you
should try to fit in with. See perlmodlib for more details
on how this works, and browse around CPAN and the modules
<br>
list to get a feel of it. At the very least, remember this:
modules should be title capitalised, (This::Thing) fit in
with a category, and explain their purpose succinctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Check again <br>
While you&rsquo;re doing that, make really sure you
haven&rsquo;t missed a module similar to the one
you&rsquo;re about to write.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you&rsquo;ve got your name
sorted out and you&rsquo;re sure that your module is wanted
and not currently available, it&rsquo;s time to start
coding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Step-by-step: Making the module
<br>
Start with module-starter or h2xs <br>
The module-starter utility is distributed as part of the
Module::Starter CPAN package. It creates a directory with
stubs of all the necessary files to start a new module, <br>
according to recent &quot;best practice&quot; for module
development, and is invoked from the command line, thus:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">module-starter --module=Foo::Bar
--author=&quot;Your Name&quot; --email=yourname@cpan.org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not wish to install
the Module::Starter package from CPAN, h2xs is an older
tool, originally intended for the development of XS modules,
which comes packaged with <br>
the Perl distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A typical invocation of h2xs for
a pure Perl module is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h2xs -AX --skip-exporter
--use-new-tests -n Foo::Bar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;-A&quot; omits the
Autoloader code, &quot;-X&quot; omits XS elements,
&quot;--skip-exporter&quot; omits the Exporter code,
&quot;--use-new-tests&quot; sets up a modern testing
environment, and &quot;-n&quot; <br>
specifies the name of the module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use strict and warnings <br>
A module&rsquo;s code has to be warning and strict-clean,
since you can&rsquo;t guarantee the conditions that
it&rsquo;ll be used under. Besides, you wouldn&rsquo;t want
to distribute code that <br>
wasn&rsquo;t warning or strict-clean anyway, right?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use Carp <br>
The Carp module allows you to present your error messages
from the caller&rsquo;s perspective; this gives you a way to
signal a problem with the caller and not your module. For
<br>
instance, if you say this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warn &quot;No hostname
given&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the user will see something like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No hostname given at
/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/Net/Acme.pm <br>
line 123.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which looks like your module is
doing something wrong. Instead, you want to put the blame on
the user, and say this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No hostname given at bad_code,
line 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You do this by using Carp and
replacing your &quot;warn&quot;s with &quot;carp&quot;s. If
you need to &quot;die&quot;, say &quot;croak&quot; instead.
However, keep &quot;warn&quot; and &quot;die&quot; in place
for your sanity checks - <br>
where it really is your module at fault.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use Exporter - wisely! <br>
Exporter gives you a standard way of exporting symbols and
subroutines from your module into the caller&rsquo;s
namespace. For instance, saying &quot;use Net::Acme
qw(&amp;frob)&quot; would <br>
import the &quot;frob&quot; subroutine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The package variable @EXPORT
will determine which symbols will get exported when the
caller simply says &quot;use Net::Acme&quot; - you will
hardly ever want to put anything in there. <br>
@EXPORT_OK, on the other hand, specifies which symbols
you&rsquo;re willing to export. If you do want to export a
bunch of symbols, use the %EXPORT_TAGS and define a standard
export <br>
set - look at Exporter for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use plain old documentation <br>
The work isn&rsquo;t over until the paperwork is done, and
you&rsquo;re going to need to put in some time writing some
documentation for your module. &quot;module-starter&quot; or
&quot;h2xs&quot; will <br>
provide a stub for you to fill in; if you&rsquo;re not sure
about the format, look at perlpod for an introduction.
Provide a good synopsis of how your module is used in code,
a <br>
description, and then notes on the syntax and function of
the individual subroutines or methods. Use Perl comments for
developer notes and POD for end-user notes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Write tests <br>
You&rsquo;re encouraged to create self-tests for your module
to ensure it&rsquo;s working as intended on the myriad
platforms Perl supports; if you upload your module to CPAN,
a host of <br>
testers will build your module and send you the results of
the tests. Again, &quot;module-starter&quot; and
&quot;h2xs&quot; provide a test framework which you can
extend - you should do <br>
something more than just checking your module will compile.
Test::Simple and Test::More are good places to start when
writing a test suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Write the README <br>
If you&rsquo;re uploading to CPAN, the automated gremlins
will extract the README file and place that in your CPAN
directory. It&rsquo;ll also appear in the main by-module and
by-category <br>
directories if you make it onto the modules list. It&rsquo;s
a good idea to put here what the module actually does in
detail, and the user-visible changes since the last
release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Step-by-step: Distributing your
module <br>
Get a CPAN user ID <br>
Every developer publishing modules on CPAN needs a CPAN ID.
Visit &quot;http://pause.perl.org/&quot;, select
&quot;Request PAUSE Account&quot;, and wait for your request
to be approved by the <br>
PAUSE administrators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;perl Makefile.PL; make
test; make dist&quot; <br>
Once again, &quot;module-starter&quot; or &quot;h2xs&quot;
has done all the work for you. They produce the standard
&quot;Makefile.PL&quot; you see when you download and
install modules, and this produces <br>
a Makefile with a &quot;dist&quot; target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you&rsquo;ve ensured that
your module passes its own tests - always a good thing to
make sure - you can &quot;make dist&quot;, and the Makefile
will hopefully produce you a nice tarball <br>
of your module, ready for upload.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upload the tarball <br>
The email you got when you received your CPAN ID will tell
you how to log in to PAUSE, the Perl Authors Upload SErver.
From the menus there, you can upload your module to <br>
CPAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Announce to the modules list
<br>
Once uploaded, it&rsquo;ll sit unnoticed in your author
directory. If you want it connected to the rest of the CPAN,
you&rsquo;ll need to go to &quot;Register Namespace&quot; on
PAUSE. Once <br>
registered, your module will appear in the by-module and
by-category listings on CPAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Announce to clpa <br>
If you have a burning desire to tell the world about your
release, post an announcement to the moderated
&quot;comp.lang.perl.announce&quot; newsgroup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fix bugs! <br>
Once you start accumulating users, they&rsquo;ll send you
bug reports. If you&rsquo;re lucky, they&rsquo;ll even send
you patches. Welcome to the joys of maintaining a software
project...</p>
