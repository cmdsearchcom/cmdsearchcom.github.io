<p>TELNET(1) BSD General Commands Manual TELNET(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
telnet &acirc; user interface to the TELNET protocol</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
telnet [-8EFKLacdfrx] [-X authtype] [-b hostalias] [-e
escapechar] [-k realm] [-l user] [-n tracefile] [host
[port]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The telnet command is used to communicate with another host
using the TELNET protocol. If telnet is invoked without the
host argument, it enters command mode, indicated by its <br>
prompt (telnet&gt;). In this mode, it accepts and executes
the commands listed below. If it is invoked with arguments,
it performs an open command with those arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-7 Strip 8th bit on input and
output. Telnet is 8-bit clean by default but doesn&rsquo;t
send the TELNET BINARY option unless forced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-8 Specifies an 8-bit data path.
This causes an attempt to negotiate the TELNET BINARY option
on both input and output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Stops any character from
being recognized as an escape character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F If Kerberos V5 authentication
is being used, the -F option allows the local credentials to
be forwarded to the remote system, including any credentials
that have already <br>
been forwarded into the local environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K Specifies no automatic login
to the remote system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Specifies an 8-bit data path
on output. This causes the BINARY option to be negotiated on
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X atype <br>
Disables the atype type of authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Attempt automatic login.
Currently, this sends the user name via the USER variable of
the ENVIRON option if supported by the remote system. The
name used is that of the <br>
current user as returned by getlogin(2) if it agrees with
the current user ID, otherwise it is the name associated
with the user ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b hostalias <br>
Uses bind(2) on the local socket to bind it to an aliased
address (see ifconfig(8) and the
&lsquo;&lsquo;alias&rsquo;&rsquo; specifier) or to the
address of another interface than the one natu&acirc; <br>
rally chosen by connect(2). This can be useful when
connecting to services which use IP addresses for
authentication and reconfiguration of the server is
undesirable (or <br>
impossible).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Disables the reading of the
user&rsquo;s .telnetrc file. (See the toggle skiprc command
on this man page.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Sets the initial value of the
debug toggle to TRUE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e escapechar <br>
Sets the initial telnet escape character to escapechar. If
escapechar is omitted, then there will be no escape
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f If Kerberos V5 authentication
is being used, the -f option allows the local credentials to
be forwarded to the remote system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k realm <br>
If Kerberos authentication is being used, the -k option
requests that telnet obtain tickets for the remote host in
realm realm instead of the remote host&rsquo;s realm, as
deter&acirc; <br>
mined by krb_realmofhost(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l user <br>
When connecting to the remote system, if the remote system
understands the ENVIRON option, then user will be sent to
the remote system as the value for the variable USER. <br>
This option implies the -a option. This option may also be
used with the open command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n tracefile <br>
Opens tracefile for recording trace information. See the set
tracefile command below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Specifies a user interface
similar to rlogin(1). In this mode, the escape character is
set to the tilde (~) character, unless modified by the -e
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Turns on encryption of the
data stream if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host Indicates the official
name, an alias, or the Internet address of a remote
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port Indicates a port number
(address of an application). If a number is not specified,
the default telnet port is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When in rlogin mode, a line of
the form ~. disconnects from the remote host; ~ is the
telnet escape character. Similarly, the line ~^Z suspends
the telnet session. The line ~^] <br>
escapes to the normal telnet escape prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once a connection has been
opened, telnet will attempt to enable the TELNET LINEMODE
option. If this fails, telnet will revert to one of two
input modes: either &lsquo;&lsquo;character at a <br>
time&rsquo;&rsquo; or &lsquo;&lsquo;old line by
line&rsquo;&rsquo; depending on what the remote system
supports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When LINEMODE is enabled,
character processing is done on the local system, under the
control of the remote system. When input editing or
character echoing is to be disabled, the <br>
remote system will relay that information. The remote system
will also relay changes to any special characters that
happen on the remote system, so that they can take effect on
<br>
the local system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In &lsquo;&lsquo;character at a
time&rsquo;&rsquo; mode, most text typed is immediately sent
to the remote host for processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In &lsquo;&lsquo;old line by
line&rsquo;&rsquo; mode, all text is echoed locally, and
(normally) only completed lines are sent to the remote host.
The &lsquo;&lsquo;local echo character&rsquo;&rsquo;
(initially &lsquo;&lsquo;^E&rsquo;&rsquo;) may be <br>
used to turn off and on the local echo (this would mostly be
used to enter passwords without the password being
echoed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the LINEMODE option is
enabled, or if the localchars toggle is TRUE (the default
for &lsquo;&lsquo;old line by line&rsquo;&rsquo;; see
below), the user&rsquo;s quit, intr, and flush characters
are trapped <br>
locally, and sent as TELNET protocol sequences to the remote
side. If LINEMODE has ever been enabled, then the
user&rsquo;s susp and eof are also sent as TELNET protocol
sequences, and <br>
quit is sent as a TELNET ABORT instead of BREAK. There are
options (see toggle autoflush and toggle autosynch below)
which cause this action to flush subsequent output to the
ter&acirc; <br>
minal (until the remote host acknowledges the TELNET
sequence) and flush previous terminal input (in the case of
quit and intr).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While connected to a remote
host, telnet command mode may be entered by typing the
telnet &lsquo;&lsquo;escape character&rsquo;&rsquo;
(initially &lsquo;&lsquo;^]&rsquo;&rsquo;). When in command
mode, the normal terminal edit&acirc; <br>
ing conventions are available. Note that the escape
character will return to the command mode of the initial
invocation of telnet that has the controlling terminal. Use
the send <br>
escape command to switch to command mode in subsequent
telnet processes on remote hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following telnet commands
are available. Only enough of each command to uniquely
identify it need be typed (this is also true for arguments
to the mode, set, toggle, unset, <br>
slc, environ, and display commands).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auth argument [...] <br>
The auth command manipulates the information sent through
the TELNET AUTHENTICATE option. Valid arguments for the auth
command are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disable type Disables the
specified type of authentication. To obtain a list of
available types, use the auth disable ? command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable type Enables the
specified type of authentication. To obtain a list of
available types, use the auth enable ? command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status Lists the current status
of the various types of authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close Close a TELNET session and
return to command mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">display argument [...] <br>
Displays all, or some, of the set and toggle values (see
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">encrypt argument [...] <br>
The encrypt command manipulates the information sent through
the TELNET ENCRYPT option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Valid arguments for the encrypt
command are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disable type [input|output] <br>
Disables the specified type of encryption. If you omit input
and output, both input and output are disabled. To obtain a
list of available types, use the <br>
encrypt disable ? command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable type [input|output] <br>
Enables the specified type of encryption. If you omit input
and output, both input and output are enabled. To obtain a
list of available types, use the <br>
encrypt enable ? command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">input This is the same as the
encrypt start input command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-input This is the same as the
encrypt stop input command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">output This is the same as the
encrypt start output command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-output This is the same as the
encrypt stop output command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start [input|output] <br>
Attempts to start encryption. If you omit input and output,
both input and output are enabled. To obtain a list of
available types, use the encrypt <br>
enable ? command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status Lists the current status
of encryption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop [input|output] <br>
Stops encryption. If you omit input and output, encryption
is on both input and output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type type Sets the default type
of encryption to be used with later encrypt start or encrypt
stop commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">environ arguments [...] <br>
The environ command is used to manipulate the variables that
may be sent through the TELNET ENVIRON option. The initial
set of variables is taken from the users envi&acirc; <br>
ronment, with only the DISPLAY and PRINTER variables being
exported by default. The USER variable is also exported if
the -a or -l options are used. <br>
Valid arguments for the environ command are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">define variable value <br>
Define the variable variable to have a value of value. Any
variables defined by this command are automatically
exported. The value may be enclosed in sin&acirc; <br>
gle or double quotes so that tabs and spaces may be
included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">undefine variable <br>
Remove variable from the list of environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export variable <br>
Mark the variable variable to be exported to the remote
side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unexport variable <br>
Mark the variable variable to not be exported unless
explicitly asked for by the remote side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list List the current set of
environment variables. Those marked with a * will be sent
automatically, other variables will only be sent if
explicitly requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Prints out help information
for the environ command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logout Sends the TELNET LOGOUT
option to the remote side. This command is similar to a
close command; however, if the remote side does not support
the LOGOUT option, nothing <br>
happens. If, however, the remote side does support the
LOGOUT option, this command should cause the remote side to
close the TELNET connection. If the remote side also <br>
supports the concept of suspending a user&rsquo;s session
for later reattachment, the logout argument indicates that
you should terminate the session immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode type type is one of several
options, depending on the state of the TELNET session. The
remote host is asked for permission to go into the requested
mode. If the remote host <br>
is capable of entering that mode, the requested mode will be
entered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">character Disable the TELNET
LINEMODE option, or, if the remote side does not understand
the LINEMODE option, then enter &lsquo;&lsquo;character at a
time&rsquo;&rsquo; mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">line Enable the TELNET LINEMODE
option, or, if the remote side does not understand the
LINEMODE option, then attempt to enter
&lsquo;&lsquo;old-line-by-line&rsquo;&rsquo; mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">isig (-isig) Attempt to enable
(disable) the TRAPSIG mode of the LINEMODE option. This
requires that the LINEMODE option be enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">edit (-edit) Attempt to enable
(disable) the EDIT mode of the LINEMODE option. This
requires that the LINEMODE option be enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">softtabs (-softtabs) <br>
Attempt to enable (disable) the SOFT_TAB mode of the
LINEMODE option. This requires that the LINEMODE option be
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">litecho (-litecho) <br>
Attempt to enable (disable) the LIT_ECHO mode of the
LINEMODE option. This requires that the LINEMODE option be
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Prints out help information
for the mode command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open host [-l user] [[-] port]
<br>
Open a connection to the named host. If no port number is
specified, telnet will attempt to contact a TELNET server at
the default port. The host specification may be <br>
either a host name (see hosts(5)) or an Internet address
specified in the &lsquo;&lsquo;dot notation&rsquo;&rsquo;
(see inet(3)). The -l option may be used to specify the user
name to be <br>
passed to the remote system via the ENVIRON option. When
connecting to a non-standard port, telnet omits any
automatic initiation of TELNET options. When the port
num&acirc; <br>
ber is preceded by a minus sign, the initial option
negotiation is done. After establishing a connection, the
file .telnetrc in the user&rsquo;s home directory is opened.
<br>
Lines beginning with a &lsquo;&lsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo; are
comment lines. Blank lines are ignored. Lines that begin
without whitespace are the start of a machine entry. The
first thing on the <br>
line is the name of the machine that is being connected to.
The rest of the line, and successive lines that begin with
whitespace are assumed to be telnet commands and <br>
are processed as if they had been typed in manually to the
telnet command prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit Close any open TELNET
session and exit telnet. An end-of-file (in command mode)
will also close a session and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">send arguments <br>
Sends one or more special character sequences to the remote
host. The following are the arguments which may be specified
(more than one argument may be specified at a <br>
time):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">abort Sends the TELNET ABORT
(Abort processes) sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ao Sends the TELNET AO (Abort
Output) sequence, which should cause the remote system to
flush all output from the remote system to the user&rsquo;s
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ayt Sends the TELNET AYT (Are
You There) sequence, to which the remote system may or may
not choose to respond.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">brk Sends the TELNET BRK (Break)
sequence, which may have significance to the remote
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ec Sends the TELNET EC (Erase
Character) sequence, which should cause the remote system to
erase the last character entered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">el Sends the TELNET EL (Erase
Line) sequence, which should cause the remote system to
erase the line currently being entered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eof Sends the TELNET EOF (End Of
File) sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eor Sends the TELNET EOR (End of
Record) sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">escape Sends the current telnet
escape character (initially
&lsquo;&lsquo;^]&rsquo;&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ga Sends the TELNET GA (Go
Ahead) sequence, which likely has no significance to the
remote system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getstatus <br>
If the remote side supports the TELNET STATUS command,
getstatus will send the subnegotiation to request that the
server send its current option status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip Sends the TELNET IP
(Interrupt Process) sequence, which should cause the remote
system to abort the currently running process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nop Sends the TELNET NOP (No
OPeration) sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">susp Sends the TELNET SUSP
(SUSPend process) sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">synch Sends the TELNET SYNCH
sequence. This sequence causes the remote system to discard
all previously typed (but not yet read) input. This sequence
is sent as TCP <br>
urgent data (and may not work if the remote system is a
4.2BSD system -- if it doesn&rsquo;t work, a lower case
&lsquo;&lsquo;r&rsquo;&rsquo; may be echoed on the
terminal).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">do cmd Sends the TELNET DO cmd
sequence. cmd can be either a decimal number between 0 and
255, or a symbolic name for a specific TELNET command. cmd
can also be <br>
either help or ? to print out help information, including a
list of known symbolic names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dont cmd <br>
Sends the TELNET DONT cmd sequence. cmd can be either a
decimal number between 0 and 255, or a symbolic name for a
specific TELNET command. cmd can also be <br>
either help or ? to print out help information, including a
list of known symbolic names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will cmd <br>
Sends the TELNET WILL cmd sequence. cmd can be either a
decimal number between 0 and 255, or a symbolic name for a
specific TELNET command. cmd can also be <br>
either help or ? to print out help information, including a
list of known symbolic names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wont cmd <br>
Sends the TELNET WONT cmd sequence. cmd can be either a
decimal number between 0 and 255, or a symbolic name for a
specific TELNET command. cmd can also be <br>
either help or ? to print out help information, including a
list of known symbolic names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Prints out help information
for the send command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set argument value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unset argument value <br>
The set command will set any one of a number of telnet
variables to a specific value or to TRUE. The special value
off turns off the function associated with the vari&acirc;
<br>
able; this is equivalent to using the unset command. The
unset command will disable or set to FALSE any of the
specified functions. The values of variables may be <br>
interrogated with the display command. The variables which
may be set or unset, but not toggled, are listed here. In
addition, any of the variables for the toggle com&acirc;
<br>
mand may be explicitly set or unset using the set and unset
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ayt If TELNET is in localchars
mode, or LINEMODE is enabled, and the status character is
typed, a TELNET AYT sequence (see send ayt preceding) is
sent to the remote <br>
host. The initial value for the &quot;Are You There&quot;
character is the terminal&rsquo;s status character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo This is the value
(initially &lsquo;&lsquo;^E&rsquo;&rsquo;) which, when in
&lsquo;&lsquo;line by line&rsquo;&rsquo; mode, toggles
between doing local echoing of entered characters (for
normal processing), and <br>
suppressing echoing of entered characters (for entering,
say, a password).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eof If telnet is operating in
LINEMODE or &lsquo;&lsquo;old line by line&rsquo;&rsquo;
mode, entering this character as the first character on a
line will cause this character to be sent to <br>
the remote system. The initial value of the eof character is
taken to be the terminal&rsquo;s eof character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">erase If telnet is in localchars
mode (see toggle localchars below), and if telnet is
operating in &lsquo;&lsquo;character at a time&rsquo;&rsquo;
mode, then when this character is typed, a <br>
TELNET EC sequence (see send ec above) is sent to the remote
system. The initial value for the erase character is taken
to be the terminal&rsquo;s erase character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">escape This is the telnet escape
character (initially &lsquo;&lsquo;^[&rsquo;&rsquo;) which
causes entry into telnet command mode (when connected to a
remote system).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flushoutput <br>
If telnet is in localchars mode (see toggle localchars
below) and the flushoutput character is typed, a TELNET AO
sequence (see send ao above) is sent to the <br>
remote host. The initial value for the flush character is
taken to be the terminal&rsquo;s flush character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">forw1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">forw2 If TELNET is operating in
LINEMODE, these are the characters that, when typed, cause
partial lines to be forwarded to the remote system. The
initial value for <br>
the forwarding characters are taken from the
terminal&rsquo;s eol and eol2 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interrupt <br>
If telnet is in localchars mode (see toggle localchars
below) and the interrupt character is typed, a TELNET IP
sequence (see send ip above) is sent to the <br>
remote host. The initial value for the interrupt character
is taken to be the terminal&rsquo;s intr character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill If telnet is in localchars
mode (see toggle localchars below), and if telnet is
operating in &lsquo;&lsquo;character at a time&rsquo;&rsquo;
mode, then when this character is typed, a <br>
TELNET EL sequence (see send el above) is sent to the remote
system. The initial value for the kill character is taken to
be the terminal&rsquo;s kill character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lnext If telnet is operating in
LINEMODE or &lsquo;&lsquo;old line by line&rsquo;&rsquo;
mode, then this character is taken to be the
terminal&rsquo;s lnext character. The initial value for the
<br>
lnext character is taken to be the terminal&rsquo;s lnext
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit If telnet is in localchars
mode (see toggle localchars below) and the quit character is
typed, a TELNET BRK sequence (see send brk above) is sent to
the remote <br>
host. The initial value for the quit character is taken to
be the terminal&rsquo;s quit character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reprint <br>
If telnet is operating in LINEMODE or old line by
line&rsquo;&rsquo; mode, then this character is taken to be
the terminal&rsquo;s reprint character. The initial value
for the <br>
reprint character is taken to be the terminal&rsquo;s
reprint character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rlogin This is the rlogin escape
character. If set, the normal TELNET escape character is
ignored unless it is preceded by this character at the
beginning of a line. <br>
This character, at the beginning of a line, followed by a
&quot;.&quot; closes the connection; when followed by a ^Z
it suspends the telnet command. The initial state is <br>
to disable the rlogin escape character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start If the TELNET
TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL option has been enabled, then this
character is taken to be the terminal&rsquo;s start
character. The initial value for the start <br>
character is taken to be the terminal&rsquo;s start
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop If the TELNET
TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL option has been enabled, then this
character is taken to be the terminal&rsquo;s stop
character. The initial value for the stop <br>
character is taken to be the terminal&rsquo;s stop
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">susp If telnet is in localchars
mode, or LINEMODE is enabled, and the suspend character is
typed, a TELNET SUSP sequence (see send susp above) is sent
to the remote <br>
host. The initial value for the suspend character is taken
to be the terminal&rsquo;s suspend character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tracefile <br>
This is the file to which the output, caused by netdata or
option tracing being TRUE, will be written. If it is set to
&acirc;-&acirc;, then tracing information will be <br>
written to standard output (the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">worderase <br>
If telnet is operating in LINEMODE or &lsquo;&lsquo;old line
by line&rsquo;&rsquo; mode, then this character is taken to
be the terminal&rsquo;s worderase character. The initial
value for <br>
the worderase character is taken to be the terminal&rsquo;s
worderase character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Displays the legal set (unset)
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skey sequence challenge <br>
The skey command computes a response to the S/Key challenge.
See skey(1) for more information on the S/Key system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slc state The slc command (Set
Local Characters) is used to set or change the state of the
special characters when the TELNET LINEMODE option has been
enabled. Special characters <br>
are characters that get mapped to TELNET commands sequences
(like ip or quit) or line editing characters (like erase and
kill). By default, the local special characters <br>
are exported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check Verify the current
settings for the current special characters. The remote side
is requested to send all the current special character
settings, and if <br>
there are any discrepancies with the local side, the local
side will switch to the remote value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export Switch to the local
defaults for the special characters. The local default
characters are those of the local terminal at the time when
telnet was started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">import Switch to the remote
defaults for the special characters. The remote default
characters are those of the remote system at the time when
the TELNET connec&acirc; <br>
tion was established.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Prints out help information
for the slc command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status Show the current status
of telnet. This includes the peer one is connected to, as
well as the current mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">toggle arguments [...] <br>
Toggle (between TRUE and FALSE) various flags that control
how telnet responds to events. These flags may be set
explicitly to TRUE or FALSE using the set and unset <br>
commands listed above. More than one argument may be
specified. The state of these flags may be interrogated with
the display command. Valid arguments are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">authdebug Turns on debugging
information for the authentication code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoflush If autoflush and
localchars are both TRUE, then when the ao or quit
characters are recognized (and transformed into TELNET
sequences; see set above for <br>
details), telnet refuses to display any data on the
user&rsquo;s terminal until the remote system acknowledges
(via a TELNET TIMING MARK option) that it has pro&acirc;
<br>
cessed those TELNET sequences. The initial value for this
toggle is TRUE if the terminal user had not done an
&quot;stty noflsh&quot;, otherwise FALSE (see <br>
stty(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autodecrypt When the TELNET
ENCRYPT option is negotiated, by default the actual
encryption (decryption) of the data stream does not start
automatically. The <br>
autoencrypt (autodecrypt) command states that encryption of
the output (input) stream should be enabled as soon as
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autologin If the remote side
supports the TELNET AUTHENTICATION option TELNET attempts to
use it to perform automatic authentication. If the
AUTHENTICATION option <br>
is not supported, the user&rsquo;s login name are propagated
through the TELNET ENVIRON option. This command is the same
as specifying a option on the open com&acirc; <br>
mand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autosynch If autosynch and
localchars are both TRUE, then when either the intr or quit
character is typed (see set above for descriptions of the
intr and quit char&acirc; <br>
acters), the resulting TELNET sequence sent is followed by
the TELNET SYNCH sequence. This procedure should cause the
remote system to begin throwing away <br>
all previously typed input until both of the TELNET
sequences have been read and acted upon. The initial value
of this toggle is FALSE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">binary Enable or disable the
TELNET BINARY option on both input and output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inbinary Enable or disable the
TELNET BINARY option on input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">outbinary Enable or disable the
TELNET BINARY option on output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">crlf If this is TRUE, then
carriage returns will be sent as &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;. If
this is FALSE, then carriage returns will be send as
&lt;CR&gt;&lt;NUL&gt;. The initial value for <br>
this toggle is FALSE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">crmod Toggle carriage return
mode. When this mode is enabled, most carriage return
characters received from the remote host will be mapped into
a carriage <br>
return followed by a line feed. This mode does not affect
those characters typed by the user, only those received from
the remote host. This mode is not <br>
very useful unless the remote host only sends carriage
return, but never line feeds. The initial value for this
toggle is FALSE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug Toggles socket level
debugging (useful only to the superuser). The initial value
for this toggle is FALSE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">encdebug Turns on debugging
information for the encryption code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">localchars If this is TRUE, then
the flush, interrupt, quit, erase, and kill characters (see
set above) are recognized locally, and transformed into
(hopefully) <br>
appropriate TELNET control sequences (respectively ao, ip,
brk, ec, and el; see send above). The initial value for this
toggle is TRUE in &lsquo;&lsquo;old line by <br>
line&rsquo;&rsquo; mode, and FALSE in
&lsquo;&lsquo;character at a time&rsquo;&rsquo; mode. When
the LINEMODE option is enabled, the value of localchars is
ignored, and assumed to always be <br>
TRUE. If LINEMODE has ever been enabled, then quit is sent
as abort, and eof and suspend are sent as eof and susp (see
send above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netdata Toggles the display of
all network data (in hexadecimal format). The initial value
for this toggle is FALSE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">options Toggles the display of
some internal telnet protocol processing (having to do with
TELNET options). The initial value for this toggle is
FALSE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prettydump When the netdata
toggle is enabled, if prettydump is enabled the output from
the netdata command will be formatted in a more user
readable format. Spaces <br>
are put between each character in the output, and the
beginning of any TELNET escape sequence is preceded by a
&rsquo;*&rsquo; to aid in locating them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skiprc When the skiprc toggle is
TRUE, TELNET skips the reading of the .telnetrc file in the
user&rsquo;s home directory when connections are opened. The
initial value <br>
for this toggle is FALSE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">termdata Toggles the display of
all terminal data (in hexadecimal format). The initial value
for this toggle is FALSE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbose_encrypt <br>
When the verbose_encrypt toggle is TRUE, telnet prints out a
message each time encryption is enabled or disabled. The
initial value for this toggle is <br>
FALSE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Displays the legal toggle
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">z Suspend telnet. This command
only works when the user is using the csh(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! [command] <br>
Execute a single command in a subshell on the local system.
If command is omitted, then an interactive subshell is
invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? [command] <br>
Get help. With no arguments, telnet prints a help summary.
If a command is specified, telnet will print the help
information for just that command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
telnet uses at least the HOME, SHELL, DISPLAY, and TERM
environment variables. Other environment variables may be
propagated to the other side via the TELNET ENVIRON
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.telnetrc user customized telnet startup values</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The telnet command appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
On some remote systems, echo has to be turned off manually
when in &lsquo;&lsquo;old line by line&rsquo;&rsquo;
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In &lsquo;&lsquo;old line by
line&rsquo;&rsquo; mode or LINEMODE the terminal&rsquo;s eof
character is only recognized (and sent to the remote system)
when it is the first character on a line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Source routing is not supported
yet for IPv6.</p>
