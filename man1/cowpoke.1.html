<p>COWPOKE(1) General Commands Manual COWPOKE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cowpoke - Build a Debian source package in a remote
cowbuilder instance</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cowpoke [options] packagename.dsc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Uploads a Debian source package to a cowbuilder host and
builds it, optionally also signing and uploading the result
to an incoming queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--arch=architecture <br>
Specify the Debian architecture(s) to build for. A space
separated list of architectures may be used to build for all
of them in a single pass. Valid arch names are <br>
those returned by dpkg-architecture(1) for
DEB_BUILD_ARCH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dist=distribution <br>
Specify the Debian distribution(s) to build for. A space
separated list of distributions may be used to build for all
of them in a single pass. Either codenames (such as <br>
sid, or squeeze) or distribution names (such as unstable, or
experimental) may be used, but you should usually stick to
using one or the other consistently as this name <br>
may be used in file paths and to locate old packages for
comparison reporting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is now also possible to use
locally defined names with this option, when used in
conjunction with the BASE_DIST option in a configuration
file. This permits the main&acirc; <br>
tenance and use of specially configured build chroots, which
can source package dependencies from the backports archives
or a local repository, or have other unusual con&acirc; <br>
figuration options set, without polluting the chroots you
use for clean package builds intended for upload to the main
repositories. See the description of BASE_DIST <br>
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--buildd=host <br>
Specify the remote host to build on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--buildd-user=name <br>
Specify the remote user to build as.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--create <br>
Create the remote cowbuilder root if it does not already
exist. If this option is not passed it is an error for the
specified --dist or --arch to not have an existing <br>
cowbuilder root in the expected location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --buildd-user must have
permission to create the RESULT_DIR on the build host, or an
admin with the necessary permission must first create it and
give that user (or <br>
some group they are in) write access to it, for this option
to succeed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--return=[path] <br>
Copy results of the build to path. If path is not specified,
then return them to the current directory. The given path
must exist, it will not be created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-return <br>
Do not copy results of the build to RETURN_DIR (overriding a
path set for it in the configuration files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dpkg-opts=&rsquo;opt1 opt2
...&rsquo; <br>
Specify additional options to be passed to
dpkg-buildpackage(1). Multiple options are delimited with
spaces. This will override any options specified in
DEBBUILDOPTS in <br>
the build host&rsquo;s pbuilderrc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--create-opts=&rsquo;cowbuilder
option&rsquo; <br>
Specify additional arguments to be passed verbatim to
cowbuilder when a chroot is first created (using the
--create option above). If multiple arguments need to be
passed, <br>
this option should be specified separately for each of
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E.g., --create-opts
&quot;--othermirror&quot; --create-opts &quot;deb http://
...&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option will override any
CREATE_OPTS specified for a chroot in the cowpoke
configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--update-opts=&rsquo;cowbuilder
option&rsquo; <br>
Specify additional arguments to be passed verbatim to
cowbuilder if the base of the chroot is updated. If multiple
arguments need to be passed, this option should be <br>
specified separately for each of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option will override any
UPDATE_OPTS specified for a chroot in the cowpoke
configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--build-opts=&rsquo;cowbuilder
option&rsquo; <br>
Specify additional arguments to be passed verbatim to
cowbuilder when a package build is performed. If multiple
arguments need to be passed, this option should be
speci&acirc; <br>
fied separately for each of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option will override any
BUILD_OPTS specified for a chroot in the cowpoke
configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sign=keyid <br>
Specify the key to sign packages with. This will override
any SIGN_KEYID specified for a chroot in the cowpoke
configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--upload=queue <br>
Specify the dput queue to upload signed packages to. This
will override any UPLOAD_QUEUE specified for a chroot in the
cowpoke configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Display a brief summary
of the available options and current configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Display the current version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION OPTIONS <br>
When cowpoke is run the following configuration options are
read from global, per-user, and per-project configuration
files if present. File paths may be absolute or relative,
<br>
the latter being relative to the BUILDD_USER&rsquo;s home
directory. Since the paths are typically quoted when used,
tilde expansion will not be performed on them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Global defaults <br>
These apply to every arch and dist in a single cowpoke
invocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUILDD_HOST <br>
The network address or fqdn of the build machine where
cowbuilder is configured. This may be overridden by the
--buildd command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUILDD_USER <br>
The unprivileged user name for operations on the build
machine. This defaults to the local name of the user
executing cowpoke (or to a username that is specified in
your <br>
SSH configuration for BUILDD_HOST), and may be overridden by
the --buildd-user command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUILDD_ARCH <br>
The Debian architecture(s) to build for. This must match the
DEB_BUILD_ARCH of the build chroot being used. It defaults
to the local machine architecture where cowpoke <br>
is executed, and may be overridden by the --arch command
line option. A (quoted) space separated list of
architectures may be used here to build for all of them in a
sin&acirc; <br>
gle pass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUILDD_DIST <br>
The Debian distribution(s) to build for. A (quoted) space
separated list of distributions may be used to build for all
of them in a single pass. This may be overridden <br>
by the --dist command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INCOMING_DIR <br>
The directory path on the build machine where the source
package will initially be placed. This must be writable by
the BUILDD_USER.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PBUILDER_BASE <br>
The filesystem root for all pbuilder CoW and result files.
Arch and dist specific subdirectories will normally be
created under this. The apt cache and temporary build <br>
directory will also be located under this path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGN_KEYID <br>
If this option is set, it is expected to contain the gpg key
ID to pass to debsign(1) if the packages are to be remotely
signed. You will be prompted to confirm whether <br>
you wish to sign the packages after all builds are complete.
If this option is unset or an empty string, no attempt to
sign packages will be made. It may be overridden <br>
on an arch and dist specific basis using the
arch_dist_SIGN_KEYID option described below, or
per-invocation with the --sign command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UPLOAD_QUEUE <br>
If this option is set, it is expected to contain a
&rsquo;host&rsquo; specification for dput(1) which will be
used to upload them after they are signed. You will be
prompted to con&acirc; <br>
firm whether you wish to upload the packages after they are
signed. If this option is unset or an empty string, no
attempt to upload packages will be made. If SIGN_KEYID <br>
is not set, this option will be ignored entirely. It may be
overridden on an arch and dist specific basis using the
arch_dist_UPLOAD_QUEUE option described below, or per- <br>
invocation with the --upload command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUILDD_ROOTCMD <br>
The command to use to gain root privileges on the remote
build machine. If unset the default is sudo(8). This is only
required to invoke cowbuilder and allow it to enter <br>
its chroot, so you may restrict this user to only being able
to run that command with escalated privileges. Something
like this in sudoers will enable invoking cowbuilder <br>
without an additional password entry required:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">youruser ALL = NOPASSWD:
/usr/sbin/cowbuilder</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively you could use SSH
with a forwarded key, or whatever other mechanism suits your
local access policy. Using su -c isn&rsquo;t really suitable
here due to its quot&acirc; <br>
ing requirements being somewhat different to the rest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBOOTSTRAP <br>
The utility to use when creating a new build root.
Alternatives are debootstrap or cdebootstrap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN_DIR <br>
If set, package files resulting from the build will be
copied to the path (local or remote) that this is set to,
after the build completes. The path must exist, it will <br>
not be created. This option is unset by default and can be
overridden with --return or --no-return.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arch and dist specific options
<br>
These are variables of the form: $arch_$dist_VAR which apply
only for a particular target arch/dist build.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arch_dist_RESULT_DIR <br>
The directory path on the build machine where the resulting
packages (source and binary) will be found, and where older
versions of the package that were built previously <br>
may be found. If any such older packages exist, debdiff will
be used to compare the new package with the previous version
after the build is complete, and the result will <br>
be included in the build log. Files in it must be readable
by the BUILDD_USER for sanity checking with lintian(1) and
debdiff(1), and for upload with dput(1). If this <br>
option is not specified for some arch and dist combination
then it will default to
$PBUILDER_BASE/$arch/$dist/result</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arch_dist_BASE_PATH <br>
The directory where the CoW master files are to be found (or
created if the --create command line option was passed). If
this option is not specified for some arch or <br>
dist then it will default to
$PBUILDER_BASE/$arch/$dist/base.cow</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arch_dist_BASE_DIST <br>
The code name to pass as the --distribution option for
cowbuilder instead of dist. This is necessary when dist is a
locally significant name assigned to some specially <br>
configured build chroot, such as
&rsquo;wheezy_backports&rsquo;, and not the formal suite
name of a distro release known to debootstrap. This option
cannot be overridden on the com&acirc; <br>
mand line, since it would rarely, if ever, make any sense to
change it for individual invocations of cowpoke. If this
option is not specified for an arch and dist combina&acirc;
<br>
tion then it will default to dist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arch_dist_CREATE_OPTS <br>
A bash array containing additional options to pass verbatim
to cowbuilder when this chroot is created for the first time
(using the --create option). This is useful when <br>
options like --othermirror are wanted to create specialised
chroot configurations such as
&rsquo;wheezy_backports&rsquo;. By default this is unset.
All values set in it will be <br>
overridden if the --create-opts option is passed on the
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each element in this array
corresponds to a single argument (in the ARGV sense) that
will be passed to cowbuilder. This ensures that arguments
which may contain white&acirc; <br>
space or have strange quoting requirements or other special
characters will not be mangled before they get to
cowbuilder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bash arrays are initialised
using the following form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTS=( &quot;arg1&quot;
&quot;arg 2&quot; &quot;--option&quot; &quot;value&quot;
&quot;--opt=val&quot; &quot;etc. etc.&quot; )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arch_dist_UPDATE_OPTS <br>
A bash array containing additional options to pass verbatim
to cowbuilder each time the base of this chroot is updated.
It behaves similarly to the CREATE_OPTS option <br>
above, except for acting when the chroot is updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arch_dist_BUILD_OPTS <br>
A bash array containing additional options to pass verbatim
to cowbuilder each time a package build is performed in this
chroot. This is useful when you want to use some <br>
option like --twice which cowpoke does not directly need to
care about. It otherwise behaves similarly to UPDATE_OPTS
above except that it acts during the build phase of <br>
cowbuilder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arch_dist_SIGN_KEYID <br>
An optional arch and dist specific override for the global
SIGN_KEYID option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arch_dist_UPLOAD_QUEUE <br>
An optional arch and dist specific override for the global
UPLOAD_QUEUE option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILES <br>
/etc/cowpoke.conf <br>
Global configuration options. Will override hardcoded
defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.cowpoke <br>
Per-user configuration options. Will override any global
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.cowpoke <br>
Per-project configuration options. Will override any
per-user or global configuration if cowpoke is called from
the directory where they exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the environment variable
COWPOKE_CONF is set, it specifies an additional
configuration file which will override all of those above.
Options specified explicitly on the <br>
command line override all configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COWBUILDER CONFIGURATION <br>
There is nothing particularly special required to configure
a cowbuilder instance for use with cowpoke. Simply create
them in the flavour you require with &lsquo;cowbuilder
--create&lsquo; <br>
according to the cowbuilder documentation, then configure
cowpoke with the user, arch, and path information required
to access it, on the machines you wish to invoke it from (or
<br>
alternatively configure cowpoke with the path, arch and
distribution information and pass the --create option to it
on the first invocation). The build host running cowbuilder
<br>
does not require cowpoke installed locally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The build machine should have
the lintian and devscripts packages installed for post-build
sanity checking. Upon completion, the build log and the
results of automated checks <br>
will be recorded in the INCOMING_DIR. If you wish to upload
signed packages the build machine will also need dput(1)
installed and configured to use the &rsquo;host&rsquo; alias
specified <br>
by UPLOAD_QUEUE. If rsync(1) is available on both the local
and build machine, then it will be used to transfer the
source package (this may save on some transfers of the <br>
orig.tar.* when building subsequent Debian revisions).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user executing cowpoke must
have SSH access to the build machine as the BUILDD_USER.
That user must be able to invoke cowbuilder as root by using
the BUILDD_ROOTCMD. Sign&acirc; <br>
ing keys are not required to be installed on the build
machine (and will be ignored there if they are). If the
package is signed, keys will be expected on the machine that
exe&acirc; <br>
cutes cowpoke.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When cowpoke is invoked, it will
first attempt to update the cowbuilder image if that has not
already been done on the same day. This is checked by the
presence or absence of a <br>
cowbuilder-$arch-$dist-update-log-$date file in the
INCOMING_DIR. You may move, remove, or touch this file if
you wish the image to be updated more or less often than
that. Its <br>
contents log the output of cowbuilder during the update (or
creation) of the build root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Since cowbuilder creates a chroot, and to do that you need
root, cowpoke also requires some degree of root access. So
all the horrible things that can go wrong with that may <br>
well one day rain down upon you. cowbuilder has been known
to accidentally wipe out bind-mounted filesystems outside
the chroot, and worse than that can easily happen. So be
<br>
careful, keep good backups of things you don&rsquo;t want to
lose on your build machine, and use cowpoke to keep all that
on a machine that isn&rsquo;t your bleeding edge dev box
with your <br>
last few hours of uncommitted work.</p>
