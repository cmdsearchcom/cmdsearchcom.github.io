<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
grdlandmask - &quot;Create a &quot;&quot;wet-dry&quot;&quot;
mask grid from shoreline data base&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
grdlandmask -Gmask_grd_file <br>
-Iincrement <br>
-Rregion [ -Amin_area[/min_level/max_level][+ag|i|s
|S][+r|l][ppercent] ] [ -Dresolution[+] ] [ -N ] [
-Nmaskvalues ] [ -V[level] ] [ -r ] [ -x[[-]n] ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: No space is allowed
between the option flag and the associated arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
grdlandmask reads the selected shoreline database and uses
that information to decide which nodes in the specified grid
are over land or over water. The nodes defined by the <br>
selected region and lattice spacing will be set according to
one of two criteria: (1) land vs water, or (2) the more
detailed (hierarchical) ocean vs land vs lake vs island vs
<br>
pond. The resulting mask may be used in subsequent
operations involving grdmath to mask out data from land [or
water] areas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIRED ARGUMENTS <br>
-Gmask_grd_file] <br>
Name of resulting output mask grid file. (See GRID FILE
FORMATS below).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ixinc[unit][+e|n][/yinc[unit][+e|n]]
<br>
x_inc [and optionally y_inc] is the grid spacing.
Optionally, append a suffix modifier. Geographical (degrees)
coordinates: Append m to indicate arc minutes or s to
indi&acirc; <br>
cate arc seconds. If one of the units e, f, k, M, n or u is
appended instead, the increment is assumed to be given in
meter, foot, km, Mile, nautical mile or US survey <br>
foot, respectively, and will be converted to the equivalent
degrees longitude at the middle latitude of the region (the
conversion depends on PROJ_ELLIPSOID). If y_inc is <br>
given but set to 0 it will be reset equal to x_inc;
otherwise it will be converted to degrees latitude. All
coordinates: If +e is appended then the corresponding max x
<br>
(east) or y (north) may be slightly adjusted to fit exactly
the given increment [by default the increment may be
adjusted slightly to fit the given domain]. Finally, <br>
instead of giving an increment you may specify the number of
nodes desired by appending +n to the supplied integer
argument; the increment is then recalculated from the <br>
number of nodes and the domain. The resulting increment
value depends on whether you have selected a
gridline-registered or pixel-registered grid; see
App-file-formats for <br>
details. Note: if -Rgrdfile is used then the grid spacing
has already been initialized; use -I to override the
values.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Rwest/east/south/north[/zmin/zmax][+r][+uunit]
<br>
west, east, south, and north specify the region of interest,
and you may specify them in decimal degrees or in
[&Acirc;&plusmn;]dd:mm[:ss.xxx][W|E|S|N] format Append +r if
lower left <br>
and upper right map coordinates are given instead of
w/e/s/n. The two shorthands -Rg and -Rd stand for global
domain (0/360 and -180/+180 in longitude respectively, with
<br>
-90/+90 in latitude). Alternatively for grid creation, give
Rcodelon/lat/nx/ny, where code is a 2-character combination
of L, C, R (for left, center, or right) and T, M, <br>
B for top, middle, or bottom. e.g., BL for lower left. This
indicates which point on a rectangular region the lon/lat
coordinate refers to, and the grid dimensions nx and <br>
ny with grid spacings via -I is used to create the
corresponding region. Alternatively, specify the name of an
existing grid file and the -R settings (and grid spacing,
<br>
if applicable) are copied from the grid. Appending +uunit
expects projected (Cartesian) coordinates compatible with
chosen -J and we inversely project to determine actual <br>
rectangular geographic region. For perspective view (-p),
optionally append /zmin/zmax. In case of perspective view
(-p), a z-range (zmin, zmax) can be appended to indi&acirc;
<br>
cate the third dimension. This needs to be done only when
using the -Jz option, not when using only the -p option. In
the latter case a perspective view of the plane is <br>
plotted, with no third dimension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS <br>

-Amin_area[/min_level/max_level][+ag|i|s|S][+r|l][+ppercent]
<br>
Features with an area smaller than min_area in km^2 or of
hierarchical level that is lower than min_level or higher
than max_level will not be plotted [Default is 0/0/4 <br>
(all features)]. Level 2 (lakes) contains regular lakes and
wide river bodies which we normally include as lakes; append
+r to just get river-lakes or +l to just get reg&acirc; <br>
ular lakes. By default (+ai) we select the ice shelf
boundary as the coastline for Antarctica; append +ag to
instead select the ice grounding line as coastline. For <br>
expert users who wish to print their own Antarctica
coastline and islands via psxy you can use +as to skip all
GSHHG features below 60S or +aS to instead skip all features
<br>
north of 60S. Finally, append +ppercent to exclude polygons
whose percentage area of the corresponding full-resolution
feature is less than percent. See GSHHG INFORMATION <br>
below for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dresolution[+] <br>
Selects the resolution of the data set to use ((f)ull,
(h)igh, (i)ntermediate, (l)ow, or (c)rude). The resolution
drops off by ~80% between data sets. [Default is l]. <br>
Append + to automatically select a lower resolution should
the one requested not be available [abort if not found].
Alternatively, choose (a)uto to automatically select <br>
the best resolution given the chosen region. Note that
because the coastlines differ in details a node in a mask
file using one resolution is not guaranteed to remain <br>
inside [or outside] when a different resolution is
selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Indicate that nodes that fall
exactly on a polygon boundary should be considered to be
outside the polygon [Default considers them to be
inside].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Nmaskvalues <br>
Sets the values that will be assigned to nodes. Values can
be any number, including the textstring NaN. Also select -E
to let nodes exactly on feature boundaries be con&acirc;
<br>
sidered outside [Default is inside]. Specify this
information using 1 of 2 formats:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Nwet/dry.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Nocean/land/lake/island/pond.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Default is 0/1/0/1/0 (i.e.,
0/1)].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V[level] (more &acirc;&brvbar;)
<br>
Select verbosity level [c].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r (more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Set pixel node registration [gridline].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x[[-]n] (more &acirc;&brvbar;)
<br>
Limit number of cores used in multi-threaded algorithms
(OpenMP required).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-^ or just - <br>
Print a short message about the syntax of the command, then
exits (NOTE: on Windows just use -).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+ or just + <br>
Print an extensive usage (help) message, including the
explanation of any module-specific option (but not the GMT
common options), then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? or no arguments <br>
Print a complete usage (help) message, including the
explanation of all options, then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRID FILE FORMATS <br>
By default GMT writes out grid as single precision floats in
a COARDS-complaint netCDF file format. However, GMT is able
to produce grid files in many other commonly used grid <br>
file formats and also facilitates so called
&acirc;packing&acirc; of grids, writing out floating point
data as 1- or 2-byte integers. To specify the precision,
scale and offset, the user <br>
should add the suffix =ID[+sscale][+ooffset][+ninvalid],
where ID is a two-letter identifier of the grid type and
precision, and scale and offset are optional scale factor
and <br>
offset to be applied to all grid values, and invalid is the
value used to indicate missing data. See grdconvert and
Section grid-file-format of the GMT Technical Reference and
<br>
Cookbook for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When writing a netCDF file, the
grid is stored by default with the variable name
&acirc;z&acirc;. To specify another variable name varname,
append ?varname to the file name. Note that you <br>
may need to escape the special meaning of ? in your shell
program by putting a backslash in front of it, or by placing
the filename and suffix between quotes or double quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To set all nodes on land to NaN, and nodes over water to 1,
using the high resolution data set, do</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt grdlandmask
-R-60/-40/-40/-30 -Dh -I5m -N1/NaN -Gland_mask.nc -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make a 1x1 degree global grid
with the hierarchical levels of the nodes based on the low
resolution data:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt grdlandmask -R0/360/-90/90
-Dl -I1 -N0/1/2/3/4 -Glevels.nc -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GSHHS INFORMATION <br>
The coastline database is GSHHG (formerly GSHHS) which is
compiled from three sources: World Vector Shorelines (WVS),
CIA World Data Bank II (WDBII), and Atlas of the Cryosphere
<br>
(AC, for Antarctica only). Apart from Antarctica, all
level-1 polygons (ocean-land boundary) are derived from the
more accurate WVS while all higher level polygons (level
2-4, <br>
representing land/lake, lake/island-in-lake, and
island-in-lake/lake-in-island-in-lake boundaries) are taken
from WDBII. The Antarctica coastlines come in two flavors:
ice-front <br>
or grounding line, selectable via the -A option. Much
processing has taken place to convert WVS, WDBII, and AC
data into usable form for GMT: assembling closed polygons
from <br>
line segments, checking for duplicates, and correcting for
crossings between polygons. The area of each polygon has
been determined so that the user may choose not to draw
fea&acirc; <br>
tures smaller than a minimum area (see -A); one may also
limit the highest hierarchical level of polygons to be
included (4 is the maximum). The 4 lower-resolution
databases were <br>
derived from the full resolution database using the
Douglas-Peucker line-simplification algorithm. The
classification of rivers and borders follow that of the
WDBII. See the GMT <br>
Cookbook and Technical Reference Appendix K for further
details.</p>
