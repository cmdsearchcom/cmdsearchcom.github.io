<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tic - the terminfo entry-description compiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tic [-01CDGIKLNTUVacfgrstx] [-e names] [-o dir] [-R subset]
[-v[n]] [-w[n]] file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The tic command translates a terminfo file from source
format into compiled format. The compiled format is
necessary for use with the library routines in
ncurses(3X).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As described in term(5), the
database may be either a directory tree (one file per
terminal entry) or a hashed database (one record per entry).
The tic command writes only one <br>
type of entry, depending on how it was built:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; For directory
trees, the top-level directory, e.g., /usr/share/terminfo,
specifies the location of the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; For hashed
databases, a filename is needed. If the given file is not
found by that name, but can be found by adding the suffix
&quot;.db&quot;, then that is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default name for the hashed
database is the same as the default directory name (only
adding a &quot;.db&quot; suffix).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In either case (directory or
hashed database), tic will create the container if it does
not exist. For a directory, this would be the
&quot;terminfo&quot; leaf, versus a &quot;terminfo.db&quot;
<br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The results are normally placed
in the system terminfo database /usr/share/terminfo. The
compiled terminal description can be placed in a different
terminfo database. There are <br>
two ways to achieve this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; First, you may
override the system default either by using the -o option,
or by setting the variable TERMINFO in your shell
environment to a valid database location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Secondly, if tic
cannot write in /usr/share/terminfo or the location
specified using your TERMINFO variable, it looks for the
directory $HOME/.terminfo (or hashed database <br>
$HOME/.terminfo.db); if that location exists, the entry is
placed there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Libraries that read terminfo
entries are expected to check in succession</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a location
specified with the TERMINFO environment variable,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
$HOME/.terminfo,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; directories
listed in the TERMINFO_DIRS environment variable,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a compiled-in
list of directories (no default value), and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the system
terminfo database (/usr/share/terminfo).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-0 restricts the output to a single line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 restricts the output to a
single column</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a tells tic to retain
commented-out capabilities rather than discarding them.
Capabilities are commented by prefixing them with a period.
This sets the -x option, because <br>
it treats the commented-out entries as user-defined names.
If the source is termcap, accept the 2-character names
required by version 6. Otherwise these are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Force source translation to
termcap format. Note: this differs from the -C option of
infocmp(1M) in that it does not merely translate capability
names, but also trans&acirc; <br>
lates terminfo strings to termcap format. Capabilities that
are not translatable are left in the entry under their
terminfo names but commented out with two preceding <br>
dots. The actual format used incorporates some improvements
for escaped characters from terminfo format. For a stricter
BSD-compatible translation, add the -K option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c tells tic to only check file
for errors, including syntax problems and bad use links. If
you specify -C (-I) with this option, the code will print
warnings about entries <br>
which, after use resolution, are more than 1023 (4096) bytes
long. Due to a fixed buffer length in older termcap
libraries, as well as buggy checking for the buffer <br>
length (and a documented limit in terminfo), these entries
may cause core dumps with other implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D tells tic to print the
database locations that it knows about, and exit. The first
location shown is the one to which it would write compiled
terminal descriptions. If <br>
tic is not able to find a writable database location
according to the rules summarized above, it will print a
diagnostic and exit with an error rather than printing a
list <br>
of database locations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e names <br>
Limit writes and translations to the following
comma-separated list of terminals. If any name or alias of a
terminal matches one of the names in the list, the entry
will <br>
be written or translated as normal. Otherwise no output will
be generated for it. The option value is interpreted as a
file containing the list if it contains a &rsquo;/&rsquo;.
<br>
(Note: depending on how tic was compiled, this option may
require -I or -C.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Display complex terminfo
strings which contain if/then/else/endif expressions
indented for readability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Display constant literals in
decimal form rather than their character equivalents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Display constant character
literals in quoted form rather than their decimal
equivalents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Force source translation to
terminfo format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K Suppress some longstanding
ncurses extensions to termcap format, e.g., &quot;or
space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Force source translation to
terminfo format using the long C variable names listed in
&lt;term.h&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Disable smart defaults.
Normally, when translating from termcap to terminfo, the
compiler makes a number of assumptions about the defaults of
string capabilities <br>
reset1_string, carriage_return, cursor_left, cursor_down,
scroll_forward, tab, newline, key_backspace, key_left, and
key_down, then attempts to use obsolete termcap capa&acirc;
<br>
bilities to deduce correct values. It also normally
suppresses output of obsolete termcap capabilities such as
bs. This option forces a more literal translation that <br>
also preserves the obsolete capabilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-odir Write compiled entries to
given database location. Overrides the TERMINFO environment
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Rsubset <br>
Restrict output to a given subset. This option is for use
with archaic versions of terminfo like those on SVr1,
Ultrix, or HP/UX that do not support the full set of <br>
SVR4/XSI Curses terminfo; and outright broken ports like AIX
3.x that have their own extensions incompatible with
SVr4/XSI. Available subsets are &quot;SVr1&quot;,
&quot;Ultrix&quot;, &quot;HP&quot;, <br>
&quot;BSD&quot; and &quot;AIX&quot;; see terminfo(5) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Force entry resolution (so
there are no remaining tc capabilities) even when doing
translation to termcap format. This may be needed if you are
preparing a termcap file <br>
for a termcap library (such as GNU termcap through version
1.3 or BSD termcap through 4.3BSD) that does not handle
multiple tc capabilities per entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Summarize the compile by
showing the database location into which entries are
written, and the number of entries which are compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T eliminates size-restrictions
on the generated text. This is mainly useful for testing and
analysis, since the compiled descriptions are limited (e.g.,
1023 for termcap, <br>
4096 for terminfo).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t tells tic to discard
commented-out capabilities. Normally when translating from
terminfo to termcap, untranslatable capabilities are
commented-out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U tells tic to not post-process
the data after parsing the source file. Normally, it infers
data which is commonly missing in older terminfo data, or in
termcaps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V reports the version of
ncurses which was used in this program, and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vn specifies that (verbose)
output be written to standard error trace information
showing tic&rsquo;s progress. The optional parameter n is a
number from 1 to 10, inclusive, indi&acirc; <br>
cating the desired level of detail of information. If n is
omitted, the default level is 1. If n is specified and
greater than 1, the level of detail is increased.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The debug flag levels are as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Names of files created and
linked</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Information related to the
&lsquo;&lsquo;use&rsquo;&rsquo; facility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Statistics from the hashing
algorithm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 String-table memory
allocations</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7 Entries into the
string-table</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8 List of tokens encountered by
scanner</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9 All values computed in
construction of the hash table</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the debug level n is not
given, it is taken to be one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wn specifies the width of the
output. The parameter is optional. If it is omitted, it
defaults to 60.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Treat unknown capabilities as
user-defined. That is, if you supply a capability name which
tic does not recognize, it will infer its type (boolean,
number or string) from <br>
the syntax and make an extended table entry for that.
User-defined capability strings whose name begins with
&lsquo;&lsquo;k&rsquo;&rsquo; are treated as function
keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS <br>
file contains one or more terminfo terminal descriptions in
source format [see terminfo(5)]. Each description in the
file describes the capabilities of a particular
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If file is
&lsquo;&lsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo;, then the data is read from
the standard input. The file parameter may also be the path
of a character-device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROCESSING <br>
All but one of the capabilities recognized by tic are
documented in terminfo(5). The exception is the use
capability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a use=entry-name field is
discovered in a terminal entry currently being compiled, tic
reads in the binary from /usr/share/terminfo to complete the
entry. (Entries created <br>
from file will be used first. tic duplicates the
capabilities in entry-name for the current entry, with the
exception of those capabilities that explicitly are defined
in the <br>
current entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an entry, e.g.,
entry_name_1, contains a use=entry_name_2 field, any
canceled capabilities in entry_name_2 must also appear in
entry_name_1 before use= for these capabili&acirc; <br>
ties to be canceled in entry_name_1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Total compiled entries cannot
exceed 4096 bytes. The name field cannot exceed 512 bytes.
Terminal names exceeding the maximum alias length (32
characters on systems with long <br>
filenames, 14 characters otherwise) will be truncated to the
maximum alias length and a warning message will be
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY <br>
There is some evidence that historic tic implementations
treated description fields with no whitespace in them as
additional aliases or short names. This tic does not do
that, <br>
but it does warn when description fields may be treated that
way and check them for dangerous characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENSIONS <br>
Unlike the SVr4 tic command, this implementation can
actually compile termcap sources. In fact, entries in
terminfo and termcap syntax can be mixed in a single source
file. See <br>
terminfo(5) for the list of termcap names taken to be
equivalent to terminfo names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SVr4 manual pages are not
clear on the resolution rules for use capabilities. This
implementation of tic will find use targets anywhere in the
source file, or anywhere in <br>
the file tree rooted at TERMINFO (if TERMINFO is defined),
or in the user&rsquo;s $HOME/.terminfo database (if it
exists), or (finally) anywhere in the system&rsquo;s file
tree of compiled <br>
entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The error messages from this tic
have the same format as GNU C error messages, and can be
parsed by GNU Emacs&rsquo;s compile facility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -0, -1, -C, -G, -I, -N, -R,
-T, -V, -a, -e, -f, -g, -o, -r, -s, -t and -x options are
not supported under SVr4. The SVr4 -c mode does not report
bad use links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">System V does not compile
entries to or read entries from your $HOME/.terminfo
database unless TERMINFO is explicitly set to it.</p>
