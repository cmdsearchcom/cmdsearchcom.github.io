<p>PERL5203DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL5203DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5203delta - what is new for perl v5.20.3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.20.2
release and the 5.20.3 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.20.1, first read perl5202delta,
which describes differences between 5.20.1 and 5.20.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.20.2.
If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit
a report. See &quot;Reporting Bugs&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
Updated Modules and Pragmata <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Errno has been upgraded from version 1.20_05
to 1.20_06.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add -P to the pre-processor
command-line on GCC 5. GCC added extra line directives,
breaking parsing of error code definitions. [perl #123784]
<br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123784&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Module::CoreList
has been upgraded from version 5.20150214 to 5.20150822.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Updated to cover the latest
releases of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; perl5db.pl has
been upgraded from 1.44 to 1.44_01.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The debugger would cause an
assertion failure. [perl #124127]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=124127&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documentation <br>
Changes to Existing Documentation <br>
perlfunc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Mention that
&quot;study()&quot; is currently a no-op.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlguts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The OOK example
has been updated to account for COW changes and a change in
the storage of the offset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlhacktips</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Documentation
has been added illustrating the perils of assuming the
contents of static memory pointed to by the return values of
Perl wrappers for C library functions <br>
doesn&rsquo;t change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlpodspec</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
specification of the POD language is changing so that the
default encoding of PODs that aren&rsquo;t in UTF-8 (unless
otherwise indicated) is CP1252 instead of ISO-8859-1 <br>
(Latin1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Utility Changes <br>
h2ph <br>
&Acirc;&middot; h2ph now handles hexadecimal constants in
the compiler&rsquo;s predefined macro definitions, as
visible in $Config{cppsymbols}. [perl #123784] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123784&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Testing <br>
&Acirc;&middot; t/perf/taint.t has been added to see if
optimisations with taint issues are keeping things fast.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
t/porting/re_context.t has been added to test that utf8 and
its dependencies only use the subset of the
&quot;$1..$n&quot; capture vars that Perl_save_re_context()
is hard-coded to <br>
localize, because that function has no efficient way of
determining at runtime what vars to localize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Support <br>
Platform-Specific Notes <br>
Win32 <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Previously, when compiling with a 64-bit
Visual C++, every Perl XS module (including CPAN ones) and
Perl aware C file would unconditionally have around a dozen
warnings <br>
from hv_func.h. These warnings have been silenced. GCC (all
bitness) and 32-bit Visual C++ were not affected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; miniperl.exe is
now built with -fno-strict-aliasing, allowing 64-bit builds
to complete with GCC 4.8. [perl #123976]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123976&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Repeated global pattern matches in scalar
context on large tainted strings were exponentially slow
depending on the current match position in the string. [perl
#123202] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123202&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The original
visible value of $/ is now preserved when it is set to an
invalid value. Previously if you set $/ to a reference to an
array, for example, perl would produce a <br>
runtime error and not set PL_rs, but Perl code that checked
$/ would see the array reference. [perl #123218]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123218&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl 5.14.0
introduced a bug whereby &quot;eval { LABEL: }&quot; would
crash. This has been fixed. [perl #123652]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123652&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Extending an
array cloned from a parent thread could result in
&quot;Modification of a read-only value attempted&quot;
errors when attempting to modify the new elements. [perl
<br>
#124127]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=124127&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Several cases of
data used to store environment variable contents in core C
code being potentially overwritten before being used have
been fixed. [perl #123748] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123748&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; UTF-8 variable
names used in array indexes, unquoted UTF-8 HERE-document
terminators and UTF-8 function names all now work correctly.
[perl #124113] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=124113&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A subtle bug
introduced in Perl 5.20.2 involving UTF-8 in regular
expressions and sometimes causing a crash has been fixed. A
new test script has been added to test this <br>
fix; see under &quot;Testing&quot;. [perl #124109]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=124109&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Some patterns
starting with &quot;/.*..../&quot; matched against long
strings have been slow since Perl 5.8, and some of the form
&quot;/.*..../i&quot; have been slow since Perl 5.18. They
are <br>
now all fast again. [perl #123743]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123743&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Warning fatality
is now ignored when rewinding the stack. This prevents
infinite recursion when the now fatal error also causes
rewinding of the stack. [perl #123398] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123398&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;setpgrp($nonzero)&quot; (with one argument) was
accidentally changed in Perl 5.16 to mean setpgrp(0). This
has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A crash with
&quot;%::=(); J-&gt;${</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Regular
expression possessive quantifier Perl 5.20 regression now
fixed.
&quot;qr/&quot;PAT&quot;{&quot;min,max&quot;}+&quot;&quot;/&quot;
is supposed to behave identically to
&quot;qr/(?&gt;&quot;PAT&quot;{&quot;min,max&quot;})/&quot;.
Since <br>
Perl 5.20, this didn&rsquo;t work if min and max were equal.
[perl #125825]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125825&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Code like
&quot;/$a[/&quot; used to read the next line of input and
treat it as though it came immediately after the opening
bracket. Some invalid code consequently would parse and <br>
run, but some code caused crashes, so this is now
disallowed. [perl #123712]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123712&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acknowledgements <br>
Perl 5.20.3 represents approximately 7 months of development
since Perl 5.20.2 and contains approximately 3,200 lines of
changes across 99 files from 26 authors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Excluding auto-generated files,
documentation and release tools, there were approximately
1,500 lines of changes to 43 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl continues to flourish into
its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and
developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that <br>
became Perl 5.20.3:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alex Vandiver, Andy Dougherty,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list above is almost
certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from
version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much <br>
appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl
bug tracker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the changes included in
this version originated in the CPAN modules included in
Perl&rsquo;s core. We&rsquo;re grateful to the entire CPAN
community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a more complete list of all
of Perl&rsquo;s historical contributors, please see the
AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at https://rt.perl.org/
. There <br>
may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl
Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the bug you are reporting has
security implications, which make it inappropriate to send
to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to
<br>
perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the
core committers, who will be able to help assess the impact
<br>
of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the
release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use <br>
this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for
modules independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
