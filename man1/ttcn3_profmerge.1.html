<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ttcn3_profmerge - TTCN-3 profiler and code coverage merge
tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ttcn3_profmerge [ -pc ] [ -o file ] [ -s file ] [ -f filter
] db_file1 [ db_file2 ... ] <br>
or <br>
ttcn3_profmerge -v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page is a quick reference for the TTCN-3
profmerge utility of the TTCN-3 Test Executor. The
ttcn3_profmerge utility, which can be found in
$TTCN3_DIR/bin, merges all <br>
input files (profiler databases) given in the command
argument into a single output file. It can also generate
profiler statistics from the merged database. <br>
Since there are two possible outputs, neither of them are
written to the standard output. <br>
It is useful for test suites that are run on multiple Host
Controllers (in parallel mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Available command line switches are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Discards profiler data from
the merged database. All execution times will be set to zero
in the output database file, and statistics related to
execution times will not <br>
be generated (both profiler and code coverage data cannot be
discarded, since there would be no data left).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Discards code coverage data
from the merged database. All execution counts will be set
to zero in the output database file, and statistics related
to execution counts <br>
will not be generated (both profiler and code coverage data
cannot be discarded, since there would be no data left).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o file Prints the output
(merged) database to the specified file. At least one output
file (this or the statistics file) must be set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s file Prints statistics for
the merged database into the specified file. At least one
output file (this or the output database file) must be
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filter Specifies which
statistics entries are generated. The filter is a
hexadecimal number, the last 25 bits each correspond to the
25 entries in the statistics file (the <br>
least significant bit corresponds to the first entry, and so
on). The filter is ignored if the statistics file is not
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Prints version and license
key information and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
TTCN3_DIR <br>
The installation directory where the uncompressed binary
package of the TTCN-3 Test Executor can be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TTCN3_LICENSE_FILE <br>
Points to the file (NB: not the directory) that contains the
personalized license key for the current user or host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
None known at this time</p>
