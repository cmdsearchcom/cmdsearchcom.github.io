<p>virt-resize(1) Virtualization Support virt-resize(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
virt-resize - Resize a virtual machine disk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
virt-resize [--resize /dev/sdaN=[+/-]&lt;size&gt;[%]] <br>
[--expand /dev/sdaN] [--shrink /dev/sdaN] <br>
[--ignore /dev/sdaN] [--delete /dev/sdaN] [...] indisk
outdisk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Virt-resize is a tool which can resize a virtual machine
disk, making it larger or smaller overall, and resizing or
deleting any partitions contained within.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Virt-resize cannot resize disk
images in-place. Virt-resize should not be used on live
virtual machines - for consistent results, shut the virtual
machine down before resizing <br>
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are not familiar with the
associated tools: virt-filesystems(1) and virt-df(1), we
recommend you go and read those manual pages first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. Copy &quot;olddisk&quot; to &quot;newdisk&quot;,
extending one of the guest&rsquo;s partitions to fill the
extra 5GB of space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">virt-filesystems --long -h --all
-a olddisk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">truncate -r olddisk newdisk <br>
truncate -s +5G newdisk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Note &quot;/dev/sda2&quot; is
a partition inside the &quot;olddisk&quot; file. <br>
virt-resize --expand /dev/sda2 olddisk newdisk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. As above, but make the /boot
partition 200MB bigger, while giving the remaining space to
/dev/sda2:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">virt-resize --resize
/dev/sda1=+200M --expand /dev/sda2 olddisk newdisk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. As in the first example, but
expand a logical volume as the final step. This is what you
would typically use for Linux guests that use LVM:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">virt-resize --expand /dev/sda2
--LV-expand /dev/vg_guest/lv_root olddisk newdisk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. As in the first example, but
the output format will be qcow2 instead of a raw disk:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qemu-img create -f qcow2 -o
preallocation=metadata newdisk.qcow2 15G <br>
virt-resize --expand /dev/sda2 olddisk newdisk.qcow2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DETAILED USAGE <br>
EXPANDING A VIRTUAL MACHINE DISK <br>
1. Shut down the virtual machine <br>
2. Locate input disk image <br>
Locate the input disk image (ie. the file or device on the
host containing the guest&rsquo;s disk). If the guest is
managed by libvirt, you can use &quot;virsh dumpxml&quot;
like this to <br>
find the disk image name:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># virsh dumpxml guestname |
xpath /domain/devices/disk/source <br>
Found 1 nodes: <br>
-- NODE -- <br>
&lt;source dev=&quot;/dev/vg/lv_guest&quot; /&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Look at current sizing <br>
Use virt-filesystems(1) to display the current partitions
and sizes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># virt-filesystems --long
--parts --blkdevs -h -a /dev/vg/lv_guest <br>
Name Type Size Parent <br>
/dev/sda1 partition 101M /dev/sda <br>
/dev/sda2 partition 7.9G /dev/sda <br>
/dev/sda device 8.0G -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(This example is a virtual
machine with an 8 GB disk which we would like to expand up
to 10 GB).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Create output disk <br>
Virt-resize cannot do in-place disk modifications. You have
to have space to store the resized output disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To store the resized disk image
in a file, create a file of a suitable size:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># rm -f outdisk <br>
# truncate -s 10G outdisk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or use lvcreate(1) to create a
logical volume:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># lvcreate -L 10G -n lv_name
vg_name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or use virsh(1) vol-create-as to
create a libvirt storage volume:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># virsh pool-list <br>
# virsh vol-create-as poolname newvol 10G</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Resize <br>
virt-resize takes two mandatory parameters, the input disk
(eg. device, file, or a URI to a remote disk) and the output
disk. The output disk is the one created in the <br>
previous step.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># virt-resize indisk outdisk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command just copies disk
image &quot;indisk&quot; to disk image &quot;outdisk&quot;
without resizing or changing any existing partitions. If
&quot;outdisk&quot; is larger, then an extra, empty <br>
partition is created at the end of the disk covering the
extra space. If &quot;outdisk&quot; is smaller, then it will
give an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More realistically you&rsquo;d
want to expand existing partitions in the disk image by
passing extra options (for the full list see the
&quot;OPTIONS&quot; section below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--expand&quot; is the most
useful option. It expands the named partition within the
disk to fill any extra space:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># virt-resize --expand /dev/sda2
indisk outdisk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(In this case, an extra
partition is not created at the end of the disk, because
there will be no unused space).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;--resize&quot; is the
other commonly used option. The following would increase the
size of /dev/sda1 by 200M, and expand /dev/sda2 to fill the
rest of the available space:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># virt-resize --resize
/dev/sda1=+200M --expand /dev/sda2 indisk outdisk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the expanded partition in the
image contains a filesystem or LVM PV, then if virt-resize
knows how, it will resize the contents, the equivalent of
calling a command such <br>
as pvresize(8), resize2fs(8), ntfsresize(8), btrfs(8) or
xfs_growfs(8). However virt-resize does not know how to
resize some filesystems, so you would have to online resize
<br>
them after booting the guest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># virt-resize --expand /dev/sda2
nbd://example.com outdisk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The input disk can be a URI, in
order to use a remote disk as the source. The URI format is
compatible with guestfish. See &quot;ADDING REMOTE
STORAGE&quot; in guestfish(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other options are covered
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Test <br>
Thoroughly test the new disk image before discarding the old
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are using libvirt, edit
the XML to point at the new disk:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># virsh edit guestname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change &lt;source ...&gt;, see
http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsDisks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then start up the domain with
the new, resized disk:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># virsh start guestname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and check that it still works.
See also the &quot;NOTES&quot; section below for additional
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. Resize LVs etc inside the
guest <br>
(This can also be done offline using guestfish(1))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once the guest has booted you
should see the new space available, at least for filesystems
that virt-resize knows how to resize, and for PVs. The user
may need to resize LVs <br>
inside PVs, and also resize filesystem types that
virt-resize does not know how to expand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHRINKING A VIRTUAL MACHINE DISK
<br>
Shrinking is somewhat more complex than expanding, and only
an overview is given here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Firstly virt-resize will not
attempt to shrink any partition content (PVs, filesystems).
The user has to shrink content before passing the disk image
to virt-resize, and virt- <br>
resize will check that the content has been shrunk
properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Shrinking can also be done
offline using guestfish(1))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After shrinking PVs and
filesystems, shut down the guest, and proceed with steps 3
and 4 above to allocate a new disk image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then run virt-resize with any of
the --shrink and/or --resize options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IGNORING OR DELETING PARTITIONS
<br>
virt-resize also gives a convenient way to ignore or delete
partitions when copying from the input disk to the output
disk. Ignoring a partition speeds up the copy where you <br>
don&rsquo;t care about the existing contents of a partition.
Deleting a partition removes it completely, but note that it
also renumbers any partitions after the one which is
deleted, <br>
which can leave some guests unbootable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QCOW2 AND NON-SPARSE RAW FORMATS
<br>
If the input disk is in qcow2 format, then you may prefer
that the output is in qcow2 format as well. Alternately,
virt-resize can convert the format on the fly. The output
<br>
format is simply determined by the format of the empty
output container that you provide. Thus to create qcow2
output, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qemu-img create -f qcow2 -o
preallocation=metadata outdisk [size]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">instead of the truncate
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, to get non-sparse raw
output use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fallocate -l size outdisk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(on older systems that
don&rsquo;t have the fallocate(1) command use &quot;dd
if=/dev/zero of=outdisk bs=1M count=..&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGICAL PARTITIONS <br>
Logical partitions (a.k.a. /dev/sda5+ on disks using DOS
partition tables) cannot be resized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To understand what is going on,
firstly one of the four partitions /dev/sda1-4 will have MBR
partition type 05 or &quot;0f&quot;. This is called the
extended partition. Use <br>
virt-filesystems(1) to see the MBR partition type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logical partitions live inside
the extended partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The extended partition can be
expanded, but not shrunk (unless you force it, which is not
advisable). When the extended partition is copied across,
all the logical partitions <br>
contained inside are copied over implicitly. Virt-resize
does not look inside the extended partition, so it copies
the logical partitions blindly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You cannot specify a logical
partition (/dev/sda5+) at all on the command line. Doing so
will give an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--help <br>
Display help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--align-first auto <br>
--align-first never <br>
--align-first always <br>
Align the first partition for improved performance (see also
the --alignment option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is --align-first
auto which only aligns the first partition if it is safe to
do so. That is, only when we know how to fix the bootloader
automatically, and at <br>
the moment that can only be done for Windows guests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--align-first never means we
never move the first partition. This is the safest option.
Try this if the guest does not boot after resizing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--align-first always means we
always align the first partition (if it needs to be
aligned). For some guests this will break the bootloader,
making the guest unbootable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--alignment N <br>
Set the alignment of partitions to &quot;N&quot; sectors.
The default in virt-resize &lt; 1.13.19 was 64 sectors, and
after that is 128 sectors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assuming 512 byte sector size
inside the guest, here are some suitable values for
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--alignment 1 (512 bytes) <br>
The partitions would be packed together as closely as
possible, but would be completely unaligned. In some cases
this can cause very poor performance. See <br>
virt-alignment-scan(1) for further details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--alignment 8 (4K) <br>
This would be the minimum acceptable alignment for
reasonable performance on modern hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--alignment 128 (64K) <br>
This alignment provides good performance when the host is
using high end network storage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--alignment 2048 (1M) <br>
This is the standard alignment used by all newly installed
guests since around 2008.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--colors <br>
--colours <br>
Use ANSI colour sequences to colourize messages. This is the
default when the output is a tty. If the output of the
program is redirected to a file, ANSI colour sequences <br>
are disabled unless you use this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d <br>
--debug <br>
(Deprecated: use -v option instead)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enable debugging messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug-gc <br>
Debug garbage collection and memory allocation. This is only
useful when debugging memory problems in virt-resize or the
OCaml libguestfs bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--delete part <br>
Delete the named partition. It would be more accurate to
describe this as &quot;don&rsquo;t copy it over&quot;, since
virt-resize doesn&rsquo;t do in-place changes and the
original disk image is <br>
left intact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that when you delete a
partition, then anything contained in the partition is also
deleted. Furthermore, this causes any partitions that come
after to be renumbered, <br>
which can easily make your guest unbootable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can give this option
multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--expand part <br>
Expand the named partition so it uses up all extra space
(space left over after any other resize changes that you
request have been done).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If virt-resize knows how, it
will expand the direct content of the partition. For
example, if the partition is an LVM PV, it will expand the
PV to fit (like calling <br>
pvresize(8)). Virt-resize leaves any other content it
doesn&rsquo;t know about alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently virt-resize can
resize:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; ext2, ext3 and
ext4 filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; NTFS
filesystems, if libguestfs was compiled with support for
NTFS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filesystem must have been
shut down consistently last time it was used. Additionally,
ntfsresize(8) marks the resized filesystem as requiring a
consistency check, so <br>
at the first boot after resizing Windows will check the
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; LVM PVs
(physical volumes). virt-resize does not usually resize
anything inside the PV, but see the --LV-expand option. The
user could also resize LVs as desired after <br>
boot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Btrfs
filesystems, if libguestfs was compiled with support for
btrfs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; XFS filesystems,
if libguestfs was compiled with support for XFS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that you cannot use
--expand and --shrink together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--format raw <br>
Specify the format of the input disk image. If this flag is
not given then it is auto-detected from the image
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If working with untrusted
raw-format guest disk images, you should ensure the format
is always specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this option does not
affect the output format. See &quot;QCOW2 AND NON-SPARSE RAW
FORMATS&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore part <br>
Ignore the named partition. Effectively this means the
partition is allocated on the destination disk, but the
content is not copied across from the source disk. The <br>
content of the partition will be blank (all zero bytes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can give this option
multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--LV-expand logvol <br>
This takes the logical volume and, as a final step, expands
it to fill all the space available in its volume group. A
typical usage, assuming a Linux guest with a single PV <br>
/dev/sda2 and a root device called /dev/vg_guest/lv_root
would be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">virt-resize indisk outdisk
--expand /dev/sda2 --LV-expand /dev/vg_guest/lv_root</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This would first expand the
partition (and PV), and then expand the root device to fill
the extra space in the PV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The contents of the LV are also
resized if virt-resize knows how to do that. You can stop
virt-resize from trying to expand the content by using the
option <br>
--no-expand-content.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use virt-filesystems(1) to list
the filesystems in the guest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can give this option
multiple times, but it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to do this
unless the logical volumes you specify are all in different
volume groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--machine-readable <br>
This option is used to make the output more machine friendly
when being parsed by other programs. See &quot;MACHINE
READABLE OUTPUT&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n <br>
--dryrun <br>
Print a summary of what would be done, but don&rsquo;t do
anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-copy-boot-loader <br>
By default, virt-resize copies over some sectors at the
start of the disk (up to the beginning of the first
partition). Commonly these sectors contain the Master Boot
Record <br>
(MBR) and the boot loader, and are required in order for the
guest to boot correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify this flag, then
this initial copy is not done. You may need to reinstall the
boot loader in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-extra-partition <br>
By default, virt-resize creates an extra partition if there
is any extra, unused space after all resizing has happened.
Use this option to prevent the extra partition from <br>
being created. If you do this then the extra space will be
inaccessible until you run fdisk, parted, or some other
partitioning tool in the guest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if the surplus space
is smaller than 10 MB, no extra partition will be
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-expand-content <br>
By default, virt-resize will try to expand the direct
contents of partitions, if it knows how (see --expand option
above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you give the
--no-expand-content option then virt-resize will not attempt
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-sparse <br>
Turn off sparse copying. See &quot;SPARSE COPYING&quot;
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ntfsresize-force <br>
Pass the --force option to ntfsresize(8), allowing resizing
even if the NTFS disk is marked as needing a consistency
check. You have to use this option if you want to resize
<br>
a Windows guest multiple times without booting into Windows
between each resize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--output-format raw <br>
Specify the format of the output disk image. If this flag is
not given then it is auto-detected from the image
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If working with untrusted
raw-format guest disk images, you should ensure the format
is always specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this option does not
create the output format. This option just tells libguestfs
what it is so it doesn&rsquo;t try to guess it. You still
need to create the output <br>
disk with the right format. See &quot;QCOW2 AND NON-SPARSE
RAW FORMATS&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q <br>
--quiet <br>
Don&rsquo;t print the summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resize part=size <br>
Resize the named partition (expanding or shrinking it) so
that it has the given size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;size&quot; can be
expressed as an absolute number followed by b/K/M/G to mean
bytes, Kilobytes, Megabytes, or Gigabytes; or as a
percentage of the current size; or as a relative <br>
number or percentage. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resize /dev/sda2=10G</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resize /dev/sda4=90%</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resize /dev/sda2=+1G</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resize /dev/sda2=-200M</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resize /dev/sda1=+128K</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resize /dev/sda1=+10%</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resize /dev/sda1=-10%</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can increase the size of any
partition. Virt-resize will expand the direct content of the
partition if it knows how (see --expand above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can only decrease the size
of partitions that contain filesystems or PVs which have
already been shrunk. Virt-resize will check this has been
done before proceeding, or <br>
else will print an error (see also --resize-force).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can give this option
multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resize-force part=size <br>
This is the same as --resize except that it will let you
decrease the size of any partition. Generally this means you
will lose any data which was at the end of the <br>
partition you shrink, but you may not care about that (eg.
if shrinking an unused partition, or if you can easily
recreate it such as a swap partition).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the --ignore
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--shrink part <br>
Shrink the named partition until the overall disk image fits
in the destination. The named partition must contain a
filesystem or PV which has already been shrunk using <br>
another tool (eg. guestfish(1) or other online tools).
Virt-resize will check this and give an error if it has not
been done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The amount by which the overall
disk must be shrunk (after carrying out all other operations
requested by the user) is called the &quot;deficit&quot;.
For example, a straight copy <br>
(assume no other operations) from a 5GB disk image to a 4GB
disk image results in a 1GB deficit. In this case,
virt-resize would give an error unless the user specified a
<br>
partition to shrink and that partition had more than a
gigabyte of free space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that you cannot use
--expand and --shrink together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unknown-filesystems ignore
<br>
--unknown-filesystems warn <br>
--unknown-filesystems error <br>
Configure the behaviour of virt-resize when asking to expand
a filesystem, and neither libguestfs has the support it, nor
virt-resize knows how to expand the content of the <br>
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unknown-filesystems ignore
will cause virt-resize to silently ignore such filesystems,
and nothing is printed about them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unknown-filesystems warn (the
default behaviour) will cause virt-resize to warn for each
of the filesystem that cannot be expanded, but still
continuing to resize the disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unknown-filesystems error will
cause virt-resize to error out at the first filesystem that
cannot be expanded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also
&quot;unknown/unavailable method for expanding the TYPE
filesystem on DEVICE/LV&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
--verbose <br>
Enable debugging messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
--version <br>
Display version number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Enable tracing of libguestfs
API calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MACHINE READABLE OUTPUT <br>
The --machine-readable option can be used to make the output
more machine friendly, which is useful when calling
virt-resize from other programs, GUIs etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two ways to use this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Firstly use the option on its
own to query the capabilities of the virt-resize binary.
Typical output looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ virt-resize --machine-readable
<br>
virt-resize <br>
ntfsresize-force <br>
32bitok <br>
ntfs <br>
btrfs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A list of features is printed,
one per line, and the program exits with status 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Secondly use the option in
conjunction with other options to make the regular program
output more machine friendly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the moment this means:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Progress bar messages can be
parsed from stdout by looking for this regular
expression:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^[0-9]+/[0-9]+$</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The calling program should
treat messages sent to stdout (except for progress bar
messages) as status messages. They can be logged and/or
displayed to the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The calling program should
treat messages sent to stderr as error messages. In
addition, virt-resize exits with a non-zero status code if
there was a fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Versions of the program prior to
1.13.9 did not support the --machine-readable option and
will return an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
&quot;Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary.&quot;
<br>
Virt-resize aligns partitions to multiples of 128 sectors
(see the --alignment parameter). Usually this means the
partitions will not be aligned to the ancient CHS geometry.
<br>
However CHS geometry is meaningless for disks manufactured
since the early 1990s, and doubly so for virtual hard
drives. Alignment of partitions to cylinders is not required
by <br>
any modern operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GUEST BOOT STUCK AT
&quot;GRUB&quot; <br>
If a Linux guest does not boot after resizing, and the boot
is stuck after printing &quot;GRUB&quot; on the console, try
reinstalling grub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">guestfish -i -a newdisk <br>
&gt;&lt;fs&gt; cat /boot/grub/device.map <br>
# check the contents of this file are sensible or <br>
# edit the file if necessary <br>
&gt;&lt;fs&gt; grub-install / /dev/vda <br>
&gt;&lt;fs&gt; exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more flexible guest
reconfiguration, including if you need to specify other
parameters to grub-install, use virt-rescue(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESIZING WINDOWS BOOT PARTITIONS
<br>
In Windows Vista and later versions, Microsoft switched to
using a separate boot partition. In these VMs, typically
/dev/sda1 is the boot partition and /dev/sda2 is the main
<br>
(C:) drive. Resizing the first (boot) partition causes the
bootloader to fail with 0xC0000225 error. Resizing the
second partition (ie. C: drive) should work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINDOWS CHKDSK <br>
Windows disks which use NTFS must be consistent before
virt-resize can be used. If the ntfsresize operation fails,
try booting the original VM and running &quot;chkdsk
/f&quot; on all <br>
NTFS partitions, then shut down the VM cleanly. For further
information see:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=975753</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After resize Windows may
initiate a lengthy &quot;chkdsk&quot; on first boot if NTFS
partitions have been expanded. This is just a safety check
and (unless it find errors) is nothing to <br>
worry about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINDOWS UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME
BSOD <br>
After sysprepping a Windows guest and then resizing it with
virt-resize, you may see the guest fail to boot with an
&quot;UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME&quot; BSOD. This error is
caused by <br>
having &quot;ExtendOemPartition=1&quot; in the sysprep.inf
file. Removing this line before sysprepping should fix the
problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINDOWS 8 <br>
Windows 8 &quot;fast startup&quot; can prevent virt-resize
from resizing NTFS partitions. See &quot;WINDOWS HIBERNATION
AND WINDOWS 8 FAST STARTUP&quot; in guestfs(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPARSE COPYING <br>
You should create a fresh, zeroed target disk image for
virt-resize to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Virt-resize by default performs
sparse copying. This means that it does not copy blocks from
the source disk which are all zeroes. This improves speed
and efficiency, but will <br>
produce incorrect results if the target disk image contains
unzeroed data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main time this can be a
problem is if the target is a host partition (eg.
&quot;virt-resize&Acirc;&nbsp;source.img&Acirc;&nbsp;/dev/sda4&quot;)
because the usual partitioning tools tend to leave whatever
data <br>
happened to be on the disk before.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have to reuse a target
which contains data already, you should use the --no-sparse
option. Note this can be much slower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;unknown/unavailable method
for expanding the TYPE filesystem on DEVICE/LV&quot; <br>
Virt-resize was asked to expand a partition or a logical
volume containing a filesystem with the type
&quot;TYPE&quot;, but there is no available nor known
expanding method for that <br>
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This may be due to either of the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. There corresponding
filesystem is not available in libguestfs, because there is
no proper package in the host with utilities for it. This is
usually the case for &quot;btrfs&quot;, <br>
&quot;ntfs&quot;, and &quot;xfs&quot; filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Check the results of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">virt-resize --machine-readable
<br>
guestfish -a /dev/null run : available <br>
guestfish -a /dev/null run : filesystem_available TYPE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case, it is enough to
install the proper packages adding support for them. For
example, &quot;libguestfs-xfs&quot; on Red Hat Enterprise
Linux, CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, and <br>
distributions derived from them, for supporting the
&quot;xfs&quot; filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Virt-resize has no support
for expanding that type of filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case, there&rsquo;s
nothing that can be done to let virt-resize expand that type
of filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In both cases, virt-resize will
not expand the mentioned filesystem; the result (unless
--unknown-filesystems error is specified) is that the
partitions containing such <br>
filesystems will be actually bigger as requested, but the
filesystems will still be usable at the their older
sizes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALTERNATIVE TOOLS <br>
There are several proprietary tools for resizing partitions.
We won&rsquo;t mention any here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">parted(8) and its graphical
shell gparted can do some types of resizing operations on
disk images. They can resize and move partitions, but I
don&rsquo;t think they can do anything <br>
with the contents, and they certainly don&rsquo;t understand
LVM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">guestfish(1) can do everything
that virt-resize can do and a lot more, but at a much lower
level. You will probably end up hand-calculating sector
offsets, which is something <br>
that virt-resize was designed to avoid. If you want to see
the guestfish-equivalent commands that virt-resize runs, use
the --debug flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dracut(8) includes a module
called &quot;dracut-modules-growroot&quot; which can be used
to grow the root partition when the guest first boots up.
There is documentation for this module <br>
in an associated README file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
This program returns 0 if successful, or non-zero if there
was an error.</p>
