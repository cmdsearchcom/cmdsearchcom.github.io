btool_faq - Frequently-Asked Questions about btparse and Text::BibTeX
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document attempts to address questions that I have been asked several
  times, and are easy to answer -- but not by perusing the documentation. For
  various reasons, the answers tend to be thinly distributed across several man
  pages, making it difficult to figure out what's going on. Hence, this man page
  will attempt to tie together various strands of thought, providing quick,
  focused, &quot;How do I do X?&quot; answers as opposed to lengthy descriptions
  of the capabilities and conventions of the btOOL libraries.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PERL_LIBRARY"><a class="selflink" href="#PERL_LIBRARY">PERL

This section covers questions that users of &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot;, the Perl
  component of <b>btOOL</b>, have asked.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Why_aren't_the_BibTeX_&quot;month&quot;_macros_defined?"><a class="selflink" href="#Why_aren't_the_BibTeX_&quot;month&quot;_macros_defined?">Why
  aren't the BibTeX &quot;month&quot; macros defined?</a></h2>
Because they're bibliography-specific, and &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; by default
  doesn't impose any assumptions about a particular type of database or
  data-processing domain on your entries. The problem arises when you parse
  entries from a file, say <i>foo.bib</i> that quite sensibly use the month
  macros (&quot;jan&quot;, &quot;feb&quot;, etc.) provided by the BibTeX
  standard style files:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   $bibfile = Text::BibTeX::File-&gt;new('foo.bib')    # open file
      or die &quot;foo.bib: $!\n&quot;;
   $entry = Text::BibTeX::Entry-&gt;new($bibfile);     # parse first entry
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Using this code, you might get an &quot;undefined macro&quot; warning for every
  entry parsed from <i>foo.bib</i>. Apart from the superficial annoyance of all
  those warning messages, the undefined macros are expanded as empty strings,
  meaning you lose any information about them---not good.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You could always kludge it and forcibly define the month macros yourself. Prior
  to release 0.30, this had to be done by parsing a set of fake entries, but now
  &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; provides a direct interface to the underlying macro
  table. You <i>could</i> just do this before parsing any entries:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   use Text::BibTeX qw(:macrosubs);
   # ...
   my %month = (jan =&gt; 'January', feb =&gt; 'February', ... );
   add_macro_text ($macro, $value) 
      while (($macro, $value) = each %month);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
But there's a better way that's more in keeping with how things are done under
  BibTeX (where default macros are defined in the style file): use
  &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot;'s object-oriented analogue to style files, called
  structure modules. &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; provides a structure module,
  &quot;Text::BibTeX::Bib&quot;, that (partially) emulates the standard style
  files of BibTeX 0.99, including the definition of month macros. Structure
  modules are specified on a per-file basis by using the
  &quot;set_structure&quot; method on a &quot;Text::BibTeX::File&quot; object.
  It's quite simple to tell &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; that entries from $bibfile
  are expected to conform to the &quot;Bib&quot; structure (which is implemented
  by the &quot;Text::BibTeX::Bib&quot; module, but you don't really need to know
  that):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   $bibfile = Text::BibTeX::File-&gt;new('foo.bib')
      or die &quot;foo.bib: $!\n&quot;;
   $bibfile-&gt;set_structure ('Bib');
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You probably shouldn't hardcode the name of a particular structure in your
  programs, though, as there will eventually be a multitude of structure modules
  to choose from (just as there are a multitude of BibTeX style files to choose
  from). My preferred approach is to make the structure a command-line option
  which defaults to &quot;Bib&quot; (since that's the only structure actually
  implemented as of this writing).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_do_I_append_to_a_BibTeX_file?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_do_I_append_to_a_BibTeX_file?">How
  do I append to a BibTeX file?</a></h2>
Just open it in append mode, and write entries to it as usual. Remember, a
  &quot;Text::BibTeX::File&quot; object is mainly a wrapper around an
  &quot;IO::File&quot; object, and the &quot;Text::BibTeX::File::open&quot;
  method (and thus &quot;new&quot; as well) is just a front-end to
  &quot;IO::File::open&quot;. &quot;IO::File::open&quot;, in turn, is a
  front-end either to Perl's builtin &quot;open&quot; (if called with one
  argument) or &quot;sysopen&quot; (two or three arguments). To save you the
  trouble of going off and reading all those man pages, here's the trick: if you
  pass just a filename to &quot;Text::BibTeX::File&quot;'s &quot;new&quot;
  method, then it's treated just like a filename passed to Perl's builtin
  &quot;open&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   my $append_file = Text::BibTeX::File-&gt;new(&quot;&gt;&gt;$filename&quot;)
      or die &quot;couldn't open $filename for appending: $!\n&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
opens $filename for appending. If, later on, you have an entry from another file
  (say $entry), then you can append it to $append_file by just writing it as
  usual:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   $entry-&gt;write ($append_file);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
See &quot;append_entries&quot; in the <i>examples/</i> subdirectory of the
  &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; distribution for a complete example.
