<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
btool_faq - Frequently-Asked Questions about btparse and
Text::BibTeX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document attempts to address questions that I have been
asked several times, and are easy to answer -- but not by
perusing the documentation. For various reasons, the <br>
answers tend to be thinly distributed across several man
pages, making it difficult to figure out what&rsquo;s going
on. Hence, this man page will attempt to tie together
various <br>
strands of thought, providing quick, focused, &quot;How do I
do X?&quot; answers as opposed to lengthy descriptions of
the capabilities and conventions of the btOOL libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL LIBRARY <br>
This section covers questions that users of
&quot;Text::BibTeX&quot;, the Perl component of btOOL, have
asked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Why aren&rsquo;t the BibTeX
&quot;month&quot; macros defined? <br>
Because they&rsquo;re bibliography-specific, and
&quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; by default doesn&rsquo;t impose any
assumptions about a particular type of database or
data-processing domain on your entries. <br>
The problem arises when you parse entries from a file, say
foo.bib that quite sensibly use the month macros
(&quot;jan&quot;, &quot;feb&quot;, etc.) provided by the
BibTeX standard style files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$bibfile =
Text::BibTeX::File-&gt;new(&rsquo;foo.bib&rsquo;) # open
file <br>
or die &quot;foo.bib: $!0; <br>
$entry = Text::BibTeX::Entry-&gt;new($bibfile); # parse
first entry</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using this code, you might get
an &quot;undefined macro&quot; warning for every entry
parsed from foo.bib. Apart from the superficial annoyance of
all those warning messages, the <br>
undefined macros are expanded as empty strings, meaning you
lose any information about them---not good.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You could always kludge it and
forcibly define the month macros yourself. Prior to release
0.30, this had to be done by parsing a set of fake entries,
but now &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; <br>
provides a direct interface to the underlying macro table.
You could just do this before parsing any entries:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Text::BibTeX qw(:macrosubs);
<br>
# ... <br>
my %month = (jan =&gt; &rsquo;January&rsquo;, feb =&gt;
&rsquo;February&rsquo;, ... ); <br>
add_macro_text ($macro, $value) <br>
while (($macro, $value) = each %month);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But there&rsquo;s a better way
that&rsquo;s more in keeping with how things are done under
BibTeX (where default macros are defined in the style file):
use &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot;&rsquo;s object-oriented <br>
analogue to style files, called structure modules.
&quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; provides a structure module,
&quot;Text::BibTeX::Bib&quot;, that (partially) emulates the
standard style files of BibTeX <br>
0.99, including the definition of month macros. Structure
modules are specified on a per-file basis by using the
&quot;set_structure&quot; method on a
&quot;Text::BibTeX::File&quot; object. It&rsquo;s <br>
quite simple to tell &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; that entries
from $bibfile are expected to conform to the &quot;Bib&quot;
structure (which is implemented by the
&quot;Text::BibTeX::Bib&quot; module, but you <br>
don&rsquo;t really need to know that):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$bibfile =
Text::BibTeX::File-&gt;new(&rsquo;foo.bib&rsquo;) <br>
or die &quot;foo.bib: $!0; <br>
$bibfile-&gt;set_structure (&rsquo;Bib&rsquo;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You probably shouldn&rsquo;t
hardcode the name of a particular structure in your
programs, though, as there will eventually be a multitude of
structure modules to choose from (just as <br>
there are a multitude of BibTeX style files to choose from).
My preferred approach is to make the structure a
command-line option which defaults to &quot;Bib&quot; (since
that&rsquo;s the only <br>
structure actually implemented as of this writing).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How do I append to a BibTeX
file? <br>
Just open it in append mode, and write entries to it as
usual. Remember, a &quot;Text::BibTeX::File&quot; object is
mainly a wrapper around an &quot;IO::File&quot; object, and
the <br>
&quot;Text::BibTeX::File::open&quot; method (and thus
&quot;new&quot; as well) is just a front-end to
&quot;IO::File::open&quot;. &quot;IO::File::open&quot;, in
turn, is a front-end either to Perl&rsquo;s builtin
&quot;open&quot; (if <br>
called with one argument) or &quot;sysopen&quot; (two or
three arguments). To save you the trouble of going off and
reading all those man pages, here&rsquo;s the trick: if you
pass just a <br>
filename to &quot;Text::BibTeX::File&quot;&rsquo;s
&quot;new&quot; method, then it&rsquo;s treated just like a
filename passed to Perl&rsquo;s builtin
&quot;open&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $append_file =
Text::BibTeX::File-&gt;new(&quot;&gt;&gt;$filename&quot;)
<br>
or die &quot;couldn&rsquo;t open $filename for appending:
$!0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">opens $filename for appending.
If, later on, you have an entry from another file (say
$entry), then you can append it to $append_file by just
writing it as usual:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$entry-&gt;write
($append_file);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;append_entries&quot;
in the examples/ subdirectory of the
&quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; distribution for a complete
example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C LIBRARY <br>
This section covers frequently-asked questions about
btparse, the C component of btOOL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Is there a Python binding for
btparse yet? <br>
Not that I know of. I haven&rsquo;t written one. If you do
so, please let me know about it.</p>
