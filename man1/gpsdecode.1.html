This tool is a batch-mode decoder for NMEA and various binary packet formats
  associated with GPS, AIS, and differential-correction services. It produces a
  JSON dump on standard output from binary on standard input. The JSON is the
  same format documented in <b>gpsd</b>(8); this tool uses the same decoding
  logic as gpsd, but with a simpler interface intended for batch processing of
  data files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All sensor-input formats known to the GPSD project can be decoded by this tool.
  These include: NMEA, AIVDM (the NMEA-derived sentence format used by AIS, the
  marine Automatic Identification System), RTCM2, and all supported GPS binary
  formats (notably including SiRF). See <b>gpsd</b>(8) for applicable standards
  and known limitations of the decoding logic.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can use this tool with <b>nc</b>(1) to examine AIS feeds from AIS pooling
  services, RTCM feeds from RTCM receivers or NTRIP broadcasters.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The <b>-d</b> option tells the program to decode packets presented on standard
  input to standard output. This is the default behavior.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-j</b> explicitly sets the output dump format to JSON (the default
  behavior).
<div class="Pp"></div>
With the <b>-m</b> option, dump minimum lengths for each packet type in the
  input (ignoring comment packets). This is probably of interest only to GSD
  developers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-n</b> enables dumping in generated pseudo-NME0183.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-e</b> option option tells the program to encode JSON on standard input
  to JSON on standard output. This option is only useful for regression-testing
  of the JSON dumping and parsing code.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-s</b> option option tells the program to report AIS Type 24 sentence
  halves separately rather than attempting to aggregate them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-t</b> accepts a comma-separated list of numeric types. Packets with a
  numeric AIS, RTCM2, or RTCM3 type are passed through and output only if they
  match a type in the list. Packets of other kinds (in particular GPS packets)
  are passed through unconditionally.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-u</b> suppresses scaling of AIS data to float quantities and text
  expansion of numeric codes. A dump with this option is lossless.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-v</b> enables dumping of textual packets to output as they are received
  on input, immediately preceding corresponding output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-c</b> sets the AIS dump format to separate fields with an ASCII pipe
  symbol. Fields are dumped in the order they occur in the AIS packet. Numerics
  are not scaled (-u is forced). Strings are unpacked from six-bit to full ASCII
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-V</b> option directs the program to emit its version number, then exit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-D</b> option sets a debug verbosity level. It is mainly of interest to
  developers.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="AIS_DSV_FORMAT"><a class="selflink" href="#AIS_DSV_FORMAT">AIS
  DSV FORMAT</a></h1>
With the <b>-c</b> option, dump lines are values of AIS payload fields,
  pipe-separated, in the order that they occur in the payload. Spans of fields
  expressing a date are emitted as an ISO8601 timestamp (look for colons and the
  trailing Z indicating Zulu/UTC time), and the 19-bit group of TDMA status
  fields found at the end of message types 1-4 are are dumped as a single
  unsigned integer (in hex preceded by &quot;0x&quot;). Unused
  regional-authority fields are also dumped (in hex preceded by &quot;0x&quot;).
  Variable-length binary fields are dumped as an integer bit length, followed by
  a colon, followed by a hex dump.
