<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gpsdecode - decode GPS, RTCM or AIS streams into a readable
format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gpsdecode [-c] [-d] [-e] [-j] [-m] [-n] [-s] [-t typelist]
[-u] [-v] [-D debuglevel] [-V]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This tool is a batch-mode decoder for NMEA and various
binary packet formats associated with GPS, AIS, and
differential-correction services. It produces a JSON dump on
standard <br>
output from binary on standard input. The JSON is the same
format documented in gpsd(8); this tool uses the same
decoding logic as gpsd, but with a simpler interface
intended for <br>
batch processing of data files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All sensor-input formats known
to the GPSD project can be decoded by this tool. These
include: NMEA, AIVDM (the NMEA-derived sentence format used
by AIS, the marine Automatic <br>
Identification System), RTCM2, and all supported GPS binary
formats (notably including SiRF). See gpsd(8) for applicable
standards and known limitations of the decoding logic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use this tool with nc(1)
to examine AIS feeds from AIS pooling services, RTCM feeds
from RTCM receivers or NTRIP broadcasters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The -d option tells the program to decode packets presented
on standard input to standard output. This is the default
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -j explicitly sets the
output dump format to JSON (the default behavior).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the -m option, dump minimum
lengths for each packet type in the input (ignoring comment
packets). This is probably of interest only to GSD
developers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -n enables dumping in
generated pseudo-NME0183.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -e option option tells the
program to encode JSON on standard input to JSON on standard
output. This option is only useful for regression-testing of
the JSON dumping and <br>
parsing code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -s option option tells the
program to report AIS Type 24 sentence halves separately
rather than attempting to aggregate them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -t accepts a comma-separated
list of numeric types. Packets with a numeric AIS, RTCM2, or
RTCM3 type are passed through and output only if they match
a type in the list. <br>
Packets of other kinds (in particular GPS packets) are
passed through unconditionally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -u suppresses scaling of AIS
data to float quantities and text expansion of numeric
codes. A dump with this option is lossless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -v enables dumping of
textual packets to output as they are received on input,
immediately preceding corresponding output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -c sets the AIS dump format
to separate fields with an ASCII pipe symbol. Fields are
dumped in the order they occur in the AIS packet. Numerics
are not scaled (-u is forced). <br>
Strings are unpacked from six-bit to full ASCII</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -V option directs the
program to emit its version number, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -D option sets a debug
verbosity level. It is mainly of interest to developers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AIS DSV FORMAT <br>
With the -c option, dump lines are values of AIS payload
fields, pipe-separated, in the order that they occur in the
payload. Spans of fields expressing a date are emitted as an
<br>
ISO8601 timestamp (look for colons and the trailing Z
indicating Zulu/UTC time), and the 19-bit group of TDMA
status fields found at the end of message types 1-4 are are
dumped <br>
as a single unsigned integer (in hex preceded by
&quot;0x&quot;). Unused regional-authority fields are also
dumped (in hex preceded by &quot;0x&quot;). Variable-length
binary fields are dumped as an <br>
integer bit length, followed by a colon, followed by a hex
dump.</p>
