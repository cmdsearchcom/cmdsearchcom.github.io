<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTION USAGE <br>
Obsolete options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-filter n]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options available only in older
versions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-chroma wx wy rx ry gx gy bx
by] [-phys x y unit] [-time [yy]yy-mm-dd <br>
hh:mm:ss]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimum unique abbreviation of
option is acceptable. You may use double hyphens instead of
single hyphen to denote options. You may use white space in
place of the equals sign <br>
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmtopng reads a PNM image as
input and produces a PNG image as output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Color component values in PNG
files are either eight or sixteen bits wide, so pnmtopng
will automatically scale colors to have a maxval of 255 or
65535.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a grayscale image, pnmtopng
produces a PNG bit depth 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16. When the input
image has a small maxval, the output PNG image has a
correspondingly small bit depth. <br>
But in mapping the PNM maxval to the PNG maxval (which is by
definition the maximum value that can be represented in the
number of bits), a fair amount of distortion happens with
<br>
these low maxvals. For example, with a PNM maxval of 5 and a
PNG maxval of 7, the input sample 2 becomes the output
sample 3. The input brightness is 2/5 = .40, while the
out&acirc; <br>
put brightness is 3/7 = .43. Note that this is not a problem
if you view the maxval as a precision, because in .4 and .43
are identical within the precision implied by maxval 5. <br>
Indeed, if you convert this PNG back to a maxval 5 PGM, the
pixel&rsquo;s value will again be 2, exactly as it was
originally. But if you need precisely the same colors in the
output <br>
PNG as in the input PNM, make sure your input PNM has a
maxval which is a power of two minus one. If you can&rsquo;t
do that, then convert it with pamdepth to something with a
large <br>
maxval that is a power of two minus one (255 and 65535 are
good choices) to minimize the error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
pnmtopng changed in Netpbm 10.30 (October 2005) to use the
standard Netpbm command line syntax. Before that, you could
not use double hyphens to denote an option and could not
<br>
use an equal sign to separate an option name from its value.
And the options had to come before the non-option program
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, the options
-chroma, -phys, and -time were replaced by -rgb, size, and
-modtime, respectively. The only difference, taking
-phys/-size as an example, is that -phys <br>
takes multiple program arguments as the option argument,
whereas -rgb takes a single program argument which is
composed of multiple words. E.g. The old shell command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmtopng -phys 800 800 0
input.pnm &gt;output.png</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is equivalent to the new shell
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmtopng -size &rsquo;800 800
0&rsquo; input.pnm &gt;output.png</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re writing a
program that needs to work with both new and old pnmtopng,
have it first try with the new syntax, and if it fails with
&rsquo;unrecognized option,&rsquo; fall back to the <br>
old syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Display the format of the output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-downscale <br>
Enables scaling of maxvalues of more then 65535 to 16 bit.
Since <br>
this means loss of image data, pnmtopng does not do it by
<br>
default..TP -interlace <br>
Creates an interlaced PNG file (Adam7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-alpha=filename <br>
This specifies the transparency (alpha channel) of the
image. You supply the alpha channel as a standard PGM alpha
mask (see the PGM(1) <br>
specification. pnmtopng does not necessarily represents the
transparency information as an alpha channel in the PNG
format. If it can represent the transparency infor&acirc;
<br>
mation through a palette, it will do so in order to make a
smaller PNG file. pnmtopng even sorts the palette so it can
omit the opaque colors from the transparency part <br>
of the palette and save space for the palette.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-transparent=color <br>
pnmtopng marks the specified color as transparent in the PNG
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify the color (color) as
described for the argument of the ppm_parsecolor() library
routine &acirc;&uml;libppm.html#colorname&acirc;&copy; .
E.g. red or rgb:ff/00/0d. If the color you <br>
specify is not present in the image, pnmtopng selects
instead the color in the image that is closest to the one
you specify. Closeness is measured as a Cartesian distance
<br>
between colors in RGB space. If multiple colors are
equidistant, pnmtopng chooses one of them arbitrarily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if you prefix your
color specification with &rsquo;=&rsquo;, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-transparent =red</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">only the exact color you specify
will be transparent. If that color does not appear in the
image, there will be no transparency. pnmtopng issues an
information message <br>
when this is the case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-background=color <br>
Causes pnmtopng to create a background color chunk in the
PNG output which can be used for subsequent alpha channel or
transparent color conversions. Specify color the <br>
same as for -transparent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-palette=palettefile <br>
This option specifies a palette to use in the PNG. It forces
pnmtopng to create the paletted (colormapped) variety of PNG
-- if that isn&rsquo;t possible, pnmtopng fails. If <br>
the palette you specify doesn&rsquo;t contain exactly the
colors in the image, pnmtopng fails. Since pnmtopng will
automatically generate a paletted PNG, with a correct
pal&acirc; <br>
ette, when appropriate, the only reason you would specify
the -palette option is if you care in what order the colors
appear in the palette. The PNG palette has colors in <br>
the same order as the palette you specify.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You specify the palette by
naming a PPM file that has one pixel for each color in the
palette.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, consider the case
that have a palette and you want to make sure your PNG
contains only colors from the palette, approximating if
necessary. You don&rsquo;t care <br>
what indexes the PNG uses internally for the colors (i.e.
the order of the PNG palette). In this case, you don&rsquo;t
need -palette. Pass the Netpbm input image and your
pal&acirc; <br>
ette PPM through pnmremap. Though you might think it would,
using -palette in this case wouldn&rsquo;t even save
pnmtopng any work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gamma=value <br>
Causes pnmtopng to create a gAMA chunk. This information
helps describe how the color values in the PNG must be
interpreted. Without the gAMA chunk, whatever interprets
<br>
the PNG must get this information separately (or just assume
something standard). If your input is a true PPM or PGM
image, you should specify -gamma=.45. But sometimes <br>
people generate images which are ostensibly PPM except the
image uses a different gamma transfer function than the one
specified for PPM. A common case of this is when <br>
the image is created by simple hardware that doesn&rsquo;t
have digital computational ability. Also, some simple
programs that generate images from scratch do it with a
gamma <br>
transfer in which the gamma value is 1.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hist Use this parameter to
create a chunk that specifies the frequency (or histogram)
of the colors in the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rgb=chroma_list <br>
This option specifies how red, green, and blue component
values of a pixel specify a particular color, by telling the
chromaticities of those 3 primary illuminants and of <br>
white (i.e. full strength of all three).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The chroma_list value is a
blank-separated list of 8 floating point decimal numbers.
The CIE-1931 X and Y chromaticities (in that order) of each
of white, red, green, and <br>
blue, in that order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This information goes into the
PNG&rsquo;s cHRM chunk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a shell command, make sure
you use quotation marks so that the blanks in chroma_list
don&rsquo;t make the shell see multiple command
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.30 (October 2005). Before that, the option -chroma does
the same thing, but with slightly different syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-size=&rsquo;x y unit&rsquo;
<br>
This option determines the aspect ratio of the individual
pixels of your image as well as the physical resolution of
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unit is either 0 or 1. When it
is 1, the option specifies the physical resolution of the
image in pixels per meter. For example, -size=&rsquo;10000
15000 1&rsquo; means that when <br>
someone displays the image, he should make it so that 10,000
pixels horizontally occupy 1 meter and 15,000 pixels
vertically occupy one meter. And even if he doesn&rsquo;t
take <br>
this advice on the overall size of the displayed image, he
should at least make it so that each pixel displays as 1.5
times as high as wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When unit is 0, that means there
is no advice on the absolute physical resolution; just on
the ratio of horizontal to vertical physical resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This information goes into the
PNG&rsquo;s pHYS chunk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you don&rsquo;t specify
-size, pnmtopng creates the image with no pHYS chunk, which
means square pixels of no absolute resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.30 (October 2005). Before that, the option -phys does the
same thing, but with slightly different syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-text=filename <br>
This option lets you include comments in the text chunk of
the PNG output. file is the name of a file that contains
your text comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an example of a comment
file: <br>
Title PNG file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Author Bryan Henderson</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description how to include a
text chunk <br>
PNG file <br>
&quot;Creation date&quot; 3-feb-1987</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Software pnmtopng</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the file is as
follows: The file is divided into lines, delimited by
newline characters. The last line need not end with a
newline character. A group of <br>
consecutive lines represents a comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;delimiter
character&quot; is a blank or tab or null character. The
first line representing a comment must not start with a
delimiter character. Every other line in the <br>
group is a &quot;continuation line&quot; and must start with
a delimiter character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first line representing a
comment consists of a keyword and the first line of comment
text. The keyword begins in Column 1 of the file line and
continues up to, but <br>
not including, the first delimiter character, or the end of
the line, whichever is first. Exception: you can enclose the
keyword in double quotes and spaces and tabs <br>
within the double quotes are part of the keyword. The quotes
are not part of the keyword. A NUL character is not allowed
in a keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first line of the comment
text is all the text in the file line beginning after the
keyword and any delimiter characters after it. immediately
after the delimiter <br>
character that marks the end of the keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A continuation line defines a
subsequent line of the comment. The comment line is all the
text on the continuation line starting with the first
non-delimiter character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is one newline character
between every two comment lines. There is no newline
character after the last line of comment text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no limit on the length
of a file line or keyword or comment text line or comment
text. There is no limit on the number of comments or size of
or number of lines <br>
in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ztxt=filename <br>
The same as -text, except pnmtopng considers the text
compressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-modtime=&rsquo;[yy]yy-mm-dd
hh:mm:ss&rsquo; <br>
This option allows you to specify the modification time
value to be placed in the PNG output. You can specify the
year parameter either as a two digit or four digit <br>
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.30 (October 2005). Before that, the option -time does the
same thing, but with slightly different syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-filter=n <br>
This option is obsolete. Before Netpbm 10.22 (April 2004),
this was the only way to specify a row filter. It specifies
a single type of row filter, by number, that pnm&acirc; <br>
topng must use on each row.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -nofilter, -sub, -up, -avg,
and -paeth in current Netpbm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nofilter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sub</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-up</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-avg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-paeth Each of these options
permits pnmtopng to use one type of row filter. pnmtopng
chooses whichever of the permitted filters it finds to be
optimal. If you specify none of <br>
these options, it is the same as specifying all of them --
pnmtopng uses any row filter type it finds optimal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options were new with
Netpbm 10.22 (April 2004). Before that, you could use the
-filter option to specify one permitted row filter type. The
default, when you <br>
specify no filter options, was the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-compression=n <br>
This option sets set the compression level of the zlib
compression. Select a level from 0 for no compression
(maximum speed) to 9 for maximum compression (minimum
speed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-comp_mem_level=n <br>
This option sets the memory usage level of the zlib
compression. Select a level from 1 for minimum memory usage
(and minimum speed) to 9 for maximum memory usage (and <br>
speed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.30 (October 2005).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-comp_strategy={huffman_only|filtered}
<br>
This options sets the compression strategy of the zlib
compression. See Zlib documentation for information on what
these strategies are.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.30 (October 2005).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-comp_method=deflated <br>
This option does nothing. It is here for mathematical
completeness and for possible forward compatibility. It
theoretically selects the compression method of the zlib
<br>
compression, but the Z library knows only one method today,
so there&rsquo;s nothing to choose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.30 (October 2005).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-comp_window_bits=N <br>
This option tells how big a window the zlib compression
algorithm uses. The value is the base 2 logarithm of the
window size in bytes, so 8 means 256 bytes. The value <br>
must be from 8 to 15 (i.e. 256 bytes to 32K).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See Zlib documentation for
details on what this window size is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.30 (October 2005).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-comp_buffer_size=N <br>
This option determines in what size pieces pnmtopng does the
zlib compression. One compressed piece goes in each IDAT
chunk in the PNG. So the bigger this value, the <br>
fewer IDAT chunks your PNG will have. Theoretically, this
makes the PNG smaller because 1) you have less
per-IDAT-chunk overhead, and 2) the compression algorithm
has <br>
more data to work with. But in reality, the difference will
probably not be noticeable above about 8K, which is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value n is the size of the
compressed piece (i.e. the compression buffer) in bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.30 (October 2005).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-force When you specify this,
pnmtopng limits its optimizations. The resulting PNG output
is as similar to the Netpbm input as possible. For example,
the PNG output will not be <br>
paletted and the alpha channel will be represented as a full
alpha channel even if the information could be represented
more succinctly with a transparency chunk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-libversion <br>
This option causes pnmtopng to display version information
about itself and the libraries it uses, in addition to all
its normal function. Do not confuse this with the <br>
Netpbm common option -version, which causes the program to
display version information about the Netpbm library and do
nothing else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can&rsquo;t really use this
option in a program that invokes pnmtopng and needs to know
which version it is. Its function has changed too much over
the history of pnmtopng. <br>
The option is only good for human eyes.</p>
