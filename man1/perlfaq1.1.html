perlfaq1 - General Questions About Perl
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This section of the FAQ answers very general, high-level questions about Perl.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_is_Perl?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_is_Perl?">What
  is Perl?</a></h2>
Perl is a high-level programming language with an eclectic heritage written by
  Larry Wall and a cast of thousands.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl's process, file, and text manipulation facilities make it particularly
  well-suited for tasks involving quick prototyping, system utilities, software
  tools, system management tasks, database access, graphical programming,
  networking, and web programming.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl derives from the ubiquitous C programming language and to a lesser extent
  from sed, awk, the Unix shell, and many other tools and languages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
These strengths make it especially popular with web developers and system
  administrators. Mathematicians, geneticists, journalists, managers and many
  other people also use Perl.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Who_supports_Perl?_Who_develops_it?_Why_is_it_free?"><a class="selflink" href="#Who_supports_Perl?_Who_develops_it?_Why_is_it_free?">Who
  supports Perl? Who develops it? Why is it free?</a></h2>
The original culture of the pre-populist Internet and the deeply-held beliefs of
  Perl's author, Larry Wall, gave rise to the free and open distribution policy
  of Perl. Perl is supported by its users. The core, the standard Perl library,
  the optional modules, and the documentation you're reading now were all
  written by volunteers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The core development team (known as the Perl Porters) are a group of highly
  altruistic individuals committed to producing better software for free than
  you could hope to purchase for money. You may snoop on pending developments
  via the archives &lt;http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/&gt; or
  read the faq &lt;http://dev.perl.org/perl5/docs/p5p-faq.html&gt;, or you can
  subscribe to the mailing list by sending perl5-porters-subscribe@perl.org a
  subscription request (an empty message with no subject is fine).
<div class="Pp"></div>
While the GNU project includes Perl in its distributions, there's no such thing
  as &quot;GNU Perl&quot;. Perl is not produced nor maintained by the Free
  Software Foundation. Perl's licensing terms are also more open than GNU
  software's tend to be.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can get commercial support of Perl if you wish, although for most users the
  informal support will more than suffice. See the answer to &quot;Where can I
  buy a commercial version of Perl?&quot; for more information.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Which_version_of_Perl_should_I_use?"><a class="selflink" href="#Which_version_of_Perl_should_I_use?">Which
  version of Perl should I use?</a></h2>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is often a matter of opinion and taste, and there isn't any one answer
  that fits everyone. In general, you want to use either the current stable
  release, or the stable release immediately prior to that one. Currently, those
  are perl5.14.x and perl5.12.x, respectively.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Beyond that, you have to consider several things and decide which is best for
  you.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_are_Perl_4,_Perl_5,_or_Perl_6?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_are_Perl_4,_Perl_5,_or_Perl_6?">What
  are Perl 4, Perl 5, or Perl 6?</a></h2>
In short, Perl 4 is the parent to both Perl 5 and Perl 6. Perl 5 is the older
  sibling, and though they are different languages, someone who knows one will
  spot many similarities in the other.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The number after Perl (i.e. the 5 after Perl 5) is the major release of the perl
  interpreter as well as the version of the language. Each major version has
  significant differences that earlier versions cannot support.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The current major release of Perl is Perl 5, first released in 1994. It can run
  scripts from the previous major release, Perl 4 (March 1991), but has
  significant differences.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl 6 is a reinvention of Perl, it is a language in the same lineage but not
  compatible. The two are complementary, not mutually exclusive. Perl 6 is not
  meant to replace Perl 5, and vice versa. See &quot;What is Perl 6?&quot; below
  to find out more.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See perlhist for a history of Perl revisions.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_is_Perl_6?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_is_Perl_6?">What
  is Perl 6?</a></h2>
Perl 6 was <i>originally</i> described as the community's rewrite of Perl 5.
  Development started in 2002; syntax and design work continue to this day. As
  the language has evolved, it has become clear that it is a separate language,
  incompatible with Perl 5 but in the same language family.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Contrary to popular belief, Perl 6 and Perl 5 peacefully coexist with one
  another. Perl 6 has proven to be a fascinating source of ideas for those using
  Perl 5 (the Moose object system is a well-known example). There is overlap in
  the communities, and this overlap fosters the tradition of sharing and
  borrowing that have been instrumental to Perl's success. The current leading
  implementation of Perl 6 is Rakudo, and you can learn more about it at
  &lt;http://rakudo.org&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to learn more about Perl 6, or have a desire to help in the crusade
  to make Perl a better place then read the Perl 6 developers page at
  &lt;http://www.perl6.org/&gt; and get involved.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;We're really serious about reinventing everything that needs
  reinventing.&quot; --Larry Wall
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_stable_is_Perl?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_stable_is_Perl?">How
  stable is Perl?</a></h2>
Production releases, which incorporate bug fixes and new functionality, are
  widely tested before release. Since the 5.000 release, we have averaged about
  one production release per year.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Perl development team occasionally make changes to the internal core of the
  language, but all possible efforts are made toward backward compatibility.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Is_Perl_difficult_to_learn?"><a class="selflink" href="#Is_Perl_difficult_to_learn?">Is
  Perl difficult to learn?</a></h2>
No, Perl is easy to start learning &lt;http://learn.perl.org/&gt; --and easy to
  keep learning. It looks like most programming languages you're likely to have
  experience with, so if you've ever written a C program, an awk script, a shell
  script, or even a BASIC program, you're already partway there.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most tasks only require a small subset of the Perl language. One of the guiding
  mottos for Perl development is &quot;there's more than one way to do it&quot;
  (TMTOWTDI, sometimes pronounced &quot;tim toady&quot;). Perl's learning curve
  is therefore shallow (easy to learn) and long (there's a whole lot you can do
  if you really want).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, because Perl is frequently (but not always, and certainly not by
  definition) an interpreted language, you can write your programs and test them
  without an intermediate compilation step, allowing you to experiment and
  test/debug quickly and easily. This ease of experimentation flattens the
  learning curve even more.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Things that make Perl easier to learn: Unix experience, almost any kind of
  programming experience, an understanding of regular expressions, and the
  ability to understand other people's code. If there's something you need to
  do, then it's probably already been done, and a working example is usually
  available for free. Don't forget Perl modules, either. They're discussed in
  Part 3 of this FAQ, along with CPAN &lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt;, which is
  discussed in Part 2.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_does_Perl_compare_with_other_languages_like_Java,_Python,_REXX,_Scheme,_or_Tcl?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_does_Perl_compare_with_other_languages_like_Java,_Python,_REXX,_Scheme,_or_Tcl?">How
  does Perl compare with other languages like Java, Python, REXX, Scheme, or
  Tcl?</a></h2>
Perl can be used for almost any coding problem, even ones which require
  integrating specialist C code for extra speed. As with any tool it can be used
  well or badly. Perl has many strengths, and a few weaknesses, precisely which
  areas are good and bad is often a personal choice.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When choosing a language you should also be influenced by the resources
  &lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt;, testing culture
  &lt;http://www.cpantesters.org/&gt; and community
  &lt;http://www.perl.org/community.html&gt; which surrounds it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For comparisons to a specific language it is often best to create a small
  project in both languages and compare the results, make sure to use all the
  resources &lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt; of each language, as a language is far
  more than just it's syntax.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Can_I_do_[task]_in_Perl?"><a class="selflink" href="#Can_I_do_[task]_in_Perl?">Can
  I do [task] in Perl?</a></h2>
Perl is flexible and extensible enough for you to use on virtually any task,
  from one-line file-processing tasks to large, elaborate systems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For many people, Perl serves as a great replacement for shell scripting. For
  others, it serves as a convenient, high-level replacement for most of what
  they'd program in low-level languages like C or C++. It's ultimately up to you
  (and possibly your management) which tasks you'll use Perl for and which you
  won't.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have a library that provides an API, you can make any component of it
  available as just another Perl function or variable using a Perl extension
  written in C or C++ and dynamically linked into your main perl interpreter.
  You can also go the other direction, and write your main program in C or C++,
  and then link in some Perl code on the fly, to create a powerful application.
  See perlembed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
That said, there will always be small, focused, special-purpose languages
  dedicated to a specific problem domain that are simply more convenient for
  certain kinds of problems. Perl tries to be all things to all people, but
  nothing special to anyone. Examples of specialized languages that come to mind
  include prolog and matlab.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="When_shouldn't_I_program_in_Perl?"><a class="selflink" href="#When_shouldn't_I_program_in_Perl?">When
  shouldn't I program in Perl?</a></h2>
One good reason is when you already have an existing application written in
  another language that's all done (and done well), or you have an application
  language specifically designed for a certain task (e.g. prolog, make).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you find that you need to speed up a specific part of a Perl application (not
  something you often need) you may want to use C, but you can access this from
  your Perl code with perlxs.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What's_the_difference_between_&quot;perl&quot;_and_&quot;Perl&quot;?"><a class="selflink" href="#What's_the_difference_between_&quot;perl&quot;_and_&quot;Perl&quot;?">What's
  the difference between &quot;perl&quot; and &quot;Perl&quot;?</a></h2>
&quot;Perl&quot; is the name of the language. Only the &quot;P&quot; is
  capitalized. The name of the interpreter (the program which runs the Perl
  script) is &quot;perl&quot; with a lowercase &quot;p&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may or may not choose to follow this usage. But never write
  &quot;PERL&quot;, because perl is not an acronym.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_is_a_JAPH?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_is_a_JAPH?">What
  is a JAPH?</a></h2>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<div class="Pp"></div>
JAPH stands for &quot;Just another Perl hacker,&quot;, which Randal Schwartz
  used to sign email and usenet messages starting in the late 1980s. He
  previously used the phrase with many subjects (&quot;Just another x
  hacker,&quot;), so to distinguish his JAPH, he started to write them as Perl
  programs:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    print &quot;Just another Perl hacker,&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Other people picked up on this and started to write clever or obfuscated
  programs to produce the same output, spinning things quickly out of control
  while still providing hours of amusement for their creators and readers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
CPAN has several JAPH programs at &lt;http://www.cpan.org/misc/japh&gt;.

  can I convince others to use Perl?</a></h2>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Appeal to their self interest! If Perl is new (and thus scary) to them, find
  something that Perl can do to solve one of their problems. That might mean
  that Perl either saves them something (time, headaches, money) or gives them
  something (flexibility, power, testability).
<div class="Pp"></div>
In general, the benefit of a language is closely related to the skill of the
  people using that language. If you or your team can be faster, better, and
  stronger through Perl, you'll deliver more value. Remember, people often
  respond better to what they get out of it. If you run into resistance, figure
  out what those people get out of the other choice and how Perl might satisfy
  that requirement.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You don't have to worry about finding or paying for Perl; it's freely available
  and several popular operating systems come with Perl. Community support in
  places such as Perlmonks ( &lt;http://www.perlmonks.com&gt; ) and the various
  Perl mailing lists ( &lt;http://lists.perl.org&gt; ) means that you can
  usually get quick answers to your problems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, keep in mind that Perl might not be the right tool for every job.
  You're a much better advocate if your claims are reasonable and grounded in
  reality. Dogmatically advocating anything tends to make people discount your
  message. Be honest about possible disadvantages to your choice of Perl since
  any choice has trade-offs.
