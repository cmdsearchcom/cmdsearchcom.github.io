<p>PERLFAQ1(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLFAQ1(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlfaq1 - General Questions About Perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This section of the FAQ answers very general, high-level
questions about Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What is Perl? <br>
Perl is a high-level programming language with an eclectic
heritage written by Larry Wall and a cast of thousands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl&rsquo;s process, file, and
text manipulation facilities make it particularly
well-suited for tasks involving quick prototyping, system
utilities, software tools, system management <br>
tasks, database access, graphical programming, networking,
and web programming.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl derives from the ubiquitous
C programming language and to a lesser extent from sed, awk,
the Unix shell, and many other tools and languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These strengths make it
especially popular with web developers and system
administrators. Mathematicians, geneticists, journalists,
managers and many other people also use Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Who supports Perl? Who develops
it? Why is it free? <br>
The original culture of the pre-populist Internet and the
deeply-held beliefs of Perl&rsquo;s author, Larry Wall, gave
rise to the free and open distribution policy of Perl. Perl
is <br>
supported by its users. The core, the standard Perl library,
the optional modules, and the documentation you&rsquo;re
reading now were all written by volunteers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The core development team (known
as the Perl Porters) are a group of highly altruistic
individuals committed to producing better software for free
than you could hope to purchase <br>
for money. You may snoop on pending developments via the
archives
&lt;http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/&gt;
or read the faq &lt;http://dev.perl.org/perl5/docs/p5p- <br>
faq.html&gt;, or you can subscribe to the mailing list by
sending perl5-porters-subscribe@perl.org a subscription
request (an empty message with no subject is fine).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While the GNU project includes
Perl in its distributions, there&rsquo;s no such thing as
&quot;GNU Perl&quot;. Perl is not produced nor maintained by
the Free Software Foundation. Perl&rsquo;s <br>
licensing terms are also more open than GNU software&rsquo;s
tend to be.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can get commercial support
of Perl if you wish, although for most users the informal
support will more than suffice. See the answer to
&quot;Where can I buy a commercial version <br>
of Perl?&quot; for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Which version of Perl should I
use? <br>
(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is often a matter of
opinion and taste, and there isn&rsquo;t any one answer that
fits everyone. In general, you want to use either the
current stable release, or the stable <br>
release immediately prior to that one. Currently, those are
perl5.14.x and perl5.12.x, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beyond that, you have to
consider several things and decide which is best for
you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If things
aren&rsquo;t broken, upgrading perl may break them (or at
least issue new warnings).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The latest
versions of perl have more bug fixes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The Perl
community is geared toward supporting the most recent
releases, so you&rsquo;ll have an easier time finding help
for those.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Versions prior
to perl5.004 had serious security problems with buffer
overflows, and in some cases have CERT advisories (for
instance, <br>
http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1997-17.html
&lt;http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1997-17.html&gt;
).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The latest
versions are probably the least deployed and widely tested,
so you may want to wait a few months after their release and
see what problems others have if you are <br>
risk averse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The immediate,
previous releases (i.e. perl5.8.x ) are usually maintained
for a while, although not at the same level as the current
releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; No one is
actively supporting Perl 4. Ten years ago it was a dead
camel carcass (according to this document). Now it&rsquo;s
barely a skeleton as its whitewashed bones have <br>
fractured or eroded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The current
leading implementation of Perl 6, Rakudo, released a
&quot;useful, usable, &rsquo;early adopter&rsquo;&quot;
distribution of Perl 6 (called Rakudo Star) in July of 2010.
Please see <br>
&lt;http://rakudo.org/&gt; for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; There are really
two tracks of perl development: a maintenance version and an
experimental version. The maintenance versions are stable,
and have an even number as the minor <br>
release (i.e. perl5.10.x, where 10 is the minor release).
The experimental versions may include features that
don&rsquo;t make it into the stable versions, and have an
odd number <br>
as the minor release (i.e. perl5.9.x, where 9 is the minor
release).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What are Perl 4, Perl 5, or Perl
6? <br>
In short, Perl 4 is the parent to both Perl 5 and Perl 6.
Perl 5 is the older sibling, and though they are different
languages, someone who knows one will spot many similarities
<br>
in the other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number after Perl (i.e. the
5 after Perl 5) is the major release of the perl interpreter
as well as the version of the language. Each major version
has significant <br>
differences that earlier versions cannot support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current major release of
Perl is Perl 5, first released in 1994. It can run scripts
from the previous major release, Perl 4 (March 1991), but
has significant differences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl 6 is a reinvention of Perl,
it is a language in the same lineage but not compatible. The
two are complementary, not mutually exclusive. Perl 6 is not
meant to replace Perl <br>
5, and vice versa. See &quot;What is Perl 6?&quot; below to
find out more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See perlhist for a history of
Perl revisions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What is Perl 6? <br>
Perl 6 was originally described as the community&rsquo;s
rewrite of Perl 5. Development started in 2002; syntax and
design work continue to this day. As the language has
evolved, it <br>
has become clear that it is a separate language,
incompatible with Perl 5 but in the same language
family.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Contrary to popular belief, Perl
6 and Perl 5 peacefully coexist with one another. Perl 6 has
proven to be a fascinating source of ideas for those using
Perl 5 (the Moose object <br>
system is a well-known example). There is overlap in the
communities, and this overlap fosters the tradition of
sharing and borrowing that have been instrumental to
Perl&rsquo;s <br>
success. The current leading implementation of Perl 6 is
Rakudo, and you can learn more about it at
&lt;http://rakudo.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to learn more about
Perl 6, or have a desire to help in the crusade to make Perl
a better place then read the Perl 6 developers page at
&lt;http://www.perl6.org/&gt; and <br>
get involved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;We&rsquo;re really serious
about reinventing everything that needs reinventing.&quot;
--Larry Wall</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How stable is Perl? <br>
Production releases, which incorporate bug fixes and new
functionality, are widely tested before release. Since the
5.000 release, we have averaged about one production release
<br>
per year.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Perl development team
occasionally make changes to the internal core of the
language, but all possible efforts are made toward backward
compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Is Perl difficult to learn? <br>
No, Perl is easy to start learning
&lt;http://learn.perl.org/&gt; --and easy to keep learning.
It looks like most programming languages you&rsquo;re likely
to have experience with, so if <br>
you&rsquo;ve ever written a C program, an awk script, a
shell script, or even a BASIC program, you&rsquo;re already
partway there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most tasks only require a small
subset of the Perl language. One of the guiding mottos for
Perl development is &quot;there&rsquo;s more than one way to
do it&quot; (TMTOWTDI, sometimes <br>
pronounced &quot;tim toady&quot;). Perl&rsquo;s learning
curve is therefore shallow (easy to learn) and long
(there&rsquo;s a whole lot you can do if you really
want).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, because Perl is
frequently (but not always, and certainly not by definition)
an interpreted language, you can write your programs and
test them without an intermediate <br>
compilation step, allowing you to experiment and test/debug
quickly and easily. This ease of experimentation flattens
the learning curve even more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Things that make Perl easier to
learn: Unix experience, almost any kind of programming
experience, an understanding of regular expressions, and the
ability to understand other <br>
people&rsquo;s code. If there&rsquo;s something you need to
do, then it&rsquo;s probably already been done, and a
working example is usually available for free. Don&rsquo;t
forget Perl modules, either. <br>
They&rsquo;re discussed in Part 3 of this FAQ, along with
CPAN &lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt;, which is discussed in
Part 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How does Perl compare with other
languages like Java, Python, REXX, Scheme, or Tcl? <br>
Perl can be used for almost any coding problem, even ones
which require integrating specialist C code for extra speed.
As with any tool it can be used well or badly. Perl has <br>
many strengths, and a few weaknesses, precisely which areas
are good and bad is often a personal choice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When choosing a language you
should also be influenced by the resources
&lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt;, testing culture
&lt;http://www.cpantesters.org/&gt; and community <br>
&lt;http://www.perl.org/community.html&gt; which surrounds
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For comparisons to a specific
language it is often best to create a small project in both
languages and compare the results, make sure to use all the
resources <br>
&lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt; of each language, as a language
is far more than just it&rsquo;s syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can I do [task] in Perl? <br>
Perl is flexible and extensible enough for you to use on
virtually any task, from one-line file-processing tasks to
large, elaborate systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For many people, Perl serves as
a great replacement for shell scripting. For others, it
serves as a convenient, high-level replacement for most of
what they&rsquo;d program in low- <br>
level languages like C or C++. It&rsquo;s ultimately up to
you (and possibly your management) which tasks you&rsquo;ll
use Perl for and which you won&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have a library that
provides an API, you can make any component of it available
as just another Perl function or variable using a Perl
extension written in C or C++ and <br>
dynamically linked into your main perl interpreter. You can
also go the other direction, and write your main program in
C or C++, and then link in some Perl code on the fly, to
<br>
create a powerful application. See perlembed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That said, there will always be
small, focused, special-purpose languages dedicated to a
specific problem domain that are simply more convenient for
certain kinds of problems. <br>
Perl tries to be all things to all people, but nothing
special to anyone. Examples of specialized languages that
come to mind include prolog and matlab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When shouldn&rsquo;t I program
in Perl? <br>
One good reason is when you already have an existing
application written in another language that&rsquo;s all
done (and done well), or you have an application language
specifically <br>
designed for a certain task (e.g. prolog, make).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you find that you need to
speed up a specific part of a Perl application (not
something you often need) you may want to use C, but you can
access this from your Perl code with <br>
perlxs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What&rsquo;s the difference
between &quot;perl&quot; and &quot;Perl&quot;? <br>
&quot;Perl&quot; is the name of the language. Only the
&quot;P&quot; is capitalized. The name of the interpreter
(the program which runs the Perl script) is &quot;perl&quot;
with a lowercase &quot;p&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may or may not choose to
follow this usage. But never write &quot;PERL&quot;, because
perl is not an acronym.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What is a JAPH? <br>
(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JAPH stands for &quot;Just
another Perl hacker,&quot;, which Randal Schwartz used to
sign email and usenet messages starting in the late 1980s.
He previously used the phrase with many <br>
subjects (&quot;Just another x hacker,&quot;), so to
distinguish his JAPH, he started to write them as Perl
programs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;Just another Perl
hacker,&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other people picked up on this
and started to write clever or obfuscated programs to
produce the same output, spinning things quickly out of
control while still providing hours <br>
of amusement for their creators and readers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPAN has several JAPH programs
at &lt;http://www.cpan.org/misc/japh&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How can I convince others to use
Perl? <br>
(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Appeal to their self interest!
If Perl is new (and thus scary) to them, find something that
Perl can do to solve one of their problems. That might mean
that Perl either saves <br>
them something (time, headaches, money) or gives them
something (flexibility, power, testability).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, the benefit of a
language is closely related to the skill of the people using
that language. If you or your team can be faster, better,
and stronger through Perl, <br>
you&rsquo;ll deliver more value. Remember, people often
respond better to what they get out of it. If you run into
resistance, figure out what those people get out of the
other choice <br>
and how Perl might satisfy that requirement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You don&rsquo;t have to worry
about finding or paying for Perl; it&rsquo;s freely
available and several popular operating systems come with
Perl. Community support in places such as <br>
Perlmonks ( &lt;http://www.perlmonks.com&gt; ) and the
various Perl mailing lists ( &lt;http://lists.perl.org&gt; )
means that you can usually get quick answers to your
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, keep in mind that Perl
might not be the right tool for every job. You&rsquo;re a
much better advocate if your claims are reasonable and
grounded in reality. Dogmatically <br>
advocating anything tends to make people discount your
message. Be honest about possible disadvantages to your
choice of Perl since any choice has trade-offs.</p>
