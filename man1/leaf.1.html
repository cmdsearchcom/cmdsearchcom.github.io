And E LEAF(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
leaf - Lightweight Editor of Ascii(and more) Files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
leaf [-f] [-d dictionary] [+n] [filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
leaf is a simple console text file editor, with paragraph
word-wrapping and spell checking. leaf is based on the text
editor in the Cone mail reader and composer. leaf opens <br>
filename, positioning the cursor on the first line, or line
#n, if specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is not really the best
editor for program sources. leaf is meant to be used as a
quick editor for writing short notes and memos. As text is
typed, words will automatically <br>
flow to wrap within a typical 80-character terminal display,
even on larger display (due to leaf&rsquo;s heritage as an
editor for E-mail messages, which are traditionally
formatted to <br>
fit an 80-character display). Word wrapping is
&quot;lazy&quot;: only long text lines are wrapped. Short
text lines are not folded together. Individual paragraphs
are separated by blank <br>
lines of text. Press CTRL-J to optimally rejustify the
paragraph under the cursor. The bottom two lines on the
screen list which keys to press for other functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flowed text <br>
The -f option enables &acirc;flowed text&acirc; formatting
convention. Plain text files have no explicit means for
joining multiple lines into logical paragraph. Each line of
text is an <br>
individual line, and a blank line marks the end of a
paragraph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a &acirc;flowed text&acirc;
formatted file, each line in a paragraph except the last one
ends with a space character. This makes no visual
difference, it&rsquo;s just a marker that this line <br>
should be merged with the next line. The last line in the
paragraph does not end in a space character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The trailing space character is
logically removed from each flowed line, and all flowed
lines are merged into a logical paragraph that can be
adjusted to any display width. It&rsquo;s <br>
important to note that text written in non-ideographic
languages, where individual words are separated by spaces,
will have two space characters at the end of every line: the
<br>
space character that separates the last word on the line
from the first word on the next line, and the a second space
character that marks the line as a flowed line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because the trailing space
marking a flowed line is logically removed, without the
second space character there will not be a logical space
between the two words, and if the <br>
paragraph&rsquo;s width is adjusted for display the two
words may get combined together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -f option puts leaf into
flowed text mode, removing spaces from each flowed line of
text in an opened file. A flowed line is marked on the
screen with a &quot;&lt;&quot; character in the <br>
right margin (or a small &quot;next line&quot; character on
a UTF-8 display). When saving a file leaf automatically adds
a trailing space to each line that&rsquo;s marked as
flowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flowed text mode stays in
effect for each file opened in leaf. When opening another
file, press CTRL-F to turn flowed mode on or off for the
next file. This change stays in <br>
effect until it gets toggled again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pressing CTRL-J optimally
rejustifies the text in flowed text mode. leaf heuristically
determines the start and the end of the paragraph, readjusts
the width of the paragraph, <br>
and marks each line as flowed, except the last paragraph
line. leaf uses a unicode-based algorithm for determining
whether the last character line needs a space character, in
<br>
addition to the flowed space marker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
leaf is frequently used to edit plain text email message
content. Because email messages assign some semantical
meaning to lines of text that start with spaces or
&quot;&gt;&quot; <br>
characters, CTRL-J will not rejustify lines of text that
begin with a &quot;&gt;&quot; or a space. These lines will
be considered paragraph boundaries, in addition to blank
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spell checking <br>
The -d option sets the name of the dictionary used for spell
checking (overriding the default spell checking dictionary
set by the DICTIONARY environment variable). +n sets the
<br>
initial cursor position to line #n.</p>
