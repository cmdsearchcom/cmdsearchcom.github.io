<b>leaf</b> is a simple console text file editor, with paragraph word-wrapping
  and spell checking. <b>leaf</b> is based on the text editor in the Cone mail
  reader and composer. <b>leaf</b> opens <i>filename</i>, positioning the cursor
  on the first line, or line # <i>n</i>, if specified.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is not really the best editor for program sources. <b>leaf</b> is meant to
  be used as a quick editor for writing short notes and memos. As text is typed,
  words will automatically flow to wrap within a typical 80-character terminal
  display, even on larger display (due to <b>leaf</b>'s heritage as an editor
  for E-mail messages, which are traditionally formatted to fit an 80-character
  display). Word wrapping is &quot;lazy&quot;: only long text lines are wrapped.
  Short text lines are not folded together. Individual paragraphs are separated
  by blank lines of text. Press CTRL-J to optimally rejustify the paragraph
  under the cursor. The bottom two lines on the screen list which keys to press
  for other functions.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Flowed_text"><a class="selflink" href="#Flowed_text">Flowed
  text</a></h2>
The <b>-f</b> option enables &#x201C;flowed text&#x201D; formatting convention.
  Plain text files have no explicit means for joining multiple lines into
  logical paragraph. Each line of text is an individual line, and a blank line
  marks the end of a paragraph.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In a &#x201C;flowed text&#x201D; formatted file, each line in a paragraph except
  the last one ends with a space character. This makes no visual difference,
  it's just a marker that this line should be merged with the next line. The
  last line in the paragraph does not end in a space character.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The trailing space character is logically removed from each flowed line, and all
  flowed lines are merged into a logical paragraph that can be adjusted to any
  display width. It's important to note that text written in non-ideographic
  languages, where individual words are separated by spaces, will have two space
  characters at the end of every line: the space character that separates the
  last word on the line from the first word on the next line, and the a second
  space character that marks the line as a flowed line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Because the trailing space marking a flowed line is logically removed, without
  the second space character there will not be a logical space between the two
  words, and if the paragraph's width is adjusted for display the two words may
  get combined together.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-f</b> option puts <b>leaf</b> into flowed text mode, removing spaces
  from each flowed line of text in an opened file. A flowed line is marked on
  the screen with a &quot;&lt;&quot; character in the right margin (or a small
  &quot;next line&quot; character on a UTF-8 display). When saving a file
  <b>leaf</b> automatically adds a trailing space to each line that's marked as
  flowed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The flowed text mode stays in effect for each file opened in <b>leaf</b>. When
  opening another file, press CTRL-F to turn flowed mode on or off for the next
  file. This change stays in effect until it gets toggled again.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Pressing CTRL-J optimally rejustifies the text in flowed text mode. <b>leaf</b>
  heuristically determines the start and the end of the paragraph, readjusts the
  width of the paragraph, and marks each line as flowed, except the last
  paragraph line. <b>leaf</b> uses a unicode-based algorithm for determining
  whether the last character line needs a space character, in addition to the
  flowed space marker.

<b>leaf</b> is frequently used to edit plain text email message content. Because
  email messages assign some semantical meaning to lines of text that start with
  spaces or &quot;&gt;&quot; characters, CTRL-J will not rejustify lines of text
  that begin with a &quot;&gt;&quot; or a space. These lines will be considered
  paragraph boundaries, in addition to blank lines.

The <b>-d</b> option sets the name of the dictionary used for spell checking
  (overriding the default spell checking dictionary set by the <b>DICTIONARY</b>
  environment variable). <b>+</b><b></b><i>n</i> sets the initial cursor
  position to line # <i>n</i>.
