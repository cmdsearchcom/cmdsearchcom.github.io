<p>KERMIT(1) General Commands Manual KERMIT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
kermit - C&acirc;Kermit 9.0: transport&acirc; and
platform&acirc;independent interactive and scriptable
communications software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This document is intended to
give the beginner sufficient information to make basic (if
not advanced) use of C&acirc;Kermit 9.0. Although it might
be rather long for a Unix <br>
manual page, it&rsquo;s still far shorter than the
C&acirc;Kermit manual, which should be consulted for
advanced topics such as customization, character&acirc;sets,
scripting, etc. We also <br>
attempt to provide a clear structural overview of
C&acirc;Kermit&rsquo;s many capabilities, functional areas,
states, and modes and their interrelation, that should be
helpful to <br>
beginners and veterans alike, as well as to those upgrading
to version 9.0 from earlier releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This document is also available
as a Web page at:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckututor.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
C&acirc;Kermit is an all&acirc;purpose communications
software package from the Kermit Project at Columbia
University that:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Is portable to
many platforms, Unix and non&acirc;Unix alike. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Can make both serial and network
connections. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Can conduct interactive terminal sessions
over its connection. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Can transfer text or binary files over the
same connection. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Can convert character sets in the terminal
session. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Can convert character sets during
text&acirc;file file transfer. <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Is customizable in every aspect of its
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C&acirc;Kermit is a modem
program, a Telnet client, an Rlogin client, an FTP client,
an HTTP client, and on selected platforms, also an X.25
client. It can make its own secure Internet <br>
connections using IETF&acirc;approved security methods
including Kerberos IV, Kerberos V, SSL/TLS, and SRP and it
can also make SSH connections through your external SSH
client appli&acirc; <br>
cation. It can be the far&acirc;end file&acirc;transfer or
client/server partner of your desktop Kermit client. It can
also accept incoming dialed and network connections. It can
even be <br>
installed as an Internet service on its own standard TCP
socket, 1649 [RFC2839, RFC2840].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And perhaps most important,
everything you can do &quot;by hand&quot; (interactively)
with C&acirc;Kermit, can be &quot;scripted&quot; (automated)
using its built&acirc;in cross&acirc;platform
transport&acirc;independent <br>
script programming language, which happens to be identical
to its interactive command language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manual page offers an
overview of C&acirc;Kermit 9.0 for Unix (&quot;Unix&quot; is
an operating system family that includes AIX, DG/UX,
FreeBSD, HP&acirc;UX, IRIX, Linux, Mac OS X, NetBSD,
Open&acirc; <br>
BSD, Open Server, Open Unix, QNX, Solaris, SunOS, System V
R3, System V R4, Tru64 Unix, Unixware, Xenix, and many
others). For thorough coverage, please consult the published
C&acirc; <br>
Kermit manual and supplements (see DOCUMENTATION below). For
further information about C&acirc;Kermit, Kermit software
for other platforms, and Kermit manuals, visit the Kermit
Project <br>
website:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a
longer&acirc;than&acirc;average manual page, and yet it
barely scratches the surface. Don&rsquo;t be daunted.
C&acirc;Kermit is a large and complex package, evolving over
decades of practice <br>
and experience, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s hard
to learn or use. Its most commonly used functions are
explained here with pointers to additional information
elsewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
kermit [ filename ] [ options ] [ {=,--,+} text ] ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kermit URL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the first command&acirc;line
argument is the name of a file, interactive&acirc;mode
commands are executed from the file. The &rsquo;=&rsquo; (or
&quot;--&quot;) argument tells Kermit not to parse the
remainder <br>
of the command line, but to make the words following
&rsquo;=&rsquo; available as 1, 2, ... 9. The &quot;+&quot;
argument is like &quot;=&quot; but for use in &quot;kerbang
scripts&quot; (explained below). A second <br>
command&acirc;line format allows the one and only argument
to be a Telnet, FTP, HTTP, or IKSD URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Order of execution:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The command file (if
any).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The initialization file, if
any, unless suppressed with -Y.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The customization file (if it
is executed by the initialization file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. The command&acirc;line URL
(if any, and if so, execution stops here).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Command&acirc;line options
(if any).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Interactive commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some command&acirc;line options
can cause actions (such as -s to send a file); others just
set parameters. If any action options are included on the
command line, Kermit exits when <br>
finished unless also given the -S (&quot;stay&quot;) option.
If no action options are given, no initialization or command
files contained an EXIT or QUIT command, and no fatal errors
<br>
occurred, Kermit issues its prompt and waits for you to type
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bear in mind that C&acirc;Kermit
can be built with selected features disabled, and also that
certain features are not available on all platforms. For
example, C&acirc;Kermit can&rsquo;t be <br>
built with TCP/IP support on a platform that does not have
TCP/IP header files and libraries (and even if Kermit does
include TCP/IP support, it can&rsquo;t be used to make <br>
TCP/IP connections on a computer that does not have a TCP/IP
stack installed). If your version of C&acirc;Kermit lacks a
feature mentioned here, use its SHOW FEATURES command to
<br>
see what might have been excluded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C&acirc;Kermit has three kinds
of commands: regular single&acirc;letter command&acirc;line
options, extended&acirc;format command&acirc;line options,
and interactive commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like most Unix commands,
C&acirc;Kermit can be be given options on the command line.
But C&acirc;Kermit also can be used interactively by giving
it commands composed of words, which are more <br>
intuitive than cryptic command&acirc;line options, and more
flexible too. In other words, you don&rsquo;t have to use
C&acirc;Kermit&rsquo;s command&acirc;line options, but they
are available if you want to. <br>
(By the same token, you don&rsquo;t have to use its
interactive commands either &acirc;&acirc; you can use
either or both in any combination.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C&acirc;Kermit is generally
installed in the PATH as &quot;kermit&quot;, and therefore
is invoked by typing the word &quot;kermit&quot; (lowercase)
at the shell prompt, and then pressing the Return or <br>
Enter key. If you wish to include command&acirc;line
options, put them after the word &quot;kermit&quot; but
before pressing Return or Enter, separated by spaces, for
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ kermit -s ckermit.tar.gz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(&rsquo;$&rsquo; is the shell
prompt; &quot;kermit -s ckermit.tar.gz&quot; is what you
type, followed by Return or Enter.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Here is a list of C&acirc;Kermit&rsquo;s single&acirc;letter
command&acirc;line options, which start with a single dash
(-), in ASCII (&quot;alphabetical&quot;) order. Alphabetic
case is significant (-A is not <br>
the same as -a). Action options are tagged
&quot;ACTION&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extended command&acirc;line
options (necessary because single&acirc;letter ones are
about used up) start with two dashes (--), with words rather
than single letters as option names. If an <br>
extended option takes an argument, it is separated from the
option word by a colon (:). Extended options include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bannerfile:filename <br>
File to display upon startup or IKSD login.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cdfile:filename <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
(ACTION) C&acirc;Kermit prints its version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Plus several other
IKSD&acirc;Only options described at:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/iksd.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the file&acirc;transfer
section for examples of command&acirc;line invocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LANGUAGE <br>
C&acirc;Kermit&rsquo;s interactive command language is the
subject of a 622&acirc;page book and another several hundred
pages of updates, far too much for a manual page. But
it&rsquo;s not hard to get <br>
started. At the shell prompt, just type &quot;kermit&quot;
to get C&acirc;Kermit&rsquo;s interactive command
prompt:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ kermit <br>
(/current/directory) C-Kermit&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Begin by typing &quot;help&quot;
(and then press the Return or Enter key) for a
top&acirc;level overview, read it, and go from there. Your
second command should probably be &quot;intro&quot;
(introduc&acirc; <br>
tion). Note the prompt shows your current directory (unless
you tell Kermit to prompt you with something else).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interactive commands are
composed mainly of regular English words, usually in the
form of imperative sentences, such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">send oofa.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which tells Kermit to send
(transfer) the file whose name is oofa.txt, or:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set transfer mode automatic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which sets Kermit&rsquo;s
&quot;transfer mode&quot; to &quot;automatic&quot; (whatever
that means).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While typing commands, you can
abbreviate, ask for help (by pressing the &quot;?&quot; key
anywhere in a command), complete keywords or filenames (with
the Tab or Esc key), and edit your <br>
typing with Backspace or Delete, Ctrl-W, Ctrl-U, etc. You
can also recall previous commands, save your command
history, and who knows what else. Give the INTRO command for
<br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C&acirc;Kermit has hundreds of
commands, and they can be issued in infinite variety and
combinations, including commands for:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Making
connections (SET LINE, DIAL, TELNET, SSH, FTP, ...) <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Breaking connections (HANGUP, CLOSE) <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Transferring files (SEND, GET, RECEIVE,
MOVE, RESEND, ...) <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Establishing preferences (SET) <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Displaying preferences (SHOW) <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Managing local files (CD, DELETE, MKDIR,
DIR, RENAME, TYPE, ...) <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Managing remote files (RCD, RDEL, RMKDIR,
RDIR, ...) <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Using local files (FOPEN, FCLOSE, FREAD,
FWRITE) <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Programming (TAKE, DEFINE, IF, FOR, WHILE,
SWITCH, DECLARE, ...) <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Interacting with the user (ECHO, ASK, ...)
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; Interacting with a remote computer (INPUT,
OUTPUT, ...) <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Interacting with local programs (RUN, EXEC,
PTY, ...) <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Logging things (LOG SESSION, LOG PACKETS,
LOG DEBUG, ...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And of course QUIT or EXIT to
get out and HELP to get help, and for programmers: loops,
decision making, variables, arrays, associative arrays,
integer and floating point arith&acirc; <br>
metic, macros, built&acirc;in and user&acirc;defined
functions, string manipulation, pattern matching, block
structure, scoping, recursion, and all the rest. To get a
list of all C&acirc;Kermit&rsquo;s <br>
commands, type a question mark (?) at the prompt. To get a
description of any command, type HELP followed by the name
of the command, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help send</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command interruption
character is Ctrl-C (hold down the Ctrl key and press the C
key).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command language
&quot;escape character&quot;, used to introduce variable
names, function invocations, and so on, is backslash (. If
you need to include a literal backslash in a com&acirc; <br>
mand, type two of them, e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get c:55custom.ini</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command Files, Macros, and
Scripts <br>
A file containing Kermit commands is called a Kermit command
file or Kermit script. It can be executed with
Kermit&rsquo;s TAKE command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(/current/dir) C-Kermit&gt; take
commandfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(where &quot;commandfile&quot;
is the name of the command file). Please don&rsquo;t pipe a
command file into Kermit&rsquo;s standard input (which might
or might not work); if you have Kermit commands <br>
in a file, tell Kermit to TAKE the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Unix only, a Kermit command
file can also be executed directly by including a
&quot;kerbang&quot; line as the first line of the file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/local/bin/kermit +</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That is, a top line that starts
with &quot;#!&quot;, followed immediately by the full path
of the Kermit executable, and then, if the Kermit script is
to be given arguments on the command <br>
line, a space and a plus sign. The script file must also
have execute permission:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chmod +x commandfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Except for the &quot; +&quot;
part, this is exactly the same as you would do for a shell
script, a Perl script, etc. Here&rsquo;s a simple but
useless example script that regurgitates its argu&acirc;
<br>
ments (up to three of them):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/local/bin/kermit + <br>
if defined 1 echo &quot;Argument 1: 1&quot; <br>
if defined 2 echo &quot;Argument 2: 2&quot; <br>
if defined 3 echo &quot;Argument 3: 3&quot; <br>
if defined 4 echo &quot;etc...&quot; <br>
exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this file is stored in your
current directory as &quot;commandfile&quot;, then:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./commandfile one two three four
five</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prints:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Argument 1: one <br>
Argument 2: two <br>
Argument 3: three <br>
etc...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This illustrates the basic
structure of a standalone Kermit script: the &quot;kerbang
line&quot;, then some commands. It should end with
&quot;exit&quot; unless you want the Kermit prompt to appear
<br>
when it is finished. 1 is the first argument, 2 the second,
and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also create your own
commands by defining named macros composed of other Kermit
commands (or macros). For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">define mydelete { <br>
local trash <br>
assign trash home)trashcan/ <br>
if not defined 1 end 1 &quot;Delete what?&quot; <br>
if wild 1 { <br>
end 1 &quot;Deleting multiple files is too scary&quot; <br>
} <br>
if not exist 1 end 1 &quot;I can&rsquo;t find 1&quot; <br>
if not directory ash) { <br>
mkdir ash) <br>
if fail end 1 &quot;No trash can&quot; <br>
} <br>
rename /list 1 ash) <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These sample macros are not
exactly production quality (they don&rsquo;t handle
filenames that include path segments, they don&rsquo;t
handle multiple files, etc), but you get the idea: you <br>
can pass arguments to macros, and they can check them and
make other kinds of decisions. If you put the above lines
into your initialization or customization file (explained
<br>
below), you&rsquo;ll have MYDELETE and MYUNDELETE commands
available every time you start Kermit, at least as long as
you don&rsquo;t suppress execution of the initialization
file. (Exercise <br>
for the reader: Make these macros generally useful: remove
limitations, add trashcan display, browsing, emptying,
etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kerbang scripts execute without
the initialization file. This to keep them portable and also
to make them start faster. If you want to write Kerbang
scripts that depend on the <br>
initialization file, include the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">take home).kermrc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">at the desired spot in the
script. By the way, xxx) is a built&acirc;in variable (xxx
is the variable name, &quot;home&quot; in this case). To see
what built&acirc;in variables are available, type <br>
&quot;show variables&quot; at the C&acirc;Kermit prompt. To
see what else you can show, type &quot;show ?&quot;. x) is a
user defined variable (strictly speaking, it is a macro used
as a variable).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command List <br>
C&acirc;Kermit has more than 200 top&acirc;level commands,
and some of these, such as SET, branch off into hundreds of
subcommands of their own, so it&rsquo;s not practical to
describe them all <br>
here. Instead, here&rsquo;s a concise list of the most
commonly used top&acirc;level commands, grouped by category.
To learn about each command, type &quot;help&quot; followed
by the command name, <br>
e.g. &quot;help set&quot;. Terms such as Command state and
Connect state are explained in subsequent sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optional fields are shown in [
brackets ]. &quot;filename&quot; means the name of a single
file. filespec means a file specification that is allowed to
contain wildcard characters like <br>
&rsquo;*&rsquo; to match groups of files. options are
(optional) switches like /PAGE, /NOPAGE, /QUIET, etc, listed
in the HELP text for each command. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">send /recursive /larger:10000
/after:-1week /except:*.txt *</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which can be read as &quot;send
all the files in this directory and all the ones underneath
it that are larger than 10000 bytes, no more than one week
old, and whose names don&rsquo;t end <br>
with &quot;.txt&quot;.</p>

includes a brief tutorial. Hint: HELP LEARN to find out how
to get Kermit to write simple scripts for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of Kermit&rsquo;s commands
have synonyms, variants, relatives, and so on. For example,
MSEND is a version of SEND that accepts a list of file
specifications to be sent, rather <br>
than just one file specification, and MPUT is a synonym of
MSEND. MOVE means to SEND and then DELETE the source file if
successful. MMOVE is like MOVE, but accepts a list of <br>
filespecs, and so on. These are described in the full
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use question mark to feel your
way through an unfamiliar command, as in this example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-Kermit&gt; remote ? One of the
following: <br>
assign directory kermit print rmdir <br>
cd exit login pwd set <br>
copy help logout query space <br>
delete host mkdir rename type <br>
C-Kermit&gt; remote set ? One of the following: <br>
attributes file retry transfer <br>
block-check receive server window <br>
C-Kermit&gt; remote set file ? One of the following: <br>
character-set incomplete record-length <br>
collision names type <br>
C-Kermit&gt; remote set file names ? One of the following:
<br>
converted literal <br>
C-Kermit&gt; remote set file names literal <br>
C-Kermit&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is called menu on demand:
you get a menu when you want one, but menus are not forced
on you even when know what you&rsquo;re doing. Note that you
can also abbreviate most key&acirc; <br>
words, and you can complete them with the Tab or Esc key.
Also note that ? works for filenames too, and that you can
use it in the middle of a keyword or filename, not just at
<br>
the beginning. For example, &quot;send x?&quot; lists all
the files in the current directory whose names start with
&rsquo;x&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INITIALIZATION FILE <br>
In its default configuration, C&acirc;Kermit executes
commands from a file called .kermrc in your home directory
when it starts, unless it is given the -Y or -y
command&acirc;line option. <br>
Custom configurations might substitute a shared
system&acirc;wide initialization file. The SHOW FILE command
tells what initialization file, if any, was used. The
standard initializa&acirc; <br>
tion file &quot;chains&quot; to an individual customization
file, .mykermc, in the home directory, in which each user
can establish her/his own preferences, define macros, and so
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since execution of the
initialization file (at least the standard one) makes
C&acirc;Kermit take longer to start, it might be better not
to have an initialization file, especially now <br>
that Kermit&rsquo;s default startup configuration is well
attuned to modern computing and networking &acirc;&acirc; in
other words, you no longer have do anything special to make
Kermit transfers <br>
go fast. So instead of having an initialization file that is
executed every time Kermit starts, you might consider making
one or more kerbang scripts (with names other that <br>
.kermrc) that do NOT include an &quot;exit&quot; command,
and invoke those when you need the settings, macro
definitions, and/or scripted actions they contain, and
invoke C&acirc;Kermit directly <br>
when you don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To put it another way... We
still distribute the standard initialization file since
it&rsquo;s featured in the manual and backwards
compatibility is important to us. But there&rsquo;s no <br>
harm in not using it if you don&rsquo;t need the stuff
that&rsquo;s in it (services directory, dialing directory,
network directory, and associated macro definitions). On the
other hand, if <br>
there are settings or macros you want in effect EVERY time
you use Kermit, the initialization file (or the
customization file it chains to) is the place to put them,
because <br>
that&rsquo;s the only place Kermit looks for them
automatically each time you start it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODES OF OPERATION <br>
Kermit is said to be in Local mode if it has made a
connection to another computer, e.g. by dialing it or
establishing a Telnet connection to it. The other computer
is remote, so <br>
if you start another copy of Kermit on the remote computer,
it is said to be in Remote mode (as long as it has not made
any connections of its own). The local Kermit communicates
<br>
over the communications device or network connection, acting
as a conduit between the the remote computer and your
keyboard and screen. The remote Kermit is the
file&acirc;transfer <br>
partner to the local Kermit and communicates only through
its standard input and output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At any moment, a Kermit program
can be in any of the following states. It&rsquo;s important
to know what they are and how to change from one to the
other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command state <br>
In this state, Kermit reads commands from:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Your keyboard;
or: <br>
&Acirc;&middot; A file, or: <br>
&Acirc;&middot; A macro definition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can exit from Command state
back to Unix with the EXIT or QUIT command (same thing). You
can enter Connect state with any of various commands
(CONNECT, DIAL, TELNET, <br>
etc). You can enter file transfer state with commands like
SEND, RECEIVE, and GET. You can enter Server state with the
SERVER command. The TAKE command tells Kermit to <br>
read and execute commands from a file. The (perhaps implied)
DO command tells Kermit to read and execute commands from a
macro definition. While in Command state, you can <br>
interrupt any command, macro, or command file by typing
Ctrl-C (hold down the Ctrl key and press the C key); this
normally brings you back to the prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shell state <br>
You can invoke an inferior shell or external command from
the Kermit command prompt by using the PUSH, RUN (!), EDIT,
or BROWSE command. While the inferior shell or com&acirc;
<br>
mand is active, Kermit is suspended and does nothing. Return
to Kermit Command state by exiting from the inferior shell
or application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Connect state <br>
In this state, which can be entered only when in Local mode
(i.e. when Kermit has made a connection to another
computer), Kermit is acting as a terminal to the remote
com&acirc; <br>
puter. Your keystrokes are sent to the remote computer and
characters that arrive over the communication connection are
displayed on your screen. This state is entered <br>
when you give a CONNECT, DIAL, TELNET, RLOGIN, or IKSD
command. You can return to command state by logging out of
the remote computer, or by typing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl- <br>
That is: Hold down the Ctrl key and press the backslash key,
then let go of the Ctrl key and press the C key. This is
called escaping back. Certain other escape&acirc;level <br>
commands are also provided; type Ctrl- <br>
Ctrl-</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To send a Ctrl-&nbsp;to the host
while in Connect state, type two of them in a row. See HELP
CONNECT and HELP SET ESCAPE for more info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Local file&acirc;transfer state
<br>
In this state, Kermit is sending packets back and forth with
the other computer in order to transfer a file or accomplish
some other file&acirc;related task. And at the same <br>
time, it is displaying its progress on your screen and
watching your keyboard for interruptions. In this state, the
following single&acirc;keystroke commands are accepted:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X Interrupt the current file and
go on to the next (if any).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Z Interrupt the current file and
skip all the rest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E Like Z but uses a
&quot;stronger&quot; protocol (use if X or Z don&rsquo;t
work).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-C Interrupt
file&acirc;transfer mode (use if Z or E don&rsquo;t
work).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kermit returns to its previous
state (Command or Connect) when the transfer is complete or
when interrupted successfully by X, Z, E, or Ctrl-C (hold
down the Ctrl key and press <br>
the C key).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remote file&acirc;transfer state
<br>
In this state, Kermit is exchanging file&acirc;transfer
packets with its local partner over its standard i/o. It
leaves this state automatically when the transfer is
complete. <br>
In case you find your local Kermit in Connect state and the
remote one in File&acirc;transfer state (in which it seems
to ignore your keystrokes), you can usually return it to
<br>
command state by typing three Ctrl-C&rsquo;s in a row. If
that doesn&rsquo;t work, return your local Kermit to Command
state (Ctrl-&nbsp;C) and type &quot;e&acirc;packet&quot; and
then press the Return <br>
or Enter key; this forces a fatal Kermit protocol error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remote Server state <br>
This is like Remote File&acirc;transfer state, except it
never returns automatically to Command state. Rather, it
awaits further instructions from the client program; that
is, <br>
from your Local Kermit program. You can return the Remote
Server to its previous state by issuing a &quot;finish&quot;
command to the client, or if you are in Connect state, by
typ&acirc; <br>
ing three Ctrl-C&rsquo;s in a row. You can tell the server
job to log out and break the connection by issuing a
&quot;bye&quot; command to the client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Local Server state <br>
Like Remote&acirc;Server state, but in local mode, and
therefore with its file&acirc;transfer display showing, and
listening for single&acirc;key commands, as in Local
File&acirc;transfer state. <br>
Usually this state is entered automatically when a remote
Kermit program gives a GET command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C&acirc;Kermit, Kermit 95, and
MS&acirc;DOS Kermit all can switch automatically from
Connect state to Local File&acirc;transfer state when you
initiate a file transfer from the remote com&acirc; <br>
puter by starting Kermit and telling it to send or get a
file, in which case, Connect state is automatically resumed
after the file transfer is finished.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that C&acirc;Kermit is not
a terminal emulator. It is a communications application that
you run in a terminal window (e.g. console or Xterm). The
specific emulation, such <br>
as VT100, VT220, Linux Console, or Xterm, is provided by the
terminal window in which you are running C&acirc;Kermit.
Kermit 95 and MS&acirc;DOS Kermit, on the other hand, are
true <br>
terminal emulators. Why is C&acirc;Kermit not a terminal
emulator? CLICK HERE to read about it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAKING CONNECTIONS <br>
Here is how to make different kinds of connections using
interactive Kermit commands (as noted above, you can also
make connections with command&acirc;line options). Note that
you <br>
don&rsquo;t have to make connections with Kermit. It can
also be used on the far end of a connection as the remote
file transfer and management partner of your local
communications <br>
software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Making a Telnet Connection <br>
At the C&acirc;Kermit command prompt, simply type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">telnet foo.bar.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(substituting desired hostname
or address). You can also include a port number:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">telnet xyzcorp.com 3000 ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the connection is successful,
Kermit automically enters Connect state. When you logout
from the remote host, Kermit automatically returns to its
prompt. More info: HELP <br>
TELNET, HELP SET TELNET, HELP SET TELOPT. Also see the IKSD
section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Making an Rlogin connection <br>
This is just like Telnet, except you have to be root to do
it because Rlogin uses a privileged TCP port:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rlogin foo.bar.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More info: HELP RLOGIN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Making an SSH Connection <br>
Unlike Telnet and Rlogin, SSH connections are not
built&acirc;in, but handled by running your external SSH
client through a pseudoterminal. Using C&acirc;Kermit to
control the SSH <br>
client gives you all of Kermit&rsquo;s features (file
transfer, character&acirc;set conversion, scripting, etc)
over SSH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssh foo.bar.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More info: HELP SSH, HELP SET
SSH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dialing with a Modem <br>
If it&rsquo;s an external modem, make sure it is connected
to a usable serial port on your computer with a regular
(straight&acirc;through) modem cable, and to the telephone
jack with <br>
a telephone cable, and that it&rsquo;s turned on. Then use
these commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set modem type usrobotics ; Or
other supported type <br>
set line /dev/ttyS0 ; Specify device name <br>
set speed 57600 ; Or other desired speed <br>
set flow rts/cts ; Most modern modems support this <br>
set dial method tone ; (or pulse) <br>
dial 7654321 ; Dial the desired number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Type &quot;set modem type
?&quot; for a list of supported modem types. If you omit the
SET MODEM TYPE command, the default type is
&quot;generic&acirc;high&acirc;speed&quot;, which should
work for most <br>
modern AT&acirc;command&acirc;set modems. If the line is
busy, Kermit redials automatically. If the call does not
succeed, use &quot;set dial display on&quot; and try it
again to watch what <br>
happens. If the call succeeds, Kermit enters Connect state
automatically and returns to its prompt automatically when
you log out from the remote computer or the connec&acirc;
<br>
tion is otherwise lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also dial from a modem
that is accessible by Telnet, e.g. to a reverse terminal
server. In this case the command sequence is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set host ts.xxx.com 2000 ;
Terminal&acirc;server and port <br>
set modem type usrobotics ; Or other supported type <br>
set dial method tone ; (or pulse) <br>
dial 7654321 ; Dial the desired number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the terminal server supports
the Telnet Com Port Option, RFC 2217, you can also give
serial&acirc;port related commands such as SET SPEED, SET
PARITY, and so on, and Kermit <br>
relays them to the terminal server using the protocol
specified in the RFC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More info: HELP SET MODEM, HELP

COMMUNICATIONS, SHOW MODEM, <br>
SHOW DIAL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Direct Serial Port <br>
Connect the two computers, A and B, with a null modem cable
(or two modem cables interconnected with a null&acirc;modem
adapter or modem eliminator). From Computer A:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set modem type none ; There is
no modem <br>
set line /dev/ttyS0 ; Specify device name <br>
set carrier-watch off ; If DTR CD are not
cross&acirc;connected <br>
set speed 57600 ; Or other desired speed <br>
set flow rts/cts ; If RTS and CTS are cross&acirc;connected
<br>
set parity even ; (or &quot;mark&quot; or &quot;space&quot;,
if necessary) <br>
set stop-bits 2 ; (rarely necessary) <br>
set flow xon/xoff ; If you can&rsquo;t use RTS/CTS <br>
connect ; Enter Connect (terminal) state</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This assumes Computer B is set
up to let you log in. If it isn&rsquo;t, you can run a copy
of Kermit on Computer B and follow approximately the same
directions. More info: As <br>
above plus HELP CONNECT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With modems or direct serial
connections, you might also have to &quot;set parity
even&quot; (or &quot;mark&quot; or &quot;space&quot;) if
it&rsquo;s a 7&acirc;bit connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of the connection types listed
above, only one can be open at a time. However, any one of
these can be open concurrently with an FTP or HTTP session.
Each connection type can be <br>
customized to any desired degree, scripted, logged, you name
it. See the manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: On selected platforms,
C&acirc;Kermit also can make X.25 connections. See the
manual for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRANSFERRING FILES WITH KERMIT
<br>
There is a widespread and persistent belief that Kermit is a
slow protocol. This is because, until recently, it used
conservative tuning by default to make sure file transfers
<br>
succeeded, rather than failing because they overloaded the
connection. Some extra commands (or command&acirc;line
options, like -Q) were needed to make it go fast, but nobody
bothered <br>
to find out about them. Also, it takes two to tango: most
non&acirc;Kermit&acirc;Project Kermit protocol
implementations really ARE slow. The best
file&acirc;transfer partners for C&acirc;Kermit are: <br>
another copy of C&acirc;Kermit (7.0 or later) and Kermit 95.
These combinations work well and they work fast by default.
MS&acirc;DOS Kermit is good too, but you have to tell it to
go fast <br>
(by giving it the FAST command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, all three of these
Kermit programs support &quot;autodownload&quot; and
&quot;autoupload&quot;, meaning that when they are in
Connect state and a Kermit packet comes in from the remote,
<br>
they automatically switch into file transfer mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And plus, C&acirc;Kermit and K95
also switch automatically between text and binary mode for
each file, so there is no need to &quot;set file type
binary&quot; or &quot;set file type text&quot;, or to <br>
worry about files being corrupted because they were
transferred in the wrong mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What all of these words add up
to is that now, when you use up&acirc;to&acirc;date Kermit
software from the Kermit Project, file transfer is not only
fast, it&rsquo;s ridiculously easy. You barely <br>
have to give any commands at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Downloading Files <br>
Let&rsquo;s say you have Kermit 95, C&acirc;Kermit, or
MS&acirc;DOS Kermit on your desktop computer, with a
connection to a Unix computer that has C&acirc;Kermit
installed as &quot;kermit&quot;. To down&acirc; <br>
load a file (send it from Unix to your desktop computer),
just type the following command at your Unix shell
prompt:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kermit -s oofa.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(where oofa.txt is the
filename). If you want to send more than one file, you can
put as many filenames as you want on the command line, and
they can be any combination of <br>
text and binary:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kermit -s oofa.txt oofa.zip
oofa.html oofa.tar.gz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and/or you can use wildcards to
send groups of files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kermit -s oofa.*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to send a file under
an assumed name, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kermit -s friday.txt -a
today.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This sends the file friday.txt
but tells the receiving Kermit that its name is today.txt.
In all cases, as noted, when the file transfer is finished,
your desktop Kermit <br>
returns automatically to Connect state. No worries about
escaping back, re&acirc;connecting, text/binary mode
switching. Almost too easy, right?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Uploading Files <br>
To upload files (send them from your desktop computer to the
remote Unix computer) do the same thing, but use the -g
(GET) option instead of -s:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kermit -g oofa.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This causes your local Kermit to
enter server mode; then the remote Kermit program requests
the named file and the local Kermit sends it and returns
automatically to Con&acirc; <br>
nect state when done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to upload multiple
files, you have have use shell quoting rules, since these
aren&rsquo;t local files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kermit -g &quot;oofa.txt
oofa.zip oofa.html oofa.tar.gz&quot; <br>
kermit -g &quot;oofa.*&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to upload a file but
store it under a different name, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kermit -g friday.txt -a
today.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kermit Transfers the
Old&acirc;Fashioned Way <br>
If your desktop communications software does not support
autoupload or autodownload, or it does not include Kermit
server mode, the procedure requires more steps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To download a file, type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kermit -s filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">on the host as before, but if
nothing happens automatically in response to this command,
you have to switch your desktop communications software into
Kermit Receive state. <br>
This might be done by escaping back using keyboard
characters or hot keys (Alt-x is typical) and/or with a
command (like RECEIVE) or a menu. When the file transfer is
com&acirc; <br>
plete, you have to go back to Connect state, Terminal
emulation, or whatever terminology applies to your desktop
communications software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To upload a file, type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kermit -r</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">on the host (rather than
&quot;kermit -g&quot;). This tells C&acirc;Kermit to wait
passively for a file to start arriving. Then regain the
attention of your desktop software (Alt-x or <br>
whatever) and instruct it to send the desired file(s) with
Kermit protocol. When the transfer is finished, return to
the Connect or Terminal screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If File Transfer Fails <br>
Although every aspect of Kermit&rsquo;s operation can be
finely tuned, there are also three short and simple
&quot;omnibus tuning&quot; commands you can use for
troubleshooting:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FAST Use fast
file&acirc;transfer settings. This has been the default
since C&acirc;Kermit 7.0 now that most modern computers and
connections support it. If transfers fail with fast <br>
settings, try . . .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAUTIOUS <br>
Use cautious but not paranoid settings. File transfers, if
they work, will go at medium speed. If not, try . . .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ROBUST Use the most robust,
resilient, conservative, safe, and reliable settings. File
transfers will almost certainly work, but they will be quite
slow (of course this is <br>
a classic tradeoff; ROBUST was C&acirc;Kermit&rsquo;s
default tuning in versions 6.0 and earlier, which made
everybody think Kermit protocol was slow). If ROBUST
doesn&rsquo;t do the <br>
trick, try again with SET PARITY SPACE first in case
it&rsquo;s not an 8&acirc;bit connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Obviously the success and
performance of a file transfer also depends on
C&acirc;Kermit&rsquo;s file transfer partner.
Up&acirc;to&acirc;date, real Kermit Project partners are
recommended because they <br>
contain the best Kermit protocol implementations and because
we can support them in case of trouble.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you still have trouble,
consult Chapter 10 of Using C&acirc;Kermit, or send email to
kermit&acirc;support@columbia.edu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Advanced Kermit
File&acirc;Transfer Features <br>
Obviously there is a lot more to Kermit file transfer,
including all sorts of interactive commands, preferences,
options, logging, debugging, troubleshooting, and anything
<br>
else you can imagine but that&rsquo;s what the manual and
updates are for. Here are a few topics you can explore if
you&rsquo;re interested by Typing HELP for the listed
commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logging transfers: <br>
LOG TRANSACTIONS (HELP LOG)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatic per&acirc;file
text/binary mode switching: <br>
SET TRANSFER MODE { AUTOMATIC, MANUAL } (HELP SET
TRANSFER).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cross&acirc;platform recursive
directory tree transfer: <br>
SEND /RECURSIVE, GET /RECURSIVE (HELP SEND, HELP GET).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File collision options: <br>
SET FILE COLLISION { OVERWRITE, BACKUP, DISCARD, ... } (HELP
SET FILE).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Update: Transfer only files that
changed since last time: <br>
SET FILE COLLISION UPDATE (HELP SET FILE).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filename selection patterns:
<br>
(HELP WILDCARD).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flexible file selection: <br>
SEND (or GET) /BEFORE /AFTER /LARGER /SMALLER /TYPE /EXCEPT,
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character&acirc;set conversion:
<br>
SET { FILE, TRANSFER } CHARACTER-SET, ASSOCIATE, ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File/Pathname control: <br>
SET { SEND, RECEIVE } PATHNAMES, SET FILE NAMES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Atomic file movement: <br>
SEND (or GET) /DELETE /RENAME /MOVE-TO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transferring to/from standard
i/o of other commands: <br>
SEND (or GET) /COMMAND</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recovery of interrupted transfer
from point of failure: <br>
RESEND, REGET (HELP RESEND, HELP REGET).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non&acirc;Kermit File Transfer
<br>
You can also use C&acirc;Kermit to transfer files with FTP
or HTTP Internet protocols; see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On a regular serial or Telnet
connection where the other computer doesn&rsquo;t support
Kermit protocol at all, you have several options. For
example, if your desktop communica&acirc; <br>
tions software supports Zmodem, use &quot;rz&quot; and
&quot;sz&quot; on the host rather than Kermit. But if Kermit
is your desktop software, and you are using it to make calls
or network <br>
connections to other computers that don&rsquo;t support
Kermit protocol (or that don&rsquo;t have a good
implementation of it), then if your computer also has
external X, Y, or Zmodem <br>
programs that are redirectable, Kermit can use them as
external protocols. HELP SET PROTOCOL for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also capture
&quot;raw&quot; data streams from the other computer with
LOG SESSION (HELP LOG and HELP SET SESSION-LOG for details),
and you can upload files without any pro&acirc; <br>
tocol at all with TRANSMIT (HELP TRANSMIT, HELP SET
TRANSMIT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KERMIT&rsquo;S BUILT&acirc;IN
FTP AND HTTP CLIENTS <br>
Kermit&rsquo;s FTP client is like the regular Unix FTP
client that you&rsquo;re used to, but with some
differences:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It has lots more
commands and features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Each FTP command
must be prefixed with &quot;ftp&quot;, for example &quot;ftp
open&quot;, &quot;ftp get&quot;, &quot;ftp bye&quot;, etc
(this is not strictly true, but until you&rsquo;re more
familiar with it, it&rsquo;s <br>
best to follow this rule).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Commands like
&quot;cd&quot;, &quot;directory&quot;, etc, execute locally,
not on the server. Use &quot;ftp cd&quot;, &quot;ftp
dir&quot;, etc, to have them act on the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You can have an
FTP session and a regular Kermit serial or Telnet session
open at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; FTP sessions can
be fully automated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pending publication of the next
edition of the manual, the Kermit FTP client is thoroughly
documented at the Kermit Project website:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ftpclient.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You also can use HELP FTP and
HELP SET FTP to get descriptions of Kermit&rsquo;s
FTP&acirc;related commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The HTTP client is similar to
the FTP one, except you prefix each command with HTTP
instead of FTP: HTTP OPEN, HTTP GET, HTTP PUT, HTTP CLOSE,
etc. Type HELP HTTP for details, <br>
or visit the to view the manual supplements. HTTP
connections can be open at the same time as regular serial
or Telnet connections and FTP connections. So Kermit can
manage up <br>
to three types connections simultaneously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERNET KERMIT SERVICE <br>
C&acirc;Kermit can be configured and run as an Internet
service (called IKSD), similar to an FTP server (FTPD)
except you can (but need not) interact with it directly,
plus it does a <br>
lot more than an FTP server can do. The TCP port for IKSD is
1649. It uses Telnet protocol. C&acirc;Kermit can be an
Internet Kermit Server, or it can be a client of an IKSD.
You can <br>
make connections from C&acirc;Kermit to an IKSD with any of
the following commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">telnet foo.bar.edu 1649 <br>
telnet foo.bar.edu kermit ; if &quot;kermit&quot; is listed
in /etc/services <br>
iksd foo.bar.edu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The IKSD command is equivalent
to a TELNET command specifying port 1649. For more
information about making and using connections to an IKSD,
see:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/cuiksd.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can run an Internet Kermit
Service on your own computer too (if you are the system
administrator). For instructions, see:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/iksd.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
All of C&acirc;Kermit&rsquo;s built&acirc;in TCP/IP
networking methods (Telnet, Rlogin, IKSD, FTP, and HTTP) can
be secured by one or more of the following
IETF&acirc;approved methods:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; MIT Kerberos IV
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; MIT Kerberos V <br>
&Acirc;&middot; SSL/TLS <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Stanford SRP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For complete instructions
see:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/security.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And as noted previously, you can
also make SSH connections with C&acirc;Kermit if you already
have an SSH client installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALTERNATIVE COMMAND&acirc;LINE
PERSONALITIES <br>
When invoked as &quot;kermit&quot; or any other name besides
&quot;ftp&quot; or &quot;telnet&quot;, C&acirc;Kermit has
the command&acirc;line options described above in the
OPTIONS section. However, if you invoke C&acirc;Ker&acirc;
<br>
mit as &quot;telnet&quot; or &quot;ftp&quot;, it changes its
command&acirc;line personality to match. This can be done
(among other ways) with symbolic links (symlinks). For
example, if you want C&acirc;Kermit <br>
to be your regular Telnet client, or the Telnet helper of
your Web browser, you can create a link like the following
in a directory that lies in your PATH ahead of the regular
<br>
telnet program:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ln -s /usr/local/bin/kermit
telnet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now when you give a
&quot;telnet&quot; command, you are invoking Kermit instead,
but with its Telnet command&acirc;line personality so, for
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">telnet xyzcorp.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makes a Telnet connection to
xyzcorp.com, and Kermit exits automatically when the
connection is closed (just like the regular Telnet client).
Type &quot;telnet -h&quot; to get a list of <br>
Kermit&rsquo;s Telnet&acirc;personality command&acirc;line
options, which are intended to be as compatible as possible
with the regular Telnet client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly for FTP:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ln -s /usr/local/bin/kermit
ftp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And now type &quot;ftp -h&quot;
to see its command&acirc;line options, and command lines
just like you would give your regular FTP client:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp xyzcorp.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but with additional options
allowing an entire session to be specified on the command
line. Finally, if Kermit&rsquo;s first command&acirc;line
option is a Telnet, FTP, IKSD, or HTTP URL, <br>
Kermit automatically makes the appropriate kind of
connection and, if indicated by the URL, takes the desired
action:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kermit telnet:xyzcorp.com <br>
Opens a Telnet session</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kermit telnet://olga@xyzcorp.com
<br>
Ditto for user olga</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kermit
ftp://olga@xyzcorp.com/public/oofa.zip <br>
Downloads a file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kermit
kermit://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/f/READ.ME <br>
Ditto for IKSD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kermit
