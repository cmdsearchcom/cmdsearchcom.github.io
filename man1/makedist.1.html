<p>MAKEDIST(1) General Commands Manual MAKEDIST(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
makedist - a distribution kit maker</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
makedist [ -dhqvV ] [ -c dir ] [ -s size ] [-f manifest
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Makedist is a rather simpleminded shar program that knows
how to pack files into multiple kits of approximately 50000
bytes each. The shar scripts produced assume very little
<br>
about the target machine; there is correspondingly little
error checking done compared to other shar programs.
Alternatively, with the -c option, you can create a
directory con&acirc; <br>
taining the whole source tree, and then pack it up using
your own shell archiver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are using the copyright
expansion feature (as determined by packinit), then you have
to pack your distribution using this program to ensure the
copyright is correctly set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to run makedist you
have to do two things:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) Create a .package file in the
package&rsquo;s top-level directory by running packinit.
This program will ask you about your package and remember
what you tell it so that all the <br>
dist programs can be smart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) Create a MANIFEST.new file in
your top-level directory that lists all the files in your
package. The filename should be the first field on each
line. After some whitespace <br>
you can add a comment describing your file (briefly).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After running makedist, you will
have a set of kits in your top-level directory. If your
package name is &quot;foo&quot;, they will be named
foo.kit1, foo.kit2, etc. The file created <br>
PACKLIST file is automatically added to the distribution and
tells which files come with which kits. If you used the -c
option, you will end-up with a single directory instead,
<br>
containing the whole distribution, ready to be sent to the
end-user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a file is too large to be
packed as-is in one archive, it will be automatically split
in smaller parts. Only the first 11 characters of the file
will be kept though, and <br>
makedist will abort if two distinct files are to be split
and have the same 11 first characters in their names. The
split files will automatically be reconstructed at the end
of <br>
the archive extraction by running a script generated in
PACKNOTES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may then mail your kits via
kitsend or post them with kitpost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are handled by makedist:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c dir Tell makedist that the
distribution should be copied (mirrored) in the specified
directory, instead of producing shell archives. Compatible
with the -q option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Turn on debug mode. Probably
not useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f file Use file as manifest. By
default, MANIFEST.new is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print help message and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quick production of the kits:
the checked-out version of the files is used, instead of
using the RCS file to actually get the latest checked-in
version. This will save <br>
some considerable time, but you have to be sure the
checked-out version is up-to-date or you might end up with
an inconsistent package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s size Set maximum kit size to
size bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose mode: trace kit
building process or tree mirroring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print version number and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
Larry Wall &lt;lwall@netlabs.com&gt; (version 2.0) <br>
Raphael Manfredi &lt;ram@hptnos02.grenoble.hp.com&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Creates ./$package.kit* unless -c option is used. <br>
PACKLIST and PACKNOTES are also temporarily created.</p>
