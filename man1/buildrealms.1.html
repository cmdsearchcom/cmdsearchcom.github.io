<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
buildrealms - assist in building a DNSSEC-Tools realms
environment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
buildrealms [options] &lt;realmsfile&gt; &lt;command&gt;
&lt;command-args&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
buildrealms helps in setting up a realms environment for use
by dtrealms. buildrealms creates the required file
hierarchies for each realm, it moves a realm&rsquo;s files
to their <br>
appropriate place in the hierarchy, and it updates several
files for the final destination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The realm hierarchies are built
in a staging area, which will hold the files for all the
realms. These are rollrec files, keyrec files, key files,
configuration files, log <br>
files, and anything else needed for by DNSSEC-Tools to
manage key rollover. After buildrealms creates these files,
the user should check the files to ensure that they are <br>
correct. The files and directories in the staging then must
be manually moved to the final directory. It is from this
directory that dtrealms will manage the various realms. <br>
If the final directory isn&rsquo;t specified (via an
option), then the directory in which buildrealms was
executed will be the final directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">buildrealms uses a realms file
to control how it builds the realms environment. This realm
entries in this file have a hoard field, which is only used
by buildrealms. For each <br>
realm, this field&rsquo;s value is a directory which holds
the files needed by that particular realm. After building
that realm, buildrealms removes the hoard entry from that
realm <br>
record. After all the realms have been built, a copy of this
realms file is moved into the staging area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two operations
buildrealms currently provides. These operations are in
support of creating and maintaining a DNSSEC-Tools realms
environment. This documentation <br>
describes the operations individually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Realms Environment Creation <br>
The create command builds the whole realms environment. The
realm file hierarchies are built in the staging area. After
buildrealms creates these files, the user should check <br>
the files to ensure that they are correct. The files and
directories in the staging then must be manually moved to
the final directory. If the final directory isn&rsquo;t
specified <br>
(via an option), then the directory in which buildrealms was
executed will be the final directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">buildrealms takes the following
actions when given the create command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A file hierarchy
is created for each realm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A DNSSEC-Tools
configuration file is put in each realm&rsquo;s hierarchy.
If the -config option is given, then the specified
configuration file will be copied to each realm. If <br>
it isn&rsquo;t given, then each realm&rsquo;s hoard will be
searched for a file whose name ends with .conf. The first
such file found will be used for that realm only. If such a
file <br>
is not found, then the system-wide DNSSEC-Tools
configuration file will be used for that realm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
realm&rsquo;s rollrec, keyrec, zone, and key files are moved
into the hierarchy. The rollrec file is named in the realms
file. The keyrec and signed zone files are listed in <br>
the rollrec file. The unsigned zone files and key files are
listed in the keyrec file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A key archive is
created for each realm&rsquo;s existing, expired keys. The
key archive is placed in the realm&rsquo;s state directory
in the staging area. Archived keys, as listed in <br>
the keyrec files, are moved to this key archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Paths in several
files are adjusted for the new hierarchy and the
realm&rsquo;s final destination. These paths include
archived keys in the realm&rsquo;s keyrec files, the key
archive <br>
and rollerd log files in the realm&rsquo;s DNSSEC-Tools
configuration file, and key directories in the keyrec
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Realms Hierarchy Creation <br>
The trees command builds the basic directory hierarchy for
each realm in the staging area. However, no other files or
directories are copied or moved in to the staging area..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following directories are
created for each realm:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; configuration
directory - This holds the dnssec-tools directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; dnssec-tools
directory - This will hold the DNSSEC-Tools configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; state directory
- This will hold the realm&rsquo;s state information,
including the key archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; realm directory
- This will hold the realm&rsquo;s rollrec file, the keyrec
files, the zone files (signed and unsigned), and the key
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREPARING FOR EXECUTION <br>
In preparing a realms file and the realm hoards for
buildrealms, there are several things that should be kept in
mind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Use relative
paths for the rollrec file and three directories in the
realms file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; All a
realm&rsquo;s files should be stored in its hoard. They do
not have to be in a particular place in the directory, as
long as the rollrec and keyrec files are accurate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; At the end of
the creation process, the realms file will be copied into
the top level of the staging area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; After specific
files (e.g., rollrecs, keyrecs, etc.) are moved into a
realm&rsquo;s part of the staging area, the remaining files
in the hoard will be moved into the realm&rsquo;s <br>
realmdir part of the staging area. The hierarchical
organization of the remaining hoard files will be
preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The contents of
a keyrec&rsquo;s archive directory in the realm&rsquo;s
hoard, as defined by the archivedir field, will be moved to
&lt;statedir&gt;/key-archive in the staging area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
configuration file for a realm will be put in
&lt;configdir&gt;/dnssec-tools/&lt;conffile&gt; in the
staging area. The actual name of the configuration file
(given here as <br>
&lt;conffile&gt;) will depend on how the configuration file
is found. If the system-wide DNSSEC-Tools file is used, then
the name will be dnssec-tools.conf. If the -config option
<br>
is used, then the name used with the option will be used. If
a .conf file is found in the realm&rsquo;s hoard, then the
full filename will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNINGS <br>
root is not allowed to run buildrealms. Some of the actions
taken by buildrealms can be devastating if a misconfigured
(or maliciously constructed) realm file is used to control
<br>
construction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">buildrealms is not clairvoyant.
It does the best it can, but it is a general tool. The
resulting realms should be checked to ensure they are set up
as desired. In particular, <br>
you should check the realm file rollrec files, keyrec files,
and configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No reverse functionality has
been implemented, so once run, the files are modified,
moved, and copied. It might not be a bad idea to back up
your files prior to running <br>
buildrealms, just in case...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
create <br>
The create command builds the whole realms environment.
buildrealms takes the following actions when given this
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trees <br>
The trees command builds the basic directory hierarchy for
each realm. The following directories are created for each
realm:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-actions <br>
Display the file actions taken by buildrealms. This includes
directory creations, file copies, and file moves. If used in
conjunction with the -nobuild option, buildrealms <br>
will not perform the actions, but will display the actions
that would otherwise have been taken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-clear <br>
This flag indicates that buildrealms should delete the
current staging area and its contents prior to building the
realms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-config conffile <br>
conffile is the DNSSEC-Tools configuration file to copy for
each realm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-directory target <br>
target is the target directory for the realms to be built by
buildrealms. The new realms will not be moved to this
directory, but the realms&rsquo; files will reflect the use
of <br>
this directory. If this option is not specified, the current
directory will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -directory and -stagedir use
the same directory, then the realms environment will be
build in the final directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nobuild <br>
This option tells buildrealms to go through the motions of
building the new realms, but not to actually build anything.
If this is used in conjunctions with the -actions <br>
option, buildrealms will show the actions that would have
been taken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stagedir directory <br>
This directory in which the new realms hierarchy is built.
The default staging area is ./staging-buildrealms if this
option is not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -directory and -stagedir use
the same directory, then the realms environment will be
build in the final directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quiet <br>
buildrealms is prevented from printing any non-error output.
This option and the -verbose option are mutually
exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
buildrealms prints a lot of information about what it is
doing. This option and the -quiet option are mutually
exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Version <br>
Displays the version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help <br>
Displays a help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following examples may help clarify the use of
buildrealms. In each example, the following realms file will
be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">realm &quot;example&quot; <br>
state &quot;active&quot; <br>
configdir &quot;configs/example&quot; <br>
statedir &quot;states/example&quot; <br>
realmdir &quot;r-example&quot; <br>
rollrec &quot;demo-example.rollrec&quot; <br>
administrator &quot;zonefolks@example.com&quot; <br>
display &quot;1&quot; <br>
manager &quot;rollerd&quot; <br>
args &quot;-loglevel phase -logfile log.example&quot; <br>
hoard &quot;r-example&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">realm &quot;test&quot; <br>
state &quot;active&quot; <br>

manager &quot;rollerd&quot; <br>
args &quot;-loglevel tmi -logfile log.test&quot; <br>
display &quot;1&quot; <br>
hoard &quot;r-test&quot;</p>
