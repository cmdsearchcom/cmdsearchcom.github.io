<p>TEXDOCTK(1) General Commands Manual TEXDOCTK(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
texdoctk - GUI for easier access of TeX package and program
documentations</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
texdoctk -[aq]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
texdoctk is a GUI for easier access to a large part of the
vast amount of package and program documentations and
tutorials for TeX and its different derivatives (mainly
LaTeX). <br>
It is optimized and included in the teTeX and fpTeX
distributions and also available with TeXLive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The documentation is grouped
into 17 categories; the 18th button of the main panel is
inactive by default and intended for use with local
additions (see section CONFIGURATION <br>
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the settings window you see a
checkbox in the html-&gt;ps and text-&gt;ps converter menus
for switching on/off output redirect. This is due to the
fact that some converters do not <br>
write their output into a file but to stdout by default, so
a redirect is needed, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a2ps myfile.txt
&gt;myfile.ps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v verbose: enable some viewer messages which are otherwise
sent to stderr, as well as some warning popup windows. This
can also be set in a configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a autoview: autostart viewer if
a listbox contains only one item (this will frequently
happen in search results). This can also be set in a
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
The configuration is controlled by the system default
configuration file ($TEXMFMAIN)/texdoctk/texdocrc.defaults,
most of whose entries can though be overridden by the
users&rsquo; own <br>
optional ~/.texdocrc files and/or command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Settings menu and
configuration files <br>
The Settings menu is used to change the user-definable
settings of texdoctk for the duration of the program call or
as new defaults. The latter case is the purpose of the Save
<br>
button, which generates or rewrites the user&rsquo;s own
~/.texdocrc file. The system defaults cannot be edited with
the Settings menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Paths The TEXMF-type paths on
the system are reported, and the user can specify the name
of the subdirectory of $HOMETEXMF, where the personal
documentation is stored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General viewer behaviour</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppress error messages toggle
verbose mode (see option -v); default is off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Autostart viewer for one-item
listboxes if a listbox contains only one item (see option
-a)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use text viewer for unknown file
format i.e. treat the file as plain text. texdoctk should
recognize the usual file formats and also relate names like
README to plain <br>
text, but some docs may have freely invented names. Default
is on; if switched off, trying to view such files will raise
an error. The switch does not influence printing: <br>
unrecognized formats cannot be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change viewer colours using
either RGB triplets in the format #rrggbb or the
standardized names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DVI/PostScript/PDF/HTML/Plain
text <br>
For text files, texdoctk provides an own viewer. If this
viewer is disabled, but no alternative viewer is specified,
texdoctk tries to read the content of the environment <br>
variable $PAGER.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to print the
documentations, you will need converters to turn non-PS
files into PostScript. Here are some suggestions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvi-&gt;ps: dvips (is part of
teTeX) (http://www.radicaleye.com/dvips.html)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdf-&gt;ps: pdf2ps
(http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost) or Acrobat Reader
(http://www.adobe.com)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">html-&gt;ps: html2ps
(http://user.it.uu.se/~jan/html2ps.html)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plain text-&gt;ps: a2ps
(http://www-inf.enst.fr/~demaille/a2ps/)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The html-&gt;ps and text-&gt;ps
converter menus for switching on/off output redirect. This
is due to the fact that some converters do not write their
output into a file but to <br>
stdout by default, so a redirect is needed, e.g. a2ps
myfile.txt &gt;myfile.ps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The system-wide configuration
file is ($TEXMFMAIN)/texdoctk/texdocrc.defaults and should
only be writable by the administrator of the installation
using any text editor. The <br>
optional user configuration file is ~/.texdocrc and can
override all but those system settings which affect the
installation as a whole. The preferred way of changing it is
<br>
through the Settings menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The databases <br>
texdoctk comes with a default database file
($TEXMFMAIN)/texdoctk/texdoctk.dat with a special format. It
is divided into 17 sections corresponding to the 17 buttons
that are <br>
active by default. Each section begins with a line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@section_name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where section_name is the text
as it appears in the button. This title is followed by the
descriptive entries for each documentation, which have this
format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package-label;Short description
for listbox (opt. package-name);path in doc
directory;optional keywords</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(without breaking the line!).
Comments (initiated with a #) and empty lines are ignored by
the program. The second field is the text displayed in the
selection listboxes of tex&acirc; <br>
doctk, and you will usually want to mention the name of the
package in parens along with it; the first field is a unique
label for the package for internal use of the program <br>
which will usually be chosen identical to the package name,
but can be different if there is more than one documentation
file coming with a package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The administrator will probably
install additional packages in the local texmf tree. The
corresponding documentation can be made accessible by an
additional database $TEXMFLO&acirc; <br>
CAL/texdoctk/texdoctk-local.dat. Furthermore, individual
users possibly install additional packages in an texmf
subdirectory of their $HOME, for which they can make an
individual <br>
database themselves as
$TEXMFHOME/texdoctk/texdoctk-pers.dat. After creating such
files, texhash must be executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both types of databases must
have the same structure as the system database, although
they need (and should) not include all its sections if there
are no additional entries. For <br>
example, if the the package foo is added to the local tree
such that its documentation file is
($TEXMFLOCAL)/doc/latex/foo/foo.dvi and it is decided that
it fits best into the <br>
existing category Graphics, texdoctk-local.dat would look
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@Graphics <br>
foo;Create bells and whistles
(foo);latex/foo/foo.dvi;decoration</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The entry for foo will then be
appended to the list of entries in the Graphics category.
The 18th button can be activated in the same way, but using
a new category name; possible <br>
entries at the beginning of the database which have not been
assigned to a category will be assigned to the default
Miscellaneous, making the 18th button active with that
label. <br>
Note that you cannot have more than 18 categories; if there
are more, only the one defined last will appear and be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the documentation is included
in the .sty file instead of a proper documentation file, the
optional keywords should start with -?- directly after the
semicolon, where ? is 0, <br>
1, 2 or 3; these are flags which indicate in which part of
the .sty the instructions are placed and should help
texdoctk to extract the documentation from the style and
present <br>
it without the code, which would normally be of little
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 no specific place, scattered
between the code</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 at end, behind \ndinput; some
.sty files have well-organized documentation behind the end
of the actual code, where TeX doesn&rsquo;t see it upon
compilation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 at beginning, terminated by
%%%%%%; in some other cases, some usage information is at
the beginning of the .sty as a comment terminated by a line
full of %</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 as 2, but with a blank line as
termination</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the system database for
plenty of examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$TEXMFMAIN/texdoctk/texdocrc.defaults system-wide
configuration file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.texdocrc (optional) personal
configuration file; can also be created with the Settings
menu</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$TEXMFMAIN/texdoctk/texdoctk.dat
default database file for documentation files of the
distribution</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$TEXMFLOCAL/texdoctk/texdoctk-local.dat
(optional) local database file for documentation files</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$TEXMFHOME/texdoctk/texdoctk-pers.dat
(optional) personal database file of individual users for
documentation files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Widget placement in topic toplevels becomes ugly when the
toplevel is stretched or shrunk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The font in the frame labels of
the Settings menu are not forced to the default font; this
will become visible e.g. at hi-res screens, where the label
font is not scaled up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Netscape and Mozilla error
output will be written to stderr even if the quiet mode was
set.</p>
