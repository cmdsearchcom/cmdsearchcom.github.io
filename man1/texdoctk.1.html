texdoctk - GUI for easier access of TeX package and program documentations
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>texdoctk</b> -[aq]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>texdoctk</b> is a GUI for easier access to a large part of the vast amount of
  package and program documentations and tutorials for TeX and its different
  derivatives (mainly LaTeX). It is optimized and included in the teTeX and
  fpTeX distributions and also available with TeXLive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The documentation is grouped into 17 categories; the 18th button of the main
  panel is inactive by default and intended for use with local additions (see
  section <b>CONFIGURATION</b> below).
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the settings window you see a checkbox in the html-&gt;ps and text-&gt;ps
  converter menus for switching on/off output redirect. This is due to the fact
  that some converters do not write their output into a file but to stdout by
  default, so a redirect is needed, e.g.
<div class="Pp"></div>
a2ps myfile.txt &gt;myfile.ps
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>-v</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">verbose: enable some viewer messages which are otherwise
      sent to stderr, as well as some warning popup windows. This can also be
      set in a configuration file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>-a</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">autoview: autostart viewer if a listbox contains only one
      item (this will frequently happen in search results). This can also be set
      in a configuration file.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
The configuration is controlled by the system default configuration file
  ($TEXMFMAIN)/texdoctk/texdocrc.defaults, most of whose entries can though be
  overridden by the users' own optional ~/.texdocrc files and/or command line
  options.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_Settings_menu_and_configuration_files"><a class="selflink" href="#The_Settings_menu_and_configuration_files">The
  Settings menu and configuration files</a></h2>
The Settings menu is used to change the user-definable settings of
  <b>texdoctk</b> for the duration of the program call or as new defaults. The
  latter case is the purpose of the Save button, which generates or rewrites the
  user's own ~/.texdocrc file. The system defaults cannot be edited with the
  Settings menu.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Paths</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The TEXMF-type paths on the system are reported, and the
      user can specify the name of the subdirectory of $HOMETEXMF, where the

  <dd class="It-tag">

    <i>Use text viewer for unknown file format</i> i.e. treat the file as plain
      text. <b>texdoctk</b> should recognize the usual file formats and also
      relate names like README to plain text, but some docs may have freely
      invented names. Default is on; if switched off, trying to view such files
      will raise an error. The switch does not influence printing: unrecognized
      formats cannot be printed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

  <dd class="It-tag">For text files, <b>texdoctk</b> provides an own viewer. If
      this viewer is disabled, but no alternative viewer is specified,
      <b>texdoctk</b> tries to read the content of the environment variable
      $PAGER.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you want to print the documentations, you will need converters to turn
      non-PS files into PostScript. Here are some suggestions:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     dvi-&gt;ps: dvips (is part of teTeX) (http://www.radicaleye.com/dvips.html)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     pdf-&gt;ps: pdf2ps (http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost) or Acrobat Reader
      (http://www.adobe.com)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     html-&gt;ps: html2ps (http://user.it.uu.se/~jan/html2ps.html)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     plain text-&gt;ps: a2ps (http://www-inf.enst.fr/~demaille/a2ps/)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The html-&gt;ps and text-&gt;ps converter menus for switching on/off output
      redirect. This is due to the fact that some converters do not write their
      output into a file but to stdout by default, so a redirect is needed, e.g.
      <b>a2ps myfile.txt &gt;myfile.ps</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The system-wide configuration file is ($TEXMFMAIN)/texdoctk/texdocrc.defaults
  and should only be writable by the administrator of the installation using any
  text editor. The optional user configuration file is ~/.texdocrc and can
  override all but those system settings which affect the installation as a
  whole. The preferred way of changing it is through the Settings menu.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_databases"><a class="selflink" href="#The_databases">The
  databases</a></h2>
<b>texdoctk</b> comes with a default database file
  ($TEXMFMAIN)/texdoctk/texdoctk.dat with a special format. It is divided into
  17 sections corresponding to the 17 buttons that are active by default. Each
  section begins with a line
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
@ <i>section_name</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
where <i>section_name</i> is the text as it appears in the button. This title is
  followed by the descriptive entries for each documentation, which have this
  format:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<i>package-label</i>;Short description for listbox (opt.
  <i>package-name</i>);path in doc directory;optional keywords
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
(without breaking the line!). Comments (initiated with a #) and empty lines are
  ignored by the program. The second field is the text displayed in the
  selection listboxes of <b>texdoctk</b>, and you will usually want to mention
  the name of the package in parens along with it; the first field is a
  <b>unique</b> label for the package for internal use of the program which will
  usually be chosen identical to the package name, but can be different if there
  is more than one documentation file coming with a package.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The administrator will probably install additional packages in the local texmf
  tree. The corresponding documentation can be made accessible by an additional
  database $TEXMFLOCAL/texdoctk/texdoctk-local.dat. Furthermore, individual
  users possibly install additional packages in an texmf subdirectory of their
  $HOME, for which they can make an individual database themselves as
  $TEXMFHOME/texdoctk/texdoctk-pers.dat. After creating such files, texhash must
  be executed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Both types of databases must have the same structure as the system database,
  although they need (and should) not include all its sections if there are no
  additional entries. For example, if the the package <i>foo</i> is added to the
  local tree such that its documentation file is
  ($TEXMFLOCAL)/doc/latex/foo/foo.dvi and it is decided that it fits best into
  the existing category Graphics, texdoctk-local.dat would look like this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
@Graphics
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
foo;Create bells and whistles (foo);latex/foo/foo.dvi;decoration
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The entry for <i>foo</i> will then be appended to the list of entries in the
  Graphics category. The 18th button can be activated in the same way, but using
  a new category name; possible entries at the beginning of the database which
  have not been assigned to a category will be assigned to the default
  Miscellaneous, making the 18th button active with that label. Note that you
  cannot have more than 18 categories; if there are more, only the one defined
  last will appear and be used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the documentation is included in the .sty file instead of a proper
  documentation file, the optional keywords should start with -?- directly after
  the semicolon, where ? is 0, 1, 2 or 3; these are flags which indicate in
  which part of the .sty the instructions are placed and should help
  <b>texdoctk</b> to extract the documentation from the style and present it
  without the code, which would normally be of little use.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">0</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">no specific place, scattered between the code</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">at end, behind \endinput; some .sty files have
      well-organized documentation behind the end of the actual code, where TeX
      doesn't see it upon compilation</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">at beginning, terminated by %%%%%%; in some other cases,
      some usage information is at the beginning of the .sty as a comment
      terminated by a line full of %</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">as 2, but with a blank line as termination</dd>

The font in the frame labels of the Settings menu are not forced to the default
  font; this will become visible e.g. at hi-res screens, where the label font is
  not scaled up.

Netscape and Mozilla error output will be written to stderr even if the quiet
