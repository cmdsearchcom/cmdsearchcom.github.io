<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
alsa_in, alsa_out - Jack clients that perform I/O with an
alternate audio interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
alsa_in [options] <br>
alsa_out [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
A JACK client that opens a specified audio interface
(different to the one used by the JACK server, if any) and
moves audio data between its JACK ports and the interface.
alsa_in <br>
will provide data from the interface (potentially for
capture); alsa_out will deliver data to it (for
playback).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The audio interface used by
alsa_in/alsa_out does not need to be synchronized with JACK
backend (or the hardware it might be using).
alsa_in/alsa_out tries to resample the out&acirc; <br>
put stream in an attempt to compensate for drift between the
two clocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of jack-0.116.3 this works
almost perfectly. It takes some time, to reach absolute
resample-rate stability. So give it some minutes (its
intended to be running permanently <br>
anyways)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-j jack_client_name <br>
Set Client Name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d alsa_device <br>
Use this Soundcard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
Verbose, prints out resample coefficient and other
parameters useful for debugging, every 500ms. also reports
soft xruns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i <br>
Instrumentation. This logs the 4 important parameters of the
samplerate control algorithm every 1ms. You can pipe this
into a file, and plot it. Should only be necessary, <br>
if it does not work as expected, and we need to adjust some
of the obscure parameters, to make it work. Find me on
irc.freenode.org #jack in order to set this up cor&acirc;
<br>
rectly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c channels <br>
Set Number of channels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r sample_rate <br>
Set sample_rate. The program resamples as necessary. So you
can connect a 44k1 jackd to a soundcard only supporting 48k.
(default is jack sample_rate)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p period_size <br>
Set the period size. It is not related to the jackd
period_size. Sometimes it affects the quality of the delay
measurements. Setting this lower than the jackd <br>
period_size will only work, if you use a higher number of
periods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n num_period <br>
Set number of periods. See note for period_size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q quality <br>
Set the quality of the resampler from 0 to 4. can
significanly reduce cpu usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m max_diff <br>
The value when a soft xrun occurs. Basically the window, in
which the dma pointer may jitter. I don&rsquo;t think its
necessary to play with this anymore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t target_delay <br>
The delay alsa_io should try to approach. Same as for
max_diff. It will be setup based on -p and -n which is
generally sufficient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s smooth_array_size <br>
This parameter controls the size of the array used for
smoothing the delay measurement. Its default is 256. If you
use a pretty low period size, you can lower the CPU <br>
usage a bit by decreasing this parameter. However most CPU
time is spent in the resampling so this will not be
much.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C P Control Clamp <br>
If you have a PCI card, then the default value (15) of this
parameter is too high for -p64 -n2... Setting it to 5 should
fix that. Be aware that setting this parameter <br>
too low, lets the hf noise on the delay measurement come
through onto the resamplerate, so this might degrade the
quality of the output. (but its a threshold value, and it
<br>
has been chosen, to mask the noise of a USB card, which has
an amplitude which is 50 times higher than that of a PCI
card, so 5 wont loose you any quality on a PCI card)</p>
