Invoked by <i>git send-pack</i> and updates the repository with the information
  fed from the remote end.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This command is usually not invoked directly by the end user. The UI for the
  protocol is on the <i>git send-pack</i> side, and the program pair is meant to
  be used to push updates to remote repository. For pull operations, see
  <b>git-fetch-pack</b>(1).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The command allows for creation and fast-forwarding of sha1 refs (heads/tags) on
  the remote end (strictly speaking, it is the local end <i>git-receive-pack</i>
  runs, but to the user who is sitting at the send-pack end, it is updating the
  remote. Confused?)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There are other real-world examples of using update and post-update hooks found
  in the Documentation/howto directory.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<i>git-receive-pack</i> honours the receive.denyNonFastForwards config option,
  which tells it if updates to a ref should be denied if they are not
  fast-forwards.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PRE-RECEIVE_HOOK"><a class="selflink" href="#PRE-RECEIVE_HOOK">PRE-RECEIVE
  HOOK</a></h1>
Before any ref is updated, if $GIT_DIR/hooks/pre-receive file exists and is
  executable, it will be invoked once with no parameters. The standard input of
  the hook will be one line per ref to be updated:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
sha1-old SP sha1-new SP refname LF
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The refname value is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master head this is
  &quot;refs/heads/master&quot;. The two sha1 values before each refname are the
  object names for the refname before and after the update. Refs to be created
  will have sha1-old equal to 0{40}, while refs to be deleted will have sha1-new
  equal to 0{40}, otherwise sha1-old and sha1-new should be valid objects in the
  repository.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This hook is called before any refname is updated and before any fast-forward
  checks are performed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the pre-receive hook exits with a non-zero exit status no updates will be
  performed, and the update, post-receive and post-update hooks will not be
  invoked either. This can be useful to quickly bail out if the update is not to
  be supported.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="UPDATE_HOOK"><a class="selflink" href="#UPDATE_HOOK">UPDATE
  HOOK</a></h1>
Before each ref is updated, if $GIT_DIR/hooks/update file exists and is
  executable, it is invoked once per ref, with three parameters:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
$GIT_DIR/hooks/update refname sha1-old sha1-new
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The refname parameter is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master head this is
  &quot;refs/heads/master&quot;. The two sha1 arguments are the object names for
  the refname before and after the update. Note that the hook is called before
  the refname is updated, so either sha1-old is 0{40} (meaning there is no such
  ref yet), or it should match what is recorded in refname.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The hook should exit with non-zero status if it wants to disallow updating the
  named ref. Otherwise it should exit with zero.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Successful execution (a zero exit status) of this hook does not ensure the ref
  will actually be updated, it is only a prerequisite. As such it is not a good
  idea to send notices (e.g. email) from this hook. Consider using the
  post-receive hook instead.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="POST-RECEIVE_HOOK"><a class="selflink" href="#POST-RECEIVE_HOOK">POST-RECEIVE
  HOOK</a></h1>
After all refs were updated (or attempted to be updated), if any ref update was
  successful, and if $GIT_DIR/hooks/post-receive file exists and is executable,
  it will be invoked once with no parameters. The standard input of the hook
  will be one line for each successfully updated ref:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
sha1-old SP sha1-new SP refname LF
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The refname value is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master head this is
  &quot;refs/heads/master&quot;. The two sha1 values before each refname are the
  object names for the refname before and after the update. Refs that were
  created will have sha1-old equal to 0{40}, while refs that were deleted will
  have sha1-new equal to 0{40}, otherwise sha1-old and sha1-new should be valid
  objects in the repository.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Using this hook, it is easy to generate mails describing the updates to the
  repository. This example script sends one mail message per ref listing the
  commits pushed to the repository:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
# mail out commit update information.
while read oval nval ref
do
        if expr &quot;$oval&quot; : '0*$' &gt;/dev/null
        then
                echo &quot;Created a new ref, with the following commits:&quot;
                git rev-list --pretty &quot;$nval&quot;
        else
                echo &quot;New commits:&quot;
                git rev-list --pretty &quot;$nval&quot; &quot;^$oval&quot;
        fi |
        mail -s &quot;Changes to ref $ref&quot; commit-list@mydomain
done
exit 0
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The exit code from this hook invocation is ignored, however a non-zero exit code
  will generate an error message.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that it is possible for refname to not have sha1-new when this hook runs.
  This can easily occur if another user modifies the ref after it was updated by
  <i>git-receive-pack</i>, but before the hook was able to evaluate it. It is
  recommended that hooks rely on sha1-new rather than the current value of
  refname.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="POST-UPDATE_HOOK"><a class="selflink" href="#POST-UPDATE_HOOK">POST-UPDATE
  HOOK</a></h1>
After all other processing, if at least one ref was updated, and if
  $GIT_DIR/hooks/post-update file exists and is executable, then post-update
  will be called with the list of refs that have been updated. This can be used
  to implement any repository wide cleanup tasks.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The exit code from this hook invocation is ignored; the only thing left for
  <i>git-receive-pack</i> to do at that point is to exit itself anyway.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This hook can be used, for example, to run git update-server-info if the
  repository is packed and is served via a dumb transport.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
