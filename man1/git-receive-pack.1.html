<p>GIT-RECEIVE-PACK(1) Git Manual GIT-RECEIVE-PACK(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-receive-pack - Receive what is pushed into the
repository</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git-receive-pack &lt;directory&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Invoked by git send-pack and updates the repository with the
information fed from the remote end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is usually not
invoked directly by the end user. The UI for the protocol is
on the git send-pack side, and the program pair is meant to
be used to push updates to <br>
remote repository. For pull operations, see
git-fetch-pack(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command allows for creation
and fast-forwarding of sha1 refs (heads/tags) on the remote
end (strictly speaking, it is the local end git-receive-pack
runs, but to the user who <br>
is sitting at the send-pack end, it is updating the remote.
Confused?)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are other real-world
examples of using update and post-update hooks found in the
Documentation/howto directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git-receive-pack honours the
receive.denyNonFastForwards config option, which tells it if
updates to a ref should be denied if they are not
fast-forwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
&lt;directory&gt; <br>
The repository to sync into.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRE-RECEIVE HOOK <br>
Before any ref is updated, if $GIT_DIR/hooks/pre-receive
file exists and is executable, it will be invoked once with
no parameters. The standard input of the hook will be one
<br>
line per ref to be updated:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sha1-old SP sha1-new SP refname
LF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The refname value is relative to
$GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master head this is
&quot;refs/heads/master&quot;. The two sha1 values before
each refname are the object names for the refname <br>
before and after the update. Refs to be created will have
sha1-old equal to 0{40}, while refs to be deleted will have
sha1-new equal to 0{40}, otherwise sha1-old and sha1-new
<br>
should be valid objects in the repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This hook is called before any
refname is updated and before any fast-forward checks are
performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the pre-receive hook exits
with a non-zero exit status no updates will be performed,
and the update, post-receive and post-update hooks will not
be invoked either. This can be <br>
useful to quickly bail out if the update is not to be
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UPDATE HOOK <br>
Before each ref is updated, if $GIT_DIR/hooks/update file
exists and is executable, it is invoked once per ref, with
three parameters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$GIT_DIR/hooks/update refname
sha1-old sha1-new</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The refname parameter is
relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master head this is
&quot;refs/heads/master&quot;. The two sha1 arguments are
the object names for the refname before and after <br>
the update. Note that the hook is called before the refname
is updated, so either sha1-old is 0{40} (meaning there is no
such ref yet), or it should match what is recorded in <br>
refname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hook should exit with
non-zero status if it wants to disallow updating the named
ref. Otherwise it should exit with zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Successful execution (a zero
exit status) of this hook does not ensure the ref will
actually be updated, it is only a prerequisite. As such it
is not a good idea to send notices <br>
(e.g. email) from this hook. Consider using the post-receive
hook instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POST-RECEIVE HOOK <br>
After all refs were updated (or attempted to be updated), if
any ref update was successful, and if
$GIT_DIR/hooks/post-receive file exists and is executable,
it will be invoked <br>
once with no parameters. The standard input of the hook will
be one line for each successfully updated ref:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sha1-old SP sha1-new SP refname
LF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The refname value is relative to
$GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master head this is
&quot;refs/heads/master&quot;. The two sha1 values before
each refname are the object names for the refname <br>
before and after the update. Refs that were created will
have sha1-old equal to 0{40}, while refs that were deleted
will have sha1-new equal to 0{40}, otherwise sha1-old and
<br>
sha1-new should be valid objects in the repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using this hook, it is easy to
generate mails describing the updates to the repository.
This example script sends one mail message per ref listing
the commits pushed to the <br>
repository:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh <br>
# mail out commit update information. <br>
while read oval nval ref <br>
do <br>
if expr &quot;$oval&quot; : &rsquo;0*$&rsquo; &gt;/dev/null
<br>
then <br>
echo &quot;Created a new ref, with the following
commits:&quot; <br>
git rev-list --pretty &quot;$nval&quot; <br>
else <br>
echo &quot;New commits:&quot; <br>
git rev-list --pretty &quot;$nval&quot; &quot;^$oval&quot;
<br>
fi | <br>
mail -s &quot;Changes to ref $ref&quot; commit-list@mydomain
<br>
done <br>
exit 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exit code from this hook
invocation is ignored, however a non-zero exit code will
generate an error message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that it is possible for
refname to not have sha1-new when this hook runs. This can
easily occur if another user modifies the ref after it was
updated by git-receive-pack, <br>
but before the hook was able to evaluate it. It is
recommended that hooks rely on sha1-new rather than the
current value of refname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POST-UPDATE HOOK <br>
After all other processing, if at least one ref was updated,
and if $GIT_DIR/hooks/post-update file exists and is
executable, then post-update will be called with the list of
<br>
refs that have been updated. This can be used to implement
any repository wide cleanup tasks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exit code from this hook
invocation is ignored; the only thing left for
git-receive-pack to do at that point is to exit itself
anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This hook can be used, for
example, to run git update-server-info if the repository is
packed and is served via a dumb transport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh <br>
exec git update-server-info</p>
