<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
kpcli - A command line interface to KeePass database
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
A command line interface (interactive shell) to work with
KeePass database files
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeePass). This program was
inspired by my use of &quot;kedpm -c&quot; <br>
combined with my need to migrate to KeePass. The curious can
read about the Ked Password Manager at
http://kedpm.sourceforge.net/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
Please run the program and type &quot;help&quot; to learn
how to use it. Run the program with --help as a command line
option to learn about its command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREREQUISITES <br>
This program requires these non-core modules:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Crypt::Rijndael&quot; -
libcrypt-rijndael-perl on Ubuntu 10.04</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Term::ReadKey&quot; -
libterm-readkey-perl on Ubuntu 10.04</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Sort::Naturally&quot; -
libsort-naturally-perl on Ubuntu 10.04</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;File::KeePass&quot; -
libfile-keepass-perl on Ubuntu 12.04</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Term::ShellUI&quot; -
libterm-shellui-perl on Ubuntu 12.10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is recommended that you
install &quot;Term::ReadLine::Gnu&quot; which will provide
more fluid signal handling on Unix-like systems, making
kpcli robust to suspend, resume, and interrupt <br>
- SIGSTP, SIGCONT and SIGINT. That module is in the
libterm-readline-gnu-perl package on Ubuntu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can optionally install
&quot;Term::ReadLine::Perl5&quot;, which is often preferred
on platforms without GNU readline (MacOS, Windows, etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can optionally install
&quot;Clipboard&quot; and &quot;Tiny::Capture&quot; to use
the clipboard features;
http://search.cpan.org/~king/Clipboard/ and
libcapture-tiny-perl on Ubuntu 10.04.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can optionally install
&quot;Sub::Install&quot; to use the --timeout feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can optionally install
&quot;Data::Password&quot; to use the pwck feature (Password
Quality Check); libdata-password-perl on Ubuntu 10.04.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can optionally install
&quot;Data::Password::passwdqc&quot;, which is preferred by
the pwck feature if it is available. That module is not
commonly packaged and its list of <br>
dependencies is quite long, but cpanminus installs it nicely
on Linux Mint. It appeared that all of its upstream
dependencies were packaged in Linux Mint and so I apt-get
<br>
install&rsquo;ed them first, and then cpanminus only
installed &quot;Data::Password::passwdqc&quot;. Because it
is a binding to a C library,
&quot;Data::Password::passwdqc&quot; is much faster than
<br>
&quot;Data::Password&quot; and also seems to have a bit more
stict password rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can optionally install
&quot;Crypt::PWSafe3&quot; in order to import Password Safe
v3 files (https://pwsafe.org/). The dependency list of this
module is hefty and it is not packaged in <br>
many distros, but cpanminus installs it nicely on Linux Mint
(https://cpanmin.us/).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can optionally install
&quot;Math::Random::ISAAC&quot; in order to use a more
secure rand() function. Package libmath-random-isaac-perl on
Debian.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On MS Windows, you can
optionally install &quot;Win32::Console::ANSI&quot; to get
ANSI colors in Windows cmd terminals. Strawberry Perl 5.16.2
was used for the kpcli port to Windows and, <br>
using cpanminus, one can install all of kpcli&rsquo;s
dependencies, sans Term::ReadLine::Gnu which is optional for
kpcli and not supported on MS Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS AND WORDS OF CAUTION
<br>
The main author of kpcli primarily interoperability tests
with KeePassX (http://www.keepassx.org/) and primarily uses
KeePass v1 (*.kdb) files. Support for KeePass v2 (*.kdbx)
<br>
files in kpcli is substantial, and many people use it daily,
but it is not the author&rsquo;s primary use case. It is
also the author&rsquo;s intent to maintain compatibility
with v1 files, <br>
and so anyone sending patches, for consideration for
inclusion in future kpcli versions, is asked to validate
them with both v1 and v2 files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some versions of
Term::ReadLine::Perl5 are incompatible <br>
&quot;Term::ReadLine::Perl5&quot; versions 1.39-1.42 are
incompatible with the &quot;Term::ShellUI&quot; module,
which is core to kpcli. There is information about this in
kpcli SF bug #18 <br>
(http://sourceforge.net/p/kpcli/bugs/18/). The
&quot;Term::ReadLine::Perl5&quot; author submitted a
&quot;Term::ShellUI&quot; patch to resolve the issue <br>
(https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=105375) and he
also released &quot;Term::ReadLine::Perl5&quot; version 1.43
which resolves it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No history tracking for KeePass
2 (*.kdbx) files <br>
Recording entries&rsquo; history in KeePass 2 files is not
implemented. History that exists in a file is not destroyed,
but results of entry changes made in kpcli are not recorded
into <br>
their history. Prior-to-change copies are stored into the
&quot;Recycle Bin.&quot; Note that File::KeePass does not
encrypt passwords of history entries in RAM, like it does
for current <br>
entries. This is a small security risk that can, in theory,
allow privileged users to steal your passwords from RAM,
from entry history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File::KeePass bug prior to
version 2.03 <br>
Prior to version 2.03, File::KeePass had a bug related to
some &quot;unknown&quot; data that KeePassX stores in group
records. For File::KeePass &lt; v2.03, kpcli deletes those
unknown data <br>
when saving. Research in the libkpass
(http://libkpass.sourceforge.net/) source code revealed that
what early versions of File::KeePass classifies as
&quot;unknown&quot; are the times for <br>
created/modified/accessed/expires as well as
&quot;flags&quot; (id=9), but only for groups; File::KeePass
handled those fields just fine for entries. I found no
ill-effect from dropping <br>
those fields when saving and so that is what kpcli does to
work around the File::KeePass bug, if kpcli is using
File::KeePass &lt; v2.03.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Using Ctrl-D to Exit <br>
Versions of Term::ShellUI prior to v0.9. do not have the
ability to trap Ctrl-D exits by the client program. I
submitted a patch to remedy that and it made it into
Term::ShellUI <br>
v0.9. Please upgrade if kpcli asks you to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple Entries or Groups With
the Same Name in the Same Group <br>
This program does not support multiple entries in the same
group having the exact same name, nor does it support
multiple groups at the same level having the same name, and
it <br>
likely never will. KeepassX does support those. This program
detects and alert when an opened database file has those
issues, but it does not refuse to save (overwrite) a file
<br>
that is opened like that. Saves are actually safe (no data
loss) as long as the user has not touched one of the
duplicately-named items.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LICENSE <br>
This program may be distributed under the same terms as Perl
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CREDITS <br>
Special thanks to Paul Seamons, author of
&quot;File::KeePass&quot;, and to Scott Bronson, author of
&quot;Term::ShellUI&quot;. Without those two modules this
program would not have been practical <br>
for me to author.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHANGELOG <br>

2010-Dec-01 v0.7 - Further documented the group fields that
are <br>
dropped, in the CAVEATS section of the POD. <br>
Sort group and entry titles naturally. <br>
2010-Dec-23 v0.8 - Worked with File::KeePass author to fix a
couple <br>
of bugs and then required &gt;=v0.03 of that module. <br>
Sorted &quot;/_found&quot; to last in the root group list.
<br>
Fixed a &quot;database changed&quot; state bug in
cli_save(). <br>
Made the find command ignore entries in /Backup/. <br>
Find now offers show when only one entry is found. <br>
Provided a patch to Term::ShellUI author to add <br>
eof_exit_hook and added support for it to kpcli. <br>
2011-Feb-19 v0.9 - Fixed bugs related to spaces in group
names as <br>
reported in SourceForge bug number 3132258. <br>
The edit command now prompts to save on changes. <br>
Put scrub_unknown_values_from_all_groups() calls <br>
back into place after realizing that v0.03 of <br>
File::KeePass did not resolve all of the problems. <br>

by the find command to stop kpcli from croaking on <br>
multiple entries with the same name in that group. <br>
- Note: There is a more general bug here that <br>
needs addressing (see BUGS section). <br>
An empty title on new entry aborts the new entry. <br>
Changed kdb files are now detected/warned about. <br>
Tested against Term::ShellUI v0.9, which has my EOF <br>
hook patch, and updated kpcli comments about it. <br>
Term::ShellUI&rsquo;s complete_history() method was <br>
removed between v0.86 and v0.9 and so I removed <br>
kpli&rsquo;s call to it (Ctrl-r works for history). <br>
Added the &quot;icons&quot; command. <br>
2011-Sep-07 v1.1 - Empty DBs are now initialized to KeePassX

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TODO ITEMS <br>
Consider adding /shadow_copies/&lt;entries&gt; feature,
where kpcli <br>
will write &quot;shadow copies&quot; of the database, one
for each entry, <br>
using the path/password in the url/password fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consider broadening
shell_expansion support beyond just mv and ls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consider adding a tags command
for use with v2 files. <br>
- To navigate by entry tags</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consider supporting KeePass 2.x
style entry history. <br>
- There are potential security implications in
File::KeePass. <br>
- Related, consider adding a purge command for that
history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consider adding KeePass 2.x
style multi-user synchronization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consider adding searches for
created, modified, and accessed times <br>
older than a user supplied time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATING SYSTEMS AND SCRIPT
CATEGORIZATION <br>
