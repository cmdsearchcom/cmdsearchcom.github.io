kpcli - A command line interface to KeePass database files.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
A command line interface (interactive shell) to work with KeePass database files
  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeePass). This program was inspired by my use of
  &quot;kedpm -c&quot; combined with my need to migrate to KeePass. The curious
  can read about the Ked Password Manager at http://kedpm.sourceforge.net/.

Please run the program and type &quot;help&quot; to learn how to use it. Run the
  program with --help as a command line option to learn about its command line
  options.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PREREQUISITES"><a class="selflink" href="#PREREQUISITES">PREREQUISITES</a></h1>
This program requires these non-core modules:
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;Crypt::Rijndael&quot; - libcrypt-rijndael-perl on Ubuntu 10.04
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;Term::ReadKey&quot; - libterm-readkey-perl on Ubuntu 10.04
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;Sort::Naturally&quot; - libsort-naturally-perl on Ubuntu 10.04
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;File::KeePass&quot; - libfile-keepass-perl on Ubuntu 12.04
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;Term::ShellUI&quot; - libterm-shellui-perl on Ubuntu 12.10
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is recommended that you install &quot;Term::ReadLine::Gnu&quot; which will
  provide more fluid signal handling on Unix-like systems, making kpcli robust
  to suspend, resume, and interrupt - SIGSTP, SIGCONT and SIGINT. That module is
  in the libterm-readline-gnu-perl package on Ubuntu.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can optionally install &quot;Term::ReadLine::Perl5&quot;, which is often
  preferred on platforms without GNU readline (MacOS, Windows, etc.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can optionally install &quot;Clipboard&quot; and &quot;Tiny::Capture&quot;
  to use the clipboard features; http://search.cpan.org/~king/Clipboard/ and
  libcapture-tiny-perl on Ubuntu 10.04.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can optionally install &quot;Sub::Install&quot; to use the --timeout
  feature.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can optionally install &quot;Data::Password&quot; to use the pwck feature
  (Password Quality Check); libdata-password-perl on Ubuntu 10.04.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can optionally install &quot;Data::Password::passwdqc&quot;, which is
  preferred by the pwck feature if it is available. That module is not commonly
  packaged and its list of dependencies is quite long, but cpanminus installs it
  nicely on Linux Mint. It appeared that all of its upstream dependencies were
  packaged in Linux Mint and so I apt-get install'ed them first, and then
  cpanminus only installed &quot;Data::Password::passwdqc&quot;. Because it is a
  binding to a C library, &quot;Data::Password::passwdqc&quot; is much faster
  than &quot;Data::Password&quot; and also seems to have a bit more stict
  password rules.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can optionally install &quot;Crypt::PWSafe3&quot; in order to import
  Password Safe v3 files (https://pwsafe.org/). The dependency list of this
  module is hefty and it is not packaged in many distros, but cpanminus installs
  it nicely on Linux Mint (https://cpanmin.us/).
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can optionally install &quot;Math::Random::ISAAC&quot; in order to use a
  more secure <i>rand()</i> function. Package libmath-random-isaac-perl on
  Debian.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On MS Windows, you can optionally install &quot;Win32::Console::ANSI&quot; to
  get ANSI colors in Windows cmd terminals. Strawberry Perl 5.16.2 was used for
  the kpcli port to Windows and, using cpanminus, one can install all of kpcli's
  dependencies, sans Term::ReadLine::Gnu which is optional for kpcli and not
  supported on MS Windows.

  AND WORDS OF CAUTION</a></h1>
The main author of kpcli primarily interoperability tests with KeePassX
  (http://www.keepassx.org/) and primarily uses KeePass v1 (*.kdb) files.
  Support for KeePass v2 (*.kdbx) files in kpcli is substantial, and many people
  use it daily, but it is not the author's primary use case. It is also the
  author's intent to maintain compatibility with v1 files, and so anyone sending
  patches, for consideration for inclusion in future kpcli versions, is asked to
  validate them with both v1 and v2 files.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Some_versions_of_Term::ReadLine::Perl5_are_incompatible"><a class="selflink" href="#Some_versions_of_Term::ReadLine::Perl5_are_incompatible">Some
  versions of Term::ReadLine::Perl5 are incompatible</a></h2>
&quot;Term::ReadLine::Perl5&quot; versions 1.39-1.42 are incompatible with the
  &quot;Term::ShellUI&quot; module, which is core to kpcli. There is information
  about this in kpcli SF bug #18 (http://sourceforge.net/p/kpcli/bugs/18/). The
  &quot;Term::ReadLine::Perl5&quot; author submitted a &quot;Term::ShellUI&quot;
  patch to resolve the issue (https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=105375)
  and he also released &quot;Term::ReadLine::Perl5&quot; version 1.43 which
  resolves it.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="No_history_tracking_for_KeePass_2_(*.kdbx)_files"><a class="selflink" href="#No_history_tracking_for_KeePass_2_(*.kdbx)_files">No
  history tracking for KeePass 2 (*.kdbx) files</a></h2>
Recording entries' history in KeePass 2 files is not implemented. History that
  exists in a file is not destroyed, but results of entry changes made in kpcli
  are not recorded into their history. Prior-to-change copies are stored into
  the &quot;Recycle Bin.&quot; Note that File::KeePass does not encrypt
  passwords of history entries in RAM, like it does for current entries. This is
  a small security risk that can, in theory, allow privileged users to steal
  your passwords from RAM, from entry history.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="File::KeePass_bug_prior_to_version_2.03"><a class="selflink" href="#File::KeePass_bug_prior_to_version_2.03">File::KeePass
  bug prior to version 2.03</a></h2>
Prior to version 2.03, File::KeePass had a bug related to some
  &quot;unknown&quot; data that KeePassX stores in group records. For
  File::KeePass &lt; v2.03, kpcli deletes those unknown data when saving.
  Research in the libkpass (http://libkpass.sourceforge.net/) source code
  revealed that what early versions of File::KeePass classifies as
  &quot;unknown&quot; are the times for created/modified/accessed/expires as
  well as &quot;flags&quot; (id=9), but only for groups; File::KeePass handled
  those fields just fine for entries. I found no ill-effect from dropping those
  fields when saving and so that is what kpcli does to work around the
  File::KeePass bug, if kpcli is using File::KeePass &lt; v2.03.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Using_Ctrl-D_to_Exit"><a class="selflink" href="#Using_Ctrl-D_to_Exit">Using
  Ctrl-D to Exit</a></h2>
Versions of Term::ShellUI prior to v0.9. do not have the ability to trap Ctrl-D
  exits by the client program. I submitted a patch to remedy that and it made it
  into Term::ShellUI v0.9. Please upgrade if kpcli asks you to.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Multiple_Entries_or_Groups_With_the_Same_Name_in_the_Same_Group"><a class="selflink" href="#Multiple_Entries_or_Groups_With_the_Same_Name_in_the_Same_Group">Multiple
  Entries or Groups With the Same Name in the Same Group</a></h2>
This program does not support multiple entries in the same group having the
  exact same name, nor does it support multiple groups at the same level having
  the same name, and it likely never will. KeepassX does support those. This
  program detects and alert when an opened database file has those issues, but
  it does not refuse to save (overwrite) a file that is opened like that. Saves
  are actually safe (no data loss) as long as the user has not touched one of
  the duplicately-named items.

                     dropped, in the CAVEATS section of the POD.
                    Sort group and entry titles naturally.
 2010-Dec-23 v0.8 - Worked with File::KeePass author to fix a couple
                     of bugs and then required &gt;=v0.03 of that module.
                    Sorted &quot;/_found&quot; to last in the root group list.
                    Fixed a &quot;database changed&quot; state bug in cli_save().
                    Made the find command ignore entries in /Backup/.
                    Find now offers show when only one entry is found.
                    Provided a patch to Term::ShellUI author to add

                    Put scrub_unknown_values_from_all_groups() calls
                     back into place after realizing that v0.03 of
                    File::KeePass did not resolve all of the problems.
 2011-Apr-23 v1.0 - Changed a perl 5.10+ regex to a backward-compatable
                     one to resolve SourceForge bug number 3192413.
                    Modified the way that the /Backup group is ignored
                     by the find command to stop kpcli from croaking on
                     multiple entries with the same name in that group.
                     - Note: There is a more general bug here that
                             needs addressing (see BUGS section).
                    An empty title on new entry aborts the new entry.
                    Changed kdb files are now detected/warned about.
                    Tested against Term::ShellUI v0.9, which has my EOF
                     hook patch, and updated kpcli comments about it.
                    Term::ShellUI's complete_history() method was
                     removed between v0.86 and v0.9 and so I removed
                     kpli's call to it (Ctrl-r works for history).
                    Added the &quot;icons&quot; command.
 2011-Sep-07 v1.1 - Empty DBs are now initialized to KeePassX style.
                    Fixed a couple of bugs in the find command.
                    Fixed a password noecho bug in the saveas command.
                    Fixed a kdb_has_changed bug in the saveas command.
                    Fixed a cli_open bug where it wasn't cli_close'ing.
                    Fixed variable init bugs in put_master_passwd().
                    Fixed a false warning in warn_if_file_changed().
 2011-Sep-30 v1.2 - Added the &quot;export&quot; command.
                    Added the &quot;import&quot; command.
                    Command &quot;rmdir&quot; asks then deletes non-empty groups.
                    Command &quot;new&quot; can auto-generate random passwords.
 2012-Mar-03 v1.3 - Fixed bug in cl command as reported in SourceForge
                     bug number 3496544.
 2012-Apr-17 v1.4 - Added key file support based on a user contributed
                     patch with SourceForge ID# 3518388.

                     descriptive command summaries (for help command).
                    Stopped allowing empty passwords for export.
 2012-Oct-13 v1.5 - Fixed &quot;help &lt;foo&gt;&quot; commands, that I broke in v1.4.
                    Command &quot;edit&quot; can auto-generate random passwords.
                    Added the &quot;cls&quot; and &quot;clear&quot; commands from a patch
                     with SourceForge ID# 3573930.
                    Tested compatibility with File::KeePass v2.03 and
                     made minor changes that are possible with &gt;=2.01.
                    With File::KeePass v2.03, kpcli should now support
                     KeePass v2 files (*.kdbx).
 2012-Nov-25 v1.6 - Hide passwords (red on red) in the show command
                     unless the -f option is given.
                    Added the --readonly command line option.
                    Added support for multi-line notes/comments;
                     input ends on a line holding a single &quot;.&quot;.
 2013-Apr-25 v1.7 - Patched to use native File::KeePass support for key
                     files, if the File::KeePass version is new enough.
                    Added the &quot;version&quot; and &quot;ver&quot; commands.
                    Updated documentation as Ubuntu 12.10 now packages
                     all of kpcli's dependencies.
                    Added --histfile command line option.
                    Record modified times on edited records, from a
                     patch with SourceForge ID# 3611713.
                    Added the -a option to the show command.
 2013-Jun-09 v2.0 - Removed the unused Clone module after a report that
                     Clone is no longer in core Perl as of v5.18.0.
                    Added the stats and pwck commands.
                    Added clipboard commands (xw/xu/xp/xx).
                    Fixed some long-standing tab completion bugs.
                    Warn if multiple groups or entries are titled the
                     same within a group, except for /Backup entries.
 2013-Jun-10 v2.1 - Fixed several more tab completion bugs, and they
                     were serious enough to warrant a quick release.
 2013-Jun-16 v2.2 - Trap and handle SIGINT (^C presses).
                    Trap and handle SIGTSTP (^Z presses).
                    Trap and handle SIGCONT (continues after ^Z).
                    Stopped printing found dictionary words in pwck.
 2013-Jul-01 v2.3 - More readline() and signal handling improvements.
                    Title conflict checks in cli_new()/edit()/mv().
                    Group title conflict checks in rename().
                    cli_new() now accepts optional path&amp;|title param.
                    cli_ls() can now list multiple paths.
                    cli_edit() now shows the &quot;old&quot; values for users
                     to edit, if Term::ReadLine::Gnu is available.
                    cli_edit() now aborts all changes on ^C.
                    cli_saveas() now asks before overwriting a file.
 2013-Nov-26 v2.4 - Fixed several &quot;perl -cw&quot; warnings reported on
                     2013-07-09 as SourceForge bug #9.
                    Bug fix for the cl command, but in sub cli_ls().
                    First pass at Strawberry perl/MS Windows support.
                     - Enhanced support for Term::ReadLine::Perl
                     - Added support for Term::ReadLine::Perl5

                    Added generatePasswordFromDict() and &quot;w&quot; generation.
                    Added the -v option to the version command.
                     - Added the versions command.

                    Removed unneeded use of Term::ReadLine.
                    Quieted &quot;inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method&quot; warns
                     caused by Term::Readline::Gnu on perl 5.14.x.
 2014-Jun-06 v2.6 - Added interactive password generation (&quot;i&quot; method).
                     - Thanks to Florian Tham for the idea and patch.
                    Show entry's tags if present (KeePass &gt;= v2.11).

                    Added key file generation to saveas and export.
                     2014-04-19 SourceForge bug #13.
                    Added -expired option to the find command.
                    Added &quot;dir&quot; as an alias for &quot;ls&quot;
