<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Retrv retrieves a specified, previously saved version of a
file from the version object base. The version archive is
expected to reside in the AtFS subdirectory. A selected
ver&acirc; <br>
sion will by default be retrieved into a file in the
directory where it was originally saved. If just a copy of a
file version shall be retrieved, this behavior can be
overrid&acirc; <br>
den with the -dest option. If a busy version is created with
the -lock option, it must be created in the directory from
where it was saved. This is necessary to maintain the
spa&acirc; <br>
tial relationship between the busy version and the
corresponding history archive, residing in the AtFS
subdirectory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Retrieve tries to be careful if
an attempt is made to overwrite an existing busy-version:
unless -f (-force) is specified, retrv will ask the caller
for permission. If no busy <br>
version exists, one is created with the same modes as the
formerly saved version. If a busy version exists, its modes
are preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the program is invoked as
vcat, the specified version(s) will be printed on standard
output. No status change of the object base will occur in
this case. vcat behaves similar <br>
to the cat(1) command: if just a filename is given, vcat
displays the most recent status of the referenced object. If
a busy version does exist it will be selected as most recent
<br>
status. If no busy version exists, vcat displays the most
recently saved version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ATTRIBUTE CITATIONS <br>
It is possible to cite any of a file-version&rsquo;s
attributes within the the body of the version. This can be
done by using attribute citation expressions. These
expressions have the <br>
form &quot;$__attributename$&quot;. Version attributes that
are cited within the text of a stored revision are expanded
by default. In this case, the citation expression will be
substi&acirc; <br>
tuted by the cited attribute&rsquo;s value. For a list of
predefined attribute names, check the vadm(1) manual
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are three basic kinds of
attribute values: genuine values, reference values, and
execution values. Genuine values are simply strings that are
assigned to an attribute. <br>
Reference values are pointers to files or AtFS-versions
whose contents will be substituted in place of an
attribute-citation. Reference values are strings that begin
with a cir&acirc; <br>
cumflex-character, typically followed by pathname, e.g.
^/usr/local/lib/std-header[2.4]. Execution values are names
of executable programs, whose standard output is substituted
<br>
in place of an attribute-citation. Execution values are
strings that begin with an exclamation-mark character,
typically followed by the name of the program, e.g.
!/bin/date. <br>
Execution values can be used to generate highly dynamic
attributes or a primitive form of event-triggers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When expanding an attribute
citation, retrv first looks for an attribute of the
mentioned name within the version&rsquo;s set of associated
attributes. If no attribute of that name can <br>
be found, the environment is searched for a variable of that
name. In case the cited attribute exists and has a value,
the value is itself searched for attribute-citations that
<br>
are expanded recursively. If neither an attribute nor an
environment variable of the cited name can be found, no
substitution takes place and the expression will be left
<br>
unchanged. The same is true if a referenced object of a
reference value does not exist, or an execution value
happens to not be executable. Attribute citation expressions
are <br>
also left unchanged if a revision is retrieved with the
-lock option. Expansion of attribute citation within
documents can be controlled by the pseudo-attribute
citations <br>
&quot;$__xpoff$&quot; and &quot;$__xpon$&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
For version selection, any version binding option, as
described on the vbind(1) manual page, may be given, or a
version bind directive may be given in brackets added to the
file <br>
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, -help <br>
print brief instructions about using this program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, -copy <br>
Do not check for equality. Usually, retrv checks whether an
existing destination file is identical to the version to be
retrieved and suppresses copying in this case. This <br>
behaviour is mainly for efficiency reasons and may be
disabled by the -c switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dest path <br>
retrieve the specified version from the object base and
install a copy it in the directory denoted by path. As this
directory may be a long way apart from the directory <br>
containing the AtFS archives, this copy of the retrieved
version is separated from its history and subsequently
unrelated to the object history it came from. Proper object
<br>
histories require a constant spatial relationship of any
busy versions and the corresponding archives. This
relationship requires the archives to reside in a
subdirectory <br>
named AtFS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fix attempt to reserve the
privilege to add a new version to an old generation (insert
a new minor revision into an old major revision) within the
object history. If success&acirc; <br>
ful, the user who issued the command holds a generation
lock. There can be only one lock per generation, preventing
simultaneous updates of the generation. The generation <br>
lock is, by convention, a revision lock (see vadm -lock)
attached to the version with the highest version number
within a generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -fix switch is intended to
support concurrency of the main development process and
maintenance activities (such as bug fixing) for older
releases. When a version is <br>
retrieved with the purpose to fix it, it is called the
fixpoint version. The fixpoint version accumulates all fixes
applied to a baseline version within a generation. One <br>
important advantage of this policy is the elimination of the
need to create a branch for each fix that must later be
merged with the &lsquo;&lsquo;mainline&rsquo;&rsquo;
version, containing pre&acirc; <br>
vious fixes. So, if retrv is invoked with
&lsquo;&lsquo;-fix&rsquo;&rsquo; it will restore the
fixpoint version (the most recent minor revision within the
implied generation) rather than the <br>
explicitly referenced version. However, retrv issues a
warning, if the baseline- and the fixpoint version are not
identical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To insert a fix into an old
generation, use the -fix option of the save command. When
setting a lock on a generation, the requesting user is
prompted for an optional <br>
description of the planned changes. The -fix switch is
incompatible with -lock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, -force <br>
force the reinstallation of the specified version as busy
version without asking the user, even if a writable
(possibly unsaved) busy version exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i message <br>
set message as intent text describing the changes that are
intended to be applied to a busy version that is installed
by retrv. When message starts with an at sign (@), it <br>
is interpreted as filename and the text contained in the
file is takes as intent text. If message is
&lsquo;&lsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo;, the change intent is read
from standard input. The latter case <br>
is identical to specifying the command line switch -stdin.
This option requires the -lock switch to be set in order to
be effective.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, -lock <br>
attempt to reserve the privilege to add a new version to the
main development line of an object history, thus preventing
multiple programmers working upon the same object <br>
base from interfering with each other by saving concurrent
updates. When setting a new lock on an object history,
prompt the requesting user for an optional description <br>
of the planned changes. The -lock switch is incompatible
with -fix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, -quiet <br>
quiet operation. No messages are printed on standard output.
If a current busy version exists, it will not be overwritten
by the specified version unless -f is set. This <br>
option is useful for batch operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stdin force retrv to read the
message describing the change intent from stdin rather than
fork an editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
print version identification for this program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xpoff Do not expand attribute
citations in the restored file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
All revisions of documents are retrieved from archive files
located in the subdirectory AtFS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Redirection of stdin in conjunction with option -stdin
doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
