<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimum unique abbreviation of
option is acceptable. You may use double hyphens instead of
single hyphen to denote options. You may use white space in
place of the equals sign <br>
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamscale scales a Netpbm image
by a specified factor, or scales individually horizontally
and vertically by specified factors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can either enlarge (scale
factor &gt; 1) or reduce (scale factor &lt; 1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamscale work on multi-image
streams, scaling each one independently. But before Netpbm
10.49 (December 2009), it scales only the first image and
ignores the rest of the stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Scale Factors <br>
The options -width, -height, -xsize, -ysize, -xscale,
-yscale, -xyfit, -xyfill, -reduce, and -pixels control the
amount of scaling. For backward compatibility, there is also
<br>
-xysize and the scale_factor argument, but you
shouldn&rsquo;t use those.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-width and -height specify the
width and height in pixels you want the resulting image to
be. See below for rules when you specify one and not the
other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xsize and -ysize are synonyms
for -width and -height, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xscale and -yscale tell the
factor by which you want the width and height of the image
to change from source to result (e.g. -xscale 2 means you
want to double the width; <br>
-xscale .5 means you want to halve it). See below for rules
when you specify one and not the other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you specify an absolute
size or scale factor for both dimensions, pamscale scales
each dimension independently without consideration of the
aspect ratio.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify one dimension as
a pixel size and don&rsquo;t specify the other dimension,
pamscale scales the unspecified dimension to preserve the
aspect ratio.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify one dimension as
a scale factor and don&rsquo;t specify the other dimension,
pamscale leaves the unspecified dimension unchanged from the
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify the scale_factor
parameter instead of dimension options, that is the scale
factor for both dimensions. It is equivalent to
-xscale=scale_factor -yscale=scale_fac&acirc; <br>
tor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying the -reduce
reduction_factor option is equivalent to specifying the
scale_factor parameter, where scale_factor is the reciprocal
of reduction_factor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xyfit specifies a bounding box.
pamscale scales the input image to the largest size that
fits within the box, while preserving its aspect ratio.
-xysize is a synonym for this. <br>
Before Netpbm 10.20 (January 2004), -xyfit did not exist,
but -xysize did.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xyfill is similar, but pamscale
scales the input image to the smallest size that completely
fills the box, while preserving its aspect ratio. This
option has existed since <br>
Netpbm 10.20 (January 2004).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pixels specifies a maximum
total number of output pixels. pamscale scales the image
down to that number of pixels. If the input image is already
no more than that many pixels, <br>
pamscale just copies it as output; pamscale does not scale
up with -pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you enlarge by a factor of 3
or more, you should probably add a pnmsmooth step;
otherwise, you can see the original pixels in the resulting
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usage Notes <br>
A useful application of pamscale is to blur an image. Scale
it down (without -nomix) to discard some information, then
scale it back up using pamstretch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or scale it back up with
pamscale and create a &rsquo;pixelized&rsquo; image, which
is sort of a computer-age version of blurring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transparency <br>
pamscale understands transparency and properly mixes pixels
considering the pixels&rsquo; transparency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Proper mixing does not mean just
mixing the transparency value and the color component values
separately. In a PAM image, a pixel which is not opaque
represents a color that <br>
contains light of the foreground color indicated explicitly
in the PAM and light of a background color to be named
later. But the numerical scale of a color component sample
in <br>
a PAM is as if the pixel is opaque. So a pixel that is
supposed to contain half-strength red light for the
foreground plus some light from the background has a red
color sample <br>
that says full red and a transparency sample that says 50%
opaque. In order to mix pixels, you have to first convert
the color sample values to numbers that represent amount of
<br>
light directly (i.e. multiply by the opaqueness) and after
mixing, convert back (divide by the opaqueness).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input And Output Image Types
<br>
pamscale produces output of the same type (and tuple type if
the type is PAM) as the input, except if the input is PBM.
In that case, the output is PGM with maxval 255. The <br>
purpose of this is to allow meaningful pixel mixing. Note
that there is no equivalent exception when the input is PAM.
If the PAM input tuple type is BLACKANDWHITE, the PAM <br>
output tuple type is also BLACKANDWHITE, and you get no
meaningful pixel mixing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want PBM output with PBM
input, use pamditherbw to convert pamscale&rsquo;s output to
PBM. Also consider pbmreduce.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamscale&rsquo;s function is
essentially undefined for PAM input images that are not of
tuple type RGB, GRAYSCALE, BLACKANDWHITE, or the _ALPHA
variations of those. (By standard <br>
Netpbm backward compatibility, this includes PBM, PGM, and
PPM images).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You might think it would have an
obvious effect on other tuple types, but remember that the
aforementioned tuple types have gamma-adjusted sample
values, and pamscale uses that <br>
fact in its calculations. And it treats a transparency plane
different from any other plane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamscale does not simply reject
unrecognized tuple types because there&rsquo;s a possibility
that just by coincidence you can get useful function out of
it with some other tuple type <br>
and the right combination of options (consider -linear in
particular).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Methods Of Scaling <br>
There are numerous ways to scale an image. pamscale
implements a bunch of them; you select among them with
invocation options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pixel Mixing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pamscale&rsquo;s default method
is pixel mixing. To understand this, imagine the source
image as composed of square tiles. Each tile is a pixel and
has uniform color. The tiles are <br>
all the same size. Now take a transparent sheet the size of
the target image, marked with a square grid of tiles the
same size. Stretch or compress the source image to the size
<br>
of the sheet and lay the sheet over the source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each cell in the overlay grid
stands for a pixel of the target image. For example, if you
are scaling a 100x200 image up by 1.5, the source image is
100 x 200 tiles, and the <br>
transparent sheet is marked off in 150 x 300 cells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each cell covers parts of
multiple tiles. To make the target image, just color in each
cell with the color which is the average of the colors the
cell covers -- weighted by the <br>
amount of that color it covers. A cell in our example might
cover 4/9 of a blue tile, 2/9 of a red tile, 2/9 of a green
tile, and 1/9 of a white tile. So the target pixel would
<br>
be somewhat unsaturated blue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you are scaling up or down
by an integer, the results are simple. When scaling up,
pixels get duplicated. When scaling down, pixels get thrown
away. In either case, the <br>
colors in the target image are a subset of those in the
source image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the scale factor is weirder
than that, the target image can have colors that
didn&rsquo;t exist in the original. For example, a red pixel
next to a white pixel in the source <br>
might become a red pixel, a pink pixel, and a white pixel in
the target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This method tends to replicate
what the human eye does as it moves closer to or further
away from an image. It also tends to replicate what the
human eye sees, when far enough <br>
away to make the pixelization disappear, if an image is not
made of pixels and simply stretches or shrinks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Discrete Sampling</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Discrete sampling is basically
the same thing as pixel mixing except that, in the model
described above, instead of averaging the colors of the
tiles the cell covers, you pick <br>
the one color that covers the most area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The result you see is that when
you enlarge an image, pixels get duplicated and when you
reduce an image, some pixels get discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The advantage of this is that
you end up with an image made from the same color palette as
the original. Sometimes that&rsquo;s important.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The disadvantage is that it
distorts the picture. If you scale up by 1.5 horizontally,
for example, the even numbered input pixels are doubled in
the output and the odd numbered <br>
ones are copied singly. If you have a bunch of one pixel
wide lines in the source, you may find that some of them
stretch to 2 pixels, others remain 1 pixel when you enlarge.
<br>
When you reduce, you may find that some of the lines
disappear completely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You select discrete sampling
with pamscale&rsquo;s -nomix option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Actually, -nomix doesn&rsquo;t
do exactly what I described above. It does the scaling in
two passes - first horizontal, then vertical. This can
produce slightly different results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is one common case in
which one often finds it burdensome to have pamscale make up
colors that weren&rsquo;t there originally: Where one is
working with an image format such as <br>
GIF that has a limited number of possible colors per image.
If you take a GIF with 256 colors, convert it to PPM, scale
by .625, and convert back to GIF, you will probably find
<br>
that the reduced image has way more than 256 colors, and
therefore cannot be converted to GIF. One way to solve this
problem is to do the reduction with discrete sampling <br>
instead of pixel mixing. Probably a better way is to do the
pixel mixing, but then color quantize the result with
pnmquant before converting to GIF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the scale factor is an
integer (which means you&rsquo;re scaling up), discrete
sampling and pixel mixing are identical -- output pixels are
always just N copies of the input pix&acirc; <br>
els. In this case, though, consider using pamstretch instead
of pamscale to get the added pixels interpolated instead of
just copied and thereby get a smoother enlargement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamscale&rsquo;s discrete
sampling is faster than pixel mixing, but pamenlarge is
faster still. pamenlarge works only on integer
enlargements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">discrete sampling (-nomix) was
new in Netpbm 9.24 (January 2002).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resampling</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resampling assumes that the
source image is a discrete sampling of some original
continuous image. That is, it assumes there is some
non-pixelized original image and each pixel <br>
of the source image is simply the color of that image at a
particular point. Those points, naturally, are the
intersections of a square grid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The idea of resampling is just
to compute that original image, then sample it at a
different frequency (a grid of a different scale).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The problem, of course, is that
sampling necessarily throws away the information you need to
rebuild the original image. So we have to make a bunch of
assumptions about the <br>
makeup of the original image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You tell pamscale to use the
resampling method by specifying the -filter option. The
value of this option is the name of a function, from the set
listed below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To explain resampling, we are
going to talk about a simple one dimensional scaling --
scaling a single row of grayscale pixels horizontally. If
you can understand that, you can <br>
easily understand how to do a whole image: Scale each of the
rows of the image, then scale each of the resulting columns.
And scale each of the color component planes sepa&acirc;
<br>
rately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a first step in resampling,
pamscale converts the source image, which is a set of
discrete pixel values, into a continuous step function. A
step function is a function whose <br>
graph is a staircase-y thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, we convolve the step
function with a proper scaling of the filter function that
you identified with -filter. If you don&rsquo;t know what
the mathematical concept of convolution <br>
(convolving) is, you are officially lost. You cannot
understand this explanation. The result of this convolution
is the imaginary original continuous image we&rsquo;ve been
talking <br>
about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, we make target pixels
by picking values from that function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To understand what is going on,
we use Fourier analysis:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The idea is that the only
difference between our step function and the original
continuous function (remember that we constructed the step
function from the source image, which <br>
is itself a sampling of the original continuous function) is
that the step function has a bunch of high frequency Fourier
components added. If we could chop out all the higher <br>
frequency components of the step function, and know that
they&rsquo;re all higher than any frequency in the original
function, we&rsquo;d have the original function back.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The resampling method assumes
that the original function was sampled at a high enough
frequency to form a perfect sampling. A perfect sampling is
one from which you can recover <br>
exactly the original continuous function. The Nyquist
theorem says that as long as your sample rate is at least
twice the highest frequency in your original function, the
sam&acirc; <br>
pling is perfect. So we assume that the image is a sampling
of something whose highest frequency is half the sample rate
(pixel resolution) or less. Given that, our filtering <br>
does in fact recover the original continuous image from the
samples (pixels).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To chop out all the components
above a certain frequency, we just multiply the Fourier
transform of the step function by a rectangle function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We could find the Fourier
transform of the step function, multiply it by a rectangle
function, and then Fourier transform the result back, but
there&rsquo;s an easier way. Mathemati&acirc; <br>
cians tell us that multiplying in the frequency domain is
equivalent to convolving in the time domain. That means
multiplying the Fourier transform of F by a rectangle
function <br>
R is the same as convolving F with the Fourier transform of
R. It&rsquo;s a lot better to take the Fourier transform of
R, and build it into pamscale than to have pamscale take the
<br>
Fourier transform of the input image dynamically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That leaves only one question:
What is the Fourier transform of a rectangle function?
Answer: sinc. Recall from math that sinc is defined as
sinc(x) = sin(PI*x)/PI*x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hence, when you specify
-filter=sinc, you are effectively passing the step function
of the source image through a low pass frequency filter and
recovering a good approximation of <br>
the original continuous image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Refiltering</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There&rsquo;s another twist: If
you simply sample the reconstructed original continuous
image at the new sample rate, and that new sample rate
isn&rsquo;t at least twice the highest fre&acirc; <br>
quency in the original continuous image, you won&rsquo;t get
a perfect sampling. In fact, you&rsquo;ll get something with
ugly aliasing in it. Note that this can&rsquo;t be a problem
when you&rsquo;re <br>
scaling up (increasing the sample rate), because the fact
that the old sample rate was above the Nyquist level means
so is the new one. But when scaling down, it&rsquo;s a
problem. <br>
Obviously, you have to give up image quality when scaling
down, but aliasing is not the best way to do it. It&rsquo;s
better just to remove high frequency components from the
original <br>
continuous image before sampling, and then get a perfect
sampling of that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Therefore, pamscale filters out
frequencies above half the new sample rate before picking
the new samples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Approximations</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately, pamscale
doesn&rsquo;t do the convolution precisely. Instead of
evaluating the filter function at every point, it samples it
-- assumes that it doesn&rsquo;t change any more <br>
often than the step function does. pamscale could actually
do the true integration fairly easily. Since the filter
functions are built into the program, the integrals of them
<br>
could be too. Maybe someday it will.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is one more complication
with the Fourier analysis. sinc has nonzero values on out to
infinity and minus infinity. That makes it hard to compute a
convolution with it. <br>
So instead, there are filter functions that approximate sinc
but are nonzero only within a manageable range. To get
those, you multiply the sinc function by a window function,
<br>
which you select with the -window option. The same holds for
other filter functions that go on forever like sinc. By
default, for a filter that needs a window function, the <br>
window function is the Blackman function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filter Functions Besides
Sinc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The math described above works
only with sinc as the filter function. pamscale offers many
other filter functions, though. Some of these approximate
sinc and are faster to com&acirc; <br>
pute. For most of them, I have no idea of the mathematical
explanation for them, but people do find they give pleasing
results. They may not be based on resampling at all, but
<br>
just exploit the convolution that is coincidentally part of
a resampling calculation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For some filter functions, you
can tell just by looking at the convolution how they vary
the resampling process from the perfect one based on
sinc:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The impulse filter assumes that
the original continuous image is in fact a step function --
the very one we computed as the first step in the
resampling. This is mathematically <br>
equivalent to the discrete sampling method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The box (rectangle) filter
assumes the original image is a piecewise linear function.
Its graph just looks like straight lines connecting the
pixel values. This is mathemati&acirc; <br>
cally equivalent to the pixel mixing method (but mixing
brightness, not light intensity, so like pamscale -linear)
when scaling down, and interpolation (ala pamstretch) when
<br>
scaling up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gamma</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamscale assumes the underlying
continuous function is a function of brightness (as opposed
to light intensity), and therefore does all this math using
the gamma-adjusted numbers <br>
found in a PNM or PAM image. The -linear option is not
available with resampling (it causes pamscale to fail),
because it wouldn&rsquo;t be useful enough to justify the
implementation <br>
effort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resampling (-filter) was new in
Netpbm 10.20 (January 2004).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filter functions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a list of the function
names you can specify for the -filter option. For most of
them, you&rsquo;re on your own to figure out just what the
function is and what kind of scal&acirc; <br>
ing it does. These are common functions from
mathematics.</p>

Not documented</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Linear vs Gamma-adjusted <br>
The pixel mixing scaling method described above involves
intensities of pixels (more precisely, it involves
individual intensities of primary color components of
pixels). But <br>
the PNM and PNM-equivalent PAM image formats represent
intensities with gamma-adjusted numbers that are not
linearly proportional to intensity. So pamscale, by default,
performs <br>
a calculation on each sample read from its input and each
sample written to its output to convert between these
gamma-adjusted numbers and internal intensity-proportional
num&acirc; <br>
bers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes you are not working
with true PNM or PAM images, but rather a variation in which
the sample values are in fact directly proportional to
intensity. If so, use the -lin&acirc; <br>
ear option to tell pamscale this. pamscale then will skip
the conversions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The conversion takes time. In
one experiment, it increased by a factor of 10 the time
required to reduce an image. And the difference between
intensity-proportional values and <br>
gamma-adjusted values may be small enough that you would
barely see a difference in the result if you just pretended
that the gamma-adjusted values were in fact
intensity-propor&acirc; <br>
tional. So just to save time, at the expense of some image
quality, you can specify -linear even when you have true PPM
input and expect true PPM output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the first 13 years of
Netpbm&rsquo;s life, until Netpbm 10.20 (January 2004),
pamscale&rsquo;s predecessor pnmscale always treated the PPM
samples as intensity-proportional even though <br>
they were not, and drew few complaints. So using -linear as
a lie is a reasonable thing to do if speed is important to
you. But if speed is important, you also should consider
<br>
the -nomix option and pnmscalefixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another technique to consider is
to convert your PNM image to the linear variation with
pnmgamma, run pamscale on it and other transformations that
like linear PNM, and then con&acirc; <br>
vert it back to true PNM with pnmgamma -ungamma. pnmgamma is
often faster than pamscale in doing the conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -nomix, -linear has no
effect. That&rsquo;s because pamscale does not concern
itself with the meaning of the sample values in this method;
pamscale just copies numbers from its <br>
input to its output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Precision <br>
pamscale uses floating point arithmetic internally. There is
a speed cost associated with this. For some images, you can
get the acceptable results (in fact, sometimes identi&acirc;
<br>
cal results) faster with pnmscalefixed, which uses fixed
point arithmetic. pnmscalefixed may, however, distort your
image a little. See the pnmscalefixed user manual for a
com&acirc; <br>
plete discussion of the difference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
pamscale was new in Netpbm 10.20 (January 2004). It was
adapted from, and obsoleted, pnmscale. pamscale&rsquo;s
primary difference from pnmscale is that it handles the PAM
format and <br>
uses the &quot;pam&quot; facilities of the Netpbm
programming library. But it also added the resampling class
of scaling method. Furthermore, it properly does its pixel
mixing arithmetic <br>
(by default) using intensity-proportional values instead of
the gamma-adjusted values the pnmscale uses. To get the old
pnmscale arithmetic, you can specify the -linear option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The intensity proportional stuff
came out of suggestions by Adam M Costello in January
2004.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The resampling algorithms are
mostly taken from code contributed by Michael Reinelt in
December 2003.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The version of pnmscale from
which pamscale was derived, itself evolved out of the
original Pbmplus version of pnmscale by Jef Poskanzer (1989,
1991). But none of that original <br>
code remains.</p>
