<p>LATEX2RTF(1) User Commands LATEX2RTF(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
latex2rtf - Convert a LaTeX file to an RTF file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
latex2rtf [-hlpFSVW] [ -d# ] [ -D# ] [ -M# ] [ -se#] [ -sf#]
[ -t# ] [ -Z# ] [ -a auxfile ] [ -b bblfile ] [ -C codepage
] [ -i language ] [ -o outputfile ] [ -P /path/to/cfg ] <br>
[ -T /path/to/tmp ] [ inputfile ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The latex2rtf command converts a LaTeX file into RTF text
format. The text and much of the formatting information is
translated to RTF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a auxfile <br>
Used to specify a particular cross-referencing file. When
this option is omitted, the auxfile is assumed to be the
same as inputfile with the .tex suffix replaced by <br>
.aux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b bblfile <br>
Used to specify a particular bibliography file When this
option is omitted, the bblfile is assumed to be the same as
inputfile with the .tex suffix replaced by .bbl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C codepage <br>
used to specify the character set (code page) used in the
LaTeX document for non-ansi characters. codepage may be one
of the following: ansinew, applemac, cp437, cp437de, <br>
cp850, cp852, cp855, cp865, cp866, decmulti, cp1250, cp1252,
koi8-r, koi8-u, latin1, latin2, latin3, latin4, latin5,
latin9, maccyr, macukr, next, raw, raw437, raw852, <br>
raw1250, raw1251, and raw1253. The default behavior is to
use ansinew (same as cp1252). For convenience, just the
numbers 437, 437de, 850, 852, 855, 866, 1250 or 1252 <br>
may be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The raw character set encoding
prevents any 8-bit character translation. The RTF file is
marked to use the same encoding as the default encoding for
the program inter&acirc; <br>
preting the RTF file. This is particularly useful when
translating a file written in a language (e.g., czech) that
maps poorly into the ansinew (western european)
charac&acirc; <br>
ter set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d# Write extra debugging output
to stderr. Higher numbers cause more debugging output and
range from 0 (only errors) to 6 (absurdly many messages).
The default is 1 (Warn&acirc; <br>
ings and Errors only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D dots_per_inch <br>
Used to specify the number of dots per inch in equations
that are converted to bitmaps and for graphics that must be
converted. Default is 300 dpi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E# where # selects the type of
figure handling desired. RTF does not support insertion of
PS, PDF, or EPS file types. These figures must be converted
to a bitmap format and <br>
then inserted. One trick is to insert the filenames into the
RTF file and then in post-processing, insert the file. These
options can be added together. <br>
-E3 insert all figures (DEFAULT) <br>
-E0 no figures in the RTF <br>
-E1 insert figures having RTF-supported formats <br>
-E2 convert and insert unsupported figure formats <br>
-E4 insert only filenames for supported file formats <br>
-E8 insert only filenames for unsupported file formats</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f use fields <br>
-f0 do not use fields in RTF. This is handy when primitive
RTF editors are being used to view the RTF output.ef and
<br>
-f1 use fields for equations but notef and -f3 use fields
when -f2 use fields for possible. This is the default and is
most useful when the RTF file is being exported to be used
in Word. This retains the most information from the <br>
original LaTeX file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F use LaTeX to create bitmaps
for all figures. This may help when figures are not
translated properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print a short usage note</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i language <br>
used to set the idiom or language used in the LaTeX document
language may be one of the following afrikaans, bahasa,
basque, brazil, breton, catalan, croatian, czech, dan&acirc;
<br>
ish, dutch, english, esperanto, estonian, finnish, french,
galician, german, icelandic, irish,italian, latin, lsorbian,
magyar, norsk, nynorsk, polish, portuges, romanian, <br>
russian, samin, scottish, serbian, slovak, slovene, spanish,
swedish, turkish, usorbian, welsh. The default is
english.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Assume LaTeX source uses ISO
8859-1 (Latin-1) special characters (default behavior).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o outputfile <br>
Redirect output to outputfile Unless an outputfile is
specified with the -o option, the resulting RTF is produced
in a file with .tex replaced by .rtf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M# where # selects the type of
equation conversion. <br>
-M1 displayed equations to RTF <br>
-M2 inline equations to RTF <br>
-M4 displayed equations to bitmap <br>
-M8 inline equations to bitmap <br>
-M16 insert Word comment field containing the raw LaTeX
equation <br>
-M32 insert raw LaTeX equation delimited by $...$ and <br>
-M64 displayed equations to EPS files with filenames in RTF
<br>
-M128 inline equations to EPS files with filenames in
RTF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options may be added
together to get different results <br>
-M0 no equations fields in the RTF. <br>
-M3 converts both inline and displayed equations to RTF
(DEFAULT). <br>
-M12 converts inline and displayed equations to bitmaps.
<br>
-M192 converts inline and displayed equations to eps files
and inserts a tag in RTF. <br>
Bitmap conversion requires a working latex2png script.
Producing bitmaps is slow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Escape printed parentheses in
mathematical formulas, as some versions of Word (e.g Word
2000) have deep psychological problems with EQ fields using
quoted parentheses. If <br>
Word displays some formulas with parentheses as
&rsquo;Error!&rsquo;, try this option. See also the -S
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P /path/to/cfg <br>
used to specify the directory that contains the @code{.cfg}
files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-se# selects the scale for
equation conversion, where # is the scale factor (default
1.00).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sf# selects the scale for
figure conversion, where # is the scale factor (default
1.00).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Use semicolons to separate
arguments in RTF fields. This is needed when the machine
opening the RTF file has a version of Word that uses commas
for decimal points. This <br>
also can fix displaying some formulas as
&rsquo;Error!&rsquo; You may also need to try the -p
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t# selects the type of table
conversion. <br>
-t1 convert tables to RTF (default) <br>
-t2 convert tables to bitmaps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T /path/to/tmp <br>
used to specify the folder where to put temporary files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Prints version on standard
output and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W Emit warnings directly in RTF
file. Handy for catching things that do not get translated
correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z# Add # close braces to end of
RTF file. (Handy when file is not converted correctly and
will not open in another word processor.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILES <br>
The configuration files are searched first in any directory
specified by -P, then in the location specified by the
environment variable RTFPATH, and finally in the location
<br>
CFGDIR specified when latex2rtf was compiled. If the
configuration files are not found then latex2rtf aborts. The
configuration files allow additional fonts to be recognized,
<br>
additional simple commands to be translation, and additional
commands to be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAUTION <br>
The input file must be a valid LaTeX file. Use LaTeX to find
and fix errors before converting with latex2rtf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration files
direct.cfg and fonts.cfg are in the correct directory. You
may have to change fonts.cfg or direct.cfg to suit your
needs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Some might consider RTF to be a bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some environments are currently
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Translation without a LaTeX
generated .aux file is poor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORTING BUGS <br>
Report bugs to to the bug tracking system at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/. Only report bugs
for the latest version of latex2rtf that is available.
Please identify <br>
your operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the program produces wrong
output or does not work for you, INCLUDE A SHORT LATEX FILE
that demonstrates the problem. The shorter the LaTeX file,
the quicker your bug will <br>
get addressed. Bug reports with non-existent LaTeX files are
not welcomed by the developers. Do not bother to send RTF
files, since these are usually unhelpful.</p>
