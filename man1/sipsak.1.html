<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sipsak - a utility for various tests on sip servers and user
agents</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sipsak [-dFGhiILnNMRSTUVvwz] [-a PASSWORD ] [-b NUMBER ] [-c
SIPURI ] [-C SIPURI ] [-D NUMBER ] [-e NUMBER ] [-E STRING ]
[-f FILE ] [-g STRING ] [-H HOSTNAME ] [-l PORT ] [-m <br>

] [-r PORT ] [-t NUMBER ] [-u STRING ] [-W NUMBER ] [-x
NUMBER ] -s SIPURI</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
sipsak is a SIP stress and diagnostics utility. It sends SIP
requests to the server within the sip-uri and examines
received responses. It runs in one of the following
modes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- default mode <br>
A SIP message is sent to destination in sip-uri and reply
status is displayed. The request is either taken from
filename or generated as a new OPTIONS message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- traceroute mode (-T) <br>
This mode is useful for learning request&rsquo;s path. It
operates similarly to IP-layer utility traceroute(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- message mode (-M) <br>
Sends a short message (similar to SMS from the mobile
phones) to a given target. With the option -B the content of
the MESSAGE can be set. Usefull might be the options -c <br>
and -O in this mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- usrloc mode (-U) <br>
Stress mode for SIP registrar. sipsak keeps registering to a
SIP server at high pace. Additionaly the registrar can be
stressed with the -I or the -M option. If -I and <br>
-M are omitted sipsak can be used to register any given
contact (with the -C option) for an account at a registrar
and to query the current bindings for an account at a <br>
registrar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- randtrash mode (-R) <br>
Parser torture mode. sipsak keeps sending randomly corrupted
messages to torture a SIP server&rsquo;s parser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- flood mode (-F) <br>
Stress mode for SIP servers. sipsak keeps sending requests
to a SIP server at high pace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If libruli
(http://www.nongnu.org/ruli/) support is compiled into the
sipsak binary, then first a SRV lookup for
_sip._udp.hostname is made. And if this lookup fails a
normal A <br>
lookup is made. If a port was given in the target URI the
SRV lookup is omitted. Failover, load distribution and other
transports are not supported yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a, --password PASSWORD <br>
With the given PASSWORD an authentication will be tryed on
received &rsquo;401 Unauthorized&rsquo;. Authorization will
be tryed on time. If this option is omitted an authorization
<br>
with an empty password (&quot;&quot;) will be tryed. If the
password is equal to - the password will be read from the
standard input (e.g. the keyboard). This prevents other
users <br>
on the same host from seeing the password the password in
the process list. NOTE: the password still can be read from
the memory if other users have access to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --timing <br>
prints only the timing values of the test run if verbosity
is zero because no -v was given. If one or more -v were
given this option will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --apendix-begin NUMBER <br>
The starting number which is appended to the user name in
the usrloc mode. This NUMBER is increased until it reaches
the value given by the -e parameter. If omitted the <br>
starting number will be one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --message-body STRING <br>
The given STRING will be used as the body for outgoing
MESSAGE requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --from SIPURI <br>
The given SIPURI will be used in the From header if sipsak
runs in the message mode (initiated with the -M option).
This is helpfull to present the receiver of a MESSAGE a <br>
meaningfull and usable address to where maybe even responses
can be send.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --contact SIPURI <br>
This is the content of the Contact header in the usrloc
mode. This allows to insert forwards like for mail. For
example you can insert the uri of your first SIP account at
<br>
a second account, thus all calls to the second account will
be forwarded to the first account. As the argument to this
option will not be enclosed in brackets you can <br>
give also multiple contacts in the raw format as comma
seperated list. The special words empty or none will result
in no contact header in the REGISTER request and thus <br>
the server should answer with the current bindings for the
account at the registrar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --ignore-redirects <br>
If this option is set all redirects will be ignored. By
default without this option received redirects will be
respected. This option is automaticly activated in the
rand&acirc; <br>
trash mode and in the flood mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --timeout-factor NUMBER <br>
The SIP_T1 timer is getting multiplied with the given
NUMBER. After receiving a provisional response for an INVITE
request, or when a reliable transport like TCP or TLS is
<br>
used sipsak waits for the resulting amount of time for a
final response until it gives up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --appendix-end NUMBER <br>
The ending number which is appended to the user name in the
usrloc mode. This number is increased until it reaches this
ending number. In the flood mode this is the max&acirc; <br>
imum number of messages which will be send. If omitted the
default value is 2^31 (2147483647) in the flood mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --transport STRING <br>
The value of STRING will be used as IP transport for sending
and receiving requests and responses. This option overwrites
any result from the URI evaluation and SRV <br>
lookup. Currently only &rsquo;udp&rsquo; and
&rsquo;tcp&rsquo; are accepted as value for STRING.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --filename FILE <br>
The content of FILE will be read in in binary mode and will
be used as replacement for the alternatively created sip
message. This can used in the default mode to make <br>
other requests than OPTIONS requests (e.g. INVITE). By
default missing carriage returns in front of line feeds will
be inserted (use -L to de-activate this function). If <br>
the filename is equal to - the file is read from standard
input, e.g. from the keyboard or a pipe. Please note that
the manipulation functions (e.g. inserting Via header) <br>
are only tested with RFC conform requests. Additionaly
special strings within the file can be replaced with some
local or given values (see -g and -G for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --flood-mode <br>
This options activates the flood mode. In this mode OPTIONS
requests with increasing CSeq numbers are sent to the
server. Replies are ignored -- source port 9 (discard) of
<br>
localhost is advertised in topmost Via.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Prints out a simple usage help message. If the long option
--help is available it will print out a help message with
the available long options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --replace-string STRING <br>
Activates the replacement of $replace$ within the request
(usualy read in from a file) with the STRING. Alternatively
you can also specify a list of attribute and values. <br>
This list has to start and end with a non alpha-numeric
character. The same character has to be used also as
seperator between the attribute and the value and between
new <br>
further attribute value pairs. The string
&quot;$attribute$&quot; will be replaced with the value
string in the message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G, --replace <br>
Activates the automatic replacement of the following
variables in the request (usualy read in from a file):
$dsthost$ will be replaced by with the host or domainname
which <br>
is given by the -s parameter. $srchost$ will be replaced by
the hostname of the local machine. $port$ will be replaced
by the local listening port of sipsak. $user$ <br>
will be replaced by the username which is given by the -s
parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --hostname HOSTNAME <br>
Overwrites the automatic detection of the hostname with the
given parameter. Warning: use this with caution (preferable
only if the automatic detection fails).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --no-via <br>
Deactivates the insertion of the Via line of the localhost.
Warning: this probably disables the receiving of the
responses from the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --invite-mode <br>
Activates the Invites cycles within the usrloc mode. It
should be combined with -U. In this combination sipsak first
registeres a user, and then simulates an invitation <br>
to this user. First an Invite is sent, this is replied with
200 OK and finaly an ACK is sent. This option can also be
used without -U , but you should be sure to NOT <br>
invite real UAs with this option. In the case of a missing
-U the -l PORT is required because only if you made a -U run
with a fixed local port before, a run with -I and <br>
the same fixed local port can be successful. Warning: sipsak
is no real UA and invitations to real UAs can result in
unexpected behaivior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j, --headers STRING <br>
The string will be added as one or more additional headers
to the request. The string &quot;0 (note: two characters)
will be replaced with CRLF and thus result in two
seper&acirc; <br>
ate headers. That way more then one header can be added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --local-port PORT <br>
The receiving UDP socket will use the local network port.
Useful if a file is given by -f which contains a correct Via
line. Check the -S option for details how sipsak <br>
sends and receives messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --no-crlf ) <br>
De-activates the insertion of carriage returns ( before all
line feeds (0 (which is not allready proceeded by carraige
return) if the input is comming from a file ( <br>
-f ). Without this option also an empty line will be
appended to the request if required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --max-forwards NUMBER <br>
This sets the value of the Max-Forward header field. If
omitted no Max-Forward field will be inserted. If omitted in
the traceroute mode number will be 255.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --message-mode <br>
This activates the Messages cycles within the usrloc mode
(known from sipsak versions pre 0.8.0 within the normal
usrloc test). This option should be combined with -U so <br>
that a succesful registration will be tested with a test
message to the user and replied with 200 OK. But this option
can also be used without the -U option. Warning: <br>
using without -U can cause unexpected behaivor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --numeric <br>
Instead of the full qualified domain name in the Via line
the IP of the local host will be used. This option is now on
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --nagios-code <br>
Use Nagios comliant return codes instead of the normal
sipsak ones. This means sipsak will return 0 if everything
was ok and 2 in case of any error (local or remote).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --sleep NUMBER <br>
sipsak will sleep for NUMBER ms before it starts the next
cycle in the usrloc mode. This will slow down the whole test
process to be more realistic. Each cycle will be <br>
still completed as fast as possible, but the whole test will
be slowed down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --disposition STRING <br>
The given STRING will be used as the content for the
Content-Disposition header. Without this option there will
be no Content-Disposition header in the request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --outbound-proxy
HOSTNAME[:PORT] <br>
the address of the hostname is the target where the request
will be sent to (outgoing proxy). Use this if the
destination host is different then the host part of the <br>
request uri. The hostname is resolved via DNS SRV if
supported (see description for SRV resolving) and no port is
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --processes NUMBER <br>
Start NUMBER of processes in parallel to do the send and
reply checking. Makes only sence if a higher number for -e
is given in the usrloc, message or invite mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --search REGEXP <br>
match replies against REGEXP and return false if no match
occured. Useful for example to detect server name in Server
header field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --remote-port PORT <br>
Instead of the default sip port 5060 the PORT will be used.
Alternatively the remote port can be given within the sip
uri of the -s parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --random-mode <br>
This activates the randtrash mode. In this mode OPTIONS
requests will be send to server with increasing numbers of
randomly crashed characters within this request. The <br>
position within the request and the replacing character are
randomly chosen. Any other response than Bad request (4xx)
will stop this mode. Also three unresponded sends <br>
will stop this mode. With the -t parameter the maximum of
trashed characters can be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --sip-uri SIPURI <br>
This mandatory option sets the destination of the request.
It depends on the mode if only the server name or also an
user name is mandatory. Example for a full SIPURI : <br>
sip:test@foo.bar:123 See the note in the description part
about SRV lookups for details how the hostname of this URI
is converted into an IP and port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --symmetric <br>
With this option sipsak will use only one port for sending
and receiving messages. With this option the local port for
sending will be the value from the -l option. In the <br>
default mode sipsak sends from a random port and listens on
the given port from the -l option. Note: With this option
sipsak will not be able to receive replies from <br>
servers with asymmetric signaling (and broken rport
implementation) like the Cisco proxy. If you run sipsak as
root and with raw socket support (check the output from the
<br>
-V option) then this option is not required because in this
case sipsak already uses only one port for sending and
receiving messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --trash-chars NUMBER <br>
This parameter specifies the maximum of trashed characters
in the randtrash mode. If omitted NUMBER will be set to the
length of the request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --traceroute-mode <br>
This activates the traceroute mode. This mode works like the
well known traceroute(8) command expect that not the number
of network hops are counted rather the number of <br>
server on the way to the destination user. Also the round
trip time of each request is printed out, but due to a
limitation within the sip protocol the identity (IP or <br>
name) can only determined and printed out if the response
from the server contains a warning header field. In this
mode on each outgoing request the value of the
Max-For&acirc; <br>
wards header field is increased, starting with one. The
maximum of the Max-Forwards header will 255 if no other
value is given by the -m parameter. Any other response than
<br>
483 or 1xx are treated as a final response and will
terminate this mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --auth-username STRING <br>
Use the given STRING as username value for the
authentication (different account and authentication
username).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U, --usrloc-mode <br>
This activates the usrloc mode. Without the -I or the -M
option, this only registers users at a registrar. With one
of the above options the previous registered user will <br>
also be probed ether with a simulated call flow (invite,
200, ack) or with an instant message (message, 200). One
password for all users accounts within the usrloc test <br>
can be given with the -a option. An user name is mandatory
for this mode in the -s parameter. The number starting from
the -b parameter to the -e parameter is appended the <br>
user name. If the -b and the -e parameter are omitted, only
one runs with the given username, but without append number
to the usernames is done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
This parameter increases the output verbosity. No -v means
nearly no output except in traceroute and error messages.
The maximum of three v&rsquo;s prints out the content of all
<br>
packets received and sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Prints out the name and version number of sipsak and the
options which were compiled into the binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --extract-ip <br>
Activates the extraction of the IP or hostname from the
Warning header field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W, --nagios-warn NUMBER <br>
Return Nagios warn exit code (1) if the number of
retransmissions before success was above the given
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --expires NUMBER <br>
Sets the value of the Expires header to the given
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --remove-bindings <br>
Activates the randomly removing of old bindings in the
usrloc mode. How many per cent of the bindings will be
removed, is determined by the USRLOC_REMOVE_PERCENT define
<br>
within the code (set it before compilation). Multiple
removing of bindings is possible, and cannot be
prevented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
The return value 0 means that a 200 was received. 1 means
something else then 1xx or 2xx was received. 2 will be
returned on local errors like non resolvable names or wrong
<br>
options combination. 3 will be returned on remote errors
like socket errors (e.g. icmp error), redirects without a
contact header or simply no answer (timeout).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -N option was given the
return code will be 2 in case of any (local or remote)
error. 1 in case there have been retransmissions from sipsak
to the server. And 0 if there <br>
was no error at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAUTION <br>
Use sipsak responsibly. Running it in any of the stress
modes puts substantial burden on network and server under
test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
sipsak -vv -s sip:nobody@foo.bar <br>
displays received replies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sipsak -T -s sip:nobody@foo.bar
<br>
traces SIP path to nobody.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sipsak -U -C sip:me@home -x 3600
-a password -s sip:myself@company <br>
inserts forwarding from work to home for one hour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sipsak -f bye.sip -g
&rsquo;!FTAG!345.af23!TTAG!1208.12!&rsquo; -s sip:myproxy
<br>
reads the file bye.sip, replaces $FTAG$ with 345.af23 and
$TTAG$ with 1208.12 and finally send this message to
myproxy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS / NOT IMPLEMENTED
<br>
Many servers may decide NOT to include SIP
&quot;Warning&quot; header fields. Unfortunately, this makes
displaying IP addresses of SIP servers in traceroute mode
impossible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPv6 is not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Missing support for the
Record-Route and Route header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
sipsak is only tested against the SIP Express Router (ser)
though their could be various bugs. Please feel free to mail
them to the author.</p>
