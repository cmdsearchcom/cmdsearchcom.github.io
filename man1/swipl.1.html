<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
swipl - SWI-Prolog 7.2.3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
swipl [--help|--version|--arch|--dump-runtime-variables]
<br>
swipl [options] <br>
swipl [options] [-o output] -c file ... <br>
swipl [options] [-o output] -b initfile ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
SWI-Prolog is a comprehensive and stable implementation of
the Prolog language with a large set of libraries. Among its
distinguishing features are mature support for multi- <br>
threading, a mature embedded web-server library, graphical
development tools (debugger, profiler, cross-referencer,
editor), an embedded efficient RDF store, support for <br>
XML/SGML/HTML and Unicode. More widely supported features
are support for constraint programming, atom garbage
collection, interfaces to databases (ODBC), C, C++ and Java
(JPL).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SWI-Prolog implements the ISO
core standard. Many of its extensions are largely compatible
to YAP and SICStus Prolog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manual page only lists the
commandline options. Full documentation is available on-line
as well as in HTML and PDF format from the WWW home page at
http://www.swi-pro&acirc; <br>
log.org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LICENSE INFORMATION <br>
SWI-Prolog is distributed under the LGPL (Lesser Gnu Public
License) for maximal compatibility with the Free Software
movement, while allowing for use with proprietary software
<br>
components. See the SWI-Prolog home page at
http://www.swi-prolog.org for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--help Gives a summary of the most important options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Displays version and architecture information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--arch Prints the architecture
identifier.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dump-runtime-variables[=format]
<br>
Dump information that is generally useful for installation
scripts in a form defined by format. Defines formats are sh
(default, bourne shell) and cmd (Windows CMD). <br>
This option is used by swipl-ld (1) to fetch necessary
information about Prolog. It is normally invoked as eval
&lsquo;swipl -dump-runtime-variables&lsquo;, which assigns
the follow&acirc; <br>
ing shell variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CC The C- compiler used to
compile SWI-Prolog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLBASE The home directory of
SWI-Prolog. This is the same value as returned by the
current_prolog_flag home.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLARCH The architecture
identifier used. Together with PLBASE this defines the
location of various components. For example, the library for
embedding is in <br>
$PLBASE/lib/$PLARCH/libswipl.a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLLIB CC identifier to link to
SWI-Prolog. Typically -lswipl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLLIBS Additional libraries
needed for linking PLLIB</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLCFLAGS <br>
Flags that need to be passed to the C-compiler to generate
compatible code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLLDFLAGS <br>
Flags that need to be passed to the C-linker for linking
embedded executables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLSOEXT <br>
Extension used by the hosting operating system for shared
objects. On most Unix systems this is &quot;so&quot;; on
MS-Windows it is &quot;dll&quot;. AIX uses &quot;o&quot;,
HPUX &quot;sl&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLSOPATH <br>
Environment variable used by the hosting operating system to
extend the search path for shared objects. For example, on
ELF systems this is &quot;LD_LIBRARY_PATH&quot; and <br>
on MS-Windows it is &quot;PATH&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLVERSION <br>
Numeric representation of the SWI-Prolog version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLSHARED <br>
Has the value yes if Prolog supports linking shared
libraries using load_foreign_library/[1,2] and no
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLTHREADS <br>
Has the value yes if Prolog was compiled for multi-threading
and no otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Gsize[kmg] <br>
Sets the global stack size to size. The default is 128
Mbytes (64-bit machines: 256 Mbytes). The global stack is
used to store compound terms, floating point numbers, big
<br>
integers and strings. See also the -L option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Lsize[kmg] <br>
Sets the local stack size to size. The default unit is
Kbytes. The local stack is used to store environment frames,
choicepoints and foreign-language term-references. <br>
SWI-Prolog performs last-call optimisation to minimize the
local stack requirements. If the argument ends in m , the
argument is interpreted in Mbytes. A g suffix is <br>
interpreted in Gbytes (64-bit machines only). This flag sets
the maximum value to which the stack is allowed to grow
(default 128 Mbytes for the 32-bit version and 256 <br>
Mbytes for the 64-bit version). A maximum is useful to
prevent buggy programs from claiming all the memory
resources. -L0 sets the limit to the highest possible
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O Optimised compilation. See
set_prolog_flag/3 in the SWI-Prolog Reference Manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Tsize[kmg] <br>
Sets the trail stack size to size K bytes. The default is
128 Mbytes (64-bit machines: 256 Mbytes). See -L for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b initfile ... -c file ... <br>
Boot compilation. initfile ... are compiled by the C written
bootstrap compiler, file ... by the normal Prolog compiler
into an intermediate code file. This option is <br>
for system maintenance and is given for reference only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c file ... <br>
Compiles file ... into an intermediate code file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d level <br>
Set debug level to level. This option is for system
maintenance and is given for reference only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f file <br>
Use file as initialisation file instead of
&lsquo;.swiplrc&rsquo;. &lsquo;-f none&rsquo; stops
SWI-Prolog from searching for an initialisation file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F file <br>
Select startup script from the SWI-Prolog home directory.
file Specifies the base-name of the script. The extension is
.rc. The default script is deduced from the base&acirc; <br>
name of the executable, taking all leading alphanumerical
(letters, digits and underscore) from the program name. Thus
if the program is named swi-2.0 it will try to load <br>
the file swi.rc from the SWI-Prolog home directory. If the
file does not exist, or the user has no read-access to it,
the script is silently not loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s file <br>
Load file as a script. This option may be used from the
shell to make Prolog load a file before entering the
toplevel. It is also used to turn a file into an executable
<br>
Prolog script on Unix systems using the following first
line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/swipl option ...
-s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l file <br>
Load file as a script. This is a synonym for -s that is
compatible with several other Prolog implementations. If
multiple -s or -l arguments are provided, all specified <br>
files are loaded in the order in which they appear on the
argument list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quiet -q <br>
Operate silently. This option suppresses all informational
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g goal <br>
Goal is executed just before entering the top level. The
default is a predicate which prints the welcome message. The
welcome message can thus be suppressed by giving -g <br>
true. goal can be a complex term. In this case, quotes are
normally needed to protect it from being expanded by the
Unix shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o output <br>
Used in combination with -b or -c to determine the output
file for compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p alias=pathlist <br>
Define a path alias for file_search_path/2. pathlist is a
&quot;:&quot; separated list of values for the alias. See
file_search_path/2 in the SWI-Prolog Reference Manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t goal <br>
Use goal as an interactive top level instead of the default
goal prolog/0. goal can be a complex term. If the top level
goal succeeds, SWI-Prolog exits with status 0. If <br>
it fails, the exit status is 1. This flag also determines
the goal started by break/0 and abort/0. If you want to stop
the user from entering interactive mode, start the <br>
application with &lsquo;-g goal&rsquo; and give
&lsquo;halt&rsquo; as the top level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x bootfile <br>
Start from an intermediate code file resulting from a Prolog
compilation using the -b or -c option, or created using
qsave_program/[1,2].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[+|-]tty <br>
Switches tty control (using ioctl(2)) on (+tty) or off
(-tty). Normally tty control is switched on. This default
depends on the installation. You may wish to switch tty <br>
control off if SWI-Prolog is used from an editor such as GNU
Emacs. If switched off, get_single_char/1 and the tracer
will wait for a carriage return.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nosignals <br>
Disable handling of signals. Often used if SWI-Prolog is
embedded in another application on Unix systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- Stops scanning for more
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
SWI_HOME_DIR <br>
Location for finding the startup file boot32.prc and the
libraries. Normally discovered from the executable or
configured default location. Providing the value through
<br>
the environment may be needed if SWI-Prolog is embedded into
another executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ON-LINE HELP <br>
SWI-Prolog has on-line help. This provides a fast lookup and
browsing facility to the SWI-Prolog Reference manual. The
on-line manual can show predicate definitions as well as
<br>
entire sections of the manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help Equivalent to
help(help/1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help(+What) <br>
Show a specified part of the manual. What is one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name/Arity <br>
give help on the specified predicate</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name give help on the named
predicate with any arity or a C interface function with that
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Section <br>
display the specified section of the SWI-Prolog Reference
Manual. Section numbers are dash separated numbers: e.g. 2-3
refers to section 2.3 of the manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Prolog is used together with
the GUI tool XPCE, these predicates start a graphical
interface, providing a coherent interface to help/1,
apropos/1 and explain/1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
This installation of SWI-Prolog has been configured using
the configure option --prefix=/usr. If the files listed
below are not at the indicated place, the installation has
<br>
probably been moved. Use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">?- current_prolog_flag(home,
Home).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to find the local installation
directory of SWI-Prolog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.swiplrc <br>
Personal initialisation files consulted by SWI-Prolog on
startup. If both exist .swiplrc is used.</p>
