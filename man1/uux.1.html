<p>uux(1) General Commands Manual uux(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
uux - Remote command execution over UUCP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
uux [ options ] command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The uux command is used to execute a command on a remote
system, or to execute a command on the local system using
files from remote systems. The command is not executed
immedi&acirc; <br>
ately; the request is queued until the uucico (8) daemon
calls the system and executes it. The daemon is started
automatically unless one of the -r or --nouucico options is
<br>
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actual command execution is
done by the uuxqt (8) daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File arguments can be gathered
from remote systems to the execution system, as can standard
input. Standard output may be directed to a file on a remote
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command name may be preceded
by a system name followed by an exclamation point if it is
to be executed on a remote system. An empty system name is
taken as the local system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each argument that contains an
exclamation point is treated as naming a file. The system
which the file is on is before the exclamation point, and
the pathname on that system <br>
follows it. An empty system name is taken as the local
system; this must be used to transfer a file to a command
being executed on a remote system. If the path is not
absolute, <br>
it will be appended to the current working directory on the
local system; the result may not be meaningful on the remote
system. A pathname may begin with ~/, in which case it <br>
is relative to the UUCP public directory (usually
/usr/spool/uucppublic or /var/spool/uucppublic) on the
appropriate system. A pathname may begin with ~name/, in
which case it <br>
is relative to the home directory of the named user on the
appropriate system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard input and output may be
redirected as usual; the pathnames used may contain
exclamation points to indicate that they are on remote
systems. Note that the redirection <br>
characters must be quoted so that they are passed to uux
rather than interpreted by the shell. Append redirection
(&gt;&gt;) does not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All specified files are gathered
together into a single directory before execution of the
command begins. This means that each file must have a
distinct base name. For example, <br>
uux &rsquo;sys1!diff sys2!~user1/foo sys3!~user2/foo
&gt;!foo.diff&rsquo; <br>
will fail because both files will be copied to sys1 and
stored under the name foo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments may be quoted by
parentheses to avoid interpretation of exclamation points.
This is useful when executing the uucp command on a remote
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A request to execute an empty
command (e.g., uux sys!) will create a poll file for the
specified system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exit status of uux is one of
the codes found in the header file sysexits.h. In
particular, EX_OK ( 0 ) indicates success, and EX_TEMPFAIL (
75 ) indicates a temporary fail&acirc; <br>
ure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options may be given to uux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-, -p, --stdin <br>
Read standard input and use it as the standard input for the
command to be executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --nocopy <br>
Do not copy local files to the spool directory. This is the
default. If they are removed before being processed by the
uucico (8) daemon, the copy will fail. The files <br>
must be readable by the uucico (8) daemon, as well as the by
the invoker of uux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --copy <br>
Copy local files to the spool directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --link <br>
Link local files into the spool directory. If a file can not
be linked because it is on a different device, it will be
copied unless one of the -c or --nocopy options also <br>
appears (in other words, use of --link switches the default
from --nocopy to --copy). If the files are changed before
being processed by the uucico (8) daemon, the changed <br>
versions will be used. The files must be readable by the
uucico (8) daemon, as well as by the invoker of uux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g grade, --grade grade <br>
Set the grade of the file transfer command. Jobs of a higher
grade are executed first. Grades run 0 ... 9 A ... Z a ... z
from high to low.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --notification=no <br>
Do not send mail about the status of the job, even if it
fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --notification=error <br>
Send mail about the status of the job if an error occurs.
For many uuxqt daemons, including the Taylor UUCP uuxqt,
this is the default action; for those, --notifica&acirc;
<br>
tion=error will have no effect. However, some uuxqt daemons
will send mail if the job succeeds unless the
--notification=error option is used, and some other uuxqt
daemons <br>
will not send mail if the job fails unless the
--notification=error option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --nouucico <br>
Do not start the uucico (8) daemon immediately; merely queue
up the execution request for later processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j, --jobid <br>
Print jobids on standard output. A jobid will be generated
for each file copy operation required to perform the
operation. These file copies may be cancelled by passing
<br>
the jobid to the --kill switch of uustat (1), which will
make the execution impossible to complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a address, --requestor address
<br>
Report job status to the specified e-mail address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x type, --debug type <br>
Turn on particular debugging types. The following types are
recognized: abnormal, chat, handshake, uucp-proto, proto,
port, config, spooldir, execute, incoming, outgoing. <br>
Only abnormal, config, spooldir and execute are meaningful
for uux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple types may be given,
separated by commas, and the --debug option may appear
multiple times. A number may also be given, which will turn
on that many types from the <br>
foregoing list; for example, --debug 2 is equivalent to
--debug abnormal,chat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I file, --config file <br>
Set configuration file to use. This option may not be
available, depending upon how uux was compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Report version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
Print a help message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
uux -z - sys1!rmail user1 <br>
Execute the command &lsquo;&lsquo;rmail user1&rsquo;&rsquo;
on the system sys1, giving it as standard input whatever is
given to uux as standard input. If a failure occurs, send a
message using mail <br>
(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uux &rsquo;diff -c
sys1!~user1/file1 sys2!~user2/file2 &gt;!file.diff&rsquo;
<br>
Fetch the two named files from system sys1 and system sys2
and execute diff putting the result in file.diff in the
current directory. The current directory must be writable by
<br>
the uuxqt (8) daemon for this to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uux &rsquo;sys1!uucp
~user1/file1 (sys2!~user2/file2)&rsquo; <br>
Execute uucp on the system sys1 copying file1 (on system
sys1) to sys2. This illustrates the use of parentheses for
quoting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
The remote system may not permit you to execute certain
commands. Many remote systems only permit the execution of
rmail and rnews.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of the options are
dependent on the capabilities of the uuxqt (8) daemon on the
remote system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
mail(1), uustat(1), uucp(1), uucico(8), uuxqt(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Files can not be referenced across multiple systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Too many jobids are output by
--jobid, and there is no good way to cancel a local
execution requiring remote files.</p>
