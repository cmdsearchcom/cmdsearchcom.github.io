<p>TTH(1) TeX to HTML translator TTH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tth, latex2gif, ps2gif, ps2png - TeX and LaTeX to HTML
translator and its auxiliary program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tth [options] [&lt;file.tex] [&gt;file.html] [2&gt;err]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tth [options] file.tex

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ps2png file.ps file.gif
[icon.gif]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tth translates TeX source that uses the plain macro package
or LaTeX, including most mathematics, into a near equivalent
in HTML. The formal standard that TTH-translated docu&acirc;
<br>
ments follow is strictly HTML4.0 Transitional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The complete documentation is
contained in &quot;tth_manual.html&quot; distributed with
the program. This man page is an incomplete summary and
updated on an irregular basis. [Last updated <br>
1 May 2002 by Hans Fredrik Nordhaug.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program is a filter, i.e. it
reads from standard input and writes to standard output. In
addition, diagnostic messages concerning its detection of
unknown or untranslated <br>
constructs are sent to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In handling embedded graphical
files tth can make use of auxiliary programs, ps2gif or
ps2png, which in turn make use of the ghostscript
interpreter gs (1) and the Portable Bit&acirc; <br>
map Graphics suite of commands, see pbm (1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tth is extremely fast in default
mode on any reasonable hardware. Conversion of even large
TeX files should be a matter of a second or two. This makes
it possible to use tth in <br>
a CGI script to output HTML directly from TeX source if
desired; (standard error may then need to be
redirected.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tth handles TeX things like:
<br>
Almost all mathematics, including symbols, fractions,
delimiters. g i n g r o u p \ n d g <br>
{} r o u p g r o u p i n g . t c s t <br>
it y l e s . g i n <br>
ction. s <br>
item{...} itemitem{...} {. <br>
Almost all accented latin characters written like <br>
g gindent 0rrower for entire paragraphs <br>
(gafter ignored). <br>
dline is made into a title. <br>
% Comments. Simply removed. <br>
ign tables, checks template for the presence of le, <br>
to decide if the table is to be border style. <br>
tabs + style tables. <br>
input: But, of course, not from the implicit texinputs path.
<br>
0wcount, 0mber, dvance and counter setting. <br>
ef, \def, f but no delimited arguments. <br>
All definitions are global. <br>
trix, matrix r d e r m a t r but not i x . a s e s .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LaTeX support includes
essentially all mathematics plus the following environments:
<br>
em, verbatim, center, flushright [one paragraph only],
verse, quotation, quote, itemize, enumerate, description,
list [treated as if description], figure, table,
tabular[*,x], <br>
equation, displaymath, eqnarray [only one equation number],
math, array, thebibliography, [raw]html, index [as
description]. <br>
and Latex commands: <br>
[re]newcommand, newenvironment [optional arg not permitted],
chapter, section, subsection, subsubsection, caption, label,
ref, pageref [no number], emph, textit, texttt, <br>
textbf, centering, raggedleft, includegraphics, [e]psfig,
title, author, date [not automatic], lefteqn, frac,
tableofcontents, input, include [as input], textcolor, color
[8 <br>
standard colors], footnote [ignoring optional arg], cite,
bibitem, bibliography, tiny ... normalsize ... Huge,
newcounter [no &lsquo;&lsquo;within&rsquo;&rsquo; support],
setcounter, addtocounter, <br>
value [inside set or addto counter], arabic, the,
stepcounter, newline, verb[*], bfseries, itshape, ttfamily,
textsc, ensuremath, listoftables, listoffigures, newtheorem
[no <br>
optional arguments permitted], today, printindex, boldmath,
unboldmath, newfont, thanks, makeindex, index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hypertext cross-references
within the document are automatically generated by (e.g.)
ref, and tableofcontents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When tth encounters TeX
constructs that it cannot handle either because there is no
HTML equivalent, or because it is not clever enough, it
tries to remove the mess they would <br>
otherwise cause in the HTML code, generally giving a warning
of the action if it is not sure what it is doing.
Untranslatable TeX math tokens are inserted verbatim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Independence of [La]TeX
installation and the -L switch <br>
A major difference between tth and latex2html is that tth
does not call the latex or tex programs at all by default,
and is not specifically dependent upon these, or indeed any
<br>
other (e.g. perl), programs being installed on the
translating system. Its portability is therefore virtually
universal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forward references in LaTeX are
handled by multiple passes that write auxiliary files. tth
does only a single pass through the source. If you want tth
to use LaTeX constructs <br>
(e.g. tableofcontents, bibliographic commands, etc.) that
depend on auxiliary files, then you do need to run LaTeX on
the code so that these files are generated. Alternatively,
<br>
the tth switch -a causes tth automatically to attempt to run
latex on the file, if no auxiliary file .aux exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When run specifying a filename
on the command line as a non-switch argument, x tth
constructs the name of the expected auxiliary LaTeX files in
the usual way and looks for them <br>
in the same directory as the file. If you are using tth as a
filter, you must tell tth , using the switch -Lfilename, the
base file name of these auxiliary files (which is the <br>
name of the original file omitting the extension). If tth
cannot find the relevant auxiliary file because you
didn&rsquo;t run LaTeX and generate the files or
didn&rsquo;t include the <br>
switch, then it will omit the construct and warn you.
Forward references via ref will not work if the .aux file is
unavailable, but backward references will. The -L switch
with <br>
no filename may be used to tell tth that the document being
translated is to be interpreted as a LaTeX file even though
it lacks the usual LaTeX header commands. This may be <br>
useful for translating single equations that (unwisely) use
the ac command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BibTeX bibliographies <br>
tth supports bibliographies that are created by hand using g
i n {bibliography} etc. Such bibliographies do not require
anything t h beyond the .aux file. tth also supports
bibli&acirc; <br>
ographies created using BibTeX from a biblography database.
The filename.bbl file is input at the correct place in the
document. However, this filename.bbl is not created
auto&acirc; <br>
matically by latex. In addition to running latex on the
source file to create the auxiliary file, you must also
execute bibtex filename in the same directory, to create the
file&acirc; <br>
name.bbl file, and then run latex again to get the
references right. (This is, of course, no more than the
standard procedure for using bibtex with latex but it must
be done if <br>
you want tth to get your bibliography right). If you
don&rsquo;t create the <br>
.bbl file, or if you create it somewhere else that tth does
not search, then naturally tth won&rsquo;t find it. Since
the BibTeX process is relatively tortuous, tth offers an
<br>
alternative. Using the -a switch with tth will cause it to
attempt to generate the required .bbl file automatically
using bibtex and latex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are many different styles
for bibliographies and a large number of different LaTeX
extension packages has grown up to implement them, which tth
does not support. More <br>
recently, a significant rationalization of the situation has
been achieved by the package natbib. tth has rudimentary
support built in for its commands default author-date form
without a second optional argument. A style file for natbib
is distributed with TTHgold which makes it possible to
accommodate most of its more useful <br>
styles and commands and easily switch from author-date
citation to numeric citation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Indexing <br>
tth can make an extremely useful hyperlinked index using
LaTeX automatic indexing entries. But indexing an HTML
document is different from indexing a printed document,
because a <br>
printed index refers to page numbers, which have no meaning
in HTML because there are no page breaks. TTH indexes LaTeX
documents by section number rather than by page; assuming,
<br>
of course, that they have been prepared with index entries
in the standard LaTeX fashion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tth will construct an index
based on the standard LaTeX commands &quot;keindex&quot; and
&quot;index{...}&quot;, and automatically process it and
read it in when &quot;rintindex&quot; is encountered. <br>
The command line for calling the makeindex program (not part
of this distribution) may be changed using the -x switch.
For a file without the &quot;keindex&quot; command, tth will
write <br>
no index files, just read in an existing one
&quot;file.ind&quot; if it exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Graphics inclusion:
epsfbox/includegraphics <br>
The standard way in plain TeX to include a graphic is using
the epsf macros. The work is done by \psfbox{file.ps} which
tth can parse. By default tth produces a simple link to <br>
such a postscript file, or indeed any format file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optionally TTH can use a more
appropriate graphics format, by using ps2gif or ps2png to
convert the postscript file to a png or gif file,
&quot;file.png&quot; or file.gif&quot; When the switch <br>
-e1 or -e2 is specified, if
&lsquo;&lsquo;file.png&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;file.gif&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;file.jpg&rsquo;&rsquo; already exists in the
same directory as implied by the reference to
&lsquo;&lsquo;file.ps&rsquo;&rsquo; then no conversion is
done <br>
and the file found is used instead. That graphics file is
then automatically either linked (-e1) or inlined (-e2) in
the document. If no such file is found, TTH tries to find a
<br>
postscript file with extension that starts either .ps or
.eps and convert it, first using ps2png then, if
unsuccessful, ps2gif. By popular request, a third graphics
option -e3 <br>
for generating icons is now available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The LaTeX command
includegraphics{...} and the older psfig{file=...} are
treated the same as \psfbox. Their optional arguments are
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Picture Environments <br>
The picture environment cannot be translated to HTML.
Pictures using the built-in LaTeX commands must be converted
to a graphics file such as a gif or png, and then included
<br>
using includegraphics. The switch -a, causes tth to attempt
automatic picture conversion using latex2gif.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a attempt automatic conversion of picture environments.
Default omit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c prefix header

delimited arguments. Default enable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e? epsfbox handling: -e1
convert figure to png/gif using user-supplied ps2png/ps2gif.
-e2 convert and include inline. -e3 as e2 but with icon. -e0

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Browser Problems <br>
tth translates (La)TeX into standard HTML and takes account
as far as possible of the idiosyncrasies of the major
browsers. Nevertheless, there are several problems that are
<br>
associated with the browsers. Authors and publishers should
recognize that these are not tth bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the most serious
difficulties of Mathematics rendering in HTML are associated
with the need for extra symbols. In addition to various
Greek letters and mathematical oper&acirc; <br>
ators, one needs access to the glyphs used to build up from
parts the large brackets matching the height of built-up
fractions. These symbols are almost universally present on
<br>
systems with graphical browsers, which all have a
&lsquo;&lsquo;Symbol&rsquo;&rsquo; font, generally based on
that made freely available by Adobe. The problem lies in
accessing the font because of <br>
shortcomings in the browsers and the HTML standards that
relate to font use.</p>
