<p>GNUCAP(1) Debian GNU GNUCAP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gnucap - GNU Circuit Analysis Package</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gnucap [-b filename] [-i filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
GNUCAP is a general purpose circuit simulator. It performs
nonlinear dc and transient analyses, fourier analysis, and
ac analysis linearized at an operating point. It is fully
<br>
interactive and command driven. It can also be run in batch
mode or as a server. The output is produced as it simulates.
Spice compatible models for the MOSFET (level 1,2,3) <br>
and diode are included in this release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since it is fully interactive,
it is possible to make changes and re-simulate quickly. The
interactive design makes it well suited to the typical
iterative design process used <br>
it optimizing a circuit design. It is also well suited to
undergraduate teaching where Spice in batch mode can be
quite intimidating. This version, while still officially in
<br>
beta test, should be stable enough for basic undergraduate
teaching and courses in MOS design, but not for bipolar
design.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In batch mode it is mostly Spice
compatible, so it is often possible to use the same file for
both GNUCAP and Spice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The analog simulation is based
on traditional nodal analysis with iteration by
Newton&rsquo;s method and LU decomposition. An event queue
and incremental matrix update speed up the <br>
solution for large circuits (at some expense for small
circuits).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It also has digital devices for
mixed signal simulation. The digital devices may be
implemented as either analog subcircuits or as true digital
models. The simulator will auto&acirc; <br>
matically determine which to use. Networks of digital
devices are simulated as digital, with no conversions to
analog between gates. This results in digital circuits being
sim&acirc; <br>
ulated faster than on a typical analog simulator, even with
behavioral models. The digital mode is experimental and
needs work. There will be substantial improvements in future
<br>
releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Two command-line options are available. Only one of these
may be specified. If no parameters are given, gnucap will
start in interactive mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b filename <br>
execute the commands in the named file then exit (batch
mode)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i filename <br>
execute the commands in the named file then go into
interactive mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
See /usr/share/doc/gnucap/bugs for a list of known bugs in
this release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GNUCAP is an ongoing research
project. It is being released in a preliminary phase in
hopes that it will be useful and that others will use it as
a thrust or base for their <br>
research. I also hope for some comments that may help me
direct my research.</p>
