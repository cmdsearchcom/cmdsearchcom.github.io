<i>GNUCAP</i> is a general purpose circuit simulator. It performs nonlinear dc
  and transient analyses, fourier analysis, and ac analysis linearized at an
  operating point. It is fully interactive and command driven. It can also be
  run in batch mode or as a server. The output is produced as it simulates.
  Spice compatible models for the MOSFET (level 1,2,3) and diode are included in
  this release.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since it is fully interactive, it is possible to make changes and re-simulate
  quickly. The interactive design makes it well suited to the typical iterative
  design process used it optimizing a circuit design. It is also well suited to
  undergraduate teaching where Spice in batch mode can be quite intimidating.
  This version, while still officially in beta test, should be stable enough for
  basic undergraduate teaching and courses in MOS design, but not for bipolar
  design.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In batch mode it is mostly Spice compatible, so it is often possible to use the
  same file for both GNUCAP and Spice.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The analog simulation is based on traditional nodal analysis with iteration by
  Newton's method and LU decomposition. An event queue and incremental matrix
  update speed up the solution for large circuits (at some expense for small
  circuits).
<div class="Pp"></div>
It also has digital devices for mixed signal simulation. The digital devices may
  be implemented as either analog subcircuits or as true digital models. The
  simulator will automatically determine which to use. Networks of digital
  devices are simulated as digital, with no conversions to analog between gates.
  This results in digital circuits being simulated faster than on a typical
  analog simulator, even with behavioral models. The digital mode is
  experimental and needs work. There will be substantial improvements in future
  releases.

Two command-line options are available. Only one of these may be specified. If
  no parameters are given, gnucap will start in interactive mode.

GNUCAP is an ongoing research project. It is being released in a preliminary
  phase in hopes that it will be useful and that others will use it as a thrust
  or base for their research. I also hope for some comments that may help me
  direct my research.
