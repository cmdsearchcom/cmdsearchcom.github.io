<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xscreensaver-command - control a running xscreensaver
process</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xscreensaver-command [-display host:display.screen] [-help |
-demo | -prefs | -activate | -deactivate | -cycle | -next |
-prev | -select n | -exit | -restart | -lock | -version |
<br>
-time | -watch]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The xscreensaver-command program controls a running
xscreensaver process by sending it client-messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xscreensaver(1) has a
client-server model: the xscreensaver process is a daemon
that runs in the background; it is controlled by other
foreground programs such as xscreensaver- <br>
command and xscreensaver-demo(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program,
xscreensaver-command, is a command-line-oriented tool; the
xscreensaver-demo(1). program is a graphical tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
xscreensaver-command accepts the following command-line
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help Prints a brief summary of
command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-demo This just launches the
xscreensaver-demo(1) program, in which one can experiment
with the various graphics hacks available, and edit
parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-demo number <br>
When the -demo option is followed by an integer, it
instructs the xscreensaver daemon to run that hack, and wait
for the user to click the mouse before deactivating <br>
(i.e., mouse motion does not deactivate.) This is the
mechanism by which xscreensaver-demo(1) communicates with
the xscreensaver(1) daemon. (The first hack in the list <br>
is numbered 1, not 0.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-prefs Like the no-argument form
of -demo, but brings up that program&rsquo;s Preferences
panel by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-activate <br>
Tell xscreensaver to turn on immediately (that is, blank the
screen, as if the user had been idle for long enough.) The
screensaver will deactivate as soon as there is <br>
any user activity, as usual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is useful to run this from a
menu; you may wish to run it as <br>
sleep 5 ; xscreensaver-command -activate <br>
to be sure that you have time to take your hand off the
mouse before the screensaver comes on. (Because if you
jiggle the mouse, xscreensaver will notice, and
deacti&acirc; <br>
vate.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-deactivate <br>
This tells xscreensaver to pretend that there has just been
user activity. This means that if the screensaver is active
(the screen is blanked), then this command will <br>
cause the screen to un-blank as if there had been keyboard
or mouse activity. If the screen is locked, then the
password dialog will pop up first, as usual. If the <br>
screen is not blanked, then this simulated user activity
will re-start the countdown (so, issuing the -deactivate
command periodically is one way to prevent the screen <br>
from blanking.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cycle If the screensaver is
active (the screen is blanked), then stop the current
graphics demo and run a new one (chosen randomly.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-next This is like either
-activate or -cycle, depending on which is more appropriate,
except that the graphics hack that will be run is the next
one in the list, instead of a <br>
randomly-chosen one. In other words, repeatedly executing
-next will cause the xscreensaver process to invoke each
graphics demo sequentially. (Though using the -demo <br>
option is probably an easier way to accomplish that.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-prev This is like -next, but
cycles in the other direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-select number <br>
Like -activate, but runs the Nth element in the list of
hacks. By knowing what is in the programs list, and in what
order, you can use this to activate the screensaver <br>
with a particular graphics demo. (The first element in the
list is numbered 1, not 0.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-exit Causes the xscreensaver
process to exit gracefully. This does nothing if the display
is currently locked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: never use kill -9 with
xscreensaver while the screensaver is active. If you are
using a virtual root window manager, that can leave things
in an inconsistent <br>
state, and you may need to restart your window manager to
repair the damage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lock Tells the running
xscreensaver process to lock the screen immediately. This is
like -activate, but forces locking as well, even if locking
is not the default (that is, <br>
even if xscreensaver&rsquo;s lock resource is false, and
even if the lockTimeout resource is non-zero.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that locking doesn&rsquo;t
work unless the xscreensaver process is running as you. See
xscreensaver(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Prints the version of xscreensaver that is currently running
on the display: that is, the actual version number of the
running xscreensaver background process, rather <br>
than the version number of xscreensaver-command. (To see the
version number of xscreensaver-command itself, use the -help
option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-time Prints the time at which
the screensaver last activated or deactivated (roughly, how
long the user has been idle or non-idle: but not quite,
since it only tells you when <br>
the screen became blanked or un-blanked.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-restart <br>
Causes the screensaver process to exit and then restart with
the same command line arguments as last time. You
shouldn&rsquo;t really need to do this, since xscreensaver
<br>
notices when the .xscreensaver file has changed and re-reads
it as needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-watch Prints a line each time
the screensaver changes state: when the screen blanks,
locks, unblanks, or when the running hack is changed. This
option never returns; it is <br>
intended for use by shell scripts that want to react to the
screensaver in some way. An example of its output would be:
<br>
BLANK Fri Nov 5 01:57:22 1999 <br>
RUN 34 <br>
RUN 79 <br>
RUN 16 <br>
LOCK Fri Nov 5 01:57:22 1999 <br>
RUN 76 <br>
RUN 12 <br>
UNBLANK Fri Nov 5 02:05:59 1999 <br>
The above shows the screensaver activating, running three
different hacks, then locking (perhaps because the
lock-timeout went off) then unblanking (because the user
<br>
became active, and typed the correct password.) The hack
numbers are their index in the &lsquo;programs&rsquo; list
(starting with 1, not 0, as for the -select command.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, suppose you want to
run a program that turns down the volume on your machine
when the screen blanks, and turns it back up when the screen
un-blanks. You <br>
could do that by running a Perl program like the following
in the background. The following program tracks the output
of the -watch command and reacts accordingly: <br>
#!/usr/bin/perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $blanked = 0; <br>
open (IN, &quot;xscreensaver-command -watch |&quot;); <br>
while (&lt;IN&gt;) { <br>
if (m/^(BLANK|LOCK)/) { <br>
if (!$blanked) { <br>
system &quot;sound-off&quot;; <br>
$blanked = 1; <br>
} <br>
} elsif (m/^UNBLANK/) { <br>
system &quot;sound-on&quot;; <br>
$blanked = 0; <br>
} <br>
} <br>
Note that LOCK might come either with or without a preceding
BLANK (depending on whether the lock-timeout is non-zero),
so the above program keeps track of both of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STOPPING GRAPHICS <br>
If xscreensaver is running, but you want it to stop running
screen hacks (e.g., if you are logged in remotely, and you
want the console to remain locked but just be black, with
<br>
no graphics processes running) you can accomplish that by
simply powering down the monitor remotely. In a minute or
so, xscreensaver will notice that the monitor is off, and
<br>
will stop running screen hacks. You can power off the
monitor like so: <br>
xset dpms force off <br>
See the xset(1) manual for more info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also use
xscreensaver-demo(1) to make the monitor power down after a
few hours, meaning that xscreensaver will run graphics until
it has been idle for the length of time <br>
you specified; and after that, the monitor will power off,
and screen hacks will stop being run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
If an error occurs while communicating with the xscreensaver
daemon, or if the daemon reports an error, a diagnostic
message will be printed to stderr, and xscreensaver-command
<br>
will exit with a non-zero value. If the command is accepted,
an indication of this will be printed to stdout, and the
exit value will be zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DISPLAY to get the host and display number of the screen
whose saver is to be manipulated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH to find the executable to
restart (for the -restart command). Note that this variable
is consulted in the environment of the xscreensaver process,
not the xscreensaver- <br>
command process.</p>
