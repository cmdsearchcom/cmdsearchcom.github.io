xscreensaver-command - control a running xscreensaver process

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <i>xscreensaver-command</i> program controls a running <i>xscreensaver</i>
  process by sending it client-messages.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>xscreensaver</b>(1) has a client-server model: the xscreensaver process is a
  daemon that runs in the background; it is controlled by other foreground
  programs such as <i>xscreensaver-command</i> and <b>xscreensaver-demo</b>(1).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This program, <i>xscreensaver-command</i>, is a command-line-oriented tool; the
  <b>xscreensaver-demo</b>(1). program is a graphical tool.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<i>xscreensaver-command</i> accepts the following command-line options:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-help</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Prints a brief summary of command-line options.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-demo</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This just launches the <b>xscreensaver-demo</b>(1) program,
      in which one can experiment with the various graphics hacks available, and
      edit parameters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-demo <i></i><i>number</i><i></i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When the <i>-demo</i> option is followed by an integer, it
      instructs the <i>xscreensaver</i> daemon to run that hack, and wait for
      the user to click the mouse before deactivating (i.e., mouse motion does
      not deactivate.) This is the mechanism by which
      <b>xscreensaver-demo</b>(1) communicates with the <b>xscreensaver</b>(1)
      daemon. (The first hack in the list is numbered 1, not 0.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-prefs</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Like the no-argument form of <i>-demo</i>, but brings up
      that program's Preferences panel by default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-activate</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Tell xscreensaver to turn on immediately (that is, blank
      the screen, as if the user had been idle for long enough.) The screensaver
      will deactivate as soon as there is any user activity, as usual.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    It is useful to run this from a menu; you may wish to run it as
    <pre>
sleep 5 ; xscreensaver-command -activate
    </pre>
    to be sure that you have time to take your hand off the mouse before the
      screensaver comes on. (Because if you jiggle the mouse, xscreensaver will
      notice, and deactivate.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-deactivate</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This tells xscreensaver to pretend that there has just been
      user activity. This means that if the screensaver is active (the screen is
      blanked), then this command will cause the screen to un-blank as if there
      had been keyboard or mouse activity. If the screen is locked, then the
      password dialog will pop up first, as usual. If the screen is not blanked,
      then this simulated user activity will re-start the countdown (so, issuing
      the <i>-deactivate</i> command periodically is <i>one</i> way to prevent
      the screen from blanking.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-cycle</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the screensaver is active (the screen is blanked), then
      stop the current graphics demo and run a new one (chosen randomly.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-next</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is like either <i>-activate</i> or <i>-cycle</i>,
      depending on which is more appropriate, except that the graphics hack that
      will be run is the next one in the list, instead of a randomly-chosen one.
      In other words, repeatedly executing -next will cause the xscreensaver
      process to invoke each graphics demo sequentially. (Though using the
      <i>-demo</i> option is probably an easier way to accomplish that.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-prev</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is like <i>-next</i>, but cycles in the other
      direction.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-select <i>number</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Like <i>-activate</i>, but runs the <i>N</i>th element in
      the list of hacks. By knowing what is in the <i>programs</i> list, and in
      what order, you can use this to activate the screensaver with a particular
      graphics demo. (The first element in the list is numbered 1, not 0.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-exit</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Causes the xscreensaver process to exit gracefully. This
      does nothing if the display is currently locked.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>Warning:</b> never use <i>kill -9</i> with <i>xscreensaver</i> while the
      screensaver is active. If you are using a virtual root window manager,
      that can leave things in an inconsistent state, and you may need to
      restart your window manager to repair the damage.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-lock</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Tells the running xscreensaver process to lock the screen
      immediately. This is like <i>-activate</i>, but forces locking as well,
      even if locking is not the default (that is, even if xscreensaver's
      <i>lock</i> resource is false, and even if the <i>lockTimeout</i> resource
      is non-zero.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that locking doesn't work unless the <i>xscreensaver</i> process is
      running as you. See <b>xscreensaver</b>(1) for details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-version</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Prints the version of xscreensaver that is currently
      running on the display: that is, the actual version number of the running
      xscreensaver background process, rather than the version number of
      xscreensaver-command. (To see the version number of
      <i>xscreensaver-command</i> itself, use the <i>-help</i> option.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-time</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Prints the time at which the screensaver last activated or
      deactivated (roughly, how long the user has been idle or non-idle: but not
      quite, since it only tells you when the screen became blanked or
      un-blanked.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-restart</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Causes the screensaver process to exit and then restart
      with the same command line arguments as last time. You shouldn't really
      need to do this, since xscreensaver notices when the <i>.xscreensaver</i>
      file has changed and re-reads it as needed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-watch</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Prints a line each time the screensaver changes state: when
      the screen blanks, locks, unblanks, or when the running hack is changed.
      This option never returns; it is intended for use by shell scripts that
      want to react to the screensaver in some way. An example of its output
      would be:
    <pre>
BLANK Fri Nov  5 01:57:22 1999
RUN 34
RUN 79
RUN 16
LOCK Fri Nov  5 01:57:22 1999
RUN 76
RUN 12
UNBLANK Fri Nov  5 02:05:59 1999
    </pre>
    The above shows the screensaver activating, running three different hacks,
      then locking (perhaps because the lock-timeout went off) then unblanking
      (because the user became active, and typed the correct password.) The hack
      numbers are their index in the `programs' list (starting with 1, not 0, as
      for the <i>-select</i> command.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example, suppose you want to run a program that turns down the volume on
      your machine when the screen blanks, and turns it back up when the screen
      un-blanks. You could do that by running a Perl program like the following
      in the background. The following program tracks the output of the
      <i>-watch</i> command and reacts accordingly:
    <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
<div class="Pp"></div>
my $blanked = 0;
open (IN, &quot;xscreensaver-command -watch |&quot;);
while (&lt;IN&gt;) {
    if (m/^(BLANK|LOCK)/) {
        if (!$blanked) {
            system &quot;sound-off&quot;;
            $blanked = 1;
        }
    } elsif (m/^UNBLANK/) {
        system &quot;sound-on&quot;;
        $blanked = 0;
    }
}
    </pre>
    Note that LOCK might come either with or without a preceding BLANK
      (depending on whether the lock-timeout is non-zero), so the above program
      keeps track of both of them.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="STOPPING_GRAPHICS"><a class="selflink" href="#STOPPING_GRAPHICS">STOPPING
  GRAPHICS</a></h1>
If xscreensaver is running, but you want it to stop running screen hacks (e.g.,
  if you are logged in remotely, and you want the console to remain locked but
  just be black, with no graphics processes running) you can accomplish that by
  simply powering down the monitor remotely. In a minute or so, xscreensaver
  will notice that the monitor is off, and will stop running screen hacks. You
  can power off the monitor like so:
<pre>
xset dpms force off
</pre>
See the <b>xset</b>(1) manual for more info.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can also use <b>xscreensaver-demo</b>(1) to make the monitor power down
  after a few hours, meaning that xscreensaver will run graphics until it has
  been idle for the length of time you specified; and after that, the monitor
  will power off, and screen hacks will stop being run.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DIAGNOSTICS"><a class="selflink" href="#DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</a></h1>
If an error occurs while communicating with the <i>xscreensaver</i> daemon, or
  if the daemon reports an error, a diagnostic message will be printed to
  stderr, and <i>xscreensaver-command</i> will exit with a non-zero value. If
  the command is accepted, an indication of this will be printed to stdout, and
  the exit value will be zero.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>DISPLAY</b></dt>

  <dd class="It-tag">to find the executable to restart (for the <i>-restart</i>
