<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
yum filter data plugin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
yum [options] [command] [package ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This plugin extends yum with some options, currently just
for &quot;update&quot; and &quot;list update&quot; type
commands, to allow filters to be placed on which packages
should be used based on <br>
the data in those packages. Note that due to some of the
data being unknown, and thus could possibly match, all
unknown data is treated as a match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL OPTIONS <br>
These are the options added to yum that are available in the
&quot;list updates&quot;, &quot;info updates&quot;,
&quot;check-update&quot; and &quot;update&quot; commands.
They are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--filter-vendors <br>
This option includes packages which have a vendor which
matches one of the passed vendor wildcard strings, or is
unknown. Note that vendors can have spaces in their value,
<br>
so &quot;,&quot; is the only way to specify multiple vendors
as one option argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--filter-rpm-groups <br>
This option includes packages which have a group which
matches one of the passed rpm group wildcard strings, or is
unknown. Note that rpm groups can have spaces in their <br>
value, so &quot;,&quot; is the only way to specify multiple
rpm groups as one option argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--filter-packagers <br>
This option includes packages which have a packager which
matches one of the passed packager wildcard strings, or is
unknown. Note that vendors can have spaces in their <br>
value, so &quot;,&quot; is the only way to specify multiple
packagers as one option argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--filter-licenses <br>
This option includes packages which have a license which
matches one of the passed license wildcard strings, or is
unknown. Note that licenses can have spaces in their <br>
value, so &quot;,&quot; is the only way to specify multiple
licenses as one option argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--filter-arches <br>
This option includes packages which have a arch which
matches one of the passed arch wildcard strings, or is
unknown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--filter-committers <br>
This option includes packages which have a committer which
matches one of the passed committer wildcard strings, or is
unknown. Note that committers can have spaces in <br>
their value, so &quot;,&quot; is the only way to specify
multiple committers as one option argument. Also, committer
values are so loosely formed that they could contain commas
too, <br>
it is recommended to not do that but you can work around it
by using &quot;?&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--filter-buildhosts <br>
This option includes packages which have a buildhost which
matches one of the passed buildhost wildcard strings, or is
unknown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--filter-urls <br>
This option includes packages which have a url which matches
one of the passed url wildcard strings, or is unknown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--filter-package-sizes <br>
This option includes packages which have a packagesize which
is within one of the passed packagesize ranges, or is
unknown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--filter-archive-sizes <br>
This option includes packages which have a archivesize which
is within one of the passed archivesize ranges, or is
unknown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--filter-installed-sizes <br>
This option includes packages which have a installedsize
which is within one of the passed installedsize ranges, or
is unknown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--filter-groups <br>
This option includes packages which are in a yum group which
matches one of the passed yum group id strings, or is
unknown. Note that yum groups can have spaces in their <br>
value, so &quot;,&quot; is the only way to specify multiple
yum groups as one option argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Currently yum can&rsquo;t filter packages in all of the
commands, so for instance &quot;yum list
&rsquo;yum*&rsquo;&quot; doesn&rsquo;t get the results
filtered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Apart from that there are no
bugs, but should you find any, you should first consult the
FAQ section on http://yum.baseurl.org/wiki/Faq and if
unsuccessful in finding a resolu&acirc; <br>
tion contact the mailing list: yum-devel@lists.baseurl.org.
To file a bug use http://bugzilla.redhat.com for
Fedora/RHEL/Centos related bugs and
http://yum.baseurl.org/report <br>
for all other bugs.</p>
