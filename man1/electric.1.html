<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
electric - a VLSI design system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
electric [OPTIONS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Electric is a general purpose system for all electrical
design. It currently knows about nMOS, CMOS, Bipolar,
artwork, schematics, printed-circuit boards, and many other
tech&acirc; <br>
nologies. It has a large set of tools including multiple
design-rule checkers (both incremental and hierarchical), an
electrical rules checker, over a dozen simulator
inter&acirc; <br>
faces, multiple generators (PLA and pad frame), multiple
routers (stitching, maze, river), network comparison,
compaction, compensation, a VHDL compiler, and a silicon
compiler <br>
that places-and-routes standard cells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the text terminal
used to invoke the program, Electric uses a color display
with a mouse as a work station. Separate windows are used
for text and graphics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a library disk file is
mentioned on the command line, that file is read as the
initial design for editing. In addition, the following
switches are recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPRESENTATION <br>
Circuits are represented as networks that contain nodes and
connecting arcs. The nodes are electrical components such as
transistors, logic gates, and contacts. The arcs are <br>
simply wires that connect the nodes. In addition, each node
has a set of ports which are the sites of arc connection. A
technology, then, is simply a set of primitive nodes and
<br>
arcs that are the building blocks of circuits designed in
that environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Collections of nodes and arcs
can also be aggregated into facets of cells which can be
used higher in the hierarchy to act as nodes. These
user-defined nodes have ports that <br>
come from internal nodes whose ports are exported. Facets
are collected in libraries which contain a hierarchically
consistent design.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arcs have properties that help
constrain the design. For example, an arc may rotate
arbitrarily or be fixed in their angle. Arcs can also be
stretchable or rigid under modifi&acirc; <br>
cation of their connecting nodes. These constraints
propagate hierarchically from the bottom-up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TECHNOLOGIES <br>
A large set of technologies is provided in Electric. These
can be modified with the technology editor, or completely
new technologies can be created. The following paragraphs
<br>
describe some of the basic technologies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The nMOS technologies have arcs
available in Metal, Polysilicon, and Diffusion. The
primitive nodes include normal contacts, buried contacts,
transistors, and &quot;pins&quot; for making <br>
arc corners. Transistors may be serpentine and the pure
layer nodes may be polygonally described with the node trace
command. The &quot;nmos&quot; technology has the standard
Mead&amp;Conway <br>
design rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The CMOS technologies have arcs
available in Metal, Polysilicon, and Diffusion. The
Diffusion arcs may be found in a P-well implant or in a P+
implant. Thus, there are two <br>
types of metal-to-diffusion contacts, two types of diffusion
pins, and two types of transistors: in P-well and in P+
implant. As with nMOS, the transistors may be serpentine and
<br>
the pure layer primitives may be polygonally defined. The
&quot;cmos&quot; technology has the standard design rules
according to Griswold; the &quot;mocmos&quot; technology has
design rules for the <br>
MOSIS CMOS process (double metal); the &quot;mocmossub&quot;
technology has design rules for the MOSIS CMOS Submicron
process (double poly and up to 6 metal); the
&quot;rcmos&quot; technology has <br>
round geometry for the MOSIS CMOS process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;schematic&quot;
technology provides basic symbols for doing schematic
capture. It contains the logic symbols: BUFFER, AND, OR, and
XOR. Negating bubbles can be placed by negat&acirc; <br>
ing a connecting arc. There are also more complex components
such as flip-flop, off-page-connector, black-box, meter, and
power source. Finally, there are the electrical compo&acirc;
<br>
nents: transistor, resistor, diode, capacitor, and inductor.
Two arc types exist for normal wires and variable-width
busses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;artwork&quot;
technology is a sketchpad environment for doing
general-purpose graphics. Components can be placed with
arbitrary color and shape.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;generic&quot;
technology exists for those miscellaneous purposes that do
not fall into the domain of other technologies. It has the
universal arc and pin which can connect to <br>
ANY other object and are therefore useful in
mixed-technology designs. The invisible arc can be used for
constraining two nodes without making a connection. The
unrouted arc <br>
can be used for electrical connections that are to be routed
later with real wires. The facet-center primitive, when
placed in a facet, defines the cursor origin on instances of
<br>
that facet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESIGN-RULE CHECKING <br>
The incremental design-rule checker is normally on and
watches all changes made to the circuit. It does not correct
but prints error messages when design rules are violated.
<br>
Hierarchy is not handled, so the contents of subfacets are
not checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hierarchical checker looks
all the way down the circuit for all design-rules. Another
option allows an input deck to prepared for ECAD&rsquo;s
Dracula design-rule checker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPACTION <br>
The compactor attempts to reduce the size of a facet by
removing unnecessary space between elements. When invoked it
will compact in the vertical and horizontal directions until
<br>
it can find no way to compact the facet any further. It does
not do hierarchical compaction, does not guarantee optimal
compaction, nor can it handle non-manhattan geometry <br>
properly. The compactor will also spread out the facet to
guarantee no design-rule violations, if the
&quot;spread&quot; option is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIMULATION <br>
There are many simulator interfaces: ESIM (the default
simulator: switch-level for nMOS without timing), RSIM
(switch-level for MOS with timing), RNL (switch-level for
MOS with <br>
timing and LISP front-end), MOSSIM (switch-level for MOS
with timing), COSMOS (switch-level for MOS with timing),
VERILOG (Cadence simulator), TEXSIM (a commercial
simulator), <br>
SILOS (a commercial simulator), ABEL (PAL
generator/simulator for schematic), and SPICE (circuit
level). MOSSIM, COSMOS, VERILOG, TEXSIM, SILOS, and ABEL do
not actually simu&acirc; <br>
late: they only write an input deck of your circuit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In preparation for most
simulators, it is necessary to export those ports that you
wish to manipulate or examine. You must also export power
and ground ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In preparation for SPICE
simulation, you must export power and ground signals and.
explicitly connect them to source nodes. The source should
then be parameterized to indicate <br>
the amount and whether it is voltage or current. For
example, to make a 5 volt supply, create a source node and
set the SPICE card to: &quot;DC 5&quot;. Next, all input
ports must be <br>
exported and connected to the positive side of sources.
Next, all values that are being plotted must be exported and
have meter nodes placed on them. The node should have the
<br>
top and bottom ports connected appropriately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLA GENERATION <br>
There are two PLA generators, one specific to nMOS layout,
and another specific to CMOS layout. The nMOS PLA generator
reads a single personality table and generates the array
<br>
and all driving circuitry including power and ground
connections. The CMOS PLA generator reads two personality
tables (AND and OR) and also reads a library of PLA helper
compo&acirc; <br>
nents (called &quot;pla_mocmos&quot;) and generates the
array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ROUTING <br>
The router is able to do river routing, maze routing, and
simple facet stitching (the explicit wiring of implicitly
connected nodes that abut). River routing runs a bus of
wires <br>
between the two opposite sides of a routing channel. The
connections on each side must be in a line so that the bus
runs between two parallel sets of points. You must use the
<br>
Unrouted arc from the Generic technology to indicate the
ports to be connected. The river router can also connect
wires to the perpendicular sides of the routing channel if
one <br>
or more Unrouted wires cross these sides.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two stitching modes:
auto stitching and mimic stitching. In auto stitching, all
ports that physically touch will be stitched. Mimic
stitching watches arcs that are <br>
created by the user and adds similar ones at other places in
the facet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NETWORK COMPARISON <br>
The network maintainer tool is able to compare the networks
in the two facets being displayed on the screen. Once
compared, nodes in one facet can be equated with nodes in
the <br>
other. If the two networks are automorphic or otherwise
difficult to distinguish, equivalence information can be
specified prior to comparison by selecting a component in
the <br>
first facet then selecting a component in the second
facet.</p>
