Electric is a general purpose system for all electrical design. It currently
  knows about nMOS, CMOS, Bipolar, artwork, schematics, printed-circuit boards,
  and many other technologies. It has a large set of tools including multiple
  design-rule checkers (both incremental and hierarchical), an electrical rules
  checker, over a dozen simulator interfaces, multiple generators (PLA and pad
  frame), multiple routers (stitching, maze, river), network comparison,
  compaction, compensation, a VHDL compiler, and a silicon compiler that
  places-and-routes standard cells.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition to the text terminal used to invoke the program, Electric uses a
  color display with a mouse as a work station. Separate windows are used for
  text and graphics.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a <i>library</i> disk file is mentioned on the command line, that file is
  read as the initial design for editing. In addition, the following switches
  are recognized:

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="REPRESENTATION"><a class="selflink" href="#REPRESENTATION">REPRESENTATION</a></h1>
Circuits are represented as networks that contain <i>nodes</i> and connecting
  <i>arcs</i>. The nodes are electrical components such as transistors, logic
  gates, and contacts. The arcs are simply wires that connect the nodes. In
  addition, each node has a set of <i>ports</i> which are the sites of arc
  connection. A <i>technology</i>, then, is simply a set of primitive nodes and
  arcs that are the building blocks of circuits designed in that environment.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Collections of nodes and arcs can also be aggregated into <i>facets</i> of
  <i>cells</i> which can be used higher in the hierarchy to act as nodes. These
  user-defined nodes have ports that come from internal nodes whose ports are
  <i>exported</i>. Facets are collected in <i>libraries</i> which contain a
  hierarchically consistent design.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Arcs have properties that help constrain the design. For example, an arc may
  rotate arbitrarily or be fixed in their angle. Arcs can also be stretchable or
  <i>rigid</i> under modification of their connecting nodes. These constraints
  propagate hierarchically from the bottom-up.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TECHNOLOGIES"><a class="selflink" href="#TECHNOLOGIES">TECHNOLOGIES</a></h1>
A large set of technologies is provided in Electric. These can be modified with
  the technology editor, or completely new technologies can be created. The
  following paragraphs describe some of the basic technologies.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The nMOS technologies have arcs available in Metal, Polysilicon, and Diffusion.
  The primitive nodes include normal contacts, buried contacts, transistors, and
  &quot;pins&quot; for making arc corners. Transistors may be serpentine and the
  pure layer nodes may be polygonally described with the <b>node trace</b>
  command. The &quot;nmos&quot; technology has the standard Mead&amp;Conway
  design rules.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The CMOS technologies have arcs available in Metal, Polysilicon, and Diffusion.
  The Diffusion arcs may be found in a P-well implant or in a P+ implant. Thus,
  there are two types of metal-to-diffusion contacts, two types of diffusion
  pins, and two types of transistors: in P-well and in P+ implant. As with nMOS,
  the transistors may be serpentine and the pure layer primitives may be
  polygonally defined. The &quot;cmos&quot; technology has the standard design
  rules according to Griswold; the &quot;mocmos&quot; technology has design
  rules for the MOSIS CMOS process (double metal); the &quot;mocmossub&quot;
  technology has design rules for the MOSIS CMOS Submicron process (double poly
  and up to 6 metal); the &quot;rcmos&quot; technology has round geometry for
  the MOSIS CMOS process.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;schematic&quot; technology provides basic symbols for doing schematic
  capture. It contains the logic symbols: BUFFER, AND, OR, and XOR. Negating
  bubbles can be placed by negating a connecting arc. There are also more
  complex components such as flip-flop, off-page-connector, black-box, meter,
  and power source. Finally, there are the electrical components: transistor,
  resistor, diode, capacitor, and inductor. Two arc types exist for normal wires
  and variable-width busses.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;artwork&quot; technology is a sketchpad environment for doing
  general-purpose graphics. Components can be placed with arbitrary color and
  shape.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;generic&quot; technology exists for those miscellaneous purposes that
  do not fall into the domain of other technologies. It has the universal arc
  and pin which can connect to ANY other object and are therefore useful in
  mixed-technology designs. The invisible arc can be used for constraining two
  nodes without making a connection. The unrouted arc can be used for electrical
  connections that are to be routed later with real wires. The facet-center
  primitive, when placed in a facet, defines the cursor origin on instances of
  that facet.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESIGN-RULE_CHECKING"><a class="selflink" href="#DESIGN-RULE_CHECKING">DESIGN-RULE
  CHECKING</a></h1>
The incremental design-rule checker is normally on and watches all changes made
  to the circuit. It does not correct but prints error messages when design
  rules are violated. Hierarchy is not handled, so the contents of subfacets are
  not checked.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The hierarchical checker looks all the way down the circuit for all
  design-rules. Another option allows an input deck to prepared for ECAD's
  Dracula design-rule checker.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMPACTION"><a class="selflink" href="#COMPACTION">COMPACTION</a></h1>
The compactor attempts to reduce the size of a facet by removing unnecessary
  space between elements. When invoked it will compact in the vertical and
  horizontal directions until it can find no way to compact the facet any
  further. It does not do hierarchical compaction, does not guarantee optimal
  compaction, nor can it handle non-manhattan geometry properly. The compactor
  will also spread out the facet to guarantee no design-rule violations, if the
  &quot;spread&quot; option is set.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SIMULATION"><a class="selflink" href="#SIMULATION">SIMULATION</a></h1>
There are many simulator interfaces: ESIM (the default simulator: switch-level
  for nMOS without timing), RSIM (switch-level for MOS with timing), RNL
  (switch-level for MOS with timing and LISP front-end), MOSSIM (switch-level
  for MOS with timing), COSMOS (switch-level for MOS with timing), VERILOG
  (Cadence simulator), TEXSIM (a commercial simulator), SILOS (a commercial
  simulator), ABEL (PAL generator/simulator for schematic), and SPICE (circuit
  level). MOSSIM, COSMOS, VERILOG, TEXSIM, SILOS, and ABEL do not actually
  simulate: they only write an input deck of your circuit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In preparation for most simulators, it is necessary to export those ports that
  you wish to manipulate or examine. You must also export power and ground
  ports.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In preparation for SPICE simulation, you must export power and ground signals
  and. explicitly connect them to source nodes. The source should then be
  parameterized to indicate the amount and whether it is voltage or current. For
  example, to make a 5 volt supply, create a source node and set the SPICE card
  to: &quot;DC 5&quot;. Next, all input ports must be exported and connected to
  the positive side of sources. Next, all values that are being plotted must be
  exported and have meter nodes placed on them. The node should have the top and
  bottom ports connected appropriately.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PLA_GENERATION"><a class="selflink" href="#PLA_GENERATION">PLA
  GENERATION</a></h1>
There are two PLA generators, one specific to nMOS layout, and another specific
  to CMOS layout. The nMOS PLA generator reads a single personality table and
  generates the array and all driving circuitry including power and ground
  connections. The CMOS PLA generator reads two personality tables (AND and OR)
  and also reads a library of PLA helper components (called
  &quot;pla_mocmos&quot;) and generates the array.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ROUTING"><a class="selflink" href="#ROUTING">ROUTING</a></h1>
The router is able to do river routing, maze routing, and simple facet stitching
  (the explicit wiring of implicitly connected nodes that abut). River routing
  runs a bus of wires between the two opposite sides of a routing channel. The
  connections on each side must be in a line so that the bus runs between two
  parallel sets of points. You must use the Unrouted arc from the Generic
  technology to indicate the ports to be connected. The river router can also
  connect wires to the perpendicular sides of the routing channel if one or more
  Unrouted wires cross these sides.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are two stitching modes: auto stitching and mimic stitching. In auto
  stitching, all ports that physically touch will be stitched. Mimic stitching
  watches arcs that are created by the user and adds similar ones at other
  places in the facet.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NETWORK_COMPARISON"><a class="selflink" href="#NETWORK_COMPARISON">NETWORK
  COMPARISON</a></h1>
The network maintainer tool is able to compare the networks in the two facets
  being displayed on the screen. Once compared, nodes in one facet can be
  equated with nodes in the other. If the two networks are automorphic or
  otherwise difficult to distinguish, equivalence information can be specified
  prior to comparison by selecting a component in the first facet then selecting
  a component in the second facet.
