<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pamflip - flip or rotate a PAM or PNM image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pamflip { -leftright | -lr | -topbottom | -tb | -transpose |
-xy | -rotate90 | -r90 | -cw | -rotate270 | -r270 | -ccw |
-rotate180 | -r180 -null | -xform=xform1,xform2... } <br>
[-memsize=mebibytes] [-pagesize=bytes] [pamfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options can be abbreviated
to their shortest unique prefix. You may use two hyphens
instead of one to designate an option. You may use either
white space or an equals sign <br>
between an option name and its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamflip flips a PAM or PNM image
top for bottom or left for right, or transposes it
horizontal for vertical, or rotates it 1, 2, or 3 quarter
turns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To rotate at other angles, use
pnmrotate. It is much slower, though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The input image is pamfile, or
Standard Input if pamfile is not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To flip/rotate a JFIF (JPEG)
image losslessly, use jpegtran. jpegtran is part of the
Independent Jpeg Group&rsquo;s compression library package,
not part of Netpbm. The normal Netpbm <br>
way to flip a JFIF file would be to convert it to PNM, use
pamflip, and convert back to JFIF. But since JPEG
compression is lossy, the resulting image would have less
quality <br>
than the original. jpegtran, on the other hand, can do this
particular transformation directly on the compressed data
without loss.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
You must supply exactly one of the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamflip&rsquo;s predecessor
(before Netpbm 10.7 - August 2002) pnmflip did not have the
-xform option and instead allowed you to specify any number
of the other options, including <br>
zero. It applied all the indicated transformations, in the
order given, just like with pamflip&rsquo;s -xform option.
(Reason for the change: this kind of interpretation of
options <br>
is inconsistent with the rest of Netpbm and most of the Unix
world, and thus hard to understand and to implement).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-leftright</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lr Flip left for right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-topbottom</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tb Flip top for bottom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-transpose</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xy Transpose horizontal for
vertical. I.e. make the pixel at (x,y) be at (y,x).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rotate90</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r90</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ccw Rotate counterclockwise 90
degrees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rotate180</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r180 Rotate 180 degrees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rotate270</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r270</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cw Rotate counterclockwise 270
degrees (clockwise 90 degrees)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-null No change. (The purpose of
this option is the convenience of programs that invoke
pamflip after computing the kind of transformation desired,
including none at all).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.13 (December 2002).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xform=xform1,xform2... <br>
Apply all the transforms listed, in order. The valid values
for the transforms are as follows and have the same meanings
as the identically named options above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; leftright</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; topbottom</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; transpose</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.13 (December 2002).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options help
pamflip use memory efficiently. Some flipping operations on
very large images can cause pamflip to have a very large
working set, which means if you <br>
don&rsquo;t have enough real memory, the program can page
thrash, which means it takes a ridiculous amount time to
run. If your entire image fits in real memory, you
don&rsquo;t have a <br>
problem. If you&rsquo;re just flipping top for bottom or
left for right, you don&rsquo;t have a problem. Otherwise,
pay attention. If you&rsquo;re interested in the details of
the thrashing <br>
problem and how pamflip approaches it, you&rsquo;re invited
to read a complete explanation in comments in the source
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-memsize=mebibytes <br>
mebibytes is the size in mebibytes (aka megabytes) of memory
available for pamflip. It is the lesser of the amount of
real or virtual memory available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamflip does nothing special to
allocate real memory or control it&rsquo;s allocation -- it
gets whatever it gets just by referencing virtual memory
normally. The real memory <br>
figure in question is the maximum amount that pamflip can be
expected to end up with by doing that. This is just about
impossible for you to know, of course, but you can <br>
estimate. The total real memory in your system should be a
major factor in your estimate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If pamflip cannot fit the entire
image in the amount of memory you specify, it does the
transformation in chunks, using temporary files for
intermediate results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Strict horizontal
transformations (either left for right or null), pamflip
never keeps more than one row in memory, so the memory size
is irrelevant and pamflip doesn&rsquo;t <br>
use temporary files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The real memory is important
when you do a column for row type of transformation (e.g.
-rotate90). In that case, even if pamflip can fit the entire
image in virtual mem&acirc; <br>
ory at once, if it does not also fit in real memory, the
program will thrash like crazy because of the order in which
pamflip accesses the pixels, and that means it will <br>
take a ridiculously long time to run. A proper -memsize
drastically reduces the paging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify -memsize too
large, pamflip may attempt to get more virtual memory than
the system allows it and fail. If it can get the virtual
memory, but -memsize is <br>
larger than the amount of real memory the system allows it
and the transformation is row for column, it will page
thrash and run very slowly. A value even slightly too <br>
high is the same as infinity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify -memsize too
small, the program will run slightly more slowly due to
extra overhead in manipulating temporary files. Also, if
your environment isn&rsquo;t set up <br>
to make temporary files possible, pamflip will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Doing the entire transformation
&rsquo;in memory&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t speed things up as
much as you might think, because even with the temporary
files, the data is just as likely to be in <br>
memory. Virtual memory gets paged to disk and disk files get
cached in memory. In fact, the pixels fit much more
compactly into memory when stored in a temporary file <br>
than when stored &rsquo;in memory&rsquo; because pamflip
uses a more efficient format. So you&rsquo;re likely to have
less disk I/O when you allow pamflip less memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not specify -memsize,
pamflip assumes infinity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option did not exist before
Netpbm 10.7 (August 2002).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 10.42 (March
2008), this option applied only to real memory. pamflip
would always keep the entire image in virtual memory and if
it could not get enough <br>
virtual memory, it failed. pamflip accessed the pixels in an
order designed to keep real memory use within the specified
amount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pagesize=bytes <br>
bytes is the size in bytes of a paging unit -- the amount of
memory that gets paged in or out as an indivisible unit --
in your system. The default is 4KiB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 10.42 (March
2008), pamflip used it to control its use of real
memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option did not exist before
Netpbm 10.7 (August 2002).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
This option causes pamflip to issue messages to Standard
Error about its progress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
pamflip replaced pnmflip in Netpbm 10.13 (December 2002).
pamflip is backward compatible, but also works on PAM
images.</p>
