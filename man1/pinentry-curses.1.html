<p>PINENTRY-CURSES(1) General Commands Manual
PINENTRY-CURSES(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pinentry-curses - PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for
GnuPG</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pinentry-curses [OPTION...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pinentry-curses is a program that allows for secure entry of
PINs or pass phrases. That means it tries to take care that
the entered information is not swapped to disk or
tempo&acirc; <br>
rarily stored anywhere. This functionality is particularly
useful for entering pass phrases when using encryption
software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using the same. It
<br>
uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
particular software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pinentry-curses implements a PIN
entry dialog using the curses tool kit, meaning that it is
useful for users working in text mode without the X Window
System. There are other <br>
flavors that implement PIN entry dialogs that use an X tool
kit. If you have installed any of the latter programs then
this program is not necessary because the X flavors
auto&acirc; <br>
matically fall back to text mode if X is not active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pinentry-curses is typically
used internally by gpg-agent. Users don&rsquo;t normally
have a reason to call it directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--version <br>
Print the program version and licensing information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Print a usage message
summarizing the most useful command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug, -d <br>
Turn on some debugging. Mostly useful for the maintainers.
Note that this may reveal sensitive information like the
entered pass phrase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enhanced, -e <br>
Ask for timeouts and insurance, too. Note that this is
currently not fully supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-global-grab, -g <br>
Grab the keyboard only when the window is focused. Use this
option if you are debugging software using pinentry-curses;
otherwise you may not be able to to access your X <br>
session anymore (unless you have other means to connect to
the machine to kill pinentry-curses).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--parent-wid N <br>
Use window ID N as the parent window for positioning the
window. Note, that this is not fully supported by all
flavors of pinentry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--display STRING, --ttyname
STRING, --ttytype STRING, --lc-type STRING, --lc-messages
STRING <br>
These options are used to pass localization information to
pinentry-curses. They are required because pinentry-curses
is usually called by some background process which <br>
does not have any information on the locale and terminal to
use. Assuan protocol options are an alternative way to pass
these information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
pinentry-gtk-2(1), pinentry-qt(1), pinentry-gnome3(1),
pinentry-tty(1), gpg(1), gpg-agent(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The full documentation for
pinentry-curses is maintained as a Texinfo manual. If the
pinentry-doc package is installed, the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info pinentry</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">should give you access to the
complete manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>

Debian project.</p>
