<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ccomps - connected components filter for graphs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ccomps [ -sxvenzC? ] [ -X[#]s[-f] ] [ -ooutfile ] [ files
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ccomps decomposes graphs into their connected components,
printing the components to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Do not induce edges in the
connected components.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s No output graph is printed.
The return value can be used to check if the graph is
connected or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Only the connected components
are printed, as separate graphs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Counts of nodes, edges and
connected components are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Sort components by size, with
the largest first. This is only effective if either -x or
-X# is present. Thus, -zX#0 will cause the largest component
to be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Use clusters in computing
components in addition to normal edge connectivity. In
essence, this gives the connected components of the derived
graph in which nodes top-level <br>
clusters and nodes in the original graph. This maintains all
subgraph structure within a component, even if a subgraph
does not contain any nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Do not project subgraph
structure. Normally, if ccomps produces components as graphs
distinct from the input graph, it will define subgraphs
which are projections of sub&acirc; <br>
graphs of the input graph onto the component. (If the
projection is empty, no subgraph is produced.) If this flag
is set, the component contains only the relevant nodes <br>
and edges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X node_name <br>
Prints only the component containing the node node_name, if
any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X# start</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X# start-</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X# start-last <br>
Prints only components in the given range. In the first
form, only the component whose index is start, if any, is
printed. In the second form, each component whose index <br>
is at least start is printed. In the last form, only those
components whose indices are in the range [Istart,last] are
printed. Thus, the flag -x is equivalent to -X#0-.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o outfile <br>
If specified, each graph will be written to a different file
with the names derived from outfile. In particular, if both
-o and -x flags are used, then each connected com&acirc;
<br>
ponent is written to a different file. If outfile does not
have a suffix, the first file will have the name outfile;
then next outfile_1, then next outfile_2, and so on. <br>
If outfile has a suffix, i.e., has the form base.sfx, then
the files will be named base.sfx, base_1.sfx, base_2.sfx,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, each input graph is
printed, with each connected component given as a subgraph
whose name is a concatenation of the name of the input
graph, the string &quot;_cc_&quot; and the <br>
number of the component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand is supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">files Names of files containing
1 or more graphs in dot format. If no files operand is
specified, the standard input will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN CODES <br>
Unless used to extract a single connected component, ccomps
returns 0 if all the input graphs are connected; and
non-zero if any graph has multiple components, or any error
<br>
occurred. If just extracting a single component, ccomps
returns 0 on success and non-zero if an error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
It is possible, though unlikely, that the names used for
connected components and their subgraphs may conflict with
existing subgraph names.</p>
