ncftp - Browser program for the File Transfer Protocol
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>ncftp</b> [<i>host</i>]
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ncftp</b> [<i>ftp://host.name/directory/</i>]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The purpose of <i>ncftp</i> is to provide a powerful and flexible interface to
  the Internet standard <i>File Transfer Protocol</i>. It is intended to replace
  the stock <i>ftp</i> program that comes with the system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Although the program appears to be rather spartan, you'll find that <i>ncftp</i>
  has a wealth of valuable performance and usage features. The program was
  designed with an emphasis on usability, and it does as much as it can for you
  automatically so you can do what you expect to do with a file transfer
  program, which is transfer files between two interconnected systems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some of the cooler features include progress meters, filename completion,
  command-line editing, background processing, auto-resume downloads,
  bookmarking, cached directory listings, host redialing, working with firewalls
  and proxies, downloading entire directory trees, etc., etc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>ncftp</i> distribution comes with the useful utility programs
  <i>ncftpget</i>(1) and <i>ncftpput</i>(1) which were designed to do
  command-line FTP. In particular, they are very handy for shell scripts. This
  version of <i>ncftp</i> no longer does command-line FTP, since the main
  <i>ncftp</i> program is more of a browser-type program.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h2>
The program allows you to specify a host or directory URL on the command line.
  This is a synonym for running <i>ncftp</i> and then using the <i>open</i>
  command. A few command-line flags are allowed with this mode:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-u </b><i>XX</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use username <i>XX</i> instead of anonymous.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-p </b><i>XX</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use password <i>XX</i> with the username.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-j </b><i>XX</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use account <i>XX</i> in supplement to the username and
      password (deprecated).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-P </b><i>XX</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use port number <i>XX</i> instead of the default FTP
      service port (21).</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="INTRODUCTION_TO_THE_COMMAND_SHELL"><a class="selflink" href="#INTRODUCTION_TO_THE_COMMAND_SHELL">INTRODUCTION
  TO THE COMMAND SHELL</a></h2>
Upon running the program you are presented a command prompt where you type
  commands to the program's shell. Usually you will want to open a remote
  filesystem to transfer files to and from your local machine's filesystem. To
  do that, you need to know the symbolic name of the remote system, or its
  <i>Internet Protocol</i> (IP) address. For example, a symbolic name might be
  ``typhoon.unl.edu,'' and its IP address could be ``129.93.33.24.'' To open a
  connection to that system, you use the program's <i>open</i> command:
<div style="height: 1.67ex;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
<pre>
open typhoon.unl.edu
open 129.93.33.24
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Both of these try to open the machine called typhoon at the <i>University of
  Nebraska</i>. Using the symbolic name is the preferred way, because IP
  addresses may change without notice, while the symbolic names usually stay the
  same.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you open a remote filesystem, you need to have permission. The <i>FTP
  Protocol</i>'s authentication system is very similar to that of logging in to
  your account. You have to give an account name, and its password for access to
  that account's files. However, most remote systems that have anything you
  might be interested in don't require an account name for use. You can often
  get anonymous access to a remote filesystem and exchange files that have been
  made publicly accessible. The program attempts to get anonymous permission to
  a remote system by default. What actually happens is that the program tries to
  use ``anonymous'' as the account name, and when prompted for a password, uses
  your E-mail address as a courtesy to the remote system's maintainer. You can
  have the program try to use a specific account also. That will be explained
  later.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After the <i>open</i> command completes successfully, you are connected to the
  remote system and logged in. You should now see the command prompt change to
  reflect the name of the current remote directory. To see what's in the current
  remote directory, you can use the program's <i>ls</i> and <i>dir</i> commands.
  The former is terse, preferring more remote files in less screen space, and
  the latter is more verbose, giving detailed information about each item in the
  directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can use the program's <i>cd</i> command to move to other directories on the
  remote system. The cd command behaves very much like the command of the same
  name in the <i>Bourne</i> and <i>Korn</i> shell.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The purpose of the program is to exchange data with other systems. You can use
  the program's <i>get</i> command to copy a file from the remote system to your
  local system:
<div style="height: 1.67ex;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
<pre>
get README.txt
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program will display the progress of the transfer on the screen, so you can
  tell how much needs to be done before the transfer finishes. When the transfer
  does finish, then you can enter more commands to the program's command shell.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can use the program's <i>put</i> command to copy a file from your system to
  the remote system:
<div style="height: 1.67ex;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
<pre>
put something.tar
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you are finished using the remote system, you can open another one or use
  the <i>quit</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before quitting, you may want to save the current FTP session's settings for
  later. You can use the <i>bookmark</i> command to save an entry into your
  $HOME/.ncftp/bookmarks file. When you use the <i>bookmark</i> command, you
  also specify a bookmark name, so the next time instead of opening the full
  hostname you can use the name of the bookmark. A bookmark acts just like one
  for your web browser, so it saves the remote directory you were in, the
  account name you used, etc., and other information it learned so that the next
  time you use the bookmark it should require as little effort from you as
  possible.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">help</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The first command to know is <i>help</i>. If you just

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">from the command shell, the program prints the names of all
      of the supported commands. From there, you can get specific help for a
      command by typing the command after, for example:</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">

  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">prints information about the <i>open</i> command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">ascii</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This command sets the transfer type to ASCII text. This is
      useful for text-only transfers because the concept of text files differs
      between operating systems. For example on UNIX, a text file denotes line
      breaks with the linefeed character, while on MS-DOS a line break is
      denoted by both a carriage return character and a line feed character.
      Therefore, for data transfers that you consider the data as text you can
      use <i>ascii</i> to ensure that both the remote system and local system
      translate accordingly. The default transfer type that <i>ncftp</i> uses is
      not ASCII, but straight binary.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">bgget and bgput</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These commands correspond to the <i>get</i> and <i>put</i>
      commands explained below, except that they do the job in the background.
      Normally when you do a <i>get</i> then the program does the download
      immediately, and does not return control to you until the download
      completes. The background transfers are nice because you can continue
      browsing the remote filesystem and even open other systems. In fact, they
      are done by a daemon process, so even if you log off your UNIX host the
      daemon should still do your transfers. The daemon will also automatically
      continue to retry the transfers until they finish. To tell when background
      jobs have finished, you have to examine the <i>$HOME/.ncftp/spool/log</i>
      file, or run the <i>jobs</i> command from within <i>NcFTP</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Both the <i>bgget</i> and <i>bgput</i> commands allow you
      to schedule when to do the transfers. They take a ``-@'' parameter, whose
      argument is a date of the form YYYYMMDDhhmmss (four digit year, month,
      day, hour, minute, second). For example, to schedule a download at 3 AM on
      November 6, you could try:</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <br/>
    <pre>
bgget -@ 19971106030000 /pub/idstuff/quake/q2_100.zip
    </pre>
    <br/>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">bgstart</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This command tells <i>ncftp</i> to immediately start the
      background transfers you've requested, which simply runs a copy of the
      <i>ncftpbatch</i> program which is responsible for the background jobs.
      Normally the program will start the background job as soon as you close
      the current site, open a new site, or quit the program. The reason for
      this is because since so many users still use slow dialup links that
      starting the transfers would slow things to a crawl, making it difficult
      to browse the remote system. An added bonus of starting the background job
      when you close the site is that <i>ncftp</i> can pass off that open
      connection to the <i>ncftpbatch</i> program. That is nice when the site is
      always busy, so that the background job doesn't have to wait and get
      re-logged on to do its job.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">binary</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Sets the transfer type to raw binary, so that no
      translation is done on the data transferred. This is the default anyway,
      since most files are in binary.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">bookmark</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Saves the current session settings for later use. This is
      useful to save the remote system and remote working directory so you can
      quickly resume where you left off some other time. The bookmark data is
      stored in your <i>$HOME/.ncftp/bookmarks</i> file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">bookmarks</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Lists the contents of your <i>$HOME/.ncftp/bookmarks</i>
      file in a human-readable format. You can use this command to recall the
      bookmark name of a previously saved bookmark, so that you can use the
      <i>open</i> command with it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">cat</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Acts like the ``/bin/cat'' <i>UNIX</i> command, only for
      remote files. This downloads the file you specify and dumps it directly to
      the screen. You will probably find the <i>page</i> command more useful,
      since that lets you view the file one screen at a time instead of printing
      the entire file at once.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">cd</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Changes the working directory on the remote host. Use this
      command to move to different areas on the remote server. If you just
      opened a new site, you might be in the root directory. Perhaps there was a
      directory called ``/pub/news/comp.sources.d'' that someone told you about.
      From the root directory, you could:</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">chmod</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Acts like the ``/bin/chmod'' <i>UNIX</i> command, only for

      servers may not support it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">close</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Disconnects you from the remote server. The program does

  <dd class="It-tag">Copies files from the current working directory on the

    try:</dd>

    <br/>
    <pre>
get README README.too
    </pre>
    <br/>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You could also accomplish that by using a wildcard

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <br/>
    <pre>
get README*
    </pre>
    <br/>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This command is similar to the behavior of other FTP
      programs' <i>mget</i> command. To retrieve a remote file but give it a
      different name on your host, you can use the ``-z'' flag. This example
      shows how to download a file called <i>ReadMe.txt</i> but name it locally
      as <i>README</i>:</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">

    </pre>
    <br/>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The program tries to ``resume'' downloads by default. This
      means that if the remote FTP server lost the connection and was only able
      to send 490 kilobytes of a 500 kilobyte file, you could reconnect to the
      FTP server and do another <i>get</i> on the same file name and it would
      get the last 10 kilobytes, instead of retrieving the entire file again.
      There are some occasions where you may not want that behavior. To turn it
      off you can use the ``-f'' flag.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">There are also times where you want to append to an
      existing file. You can do this by using the ``-A'' flag, for example</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <br/>
    <pre>
get -A log.11
    </pre>
    <br/>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">would append to a file named ``log.11'' if it existed
      locally.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Another thing you can do is delete a remote file after you
      download it. This can be useful when a remote host expects a file to be
      removed when it has been retrieved. Use the double-D flag, such as
      ``get&#x00A0;-DD'' to do this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <i>get</i> command lets you retrieve entire directory
      trees, too. Although it may not work with some remote systems, you can try
      ``get&#x00A0;-R'' with a directory to download the directory and its
      contents.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When using the ``-R'' flag, you can also use the ``-T''
      flag to disable automatic on-the-fly TAR mode for downloading whole
      directory trees. The program uses TAR whenever possible since this usually
      preserves symbolic links and file permissions. TAR mode can also result in
      faster transfers for directories containing many small files, since a
      single data connection can be used rather than an FTP data connection for
      each small file. The downside to using TAR is that it forces downloading
      of the whole directory, even if you had previously downloaded a portion of
      it earlier, so you may want to use this option if you want to resume
      downloading of a directory.</dd>

      ``ls'' which displayed the files in columns, your next listing could be

      command primitive <i>PASV</i> to have the client establish data
      connections to the server. The default FTP protocol behavior is to use the
      FTP command primitive <i>PORT</i> which has the server establish data
      connections to the client. The default setting for this variable,

  AND PROXY CONFIGURATION</a></h2>
You may find that your network administrator has placed a firewall between your
  machine and the Internet, and that you cannot reach external hosts.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The answer may be as simple as setting <i>ncftp</i> to use <i>passive</i> mode
  only, which you can do from a <i>ncftp</i> command prompt like this:
<div style="height: 1.67ex;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
<pre>
set passive on
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The reason for this is because many firewalls do not allow incoming connections
  to the site, but do allow users to establish outgoing connections. A passive
  data connection is established by the client to the server, whereas the
  default is for the server to establish the connection to the client, which
  firewalls may object to. Of course, you now may have problems with sites whose
  primitive FTP servers do not support passive mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Otherwise, if you know you need to have <i>ncftp</i> communicate directly with a
  firewall or proxy, you can try editing the separate
  <i>$HOME/.ncftp/firewall</i> configuration file. This file is created
  automatically the first time you run the program, and contains all the
  information you need to get the program to work in this setup.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The basics of this process are configuring a firewall (proxy) host to go
  through, a user account and password for authentication on the firewall, and
  which type of firewall method to use. You can also setup an exclusion list, so
  that <i>ncftp</i> does not use the firewall for hosts on the local network.
