<p>ncftp(1) General Commands Manual ncftp(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ncftp - Browser program for the File Transfer Protocol</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ncftp [host]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncftp
[ftp://host.name/directory/]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The purpose of ncftp is to provide a powerful and flexible
interface to the Internet standard File Transfer Protocol.
It is intended to replace the stock ftp program that comes
<br>
with the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although the program appears to
be rather spartan, you&rsquo;ll find that ncftp has a wealth
of valuable performance and usage features. The program was
designed with an emphasis on <br>
usability, and it does as much as it can for you
automatically so you can do what you expect to do with a
file transfer program, which is transfer files between two
intercon&acirc; <br>
nected systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of the cooler features
include progress meters, filename completion, command-line
editing, background processing, auto-resume downloads,
bookmarking, cached directory list&acirc; <br>
ings, host redialing, working with firewalls and proxies,
downloading entire directory trees, etc., etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ncftp distribution comes
with the useful utility programs ncftpget(1) and ncftpput(1)
which were designed to do command-line FTP. In particular,
they are very handy for <br>
shell scripts. This version of ncftp no longer does
command-line FTP, since the main ncftp program is more of a
browser-type program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The program allows you to specify a host or directory URL on
the command line. This is a synonym for running ncftp and
then using the open command. A few command-line flags are
<br>
allowed with this mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u XX Use username XX instead of
anonymous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p XX Use password XX with the
username.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j XX Use account XX in
supplement to the username and password (deprecated).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P XX Use port number XX instead
of the default FTP service port (21).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION TO THE COMMAND
SHELL <br>
Upon running the program you are presented a command prompt
where you type commands to the program&rsquo;s shell.
Usually you will want to open a remote filesystem to
transfer files <br>
to and from your local machine&rsquo;s filesystem. To do
that, you need to know the symbolic name of the remote
system, or its Internet Protocol (IP) address. For example,
a symbolic <br>
name might be &lsquo;&lsquo;typhoon.unl.edu,&rsquo;&rsquo;
and its IP address could be
&lsquo;&lsquo;129.93.33.24.&rsquo;&rsquo; To open a
connection to that system, you use the program&rsquo;s open
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open typhoon.unl.edu <br>
open 129.93.33.24</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both of these try to open the
machine called typhoon at the University of Nebraska. Using
the symbolic name is the preferred way, because IP addresses
may change without notice, <br>
while the symbolic names usually stay the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you open a remote
filesystem, you need to have permission. The FTP
Protocol&rsquo;s authentication system is very similar to
that of logging in to your account. You have to give <br>
an account name, and its password for access to that
account&rsquo;s files. However, most remote systems that
have anything you might be interested in don&rsquo;t require
an account name <br>
for use. You can often get anonymous access to a remote
filesystem and exchange files that have been made publicly
accessible. The program attempts to get anonymous permission
<br>
to a remote system by default. What actually happens is that
the program tries to use
&lsquo;&lsquo;anonymous&rsquo;&rsquo; as the account name,
and when prompted for a password, uses your E-mail <br>
address as a courtesy to the remote system&rsquo;s
maintainer. You can have the program try to use a specific
account also. That will be explained later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the open command completes
successfully, you are connected to the remote system and
logged in. You should now see the command prompt change to
reflect the name of the cur&acirc; <br>
rent remote directory. To see what&rsquo;s in the current
remote directory, you can use the program&rsquo;s ls and dir
commands. The former is terse, preferring more remote files
in less <br>
screen space, and the latter is more verbose, giving
detailed information about each item in the directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the program&rsquo;s
cd command to move to other directories on the remote
system. The cd command behaves very much like the command of
the same name in the Bourne and Korn <br>
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The purpose of the program is to
exchange data with other systems. You can use the
program&rsquo;s get command to copy a file from the remote
system to your local system:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get README.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program will display the
progress of the transfer on the screen, so you can tell how
much needs to be done before the transfer finishes. When the
transfer does finish, then <br>
you can enter more commands to the program&rsquo;s command
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the program&rsquo;s
put command to copy a file from your system to the remote
system:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">put something.tar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you are finished using the
remote system, you can open another one or use the quit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before quitting, you may want to
save the current FTP session&rsquo;s settings for later. You
can use the bookmark command to save an entry into your
$HOME/.ncftp/bookmarks file. <br>
When you use the bookmark command, you also specify a
bookmark name, so the next time instead of opening the full
hostname you can use the name of the bookmark. A bookmark
acts <br>
just like one for your web browser, so it saves the remote
directory you were in, the account name you used, etc., and
other information it learned so that the next time you use
<br>
the bookmark it should require as little effort from you as
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND REFERENCE <br>
help The first command to know is help. If you just type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">from the command shell, the
program prints the names of all of the supported commands.
From there, you can get specific help for a command by
typing the command after, <br>
for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help open</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prints information about the
open command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ascii This command sets the
transfer type to ASCII text. This is useful for text-only
transfers because the concept of text files differs between
operating systems. For exam&acirc; <br>
ple on UNIX, a text file denotes line breaks with the
linefeed character, while on MS-DOS a line break is denoted
by both a carriage return character and a line feed
char&acirc; <br>
acter. Therefore, for data transfers that you consider the
data as text you can use ascii to ensure that both the
remote system and local system translate accordingly. <br>
The default transfer type that ncftp uses is not ASCII, but
straight binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bgget and bgput <br>
These commands correspond to the get and put commands
explained below, except that they do the job in the
background. Normally when you do a get then the program does
the <br>
download immediately, and does not return control to you
until the download completes. The background transfers are
nice because you can continue browsing the remote <br>
filesystem and even open other systems. In fact, they are
done by a daemon process, so even if you log off your UNIX
host the daemon should still do your transfers. The <br>
daemon will also automatically continue to retry the
transfers until they finish. To tell when background jobs
have finished, you have to examine the <br>
$HOME/.ncftp/spool/log file, or run the jobs command from
within NcFTP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both the bgget and bgput
commands allow you to schedule when to do the transfers.
They take a &lsquo;&lsquo;-@&rsquo;&rsquo; parameter, whose
argument is a date of the form YYYYMMDDhhmmss (four <br>
digit year, month, day, hour, minute, second). For example,
to schedule a download at 3 AM on November 6, you could
try:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bgget -@ 19971106030000
/pub/idstuff/quake/q2_100.zip</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bgstart <br>
This command tells ncftp to immediately start the background
transfers you&rsquo;ve requested, which simply runs a copy
of the ncftpbatch program which is responsible for the <br>
background jobs. Normally the program will start the
background job as soon as you close the current site, open a
new site, or quit the program. The reason for this is <br>
because since so many users still use slow dialup links that
starting the transfers would slow things to a crawl, making
it difficult to browse the remote system. An <br>
added bonus of starting the background job when you close
the site is that ncftp can pass off that open connection to
the ncftpbatch program. That is nice when the site <br>
is always busy, so that the background job doesn&rsquo;t
have to wait and get re-logged on to do its job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">binary Sets the transfer type to
raw binary, so that no translation is done on the data
transferred. This is the default anyway, since most files
are in binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bookmark <br>
Saves the current session settings for later use. This is
useful to save the remote system and remote working
directory so you can quickly resume where you left off some
<br>
other time. The bookmark data is stored in your
$HOME/.ncftp/bookmarks file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bookmarks <br>
Lists the contents of your $HOME/.ncftp/bookmarks file in a
human-readable format. You can use this command to recall
the bookmark name of a previously saved bookmark, so <br>
that you can use the open command with it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat Acts like the
&lsquo;&lsquo;/bin/cat&rsquo;&rsquo; UNIX command, only for
remote files. This downloads the file you specify and dumps
it directly to the screen. You will probably find the page
<br>
command more useful, since that lets you view the file one
screen at a time instead of printing the entire file at
once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd Changes the working directory
on the remote host. Use this command to move to different
areas on the remote server. If you just opened a new site,
you might be in the <br>
root directory. Perhaps there was a directory called
&lsquo;&lsquo;/pub/news/comp.sources.d&rsquo;&rsquo; that
someone told you about. From the root directory, you
could:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd pub <br>
cd news <br>
cd comp.sources.d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or, more concisely,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd /pub/news/comp.sources.d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then, commands such as get, put,
and ls could be used to refer to items in that
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some shells in the UNIX
environment have a feature I like, which is switching to the
previous directory. Like those shells, you can do:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to change to the last directory
you were in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chmod Acts like the
&lsquo;&lsquo;/bin/chmod&rsquo;&rsquo; UNIX command, only
for remote files. However, this is not a standard command,
so remote FTP servers may not support it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close Disconnects you from the
remote server. The program does this for you automatically
when needed, so you can simply open other sites or quit the
program without worrying <br>
about closing the connection by hand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug This command is mostly for
internal testing. You could type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to turn debugging mode on. Then
you could see all messages between the program and the
remote server, and things that are only printed in debugging
mode. However, this <br>
information is also available in the $HOME/.ncftp/trace
file, which is created each time you run ncftp. If you need
to report a bug, send a trace file if you can.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dir Prints a detailed directory
listing. It tries to behave like UNIX&rsquo;s
&lsquo;&lsquo;/bin/ls -l&rsquo;&rsquo; command. If the
remote server seems to be a UNIX host, you can also use the
same flags <br>
you would with ls, for instance</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dir -rt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would try to act like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/bin/ls -lrt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would on UNIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">edit Downloads into a temporary
file for editing on the local host, then uploads the changed
file back to the remote host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get Copies files from the
current working directory on the remote host to your
machine&rsquo;s current working directory. To place a copy
of &lsquo;&lsquo;README&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;README.too&rsquo;&rsquo; in your <br>
local directory, you could try:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get README README.too</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You could also accomplish that
by using a wildcard expression, such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get README*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is similar to the
behavior of other FTP programs&rsquo; mget command. To
retrieve a remote file but give it a different name on your
host, you can use the &lsquo;&lsquo;-z&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
flag. This example shows how to download a file called
ReadMe.txt but name it locally as README:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get -z ReadMe.txt README</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program tries to
&lsquo;&lsquo;resume&rsquo;&rsquo; downloads by default.
This means that if the remote FTP server lost the connection
and was only able to send 490 kilobytes of a 500 kilo&acirc;
<br>
byte file, you could reconnect to the FTP server and do
another get on the same file name and it would get the last
10 kilobytes, instead of retrieving the entire file <br>
again. There are some occasions where you may not want that
behavior. To turn it off you can use the
&lsquo;&lsquo;-f&rsquo;&rsquo; flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are also times where you
want to append to an existing file. You can do this by using
the &lsquo;&lsquo;-A&rsquo;&rsquo; flag, for example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get -A log.11</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would append to a file named
&lsquo;&lsquo;log.11&rsquo;&rsquo; if it existed
locally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another thing you can do is
delete a remote file after you download it. This can be
useful when a remote host expects a file to be removed when
it has been retrieved. <br>
Use the double-D flag, such as &lsquo;&lsquo;get
-DD&rsquo;&rsquo; to do this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The get command lets you
retrieve entire directory trees, too. Although it may not
work with some remote systems, you can try &lsquo;&lsquo;get
-R&rsquo;&rsquo; with a directory to download the <br>
directory and its contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using the
&lsquo;&lsquo;-R&rsquo;&rsquo; flag, you can also use the
&lsquo;&lsquo;-T&rsquo;&rsquo; flag to disable automatic
on-the-fly TAR mode for downloading whole directory trees.
The program uses TAR whenever <br>
possible since this usually preserves symbolic links and
file permissions. TAR mode can also result in faster
transfers for directories containing many small files, since
<br>
a single data connection can be used rather than an FTP data
connection for each small file. The downside to using TAR is
that it forces downloading of the whole direc&acirc; <br>
tory, even if you had previously downloaded a portion of it
earlier, so you may want to use this option if you want to
resume downloading of a directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jobs Views the list of currently
executing NcFTP background tasks. This actually just runs
ncftpbatch -l for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lcd The lcd command is the first
of a few &lsquo;&lsquo;l&rsquo;&rsquo; commands that work
with the local host. This changes the current working
directory on the local host. If you want to download <br>
files into a different local directory, you could use lcd to
change to that directory and then do your downloads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lchmod Runs
&lsquo;&lsquo;/bin/chmod&rsquo;&rsquo; on the local
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lls Another local command that
comes in handy is the lls command, which runs
&lsquo;&lsquo;/bin/ls&rsquo;&rsquo; on the local host and
displays the results in the program&rsquo;s window. You can
use the <br>
same flags with lls as you would in your command shell, so
you can do things like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lcd ~/doc <br>
lls -lrt p*.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lmkdir Runs
&lsquo;&lsquo;/bin/mkdir&rsquo;&rsquo; on the local
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lookup The program also has a
built-in interface to the name service via the lookup
command. This means you can lookup entries for remote hosts,
like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lookup cse.unl.edu
ftp.cs.unl.edu sphygmomanometer.unl.edu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prints:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cse.unl.edu 129.93.33.1 <br>
typhoon.unl.edu 129.93.33.24 <br>
sphygmomanometer.unl.edu 129.93.33.126</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also a more detailed
option, enabled with &lsquo;&lsquo;-v,&rsquo;&rsquo;
i.e.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lookup -v cse.unl.edu
ftp.cs.unl.edu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prints:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cse.unl.edu: <br>
Name: cse.unl.edu <br>
Address: 129.93.33.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp.cs.unl.edu: <br>
Name: typhoon.unl.edu <br>
Alias: ftp.cs.unl.edu <br>
Address: 129.93.33.24</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also give IP addresses,
so this would work too:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lookup 129.93.33.24</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prints:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typhoon.unl.edu 129.93.33.24</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lpage Views a local file one
page at a time, with your preferred $PAGER program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lpwd Prints the current local
directory. Use this command when you forget where you are on
your local machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lrename <br>
Runs &lsquo;&lsquo;/bin/mv&rsquo;&rsquo; on the local
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lrm Runs
&lsquo;&lsquo;/bin/rm&rsquo;&rsquo; on the local host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lrmdir Runs
&lsquo;&lsquo;/bin/rmdir&rsquo;&rsquo; on the local
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ls Prints a directory listing
from the remote system. It tries to behave like UNIX&rsquo;s
&lsquo;&lsquo;/bin/ls -CF&rsquo;&rsquo; command. If the
remote server seems to be a UNIX host, you can also use <br>
the same flags you would with ls, for instance</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ls -rt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would try to act like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/bin/ls -CFrt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would on UNIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncftp has a powerful built-in
system for dealing with directory listings. It tries to
cache each one, so if you list the same directory, odds are
it will display <br>
instantly. Behind the scenes, ncftp always tries a long
listing, and then reformats it as it needs to. So even if
your first listing of a directory was a regular
&lsquo;&lsquo;ls&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
which displayed the files in columns, your next listing
could be &lsquo;&lsquo;ls -lrt&rsquo;&rsquo; and ncftp would
still use the cached directory listing to quickly display
the information for <br>
you!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mkdir Creates a new directory on
the remote host. For many public archives, you won&rsquo;t
have the proper access permissions to do that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open Establishes an FTP control
connection to a remote host. By default, ncftp logs in
anonymously to the remote host. You may want to use a
specific user account when you <br>
log in, so you can use the &lsquo;&lsquo;-u&rsquo;&rsquo;
flag to specify which user. This example shows how to open
the host &lsquo;&lsquo;bowser.nintendo.co.jp&rsquo;&rsquo;
using the username &lsquo;&lsquo;mario:&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open -u mario
bowser.nintendo.co.jp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a list of options
available for use with the open command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u XX Use username XX instead of
anonymous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p XX Use password XX with the
username.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j XX Use account XX in
supplement to the username and password (deprecated).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P XX Use port number XX instead
of the default FTP service port (21).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">page Browses a remote file one
page at a time, using your $PAGER program. This is useful
for reading README&rsquo;s on the remote host without
downloading them first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdir and pls <br>
These commands are equivalent to dir and ls respectively,
only they feed their output to your pager. These commands
are useful if the directory listing scrolls off your <br>
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">put Copies files from the local
host to the remote machine&rsquo;s current working
directory. To place a copy of
&lsquo;&lsquo;xx.zip&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;yy.zip&rsquo;&rsquo; in the remote directory,
you could try:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">put xx.zip yy.zip</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You could also accomplish that
by using a wildcard expression, such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">put *.zip</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is similar to the
behavior of other FTP programs&rsquo; mput command. To send
a remote file but give it a different name on your host, you
can use the &lsquo;&lsquo;-z&rsquo;&rsquo; flag. <br>
This example shows how to upload a file called
&lsquo;&lsquo;ncftpd-2.0.6.tar.gz&rsquo;&rsquo; but name it
remotely as &lsquo;&lsquo;NFTPD206.TGZ:&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">put -z ncftpd-2.0.6.tar.gz
NFTPD206.TGZ</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program does not try to
&lsquo;&lsquo;resume&rsquo;&rsquo; uploads by default. If
you do want to resume an upload, use the
&lsquo;&lsquo;-z&rsquo;&rsquo; flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are also times where you
want to append to an existing remote file. You can do this
by using the &lsquo;&lsquo;-A&rsquo;&rsquo; flag, for
example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">put -A log11.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would append to a file named
&lsquo;&lsquo;log11.txt&rsquo;&rsquo; if it existed on the
remote server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another thing you can do is
delete a local file after you upload it. Use the double-D
flag, such as &lsquo;&lsquo;put -DD&rsquo;&rsquo; to do
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The put command lets you send
entire directory trees, too. It should work on all remote
systems, so you can try &lsquo;&lsquo;put -R&rsquo;&rsquo;
with a directory to upload the directory and <br>
its contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pwd Prints the current remote
working directory. A portion of the pathname is also
displayed in the shell&rsquo;s prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit Of course, when you finish
using the program, type quit to end the program (You could
also use bye, exit, or ^D).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quote This can be used to send a
direct FTP Protocol command to the remote server. Generally
this isn&rsquo;t too useful to the average user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rename If you need to change the
name of a remote file, you can use the rename command,
like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rename SPHYGMTR.TAR
sphygmomanometer-2.3.1.tar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rhelp Sends a help request to
the remote server. The list of FTP Protocol commands is
often printed, and sometimes some other information that is
actually useful, like how to <br>
reach the site administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Depending on the remote server,
you may be able to give a parameter to the server also,
like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rhelp NLST</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One server responded:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Syntax: NLST [ &lt;sp&gt;
path-name ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rm If you need to delete a
remote file you can try the rm command. Much of the time
this won&rsquo;t work because you won&rsquo;t have the
proper access permissions. This command <br>
doesn&rsquo;t accept any flags, so you can&rsquo;t nuke a
whole tree by using &lsquo;&lsquo;-rf&rsquo;&rsquo; flags
like you can on UNIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rmdir Similarly, the rmdir
command removes a directory. Depending on the remote server,
you may be able to remove a non-empty directory, so be
careful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set This lets you configure some
program variables, which are saved between runs in the
$HOME/.ncftp/prefs file. The basic syntax is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set &lt;option&gt;
&lt;value&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to change the value
you use for the anonymous password, you might do:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set anon-password
devnull@example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the next section for a list
of things you change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show This lets you display
program variables. You can do &lsquo;&lsquo;show
all&rsquo;&rsquo; to display all of them, or give a variable
name to just display that one, such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show anon-password</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">site One obscure command you may
have to use someday is site. The FTP Protocol allows for
&lsquo;&lsquo;site specific&rsquo;&rsquo; commands. These
&lsquo;&lsquo;site&rsquo;&rsquo; commands vary of course,
such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">site chmod 644 README</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Actually, ncftp&rsquo;s chmod
command really does the above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Try doing one of these to see
what the remote server supports, if any:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rhelp SITE <br>
site help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type You may need to change
transfer types during the course of a session with a server.
You can use the type command to do this. Try one of
these:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type ascii <br>
type binary <br>
type image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ascii command is equivalent
to &lsquo;&lsquo;type a&rsquo;&rsquo;, and the binary
command is equivalent to &lsquo;&lsquo;type i&rsquo;&rsquo;
and &lsquo;&lsquo;type b&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">umask Sets the process&rsquo;
umask on the remote server, if it has any concept of a
umask, i.e.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">umask 077</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, this is not a standard
command, so remote FTP servers may not support it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version <br>
This command dumps some information about the particular
edition of the program you are using, and how it was
installed on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VARIABLE REFERENCE <br>
anon-password <br>
Specifies what to use for the password when logging in
anonymously. Internet convention has been to use your E-mail
address as a courtesy to the site administrator. If <br>
you change this, be aware that some sites require (i.e. they
check for) valid E-mail addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto-resume <br>
NcFTP 3 now prompts the user by default when you try to
download a file that already exists locally, or upload a
file that already exists remotely. Older versions of the
<br>
program automatically guessed whether to overwrite the
existing file or attempt to resume where it left off, but
sometimes the program would guess wrong. If you would <br>
prefer that the program always guess which action to take,
set this variable to yes, otherwise, leave it set to no and
the program will prompt you for which action to <br>
take.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto-ascii <br>
If set to a list of pipe-character delimited extensions,
files with these extensions will be sent in ASCII mode even
if binary mode is currently in effect. This option <br>
allows you to transfer most files in binary, with the
exception of a few well-known file types that should be sent
in ASCII. This option is enabled by default, and set to <br>
a list of common extensions (e.g., .txt and .html).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autosave-bookmark-changes <br>
With the advent of version 3 of NcFTP, the program treats
bookmarks more like they would with your web browser, which
means that once you bookmark the site, the remote <br>
directory is static. If you set this variable to yes, then
the program will automatically update the bookmark&rsquo;s
starting remote directory with the directory you were in
<br>
when you closed the site. This behavior would be more like
that of NcFTP version 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">confirm-close <br>
By default the program will ask you when a site you
haven&rsquo;t bookmarked is about to be closed. To turn this
prompt off, you can set this variable to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">connect-timeout <br>
Previous versions of the program used a single timeout value
for everything. You can now have different values for
different operations. However, you probably do not <br>
need to change these from the defaults unless you have
special requirements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The connect-timeout variable
controls how long to wait, in seconds, for a connection
establishment to complete before considering it hopeless.
You can choose to not use a <br>
timeout at all by setting this to -1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">control-timeout <br>
This is the timer used when ncftp sends an FTP command over
the control connection to the remote server. If the server
hasn&rsquo;t replied in that many seconds, it considers <br>
the session lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logsize <br>
This is controls how large the transfer log
($HOME/.ncftp/log) can grow to, in kilobytes. The default is
200, for 200kB; if you don&rsquo;t want a log, set this to
0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pager This is the external
program to use to view a text file, and is more by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">passive <br>
This controls ncftp&rsquo;s behavior for data connections,
and can be set to one of on, off, or the default, optional.
When passive mode is on, ncftp uses the FTP command
prim&acirc; <br>
itive PASV to have the client establish data connections to
the server. The default FTP protocol behavior is to use the
FTP command primitive PORT which has the server <br>
establish data connections to the client. The default
setting for this variable, optional, allows ncftp to choose
whichever method it deems necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">progress-meter <br>
You can change how the program reports file transfer status.
Select from meter 2, 1, or 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">redial-delay <br>
When a host is busy or unavailable, the program waits this
number of seconds before trying again. The smallest you can
set this is to 10 seconds -- so if you were plan&acirc; <br>
ning on being inconsiderate, think again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">save-passwords <br>
If you set this variable to yes, the program will save
passwords along with the bookmarks you save. While this
makes non-anonymous logins more convenient, this can be <br>
very dangerous since your account information is now sitting
in the $HOME/.ncftp/bookmarks file. The passwords
aren&rsquo;t in clear text, but it is still trivial to
decode <br>
them if someone wants to make a modest effort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-status-in-xterm-titlebar
<br>
If set to yes and operating from within an xterm window, the
program will change the window&rsquo;s titlebar
accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">so-bufsize <br>
If your operating system supports TCP Large Windows, you can
try setting this variable to the number of bytes to set the
TCP/IP socket buffer to. This option won&rsquo;t be of <br>
much use unless the remote server also supports large window
sizes and is pre-configured with them enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfer-timeout <br>
This timer controls how long to wait for data blocks to
complete. Don&rsquo;t set this too low or else your
transfers will timeout without completing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FIREWALL AND PROXY CONFIGURATION
<br>
You may find that your network administrator has placed a
firewall between your machine and the Internet, and that you
cannot reach external hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The answer may be as simple as
setting ncftp to use passive mode only, which you can do
from a ncftp command prompt like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set passive on</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reason for this is because
many firewalls do not allow incoming connections to the
site, but do allow users to establish outgoing connections.
A passive data connection is <br>
established by the client to the server, whereas the default
is for the server to establish the connection to the client,
which firewalls may object to. Of course, you now may <br>
have problems with sites whose primitive FTP servers do not
support passive mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, if you know you need
to have ncftp communicate directly with a firewall or proxy,
you can try editing the separate $HOME/.ncftp/firewall
configuration file. This file <br>
is created automatically the first time you run the program,
and contains all the information you need to get the program
to work in this setup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The basics of this process are
configuring a firewall (proxy) host to go through, a user
account and password for authentication on the firewall, and
which type of firewall <br>
method to use. You can also setup an exclusion list, so that
ncftp does not use the firewall for hosts on the local
network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$HOME/.ncftp/bookmarks <br>
Saves bookmark and host information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.ncftp/firewall <br>
Firewall access configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.ncftp/prefs <br>
Program preferences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.ncftp/trace <br>
Debugging output for entire program run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.ncftp/v3init <br>
Used to tell if this version of the program has run
before.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.ncftp/spool/ <br>
Directory where background jobs are stored in the form of
spool configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.ncftp/spool/log <br>
Information for background data transfer processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
PATH User&rsquo;s search path, used to find the ncftpbatch
program, pager, and some other system utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAGER Program to use to view
text files one page at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERM If the program was compiled
with support for GNU Readline it will need to know how to
manipulate the terminal correctly for line-editing, etc. The
pager program will also <br>
take advantage of this setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME By default, the program
writes its configuration data in a .ncftp subdirectory of
the HOME directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NCFTPDIR <br>
If set, the program will use this directory instead of
$HOME/.ncftp. This variable is optional except for those
users whose home directory is the root directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLUMNS <br>
Both the built-in ls command and the external ls command
need this to determine how many screen columns the terminal
has.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
There are no such sites named bowser.nintendo.co.jp or
sphygmomanometer.unl.edu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Auto-resume should check the
file timestamps instead of relying upon just the file sizes,
but it is difficult to do this reliably within FTP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Directory caching and recursive
downloads depend on UNIX-like behavior of the remote
host.</p>
