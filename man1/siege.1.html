siege is a multi-threaded HTTP/FTP load tester and benchmarking utility. It
  supports most of the features detailed in RFCs 2616 (HTTP) and 959 (FTP).
  Properties can be set at both from the command line and in a configuration
  file. When the same propertie is set in both locations, the command line takes
  precedent.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default configuration file is $HOME/.siege/siege.conf If you don't have a
  $HOME/.siege directory and a siege.conf and cookies.txt file, siege will
  generate a new config directory when it runs. You can generate your configu
  directory with the following command: siege.config

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-c NUM</b>, <b>--concurrent=NUM</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option allows you to set the concurrent number of
      users. The total number of users is technically limited to your computer's
      resources.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You should not configure more users than your web server is configured to
      handle. For example, the default apache configuration is capped at 255
      threads. If you run siege with -c 1024, then 769 siege users are left
      waiting for an apache handler.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For this reason, the default siege configuration is capped at 255 users. You
      can increase that number inside siege.conf but if you make a mess, then
      please don't complain to us.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-r NUM</b>, <b>--reps=NUM|once</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option tells each siege user how times it should run.
      The value should generally be a number greater than zero but it may be the
      keyword 'once'.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If --reps=3 then each siege user will run three times before it exits.
      However, if --reps=once, then each user will run through the urls.txt file
      exactly one time.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For more information about the urls.txt file, see option -f &lt;file&gt;,

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-t NUMm</b>, <b>--time=NUMm</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option is similar to --reps but instead of specifying
      the number of times each user should run, it specifies the amount of time
      each should run.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The value format is &quot;NUMm&quot;, where &quot;NUM&quot; is an amount of
      time and the &quot;m&quot; modifier is either S, M, or H for seconds,
      minutes and hours. To run siege for an hour, you could select any one of
      the following combinations: -t3600S, -t60M, -t1H. The modifier is not case
      sensitive, but it does require no space between the number and
    itself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d NUM</b>, <b>--delay=NUM</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option instructs siege how long to delay between each
      page request. The value NUM represents the number of seconds between each
      one. This number can be a decimal value. In fact the default is half a
      second (--delay=0.5).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The time between delay requests is NOT applied toward the transaction time.
      If two 0.1 second transactions have a 2 second delay between them, their
      average transaction time is run is 0.1 seconds. It is applied toward the
      total elapsed time. In this scenario, the elapsed time would be 2.2
      seconds.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    NOTE: when the parser is enabled (see: -p/--parser), there is no delay
      between the page and its elements, i.e., style sheets, javascripts, etc.
      The delay is only between page requests.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="URL_FORMAT"><a class="selflink" href="#URL_FORMAT">URL
  FORMAT</a></h1>
siege supports RFC 1738 URL formats but it takes pains to implement commonly
  used shortcuts for your convenience. In addition to RFC 1738 formats, siege
  introduces its own URL format to indicate protocol method.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An RFC 1738 URL looks like this:
<br/>

  &lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path&gt;;&lt;params&gt;?&lt;query&gt;#&lt;frag&gt;
<div class="Pp"></div>
A siege URL with a method idicator looks like this:
<br/>

  &lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path&gt;
  POST &lt;query&gt;
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also post the contents of a file using the redirect character like this:
<br/>

  &lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path&gt;
  POST &lt;/home/jeff/haha.txt
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here's two examples with the siege method indicator:
<br/>
 http://www.joedog.org/ POST haha=papa&amp;dada=mama
<br/>
 ftp://ftp.armstrong.com/ PUT &lt;/home/jdfulmer/etc/tests/bbc.jpg
<div class="Pp"></div>
NOTE: If you set URLs with method indicators at the command-line, then you MUST
  quote the thing or your shell will treat it like three separate arguments. If
  the URL is in a urls.txt file, then you shouldn't quote it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As mentioned above, siege goes to great lengths to allow commonly used shortcuts
  that you're used to from most browser implementations. It treats many parts of
  the 1738 URL as optional. In this example, the parts in brackets are optional:
<br/>
 [scheme://] host.domain.xxx [:port] [/path/file]
<div class="Pp"></div>
When siege receives a host name it builds the URL with default assumptions.
  www.joedog.org becomes http://www.joedog.org:80/
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="URLS.txt_FILE"><a class="selflink" href="#URLS.txt_FILE">URLS.txt
  FILE</a></h1>
From the section called Option Syntax above we learn that siege can take a URL
  as an argument. siege -c -r2 www.joedog.org will request the JoeDog index page
  twice. But what if you want to hit large portions of the site? siege will
  allow you to fill a file with URLs so that it can run through list.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The format for the file is one URL per line:
<br/>
 https://www.joedog.org/
<br/>
 https://www.joedog.org/haha/
<br/>
 https://www.joedog.org/haha/ POST homer=simpson&amp;marge=doestoo
<div class="Pp"></div>
The file also supports UNIX-style commenting:
<br/>
 # Comment looks like this
<br/>
 https://www.joedog.org/
<br/>
 https://www.joedog.org/haha/
<br/>
 https://www.joedog.org/haha/ POST homer=simpson&amp;marge=doestoo
<div class="Pp"></div>
It supports shell-style variable declaration and references. This is convenient
  if you want to run the same test on two different tiers or two different
  shemes:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  SCHEME=https
  HOST=bart.joedog.org
  $(SCHEME)://$(HOST)/
  $(SCHEME)://$(HOST)/haha/
  $(SCHEME)://$(HOST)/haha/ POST homer=simpson&amp;marge=doestoo
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can tell siege about this file with the -f/--file option:
<br/>
 siege -c1 -r50 -f /home/jeff/urls.txt
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PERFORMANCE_STATISTICS"><a class="selflink" href="#PERFORMANCE_STATISTICS">PERFORMANCE
  STATISTICS</a></h1>
When its run is complete, siege will gather performance data from all its
  clients and summarize them after the run. (You can also choose to log these
  numbers). The command-line output is modeled after Lincoln Stein's torture.pl
  script:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  Transactions:                   2000 hits
  Availability:                 100.00 %
  Elapsed time:                  58.57 secs
  Data transferred:               5.75 MB
  Response time:                  0.25 secs
  Transaction rate:              34.15 trans/sec
  Throughput:                     0.10 MB/sec

  Successful transactions:        2000
  Failed transactions:               0
  Longest transaction:            4.62
  Shortest transaction:           0.00
  Transactions
      This number represents the total number of HTTP requests. In this
      example, we ran 25 simulated users [-c25] and each ran ten times
      [-r10]. Twenty-five times ten equals 250 so why is the transaction 
      total 2000? That's because siege counts every request. This run 
      included a META redirect, a 301 redirect and the page it requested 
      contained several elements that were also downloaded.
  Availability
      This is the percentage of socket connections successfully handled 
      by the server. It is the result of socket failures (including 
      timeouts) divided by the sum of all connection attempts. This 
      number does not include 400 and 500 level server errors which are
      recorded in &quot;Failed transactions&quot; described below.  
  Elapsed time
      The duration of the entire siege test. This is measured from the 
      time the user invokes siege until the last simulated user 
      completes its transactions. Shown above, the test took 14.67 
      seconds to complete.
  Data transferred
      The sum of data transferred to every siege simulated user. It 
      includes the header information as well as content. Because it
      includes header information, the number reported by siege will 
      be larger then the number reported by the server. In internet 
      mode, which hits random URLs in a configuration file, this 
      number is expected to vary from run to run.
  Response time
      The average time it took to respond to each simulated user's requests.
  Transaction rate
      The average number of transactions the server was able to handle
      per second, in a nutshell: it is the count of all transactions 
      divided by elapsed time.
  Throughput
      The average number of bytes transferred every second from the 
      server to all the simulated users.
  Concurrency
      This is the average number of simultaneous connections. The metric
      is calculated like this: the sum of all transaction times divided
      by elapsed time (how long siege ran) 
  Successful transactions
      The number of times the server responded with a return code &lt; 400.
  Failed transactions
      The number of times the socket transactions failed which includes 
      socket timeouts.
  Longest transaction
      The greatest amount of time that any single transaction took, out 
      of all transactions.
  Shortest transaction
      The smallest amount of time that any single transaction took, out
      of all transactions.
