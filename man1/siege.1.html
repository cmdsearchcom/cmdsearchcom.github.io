<p>SIEGE(1) Siege Load Tester SIEGE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
siege - An HTTP/FTP load tester and benchmarking
utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
siege [options] <br>
siege [options] &lt;URL&gt; <br>
siege [options] -g &lt;URL&gt; <br>
siege [options] -f urls.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
siege is a multi-threaded HTTP/FTP load tester and
benchmarking utility. It supports most of the features
detailed in RFCs 2616 (HTTP) and 959 (FTP). Properties can
be set at <br>
both from the command line and in a configuration file. When
the same propertie is set in both locations, the command
line takes precedent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default configuration file
is $HOME/.siege/siege.conf If you don&rsquo;t have a
$HOME/.siege directory and a siege.conf and cookies.txt
file, siege will generate a new config <br>
directory when it runs. You can generate your configu
directory with the following command: siege.config</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Option Syntax <br>
siege supports long and short options. Short options look
like this: <br>
-c 25 <br>
-c25</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Long options look like this:
<br>
--concurrent=25</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option Values <br>
-V, --version <br>
Displays the siege release version and copyright
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Prints a help message describing siege&rsquo;s command-line
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --config <br>
Prints a detailed summary of all the currently configured
options, most of which are sent in
$HOME/.siege/siege.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --vebose <br>
This directive puts siege into verbose mode which is
actually a default setting. This command-line option is
useful when the config file is set to &rsquo;verbose =
false&rsquo; since it <br>
will allow you to override that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default siege&rsquo;s verbose
output is displayed in a color-coded style. <br>
* HTTP 2xx is coded blue <br>
* HTTP 3xx is coded cyan <br>
* HTTP 4xx is coded magenta <br>
* HTTP 5xx is coded red <br>
* HTTP cached is coded black</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: You can turn off color in
siege.conf like this: &rsquo;color = off&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
This directive silences siege. It is mostly used for
scripting and is often used in conjunction with -g/--get.
You can detect the success or failure of the run with its
exit <br>
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">siege --quiet -g www.joedog.org
<br>
if [ $? -eq 0 ] ; then <br>
echo &quot;Success&quot; <br>
else <br>
echo &quot;Failure&quot; <br>
fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g URL, --get=URL <br>
This option allows you to request a URL and watch the header
transaction. There is a corresponding config file directive
that allows you to set the request method for these <br>
requests: gmethod = HEAD|GET</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ siege -g
&quot;https://www.joedog.org/&quot; <br>
HEAD / HTTP/1.0 <br>
Host: www.joedog.org <br>
Accept: */* <br>
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (unknown-x86_64-linux-gnu)

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTTP/1.1 200 OK <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: It&rsquo;s best practice
to quote the URL when it&rsquo;s passed to siege from the
the command-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c NUM, --concurrent=NUM <br>
This option allows you to set the concurrent number of
users. The total number of users is technically limited to
your computer&rsquo;s resources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should not configure more
users than your web server is configured to handle. For
example, the default apache configuration is capped at 255
threads. If you run siege <br>
with -c 1024, then 769 siege users are left waiting for an
apache handler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For this reason, the default
siege configuration is capped at 255 users. You can increase
that number inside siege.conf but if you make a mess, then
please don&rsquo;t complain to <br>
us.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r NUM, --reps=NUM|once <br>
This option tells each siege user how times it should run.
The value should generally be a number greater than zero but
it may be the keyword &rsquo;once&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --reps=3 then each siege user
will run three times before it exits. However, if
--reps=once, then each user will run through the urls.txt
file exactly one time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information about the
urls.txt file, see option -f &lt;file&gt;,
--file=&lt;file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t NUMm, --time=NUMm <br>
This option is similar to --reps but instead of specifying
the number of times each user should run, it specifies the
amount of time each should run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value format is
&quot;NUMm&quot;, where &quot;NUM&quot; is an amount of time
and the &quot;m&quot; modifier is either S, M, or H for
seconds, minutes and hours. To run siege for an hour, you
could <br>
select any one of the following combinations: -t3600S,
-t60M, -t1H. The modifier is not case sensitive, but it does
require no space between the number and itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d NUM, --delay=NUM <br>
This option instructs siege how long to delay between each
page request. The value NUM represents the number of seconds
between each one. This number can be a decimal value. <br>
In fact the default is half a second (--delay=0.5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The time between delay requests
is NOT applied toward the transaction time. If two 0.1
second transactions have a 2 second delay between them,
their average transaction time <br>
is run is 0.1 seconds. It is applied toward the total
elapsed time. In this scenario, the elapsed time would be
2.2 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: when the parser is enabled
(see: -p/--parser), there is no delay between the page and
its elements, i.e., style sheets, javascripts, etc. The
delay is only between <br>
page requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --benchmark <br>
This directive tells siege to go into benchmark mode. This
means there is no delay between iterations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --internet <br>
This option sets siege into what we call internet mode. It
makes requests from the urls.txt file (see: -f &lt;file&gt;
/ --file=&lt;file&gt;) in random order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f FILE, --file=FILE <br>
This option tells siege to work with a list of urls inside a
text file. The URLs are listed one per line. Unlike URLs
that are passed as a command-line argument, the URLs in <br>
this file should not be quoted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">siege&rsquo;s urls.txt parser
supports comments and variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R FILE, --rc=FILE <br>
This directive allows you to set an alternative resource
file. By default, the siegerc file is
$HOME/.siege/siege.conf With this directive, you can
override the default and <br>
use an alternative file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L FILE, --log=FILE <br>
The default log file is $prefix/var/log/siege.log. This
directive allows you to specify and alternative file for
logging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m &quot;string&quot;,
--mark=&quot;string&quot; <br>
This option allows you to log a message to the log file
before your stats are written there. It is generally used to
identify the proceeding run. You could, for example, mark
<br>
the file with your command-line parameters so it&rsquo;s
understood what configuration generated the following
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H &quot;header: value&quot;,
--header=&quot;Header: value&quot; <br>
This options allows you to set a custom header in the
request. Generally speaking, this request will override an
existing header. The Cookie header is a special case. If
<br>
you set -H &quot;Cookie: value&quot; then siege will send
that cookie in addition to the other ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A &quot;string&quot;,
--agent=&quot;string&quot; <br>
This option allows you to override the default user-agent
with a custom one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">siege --agent=&quot;JoeDog Jr.
in da hizzle&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Will set this header:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User-agent: JoeDog Jr. in da
hizzle</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, you could set the
User-agent with the -H/--header option above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T &quot;text&quot;,
--content-type=&quot;text&quot; <br>
This is another set header shortcut. You use this option to
override the default Content-type request header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">URL FORMAT <br>
siege supports RFC 1738 URL formats but it takes pains to
implement commonly used shortcuts for your convenience. In
addition to RFC 1738 formats, siege introduces its own URL
<br>
format to indicate protocol method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An RFC 1738 URL looks like this:
<br>

&lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path&gt;;&lt;params&gt;?&lt;query&gt;#&lt;frag&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A siege URL with a method
idicator looks like this: <br>

&lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path&gt;
POST &lt;query&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also post the contents
of a file using the redirect character like this: <br>

&lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path&gt;
POST &lt;/home/jeff/haha.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s two examples with
the siege method indicator: <br>
http://www.joedog.org/ POST haha=papa&amp;dada=mama <br>
ftp://ftp.armstrong.com/ PUT
&lt;/home/jdfulmer/etc/tests/bbc.jpg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: If you set URLs with
method indicators at the command-line, then you MUST quote
the thing or your shell will treat it like three separate
arguments. If the URL is in a <br>
urls.txt file, then you shouldn&rsquo;t quote it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As mentioned above, siege goes
to great lengths to allow commonly used shortcuts that
you&rsquo;re used to from most browser implementations. It
treats many parts of the 1738 URL as <br>
optional. In this example, the parts in brackets are
optional: <br>
[scheme://] host.domain.xxx [:port] [/path/file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When siege receives a host name
it builds the URL with default assumptions. www.joedog.org
becomes http://www.joedog.org:80/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">URLS.txt FILE <br>
From the section called Option Syntax above we learn that
siege can take a URL as an argument. siege -c -r2
www.joedog.org will request the JoeDog index page twice. But
what if <br>
you want to hit large portions of the site? siege will allow
you to fill a file with URLs so that it can run through
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format for the file is one
URL per line: <br>
https://www.joedog.org/ <br>
https://www.joedog.org/haha/ <br>
https://www.joedog.org/haha/ POST
homer=simpson&amp;marge=doestoo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file also supports
UNIX-style commenting: <br>
# Comment looks like this <br>
https://www.joedog.org/ <br>
https://www.joedog.org/haha/ <br>
https://www.joedog.org/haha/ POST
homer=simpson&amp;marge=doestoo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It supports shell-style variable
declaration and references. This is convenient if you want
to run the same test on two different tiers or two different
shemes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCHEME=https <br>
HOST=bart.joedog.org <br>
$(SCHEME)://$(HOST)/ <br>
$(SCHEME)://$(HOST)/haha/ <br>
$(SCHEME)://$(HOST)/haha/ POST
homer=simpson&amp;marge=doestoo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can tell siege about this
file with the -f/--file option: <br>
siege -c1 -r50 -f /home/jeff/urls.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERFORMANCE STATISTICS <br>
When its run is complete, siege will gather performance data
from all its clients and summarize them after the run. (You
can also choose to log these numbers). The command-line <br>
output is modeled after Lincoln Stein&rsquo;s torture.pl
script:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transactions: 2000 hits <br>
Availability: 100.00 % <br>
Elapsed time: 58.57 secs <br>
Data transferred: 5.75 MB <br>
Response time: 0.25 secs <br>
Transaction rate: 34.15 trans/sec <br>
Throughput: 0.10 MB/sec <br>
Concurrency: 8.45 <br>
Successful transactions: 2000 <br>
Failed transactions: 0 <br>
Longest transaction: 4.62 <br>
Shortest transaction: 0.00</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transactions <br>
This number represents the total number of HTTP requests. In
this <br>
example, we ran 25 simulated users [-c25] and each ran ten
times <br>
[-r10]. Twenty-five times ten equals 250 so why is the
transaction <br>
total 2000? That&rsquo;s because siege counts every request.
This run <br>
included a META redirect, a 301 redirect and the page it
requested <br>
contained several elements that were also downloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Availability <br>
This is the percentage of socket connections successfully
handled <br>
by the server. It is the result of socket failures
(including <br>
timeouts) divided by the sum of all connection attempts.
This <br>
number does not include 400 and 500 level server errors
which are <br>
recorded in &quot;Failed transactions&quot; described
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Elapsed time <br>
The duration of the entire siege test. This is measured from
the <br>
time the user invokes siege until the last simulated user
<br>
completes its transactions. Shown above, the test took 14.67
<br>
seconds to complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data transferred <br>
The sum of data transferred to every siege simulated user.
It <br>
includes the header information as well as content. Because
it <br>
includes header information, the number reported by siege
will <br>
be larger then the number reported by the server. In
internet <br>
mode, which hits random URLs in a configuration file, this
<br>
number is expected to vary from run to run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Response time <br>
The average time it took to respond to each simulated
user&rsquo;s requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transaction rate <br>
The average number of transactions the server was able to
handle <br>
per second, in a nutshell: it is the count of all
transactions <br>
divided by elapsed time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Throughput <br>
The average number of bytes transferred every second from
the <br>
server to all the simulated users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Concurrency <br>
This is the average number of simultaneous connections. The
metric <br>
is calculated like this: the sum of all transaction times
divided <br>
by elapsed time (how long siege ran)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Successful transactions <br>
The number of times the server responded with a return code
&lt; 400.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Failed transactions <br>
The number of times the socket transactions failed which
includes <br>
socket timeouts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Longest transaction <br>
The greatest amount of time that any single transaction
took, out <br>
of all transactions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shortest transaction <br>
The smallest amount of time that any single transaction
took, out <br>
of all transactions.</p>
