<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
llogin - Connect to a LAT service</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
llogin [options] service <br>
Options: <br>
[-dvcpblhQ] [-H node] [-R port] [-n name] [-w password | -W]
[-q quit char]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
llogin connects your terminal to a LAT service via latd, the
service name must be known to latd for this to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d Shows learned services. This is the same as latcp -d
-l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d -v Verbose form of -d. -v
without -d is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H &lt;node&gt; <br>
Remote nodename. If the service is advertised by more than
one node and you want to connect to a particular node then
use this switch. By default you will be connected to <br>
the node with the highest rating.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R &lt;port&gt; <br>
Connect to a specific port on (usually) a terminal server.
This is the port NAME on the server and not the port
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Do not convert typed LF to
CR. By default the enter key generates LF and llogin
converts it CR as it is the most generically useful
translation. This switch will cause <br>
the enter key to send LF instead. Occasionally useful for
connecting to Unix consoles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Convert typed DEL to BS. By
default the DEL key (keyboard, top right usually) send DEL
(ASCII 0x7f) to the remote system. This switch will cause
the DEL key to send BS <br>
(ASCII 8) instead. Useful for some Unix systems connected
via terminal servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Convert output LF to VT. By
default LF output is sent as CRLF which can cause output
formatting problems. Changing this to VT should preserve the
output formatting on most <br>
devices or terminal emulators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q &lt;char&gt; <br>
Change the quit character. By default CTRL-] will quit the
terminal session. Entering a character after -q will cause
CTRL-&lt;char&gt; to be the quit character for that
ses&acirc; <br>
sion. -q0 will disable the quit character. If you use the
latter, make sure you are connecting to a service that will
disconnect you when you log out or you will have to <br>
kill llogin from another session to get out of it!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Tells latd that the service
you are connecting to is queued service and not a normal
login service or port service. Unfortunately latd cannot
tell whether a remote service <br>
needs to be queued or not so the onus is on the user to
specify this switch when connecting to a queued service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n &lt;name&gt; <br>
Sets the local connection name. By default this will be your
local TTY name. In most cases this simply affects the
display of the terminal on the remote end so you <br>
shouldn&rsquo;t need to change it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w &lt;password&gt; <br>
Sends the password for the service. Only needed for services
that require a password for access. If the password given is
&quot;-&quot; then you will be prompted for a password and
<br>
it will not be echoed. This avoids having passwords visible
on the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W Prompts for the service
password. This is the same as -w- (see above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Tells llogin to connect to
the device named instead of a LAT service. This would
usually be a /dev/lat pseudo-terminal but could be any other
device you like really. This <br>
switch does not make the program useful as a terminal
program because there is no way to set any serial
parameters, nor am I going to add them. This is just a
convenient <br>
way to use the /dev/lat ports without the overhead of
programs such as minicom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Displays a brief usage
description. This is the same as invoking llogin without any
parameters at all.</p>
