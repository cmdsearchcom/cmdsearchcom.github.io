<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
airsnort &acirc; WEP key cracking tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
airsnort</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
airsnort is a WEP key cracking tool designed to exploit the
RC4 scheduling weakness discussed by Fluhrer, Mantin, and
Shamir (FMS) and first exploited by Stubblefield et al.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Running AirSnort</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once launched, airsnort must be
configured to work with your wireless nic and to make crack
attempts according to your desires. In order to properly
capture packets, first indicate <br>
the name of your wireless networking device in the
&quot;Network device&quot; field. This will be something
like &quot;wlanX&quot; for cards that use the wlan-ng
drivers and &quot;ethX&quot; for other cards. <br>
Next select the type of card that you are using in the
&quot;Card type&quot; drop down box. Available choices are
Prism2, Orinoco, and other. Cisco cards fall into the other
category. The <br>
purpose if this field is primarily to inform airsnort how to
place your nic into monitor mode. In monitor mode a wireless
nic gathers all packets indiscriminately, and no
associa&acirc; <br>
tion with an access point is required. For wlan-ng and
orinoco_cs based nics, monitor mode is entered automatically
when the &rsquo;Start&rsquo; button is clicked to initiate a
capture ses&acirc; <br>
sion. Other card types must be put into monitor mode outside
of airsnort, prior to clicking Start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Choose between &quot;scan&quot;
mode to scan through all 11 802.11b channels at a regular
interval, or &quot;channel mode to monitor a specific
channel. Note that in either case it is quite pos&acirc;
<br>
sible to receive packets that bleed through from neighboring
channels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Capture Details</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Capture uses the pcap library to
receive monitor mode packets. The packets go through two
filters. First, non-encrypted packets are filtered out.
Then, if they are encrypted, use&acirc; <br>
less packets (those without a weak IV) are discarded. All
non-data packets are discarded with the exception of 802.11b
Beacon and probe response packets which are examined in
order <br>
to obtain access point SSID data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To distinguish encrypted and
non-encrypted packets, capture examines the first two bytes
of the output. Since unencrypted IP packets have a first
pair value of 0xAAAA (part of the <br>
SNAP), all of these packets get dropped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a description of what
constitutes an interesting packet please refer to the FMS
paper and its discussion of &quot;weak IVs&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Cracking Details</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cracking attempts are made in
parallel with packet capture. Currently, the cracker
attempts to crack the captured packets for both a 40 bit and
128 bit key each time 10 new weak <br>
IVs are seen for a given access point. Airsnort uses a
probabalistic attack, so, the best guess may not be the
right one. With limited captured data and enough CPU power,
you can <br>
perform more exaustive searches. The search for a key
involves a depth first traversal of an n-ary tree. The depth
of tree is 5 for 40 bit key attempts and 13 for 128 bit key
<br>
attempts. The breadth of the trees is governed by the 40 and
128 bit crack depth fields in the airsnort gui. A breadth
parameter of &rsquo;n&rsquo; instructs airsnort to try the n
most likely <br>
values at each key position using statistics derived from
the IVs that have been collected. Large breadth setting can
result in very slow processing time for crack attempts
default <br>
values of 3 for 40 bit cracks and 2 for 128 bit cracks are
recommended for starters. If a large number of weak IVs have
been gathered (&gt; 1500 if a 40 bit key is suspected, &gt;
3000 <br>
if a 128 bit key is suspected), you may want to try
increasing the breadth values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of interesting
packets needed to perform a successful crack depends on two
things; luck and key length. Assuming that luck is on your
side, the key length is the only <br>
important factor. For a key length of 128 bits, this
translates to about 1500 packets. For other key lengths,
assume 115 packets per byte of the key. Some keys are more
resistant <br>
to this technique than others and may require far more
packets. If you have a lot of packets and no key, either
wait for more packets or try a larger breadth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In any case, if the cracker
believes it has a correct password, it checks the checksum
of a random packet. If this is successful, the correct
password is printed in ASCII and Hex, <br>
and the successful crack is indicated by an &rsquo;X&rsquo;
in the leftmost column of the display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When executing the cracking
operation, crack operates with a partial key search from the
given data. Since it is a probabalistic attack, The best
guess may not be the right one, <br>
so, with limited captured data and enough CPU power, you can
perform more exaustive searches. By setting the breadth
parameter, you can specify to search &quot;worse&quot;
guesses. It is <br>
not suggested that you specify a breadth of more than three
or four.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Save and Restore</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Airsnort saves data in two
formats. All packets captured by aisrnort can be saved in
pcap dump file format by selecting the &quot;Log to
file&quot; option from the File menu. This must be <br>
done before a capture session is initiated. Airsnort can
also save a much smaller amount of data of data about a
capture session in the form of &quot;crack&quot; files.
These files repre&acirc; <br>
sent the minimum amount of data that airsnort maintains for
each access point that it discovers. Crack files contain
summary data of those packets that airsnort has seen that
<br>
actually use weak IVs. Airsnort will always ask the user to
save data to a crack file whenever the program is
terminated. By using save files, airsnort session can
effectively be <br>
paused and resumed at a later time by first loading the save
file, then starting a capture session. Restoration of data
from a pcap dump file amounts to replaying the entire
cap&acirc; <br>
ture session from which the dump file was created, all
statistics will reflect what was seen during the live
capture session. Restoration of data from a crack file will
only dis&acirc; <br>
play statistics about packets that use weak IVs, thus packet
counts are likely to be much smaller than seen during the
live capture. It is possible to load a pcap dump file and
<br>
create a corresponding crack file in order to reduce the
amount of stored data.</p>
