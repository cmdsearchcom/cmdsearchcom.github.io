<p>XWRITS(1) General Commands Manual XWRITS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xwrits - reminds you to take wrist breaks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xwrits [-display display] [typetime=time] [breaktime=time]
[other options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Xwrits reminds you to take wrist breaks for prevention or
management of repetitive stress injuries. When you should
take a break, it pops up an X window, the warning window.
You <br>
click on the warning window, then take a break. The window
changes appearance while you take the break. It changes
again when your break is over. Then you just resume typing.
<br>
Xwrits hides itself until you should take another break.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The typetime option changes the
amount of time between breaks, and the breaktime option
changes the length of a break. The defaults are 55 minutes
and 5 minutes, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xwrits&rsquo;s graphics are
brightly colored pictures of a wrist and hand. The hand
clenches and spreads &lsquo;&lsquo;as if in
pain&rsquo;&rsquo; on the warning window, slumps relaxed
during the break, and <br>
points forward valiantly when the break is over. It is
trapped behind bars while the keyboard is locked. Other
gestures are included (see the +finger option). You can also
use <br>
your own pictures: see the warning-picture, rest-picture,
and ready-picture options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, xwrits works through
annoyance -- it flashes until you stop typing. However, an
option makes it actively prevent you from typing by locking
the screen. See +lock below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xwrits notices when you leave
your workstation idle, and treats a long idle period as if
you took a break. You can turn this off with the -idle
option. With the +mouse option, it <br>
will also monitor your mouse movements -- you won&rsquo;t be
able to move the mouse during a break without aborting the
break.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each wrist break normally lasts
the same amount of time. This is what doctors suggest, but,
if you&rsquo;d like, the +quota option will reward you for
taking small breaks by reducing <br>
the length of the next official break.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some doctors recommend taking a
short &lsquo;&lsquo;microbreak&rsquo;&rsquo; every five
minutes, as well as a longer break every hour. To use xwrits
this way, just run two xwrits processes, one for the <br>
microbreaks and one for the longer breaks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESCALATION <br>
It is easy to put the warning window aside &lsquo;&lsquo;for
5 minutes&rsquo;&rsquo; and ignore it for fifty. The
after=delay option causes xwrits to escalate its activity
over time, making it harder to <br>
ignore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options following after come
into effect after you have ignored the warning window for
delay. In other words, xwrits&rsquo;s behavior escalates
after delay. For instance, with this <br>
command line, <br>
xwrits flashtime=:2 after=10 flashtime=:.03 <br>
the warning window will begin flashing very quickly if it is
ignored for 10 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any options preceding an after
option also apply following it, unless you explicitly cancel
them. For example: <br>
xwrits +finger after=10 -finger</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple after options create a
series of escalations. Delay arguments are cumulative, so
&lsquo;&lsquo;after=10 after=10&rsquo;&rsquo; means the same
as &lsquo;&lsquo;after=20&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One interesting use for after is
to make a break&rsquo;s length depend on how long you waited
to take it. For example: <br>
xwrits break=5 after=10 break=7 <br>
Here, a wrist break normally takes 5 minutes. However, if
you ignore the warning window for 10 minutes or more before
taking a break, the wrist break will last 7 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
All options may be abbreviated to their unique prefixes.
Some may be abbreviated further, in which case the smallest
legal abbreviation is shown in brackets. Options are
pro&acirc; <br>
cessed from left to right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options listed as
&lsquo;&lsquo;+option (-option)&rsquo;&rsquo; are toggles,
which can be on or off. A + turns the option on; - turns it
off. Off is the default for most toggle options, and only
the on <br>
behavior is described. You can leave off the + sign if you
like: &lsquo;&lsquo;xwrits +finger&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;xwrits finger&rsquo;&rsquo; are equivalent. Or
you can say &lsquo;&lsquo;-no-finger&rsquo;&rsquo; instead
of &lsquo;&lsquo;-finger&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many options take arguments. You
can give these after an equal sign, as in
&lsquo;&lsquo;xwrits breaktime=2&rsquo;&rsquo;. Non-optional
arguments can also be given separately, as in
&lsquo;&lsquo;xwrits breaktime <br>
2&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Time arguments are expressed in
minutes. For example, &lsquo;&lsquo;2&rsquo;&rsquo; is 2
minutes, &lsquo;&lsquo;2.5&rsquo;&rsquo; is 2 minutes 30
seconds. Use a colon to specify seconds:
&lsquo;&lsquo;2:05.4&rsquo;&rsquo; is 2 minutes 5.4 seconds,
<br>
and &lsquo;&lsquo;:5&rsquo;&rsquo; is 5 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display display <br>
Specify the X display. Xwrits monitors this display for
keystrokes and mouse movements, and displays windows on it.
You can simultaneously monitor more than one display by <br>
giving this option multiple times; for example,
&lsquo;&lsquo;xwrits display :0.0 display
fun-orgy:0.0&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+multiscreen (-multiscreen) <br>
When this option is on, xwrits will open every available
screen on each specified display. Useful for multihead
displays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typetime=time [t] <br>
Allow typing for time between breaks. Default is 55
minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">breaktime=time [b] <br>
The amount of time a break lasts. Default is 5 minutes. This
option can be supplied multiple times; see ESCALATION
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">after=delay-time <br>
See ESCALATION above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bars-picture=file [bp=file] <br>
Sets the background GIF image that appears while the screen
is locked. By default, this is an image of bars designed to
work with the usual lock-picture. If you specify your <br>
own lock-picture, however, bars-picture defaults to a black
screen. (Say
&lsquo;&lsquo;bars-picture=&quot;&amp;bars&quot;&rsquo;&rsquo;
to keep the bars.) Animations are not acceptable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+beep (-beep) <br>
Xwrits will beep when the break should begin and again when
it is over.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+breakclock (-breakclock) [bc]
<br>
A clock will appear in the resting window showing how many
minutes remain in the wrist break.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">canceltime=time [ct] <br>
Allow typing for time after a break is cancelled. You cancel
a break by deleting all xwrits windows with your window
manager. This time should probably be less than the
reg&acirc; <br>
ular type time. Default is 10 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+cheat[=num] (-cheat) <br>
Allows you to cheat during a break. You can type num
keystrokes before xwrits cancels the break. Default for num
is 5. (If you&rsquo;re using +mouse, mouse movements also
count as <br>
keystrokes.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+clock (-clock) [c] <br>
A clock will appear in the warning window showing how many
minutes you&rsquo;ve put off the wrist break.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+finger (-finger) [f] <br>
The warning window will be rude to you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+finger=culture <br>
The warning window will be rude to you, according to
culture&rsquo;s idea of rudeness. Possible values for
culture are &lsquo;american&rsquo; (the default),
&lsquo;korean&rsquo; (synonyms &lsquo;japanese&rsquo; and
<br>
&lsquo;russian&rsquo;), &lsquo;german&rsquo;, or the name of
any GIF image file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flashtime=time <br>
The amount of time between flashes of the warning window.
Default is 2 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+flipoff (-flipoff) <br>
Synonym for +finger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+iconified (-iconified) <br>
The warning window will initially appear as an icon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+idle[=idletime] (-idle) [i]
<br>
If you leave your workstation idle for idletime or longer,
xwrits will behave as if you took a break. The default for
idletime is the break length (see breaktime above). <br>
idle is on by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+lock[=jump-time] (-lock) <br>
Xwrits will lock your screen until your break is over. You
can prematurely disable the lock and get a normal warning
window by typing your password (see password below). The
<br>
jump-time argument specifies how fast the screensaver will
move; default is 4 seconds. If the keyboard has been grabbed
by another application when the lock is attempted, <br>
the lock fails and a normal warning window appears
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lock-picture=file [lp=file] <br>
Sets the GIF image that appears while the screen is locked.
Animations are acceptable. See also bars-picture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxhands=num <br>
No more than num warning windows will appear on your screen
simultaneously. Normally, there will be only one warning
window, but see +multiply below. Num cannot be less than
<br>
1, or more than 137. Default is 25.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minbreaktime=time <br>
Sets the minimum break length to time. This option is
meaningful when +quota is on (see below); no matter how many
short breaks you take, the break length will not be
short&acirc; <br>
ened below time. It defaults to half the break time or the
quota time, whichever is larger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mono (-mono) <br>
Xwrits will display its graphics in black and white. This
may be useful if you live in a world with a limited
colormap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+mouse[=sensitivity] (-mouse)
<br>
Xwrits will monitor your mouse movements. Every couple
seconds, it checks whether the mouse has moved. Movements of
more than sensitivity pixels in any direction are treated
<br>
like key presses. Default for sensitivity is 15 pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+multiply[=breed-time]
(-multiply) [m] <br>
A new warning window will be created every breed-time.
Default for breed-time is 2.3 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+noiconify (-noiconify) <br>
The warning window will not allow itself to be
iconified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+once[=count] <br>
Put up the warning window once, or (with count) count times,
then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password=password <br>
The password you type to unlock a locked screen (see +lock
above). Xwrits does not protect this password from
intruders. Therefore, do not use your login password or any
<br>
other password you must keep secure. Default is
&lsquo;&lsquo;quit&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+quota[=time] (-quota) <br>
If you leave your workstation idle for more than time, the
idle time is deducted from the length of your next break.
This option turns the break length into a break quota --
<br>
instead of resting for breaktime consecutive minutes every
typetime, you must rest for a total of breaktime minutes per
typetime. Default for time is 1 minute. See also min&acirc;
<br>
breaktime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ready-picture=file [okp=file]
<br>
Sets the image that appears when your break is over to an
arbitrary GIF. Animations are acceptable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rest-picture=file [rp=file] <br>
Sets the image that appears during your break to an
arbitrary GIF. Animations are acceptable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">title=text <br>
Xwrits windows will have text for their title, instead of
the default &lsquo;&lsquo;xwrits&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+top (-top) <br>
The warning window will try to keep itself above all other
windows on the desktop. (Note: it can be fooled into staying
only partially visible.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+verbose (-verbose) <br>
Xwrits will print a lot of information about the windows on
which it is listening for keystrokes. This is mostly useful
for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version <br>
Prints the version number and some quickie warranty
information and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warning-picture=file [wp=file]
<br>
Sets the image that appears on the warning window to an
arbitrary GIF. Animations are acceptable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Here is the way I run xwrits: <br>
xwrits typetime=40 finger after 15 clock multiply=5:1.4 <br>
This looks pretty spectacular: <br>
xwrits t=0 b=:2 f fla=:.5 m=:.31 max=100 -i <br>
Whee!!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Xwrits does not use the X resource database at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More options might be nice. So
might more careful screen locking and password protection. I
would like to include rude finger gestures from other
cultures (see the GESTURES file <br>
in the distribution for gestures I know about so far).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please send any bugs, comments,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Yes the misspelling is
intentional.</p>
