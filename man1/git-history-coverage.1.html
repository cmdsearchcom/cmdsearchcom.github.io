<p>GIT-HISTORY-COVERAGE(1) Greg Banks
GIT-HISTORY-COVERAGE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-history-coverage - summarise test coverage for recent
git commits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git-history-coverage [options] rev-list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Git-history-coverage extracts test coverage data produced by
C and C++ programs compiled with gcc --coverage, and
correlates it to git commits, printing a coverage summary
which <br>
shows how well tested recent code changes have been. This is
useful for nightly builds and Continuous Integration systems
such as Jenkins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the output of
git-history-coverage to make any sense, the coverage data
must be generated by running code which corresponds to the
last commit in the range specified by rev- <br>
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used without any options,
git-history-coverage prints three summaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">overall <br>
A summary of all the commits specified by rev-list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">by author <br>
A summary split up by each author represented in the set of
commits specified by rev-list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">by commit <br>
A summary for each individual commit in the set of commits
specified by rev-list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each of these summaries,
git-history-coverage prints statistics showing how many
lines of code were in the commits, how many lines represent
executable code (as opposed to <br>
comments, test code, or infrastructure like Makefiles), and
how many lines were actually executed in tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--summary-overall <br>
Print the overall summary (with no options, all three
summaries are printed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--summary-by-author <br>
Print the by author summary (with no options, all three
summaries are printed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--summary-by-commit <br>
Print the by commit summary (with no options, all three
summaries are printed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gcda-prefix=dir <br>
Look for .gcda files underneath the directory dir. This
option is used to read runtime coverage information written
when a test program is run using the same --gcda-pre&acirc;
<br>
fix option to ggcov-run.</p>
