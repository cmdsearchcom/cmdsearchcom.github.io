<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
polymerge - merge coincident vertices, collinear edges,
coplanar faces in an OOGL OFF object</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
polymerge [-v vertex_thresh] [-e edge_thresh] [-f
face_thresh] [-V] [-E] [-F] [-d] [-b] [inputfile.off]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Polymerge eliminates redundancies from polyhedral objects in
OOGL&rsquo;s OFF format, and writes another OFF object to
its standard output. (Optionally it can produce instead an
input <br>
file for Brakke&rsquo;s Evolver.) Specifically, it combines
nearly-coincident vertices, nearly-collinear edges, and
nearly-coplanar faces. Vertices which aren&rsquo;t used on
any face are <br>
deleted, as are faces with less than three vertices.
Thresholds for approximate equality are adjustable from the
command line. Options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v vertex_thresh <br>
Merge vertices when they&rsquo;re closer than vertex_thresh
apart; the default is .00001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Don&rsquo;t attempt to merge
vertices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e edge_thresh <br>
Merge edges where |sin(vertex_angle)| &lt; edge_thresh; the
default is When edges are merged, the corresponding vertex
is removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Don&rsquo;t attempt to merge
edges. (4OFF edges are never merged.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f face_thresh <br>
Merge faces sharing an edge where the faces are nearly
coplanar: when |sin(angle_between_face_normal_vectors)| &lt;
face_thresh. The default is .03, or about two degrees. <br>
Note that merging can create faces which are concave
polygons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Don&rsquo;t attempt to merge
faces. (4OFF faces are never merged.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Produce an output file in .fe
format for Brakke&rsquo;s Surface Evolver, instead of a new
OFF file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Include debugging information
as comments in the new OFF object. The comments indicate
which vertices and faces in the original object correspond
to which in the new one. <br>
Messages include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Vtx nnn-&gt;mmm <br>
Merged vertices nnn and mmm (both indices in the original
object).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Merged face nnn into mmm
(vertices vvv www) n1.n2 s <br>
Faces nnn and mmm in the original object were merged; their
common edge joined original vertices vvv and www. The cosine
of the angle between the face normals was s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vertex coordinates # newvertno
[order] # oldvertno <br>
Each vertex written appears with its new index, its order
(number of edges touching that vertex), and its old index
(index of a corresponding vertex in the original <br>
object).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">face description # oldvertno ...
<br>
For each new face, with N vertices after reduction, the
comment indicates N corresponding vertices in the original
object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Coplanar faces are merged even if they were assigned
different colors. Should be able to handle binary OFF
objects, but this hasn&rsquo;t been tested.</p>
