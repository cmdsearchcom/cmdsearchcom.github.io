<p>SSH-INSTALLKEYS(1) Internet SSH-INSTALLKEYS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
_ssh-installkeys - install ssh keys on local and remote
servers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ssh-installkeys [-h] [-c] [-p port] [-d] [-v]
name@host...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This script tries to export ssh public keys to a specified
site. It will walk the user through generating key pairs if
it doesn&rsquo;t find any to export. It handles all the
fiddly <br>
details, like remembering the ssh keyfile names and making
sure local and remote permissions are correct. It tells you
what it&rsquo;s doing if it has to change anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name@host argument is the
name of the host where your public keys should be installed.
If it contains a @, the part before the @ will be clipped
off and used as the login <br>
name. Otherwise your local login name will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: this script does not parse
your ssh configuration &acirc; therefore, if you have
specified a different remote user in your configuration,
this script will not know that. You can <br>
use the user@host syntax to force the remote username.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RECORDING REMOTE KEY LOCATIONS
<br>
If either of the files ~/.config/ssh/installkeys or
~/.ssh/installkeys exists, places where you install keys
will be recorded in it. This record will also be updated
when you use <br>
the check option, so you can use that option to check sites
where you may have previously installed keys and add them to
the list. Entries are removed when you delete remote <br>
keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beware that if your account is
cracked, this record will offer the intruder a menu of other
systems to attack, escalating security risks. Thus, to
enable the recording feature, <br>
you must explicitly create ~/.ssh/installkeys using touch(1)
or some other means. This tool will not create the file for
you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Invoked with the -h option, the program prints a usage
summary and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invoked with the -c option, the
program checks your local and remote ssh configuration for
problems without changing anything (except that your record
of where you have installed <br>
keys is updated).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -p option allows you to set
a port number, overriding the default 22. This may be useful
if you have a firewall and port forwarding setup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invoked with the -d option, the
program deletes any public keys under the specified login at
the specified host. The configuration entries for any such
keys are also removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -v option says to report all
commands and responses during the session. It&rsquo;s mainly
useful for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Sites where keys have been installed may be recorded in
~/.ssh-installkeys or ~/.config/ssh-installkeys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIREMENTS <br>
ssh-installkeys was written in Python 2.2a1. It will not
work under Python 1.5.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
This program relies on ptys to work correctly in combination
with exec, but some implementations (notably under FreeBSD)
don&rsquo;t. Suspect this if you see termination with the
<br>
message &quot;Remote ls returned empty string, bailing
out&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you encounter this or any
other bug, the first thing to do is run with -v and see if
that clarifies matters. If not, send the maintainer a
session transcript.</p>
