_ssh-installkeys - install ssh keys on local and remote servers
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<div class="Pp" style="margin-left: 16.00ex; text-indent: -16.00ex;"><b>ssh-installkeys</b>
  [-h] [-c] [-p&#x00A0; <i>port</i>] [-d] [-v] <i>name@host</i>...</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This script tries to export ssh public keys to a specified site. It will walk
  the user through generating key pairs if it doesn't find any to export. It
  handles all the fiddly details, like remembering the ssh keyfile names and
  making sure local and remote permissions are correct. It tells you what it's
  doing if it has to change anything.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The name@host argument is the name of the host where your public keys should be
  installed. If it contains a @, the part before the @ will be clipped off and
  used as the login name. Otherwise your local login name will be used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note: this script does not parse your ssh configuration &#x2014; therefore, if
  you have specified a different remote user in your configuration, this script
  will not know that. You can use the user@host syntax to force the remote
  username.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RECORDING_REMOTE_KEY_LOCATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#RECORDING_REMOTE_KEY_LOCATIONS">RECORDING
  REMOTE KEY LOCATIONS</a></h1>
If either of the files ~/.config/ssh/installkeys or ~/.ssh/installkeys exists,
  places where you install keys will be recorded in it. This record will also be
  updated when you use the check option, so you can use that option to check
  sites where you may have previously installed keys and add them to the list.
  Entries are removed when you delete remote keys.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Beware that if your account is cracked, this record will offer the intruder a
  menu of other systems to attack, escalating security risks. Thus, to enable
  the recording feature, you must explicitly create ~/.ssh/installkeys using
  <b>touch</b>(1) or some other means. This tool will not create the file for
  you.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
Invoked with the <b>-h</b> option, the program prints a usage summary and exits.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Invoked with the <b>-c</b> option, the program checks your local and remote ssh
  configuration for problems without changing anything (except that your record
  of where you have installed keys is updated).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The -p option allows you to set a port number, overriding the default 22. This
  may be useful if you have a firewall and port forwarding setup.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Invoked with the <b>-d</b> option, the program deletes any public keys under the
  specified login at the specified host. The configuration entries for any such
  keys are also removed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-v</b> option says to report all commands and responses during the
  session. It's mainly useful for debugging.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></h1>
Sites where keys have been installed may be recorded in ~/.ssh-installkeys or
  ~/.config/ssh-installkeys.

<b>ssh-installkeys</b> was written in Python 2.2a1. It will not work under
  Python 1.5.2.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
This program relies on ptys to work correctly in combination with exec, but some
  implementations (notably under FreeBSD) don't. Suspect this if you see
  termination with the message &quot;Remote ls returned empty string, bailing
  out&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you encounter this or any other bug, the first thing to do is run with -v and
  see if that clarifies matters. If not, send the maintainer a session
  transcript.
