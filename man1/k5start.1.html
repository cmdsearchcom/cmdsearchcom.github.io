<p style="margin-top: 1em">k5start -U -f keytab
[-abFhLnPqstvx] [-c child pid file] <br>
[-g group] [-H minutes] [-I service instance] <br>
[-K minutes] [-k ticket cache] [-l time string] <br>
[-m mode] [-o owner] [-p pid file] <br>
[-r service realm] [-S service name] [command ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
k5start obtains and caches an initial Kerberos
ticket-granting ticket for a principal. k5start can be used
as an alternative to kinit, but it is primarily intended to
be used by <br>
programs that want to use a keytab to obtain Kerberos
credentials, such as a web server that needs to authenticate
to another service such as an LDAP server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, the principal for
which to give tickets should be specified as the first
argument. principal may be either just a principal name
(including the optional instance) or a <br>
full principal and realm string. The -u and -i options can
be used as an alternative mechanism for specifying the
principal, but generally aren&rsquo;t as convenient. If no
principal <br>
is given as either the first argument or the argument to the
-u option, the client principal defaults to the Unix
username of the user running k5start in the default local
realm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optionally, a command may be
given on the command line of k5start. If so, that command is
run after Kerberos authentication (and running aklog if
desired), with the appropriate <br>
environment variables set to point it to the right ticket
cache. k5start will then continue running, waking up
periodically to refresh credentials slightly before they
would <br>
expire, until the command completes. (The frequency with
which it wakes up to refresh credentials can still be
controlled with the -K option.) To run in this mode, the
<br>
principal must either be specified as a regular command-line
argument or via the -U option; the -u and -i options may not
be used. Also, a keytab must be specified with -f to <br>
run a specific command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command will not be run
using the shell, so if you want to use shell metacharacters
in the command with their special meaning, give &quot;sh -c
command&quot; as the command to run and <br>
quote command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the command contains
command-line options (like &quot;-c&quot;), put -- on the
command line before the beginning of the command to tell
k5start to not parse those options as its own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running a command, k5start
propagates HUP, TERM, INT, and QUIT signals to the child
process and does not exit when those signals are received.
(If the propagated signal <br>
causes the child process to exit, k5start will then exit.)
This allows k5start to react properly when run under a
command supervision system such as runit(8) or svscan(8)
that <br>
uses signals to control supervised commands, and to run
interactive commands that should receive Ctrl-C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a running k5start receives an
ALRM signal, it immediately refreshes the ticket cache
regardless of whether it is in danger of expiring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If k5start is run with a command
or the -K flag and the -x flag is not given, it will keep
trying even if the initial authentication fails. It will
retry the initial <br>
authentication immediately and then with exponential backoff
to once per minute, and keep trying until authentication
succeeds or it is killed. The command, if any, will not be
<br>
started until authentication succeeds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a When run with either the -K flag or a command, always
renew tickets each time k5start wakes up. Without this
option, k5start will only try to renew a ticket as often as
<br>
necessary to prevent the ticket from expiring. With this
option, k5start will renew tickets according to the interval
specified with the -K flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This behavior probably should
have been the default behavior of -K. The default was not
changed to avoid changes for existing users, but for new
applications, consider <br>
always using -a with -K.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is important if
another program is manipulating the ticket cache that
k5start is using. For example, if another program is
automatically renewing a ticket more <br>
frequently than k5start, then k5start will never see a
ticket that is close to expiring and will therefore, by
default, never try to renew the ticket. This means that <br>
k5start will also never renew AFS tokens, even if the -t
option was given, since k5start only renews AFS tokens after
it successfully renews a ticket. If this option is <br>
specified in such a situation, k5start will renew its ticket
every time it checks the ticket, so AFS tokens will be
renewed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This argument is only valid in
combination with either -K or a command to run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b After starting, detach from
the controlling terminal and run in the background. This
option only makes sense in combination with -K or a command
that k5start will be running <br>
and can only be used if a keytab is specified with -f.
k5start will not background itself until after it has tried
authenticating once, so that any initial errors will be <br>
reported, but it will then redirect output to /dev/null and
no subsequent errors will be reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this flag is given, k5start
will also change directories to &quot;/&quot;. All paths
(such as to a command to run or a PID file) should therefore
be given as absolute, not <br>
relative, paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If used in conjunction with a
command to run, that command will also run in the background
and will also have its input and output redirected to
/dev/null. It will have to <br>
report any errors via some other mechanism for the errors to
be seen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that on Mac OS X, the
default ticket cache type is per-session and using the -b
flag will disassociate k5start from the existing ticket
cache. When using -b in <br>
conjunction with -K on Mac OS X, you probably also want to
use the -k flag to specify a ticket cache file and force the
use of a file cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using this option, consider
also using -L to report k5start errors to syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c child pid file <br>
Save the process ID (PID) of the child process into child
pid file. child pid file is created if it doesn&rsquo;t
exist and overwritten if it does exist. This option is only
<br>
allowed when a command was given on the command line and is
most useful in conjunction with -b to allow management of
the running child process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that, when used with -b,
the PID file is written out after k5start is backgrounded
and changes its working directory to /, so relative paths
for the PID file will be <br>
relative to / (probably not what you want).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Do not get forwardable
tickets even if the local configuration says to get
forwardable tickets by default. Without this flag, k5start
does whatever the library default is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f keytab <br>
Authenticate using the keytab keytab rather than asking for
a password. A key for the client principal must be present
in keytab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g group <br>
After creating the ticket cache, change its group ownership
to group, which may be either the name of a group or a
numeric group ID. Ticket caches are created with 0600 <br>
permissions by default, so this will have no useful effect
unless used with -m.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H minutes <br>
Check for a happy ticket, defined as one that has a
remaining lifetime of at least minutes minutes. If such a
ticket is found, do not attempt authentication. Instead,
just <br>
run the command (if one was specified) or exit immediately
with status 0 (if none was). Otherwise, try to obtain a new
ticket and then run the command, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -H is used with -t, the
external program will always be run even if a ticket with a
sufficient remaining lifetime was found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -H is used with -K, k5start
will not exit immediately. Instead, the specified remaining
lifetime will replace the default value of two minutes,
meaning that k5start will <br>
ensure, each time it wakes up, that the ticket has a
remaining lifetime of the minutes argument. This is an
alternative to -a to ensure that tickets always have a
certain <br>
minimal amount of lifetime remaining.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display a usage message and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I service instance <br>
The instance portion of the service principal. The default
is the default realm of the machine. Note that unlike the
client principal, a non-default service principal must <br>
be specified with -I and -S; one cannot provide the instance
portion as part of the argument to -S.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i client instance <br>
Specifies the instance portion of the principal. This option
doesn&rsquo;t make sense except in combination with -u. Note
that the instance can be specified as part of username <br>
through the normal convention of appending a slash and then
the instance, so one never has to use this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K minutes <br>
Run in daemon mode to keep a ticket alive indefinitely. The
program reawakens after minutes minutes, checks if the
ticket will expire before or less than two minutes after
<br>
the next scheduled check, and gets a new ticket if needed.
(In other words, it ensures that the ticket will always have
a remaining lifetime of at least two minutes.) If <br>
the -H flag is also given, the lifetime specified by it
replaces the two minute default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is not given but
a command was given on the command line, the default
interval is 60 minutes (1 hour).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an error occurs in refreshing
the ticket cache, the wake-up interval will be shortened to
one minute and the operation retried at that interval for as
long as the error <br>
persists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k ticket cache <br>
Use ticket cache as the ticket cache rather than the
contents of the environment variable KRB5CCNAME or the
library default. ticket cache may be any ticket cache
identifier <br>
recognized by the underlying Kerberos libraries. This
generally supports a path to a file, with or without a
leading &quot;FILE:&quot; string, but may also support other
ticket cache <br>
types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any of -o, -g, or -m are
given, ticket cache must be either a simple path to a file
or start with &quot;FILE:&quot; or &quot;WRFILE:&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Report messages to syslog as
well as to standard output or standard error. All messages
will be logged with facility LOG_DAEMON. Regular messages
that are displayed on <br>
standard output are logged with level LOG_NOTICE. Errors
that don&rsquo;t cause k5start to terminate are logged with
level LOG_WARNING. Fatal errors are logged with level <br>
LOG_ERR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is useful when debugging
problems in combination with -b.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l time string <br>
Set the ticket lifetime. time string should be in a format
recognized by the Kerberos libraries for specifying times,
such as &quot;10h&quot; (ten hours) or &quot;10m&quot; (ten
minutes). <br>
Known units are &quot;s&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;h&quot;,
and &quot;d&quot;. For more information, see kinit(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m mode <br>
After creating the ticket cache, change its file permissions
to mode, which must be a file mode in octal (640 or 444, for
example).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting a mode that does not
allow k5start to read or write to the ticket cache will
cause k5start to fail and exit when using the -K option or
running a command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Ignored, present for option
compatibility with the now-obsolete k4start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o owner <br>
After creating the ticket cache, change its ownership to
owner, which may be either the name of a user or a numeric
user ID. If owner is the name of a user and -g was not <br>
also given, also change the group ownership of the ticket
cache to the default group for that user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Do not get proxiable tickets
even if the local configuration says to get proxiable
tickets by default. Without this flag, k5start does whatever
the library default is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pid file <br>
Save the process ID (PID) of the running k5start process
into pid file. pid file is created if it doesn&rsquo;t exist
and overwritten if it does exist. This option is most useful
<br>
in conjunction with -b to allow management of the running
k5start daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that, when used with -b the
PID file is written out after k5start is backgrounded and
changes its working directory to /, so relative paths for
the PID file will be <br>
relative to / (probably not what you want).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet. Suppresses the
printing of the initial banner message saying what Kerberos
principal tickets are being obtained for, and also
suppresses the password prompt when the <br>
-s option is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r service realm <br>
The realm for the service principal. This defaults to the
default local realm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S service name <br>
Specifies the principal for which k5start is getting a
service ticket. The default value is &quot;krbtgt&quot;, to
obtain a ticket-granting ticket. This option (along with -I)
may be <br>
used if one only needs access to a single service. Note that
unlike the client principal, a non-default service principal
must be specified with both -S and -I; one cannot <br>
provide the instance portion as part of the argument to
-S.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Read the password from
standard input. This bypasses the normal password prompt,
which means echo isn&rsquo;t suppressed and input
isn&rsquo;t forced to be from the controlling <br>
terminal. Most uses of this option are a security risk. You
normally want to use a keytab and the -f option instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Run an external program after
getting a ticket. The default use of this is to run aklog to
get a token. If the environment variable KINIT_PROG is set,
it overrides the <br>
compiled-in default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If k5start has been built with
AFS setpag() support and a command was given on the command
line, k5start will create a new PAG before obtaining AFS
tokens. Otherwise, it <br>
will obtain tokens in the current PAG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Rather than requiring the
authentication principal be given on the command line, read
it from the keytab specified with -f. The principal will be
taken from the first entry <br>
in the keytab. -f must be specified if this option is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When -U is given, k5start will
not expect a principal name to be given on the command line,
and any arguments after the options will be taken as a
command to run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u client principal <br>
This specifies the principal to obtain credentials as. The
entire principal may be specified here, or alternatively
just the first portion may be specified with this flag <br>
and the instance specified with -i.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that there&rsquo;s normally
no reason to use this flag rather than simply giving the
principal on the command line as the first regular
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Be verbose. This will print
out a bit of additional information about what is being
attempted and what the results are.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Exit immediately on any
error. Normally, when running a command or when run with the
-K option, k5start keeps running even if it fails to refresh
the ticket cache and will <br>
try again at the next check interval. With this option,
k5start will instead exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
The program exits with status 0 if it successfully gets a
ticket or has a happy ticket (see -H). If k5start runs aklog
or some other program k5start returns the exit status of
<br>
that program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Use the /etc/krb5.keytab keytab to obtain a ticket granting
ticket for the principal host/example.com, putting the
ticket cache in /tmp/service.tkt. The lifetime is 10 hours
and <br>
the program wakes up every 10 minutes to check if the ticket
is about to expire.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">k5start -k /tmp/service.tkt -f
/etc/krb5.keytab -K 10 -l 10h host/example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do the same, but using the
default ticket cache and run the command
/usr/local/bin/auth-backup. k5start will continue running
until the command finishes. If the initial <br>
authentication fails, keep trying, and don&rsquo;t start the
command until it succeeds. This could be used during system
startup for a command that must have valid tickets before
<br>
starting, and tolerates having k5start start before the
network is completely set up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">k5start -f /etc/krb5.keytab -K
10 -l 10h host/example.com /usr/local/bin/auth-backup</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shows the permissions of the
temporary cache file created by k5start:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">k5start -f /etc/krb5.keytab
host/example.com -- sh -c &rsquo;ls -l
$KRB5CCNAME&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice the &quot;--&quot; before
the command to keep k5start from parsing the &quot;-c&quot;
as its own option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do the same thing, but determine
the principal from the keytab:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">k5start -f /etc/krb5.keytab -U
-- sh -c &rsquo;ls -l $KRB5CCNAME&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that no principal is given
before the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starts k5start as a daemon using
the Debian start-stop-daemon management program. This is the
sort of line that one could put into a Debian init
script:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start-stop-daemon --start
--pidfile /var/run/k5start.pid --exec /usr/local/bin/k5start
-- -b -p /var/run/k5start.pid -f /etc/krb5.keytab
host/example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This uses /var/run/k5start.pid
as the PID file and obtains host/example.com tickets from
the system keytab file. k5start would then be stopped
with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start-stop-daemon --stop
--pidfile /var/run/k5start.pid <br>
rm -f /var/run/k5start.pid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This code could be added to an
init script for Apache, for example, to start a k5start
process alongside Apache to manage its Kerberos
credentials.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
If the environment variable AKLOG is set, its value will be
used as the program to run with -t rather than the default
complied into k5start. If AKLOG is not set and KINIT_PROG
<br>
is set, its value will be used instead. KINIT_PROG is
honored for backward compatibility but its use is not
recommended due to its confusing name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no ticket file (with -k) or
command is specified on the command line, k5start will use
the environment variable KRB5CCNAME to determine the
location of the the ticket granting <br>
ticket. If either a command is specified or the -k option is
used, KRB5CCNAME will be set to point to the ticket file
before running the aklog program or any command given on
<br>
the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
The default ticket cache is determined by the underlying
Kerberos libraries. The default path for aklog is determined
at build time, and will normally be whichever of aklog or
<br>
afslog is found in the user&rsquo;s path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a command is specified and -k
was not given, k5start will create a temporary ticket cache
file of the form &quot;/tmp/krb5cc_%d_%s&quot; where %d is
the UID k5start is running as and %s <br>
is a random string.</p>
