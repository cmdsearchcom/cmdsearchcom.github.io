<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>k5start</b> obtains and caches an initial Kerberos ticket-granting ticket for
  a principal. <b>k5start</b> can be used as an alternative to <b>kinit</b>, but
  it is primarily intended to be used by programs that want to use a keytab to
  obtain Kerberos credentials, such as a web server that needs to authenticate
  to another service such as an LDAP server.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally, the principal for which to give tickets should be specified as the
  first argument. <i>principal</i> may be either just a principal name
  (including the optional instance) or a full principal and realm string. The
  <b>-u</b> and <b>-i</b> options can be used as an alternative mechanism for
  specifying the principal, but generally aren't as convenient. If no principal
  is given as either the first argument or the argument to the <b>-u</b> option,
  the client principal defaults to the Unix username of the user running
  <b>k5start</b> in the default local realm.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Optionally, a command may be given on the command line of <b>k5start</b>. If so,
  that command is run after Kerberos authentication (and running <b>aklog</b> if
  desired), with the appropriate environment variables set to point it to the
  right ticket cache. <b>k5start</b> will then continue running, waking up
  periodically to refresh credentials slightly before they would expire, until
  the command completes. (The frequency with which it wakes up to refresh
  credentials can still be controlled with the <b>-K</b> option.) To run in this
  mode, the principal must either be specified as a regular command-line
  argument or via the <b>-U</b> option; the <b>-u</b> and <b>-i</b> options may
  not be used. Also, a keytab must be specified with <b>-f</b> to run a specific
  command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The command will not be run using the shell, so if you want to use shell
  metacharacters in the command with their special meaning, give &quot;sh -c
  <i>command</i>&quot; as the command to run and quote <i>command</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the command contains command-line options (like &quot;-c&quot;), put -- on
  the command line before the beginning of the command to tell <b>k5start</b> to
  not parse those options as its own.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When running a command, <b>k5start</b> propagates HUP, TERM, INT, and QUIT
  signals to the child process and does not exit when those signals are
  received. (If the propagated signal causes the child process to exit,
  <b>k5start</b> will then exit.) This allows <b>k5start</b> to react properly
  when run under a command supervision system such as <i>runit</i>(8) or
  <i>svscan</i>(8) that uses signals to control supervised commands, and to run
  interactive commands that should receive Ctrl-C.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a running <b>k5start</b> receives an ALRM signal, it immediately refreshes
  the ticket cache regardless of whether it is in danger of expiring.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>k5start</b> is run with a command or the <b>-K</b> flag and the <b>-x</b>
  flag is not given, it will keep trying even if the initial authentication
  fails. It will retry the initial authentication immediately and then with
  exponential backoff to once per minute, and keep trying until authentication
  succeeds or it is killed. The command, if any, will not be started until
  authentication succeeds.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-a</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When run with either the <b>-K</b> flag or a command,
      always renew tickets each time <b>k5start</b> wakes up. Without this
      option, <b>k5start</b> will only try to renew a ticket as often as
      necessary to prevent the ticket from expiring. With this option,
      <b>k5start</b> will renew tickets according to the interval specified with
      the <b>-K</b> flag.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This behavior probably should have been the default behavior of <b>-K</b>.
      The default was not changed to avoid changes for existing users, but for
      new applications, consider always using <b>-a</b> with <b>-K</b>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This option is important if another program is manipulating the ticket cache
      that <b>k5start</b> is using. For example, if another program is
      automatically renewing a ticket more frequently than <b>k5start</b>, then
      <b>k5start</b> will never see a ticket that is close to expiring and will
      therefore, by default, never try to renew the ticket. This means that
      <b>k5start</b> will also never renew AFS tokens, even if the <b>-t</b>
      option was given, since <b>k5start</b> only renews AFS tokens after it
      successfully renews a ticket. If this option is specified in such a
      situation, <b>k5start</b> will renew its ticket every time it checks the
      ticket, so AFS tokens will be renewed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This argument is only valid in combination with either <b>-K</b> or a
      command to run.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-b</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">After starting, detach from the controlling terminal and
      run in the background. This option only makes sense in combination with
      <b>-K</b> or a command that <b>k5start</b> will be running and can only be
      used if a keytab is specified with <i>-f</i>. <b>k5start</b> will not
      background itself until after it has tried authenticating once, so that
      any initial errors will be reported, but it will then redirect output to
      <i>/dev/null</i> and no subsequent errors will be reported.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If this flag is given, <b>k5start</b> will also change directories to
      &quot;/&quot;. All paths (such as to a command to run or a PID file)
      should therefore be given as absolute, not relative, paths.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If used in conjunction with a command to run, that command will also run in
      the background and will also have its input and output redirected to
      <i>/dev/null</i>. It will have to report any errors via some other
      mechanism for the errors to be seen.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that on Mac OS X, the default ticket cache type is per-session and
      using the <b>-b</b> flag will disassociate <b>k5start</b> from the
      existing ticket cache. When using <b>-b</b> in conjunction with <b>-K</b>
      on Mac OS X, you probably also want to use the <b>-k</b> flag to specify a
      ticket cache file and force the use of a file cache.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When using this option, consider also using <b>-L</b> to report
      <b>k5start</b> errors to syslog.</dd>

    start-stop-daemon --start --pidfile /var/run/k5start.pid \
        --exec /usr/local/bin/k5start -- -b -p /var/run/k5start.pid \

This uses <i>/var/run/k5start.pid</i> as the PID file and obtains
  host/example.com tickets from the system keytab file. <b>k5start</b> would
  then be stopped with:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    start-stop-daemon --stop --pidfile /var/run/k5start.pid
    rm -f /var/run/k5start.pid
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This code could be added to an init script for Apache, for example, to start a
  <b>k5start</b> process alongside Apache to manage its Kerberos credentials.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
If the environment variable AKLOG is set, its value will be used as the program
  to run with <b>-t</b> rather than the default complied into <b>k5start</b>. If
  AKLOG is not set and KINIT_PROG is set, its value will be used instead.
  KINIT_PROG is honored for backward compatibility but its use is not
  recommended due to its confusing name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If no ticket file (with <b>-k</b>) or command is specified on the command line,
  <b>k5start</b> will use the environment variable KRB5CCNAME to determine the
  location of the the ticket granting ticket. If either a command is specified
  or the <b>-k</b> option is used, KRB5CCNAME will be set to point to the ticket
  file before running the <b>aklog</b> program or any command given on the
  command line.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></h1>
The default ticket cache is determined by the underlying Kerberos libraries. The
  default path for aklog is determined at build time, and will normally be
  whichever of <b>aklog</b> or <b>afslog</b> is found in the user's path.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a command is specified and <b>-k</b> was not given, <b>k5start</b> will
  create a temporary ticket cache file of the form &quot;/tmp/krb5cc_%d_%s&quot;
  where %d is the UID <b>k5start</b> is running as and %s is a random string.

<b>k5start</b> was based on the k4start code written by Robert Morgan. It was
  ported to Kerberos v5 by Booker C. Bense. Additional cleanup and current
  maintenance are done by Russ Allbery &lt;eagle@eyrie.org&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Implementations of <b>-b</b> and <b>-p</b> and the example for a Debian init
  script are based on code contributed by Navid Golpayegani.
