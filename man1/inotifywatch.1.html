<p>inotifywatch(1) General Commands Manual
inotifywatch(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
inotifywatch - gather filesystem access statistics using
inotify</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
inotifywatch [-hvzrqf] [-e &lt;event&gt; ] [-t
&lt;seconds&gt; ] [-a &lt;event&gt; ] [-d &lt;event&gt; ]
&lt;file&gt; [ ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
inotifywatch listens for filesystem events using
Linux&rsquo;s inotify(7) interface, then outputs a summary
count of the events received on each file or directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT <br>
inotifywatch will output a table on standard out with one
column for each type of event and one row for each watched
file or directory. The table will show the amount of times
<br>
each event occurred for each watched file or directory.
Output can be sorted by a particular event using the -a or
-d options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some diagnostic information will
be output on standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h, --help <br>
Output some helpful usage information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Output some extra information on standard error during
execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@&lt;file&gt; <br>
When watching a directory tree recursively, exclude the
specified file from being watched. The file must be
specified with a relative or absolute path according to <br>
whether a relative or absolute path is given for watched
directories. If a specific path is explicitly both included
and excluded, it will always be watched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: If you need to watch a
directory or file whose name starts with @, give the
absolute path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fromfile &lt;file&gt; <br>
Read filenames to watch or exclude from a file, one filename
per line. If filenames begin with @ they are excluded as
described above. If &lt;file&gt; is &lsquo;-&rsquo;,
filenames are <br>
read from standard input. Use this option if you need to
watch too many files to pass in as command line
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --zero <br>
Output table rows and columns even if all elements are zero.
By default, rows and columns are only output if they contain
non-zero elements. Using this option when <br>
watching for every event on a lot of files can result in a
lot of output!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude &lt;pattern&gt; <br>
Do not process any events whose filename matches the
specified POSIX extended regular expression, case
sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--excludei &lt;pattern&gt; <br>
Do not process any events whose filename matches the
specified POSIX extended regular expression, case
insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --recursive <br>
Watch all subdirectories of any directories passed as
arguments. Watches will be set up recursively to an
unlimited depth. Symbolic links are not traversed. If new
<br>
directories are created within watched directories they will
automatically be watched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: If you use this option
while watching the root directory of a large tree, it may
take quite a while until all inotify watches are
established, and events will not <br>
be received in this time. Also, since one inotify watch will
be established per subdirectory, it is possible that the
maximum amount of inotify watches per user will be <br>
reached. The default maximum is 8192; it can be increased by
writing to /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t &lt;seconds&gt;, --timeout
&lt;seconds&gt; <br>
Listen only for the specified amount of seconds. If not
specified, inotifywatch will gather statistics until
receiving an interrupt signal by (for example) pressing
CON&acirc; <br>
TROL-C at the console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e &lt;event&gt;, --event
&lt;event&gt; <br>
Listen for specific event(s) only. The events which can be
listened for are listed in the EVENTS section. This option
can be specified more than once. If omitted, all <br>
events are listened for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a &lt;event&gt;, --ascending
&lt;event&gt; <br>
Sort output ascending by event counts for the specified
event. Sortable events include &lsquo;total&rsquo; and all
the events listed in the EVENTS section except
&lsquo;move&rsquo; and &lsquo;close&rsquo; <br>
(you must use &lsquo;moved_to&rsquo;,
&lsquo;moved_from&rsquo;, &lsquo;close_write&rsquo; or
&lsquo;close_nowrite&rsquo; instead). The default is to sort
descending by &lsquo;total&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d &lt;event&gt;, --descending
&lt;event&gt; <br>
Sort output descending by event counts for the specified
event. Sortable events include &lsquo;total&rsquo; and all
the events listed in the EVENTS section except
&lsquo;move&rsquo; and &lsquo;close&rsquo; <br>
(you must use &lsquo;moved_to&rsquo;,
&lsquo;moved_from&rsquo;, &lsquo;close_write&rsquo; or
&lsquo;close_nowrite&rsquo; instead). The default is to sort
descending by &lsquo;total&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 The program executed successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 An error occurred in execution
of the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EVENTS <br>
The following events are valid for use with the -e
option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">access A watched file or a file
within a watched directory was read from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modify A watched file or a file
within a watched directory was written to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attrib The metadata of a watched
file or a file within a watched directory was modified. This
includes timestamps, file permissions, extended attributes
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close_write <br>
A watched file or a file within a watched directory was
closed, after being opened in writeable mode. This does not
necessarily imply the file was written to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close_nowrite <br>
A watched file or a file within a watched directory was
closed, after being opened in read-only mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close A watched file or a file
within a watched directory was closed, regardless of how it
was opened. Note that this is actually implemented simply by
listening for both <br>
close_write and close_nowrite, hence all close events
received will be output as one of these, not CLOSE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open A watched file or a file
within a watched directory was opened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">moved_to <br>
A file or directory was moved into a watched directory. This
event occurs even if the file is simply moved from and to
the same directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">moved_from <br>
A file or directory was moved from a watched directory. This
event occurs even if the file is simply moved from and to
the same directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">move A file or directory was
moved from or to a watched directory. Note that this is
actually implemented simply by listening for both moved_to
and moved_from, hence all close <br>
events received will be output as one or both of these, not
MOVE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">move_self <br>
A watched file or directory was moved. After this event, the
file or directory is no longer being watched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">create A file or directory was
created within a watched directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete A file or directory
within a watched directory was deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete_self <br>
A watched file or directory was deleted. After this event
the file or directory is no longer being watched. Note that
this event can occur even if it is not explicitly <br>
being listened for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unmount <br>
The filesystem on which a watched file or directory resides
was unmounted. After this event the file or directory is no
longer being watched. Note that this event can <br>
occur even if it is not explicitly being listened to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Watching the &lsquo;~/.beagle&rsquo; directory for 60
seconds:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% inotifywatch -v -e access -e

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
When using inotifywatch, the filename that is outputted is
not guaranteed to be up to date after a move because it is
the inode that is being monitored. Additionally, none of the
<br>
observed operations are guaranteed to have been performed on
the filename inotifywatch was instructed to monitor in cases
when the file is known by several names in the
filesys&acirc; <br>
tem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
There are race conditions in the recursive directory
watching code which can cause events to be missed if they
occur in a directory immediately after that directory is
created. <br>
This is probably not fixable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is assumed the inotify event
queue will never overflow.</p>
