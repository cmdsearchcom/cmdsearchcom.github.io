This tool reports differences between two repository histories. The histories
  may be presented as git repository directories or as fast-import streams, or
  as one of each.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Revisions are first paired into correspondence by committer and commit date. Any
  revision in the left-hand (L) history that cannot be paired with a revision in
  the right-hand (R) history is interpreted as having been deleted; any revision
  in the R history that cannot be paired with a revision in the L history is
  interpreted as having been inserted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For each changed, inserted, or deleted revision, a summary line is emitted
  identifying it by commit ID (for a repo) or mark (for a stream file) in the
  first history. In change reports, the corresponding revision in the second
  history is similarly identified and the report indicates the nature of the
  changes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A trailing statistics line summarizes the operation counts.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Tags and heads are compared as well. Two tags match if their contents do and
  they point at paired commits.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The --changes-only or -c option shows changes only, suppressing listing of
  insertions and deletions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The --show-equal or -e option enables listing of equal commits.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The --legacy-map or -m option takes a legacy map file in the format produced by
  reposurgeon, associating legacy commit IDs with committer/time pairs. If the
  tool can find a matching committer/time pair for a commit in this file,
  reports on this commit (and any matched pair it is part of) will be decorated
  with the legacy ID of the commit. (This will work, in particular, for
  displaying Subversion revisions of commits lifted from a Subversion file.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The --single or -s option compares single commits in detail. The argument must
  be a pair of commit IDs (marks or hashes) separated by an equals sign.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The --ignore or -i option causes differences between specified parts to be
  ignored. Part tags are as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
author
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Ignore differences in the (name part of the)
  author field.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
authordate
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Ignore differences in the author date
  part.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
committer
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Ignore differences in the (name part of the)
  committer field.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
committerdate
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Ignore differences in the commit date
  part</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
parents
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Ignore differences in parent links.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
timezone
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Apply a modulo 360 operation to timestamps
  before comparison, so as to ignore time-zone skew.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
tree
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Ignore tree-content differences. (It is not
  expected that this option will be useful; it is provided for completeness's
  sake.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
gitignore
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Ignore .gitignore and .cvsignore files when
  comparing tree content. Useful if you are comparing translations done by pairs
  of lifting tools only one of which lifts these; a notable case of this is
  reposurgeon vs. git-svn.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
email
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Ignore email addresses when comparing names.
  This can be useful when comparing two repositories translated from Subversion;
  typically they'll have the Subversion Unix user ID as the name part of the
  address, but whether and how a host part is generated for the address
  varies.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
One of these or a comma-separated list of several can be specified.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The --fullhash or -f option forces reporting of full 40-digit hash IDs, rather
  than the normal short hash.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally only the names of differing files are listed. With the --tree-diff
  option, context diffs of the files are listed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The --quiet or -q option suppresses the progress meter.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The --verbose or -v option enables debugging messages that are probably only of
  interest to developers; consult the source code for details.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RETURN_VALUES"><a class="selflink" href="#RETURN_VALUES">RETURN
  VALUES</a></h1>
For scripting use, this program returns 0 unless content (tree) differences were
  found in matching commits, in which case it returns 1. Right-side-only or
  left-side-only commits do not cause a return of 1, nor do differences in
  change comments only.
