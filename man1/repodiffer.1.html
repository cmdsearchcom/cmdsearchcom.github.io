<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
repodiffer - report differences between repository
histories</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
repodiffer [--ignore parts] [--quiet] [--verbose level]
[--show-equal] [--changes-only] [--full-hash] [--tree-diff]
[--legacy-map mapfile] [--single id1=id2] repo-or-stream1
<br>
repo-or-stream2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This tool reports differences between two repository
histories. The histories may be presented as git repository
directories or as fast-import streams, or as one of
each.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Revisions are first paired into
correspondence by committer and commit date. Any revision in
the left-hand (L) history that cannot be paired with a
revision in the right-hand (R) <br>
history is interpreted as having been deleted; any revision
in the R history that cannot be paired with a revision in
the L history is interpreted as having been inserted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each changed, inserted, or
deleted revision, a summary line is emitted identifying it
by commit ID (for a repo) or mark (for a stream file) in the
first history. In change <br>
reports, the corresponding revision in the second history is
similarly identified and the report indicates the nature of
the changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A trailing statistics line
summarizes the operation counts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tags and heads are compared as
well. Two tags match if their contents do and they point at
paired commits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The --changes-only or -c option shows changes only,
suppressing listing of insertions and deletions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --show-equal or -e option
enables listing of equal commits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --legacy-map or -m option
takes a legacy map file in the format produced by
reposurgeon, associating legacy commit IDs with
committer/time pairs. If the tool can find a <br>
matching committer/time pair for a commit in this file,
reports on this commit (and any matched pair it is part of)
will be decorated with the legacy ID of the commit. (This
will <br>
work, in particular, for displaying Subversion revisions of
commits lifted from a Subversion file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --single or -s option
compares single commits in detail. The argument must be a
pair of commit IDs (marks or hashes) separated by an equals
sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --ignore or -i option causes
differences between specified parts to be ignored. Part tags
are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">author <br>
Ignore differences in the (name part of the) author
field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">authordate <br>
Ignore differences in the author date part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">committer <br>
Ignore differences in the (name part of the) committer
field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">committerdate <br>
Ignore differences in the commit date part</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">parents <br>
Ignore differences in parent links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timezone <br>
Apply a modulo 360 operation to timestamps before
comparison, so as to ignore time-zone skew.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tree <br>
Ignore tree-content differences. (It is not expected that
this option will be useful; it is provided for
completeness&rsquo;s sake.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gitignore <br>
Ignore .gitignore and .cvsignore files when comparing tree
content. Useful if you are comparing translations done by
pairs of lifting tools only one of which lifts these; a <br>
notable case of this is reposurgeon vs. git-svn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">email <br>
Ignore email addresses when comparing names. This can be
useful when comparing two repositories translated from
Subversion; typically they&rsquo;ll have the Subversion Unix
user ID <br>
as the name part of the address, but whether and how a host
part is generated for the address varies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One of these or a
comma-separated list of several can be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --fullhash or -f option
forces reporting of full 40-digit hash IDs, rather than the
normal short hash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally only the names of
differing files are listed. With the --tree-diff option,
context diffs of the files are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --quiet or -q option
suppresses the progress meter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --verbose or -v option
enables debugging messages that are probably only of
interest to developers; consult the source code for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
For scripting use, this program returns 0 unless content
(tree) differences were found in matching commits, in which
case it returns 1. Right-side-only or left-side-only commits
<br>
do not cause a return of 1, nor do differences in change
comments only.</p>
