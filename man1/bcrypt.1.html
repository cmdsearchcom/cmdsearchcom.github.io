<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bcrypt - blowfish file encryption</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bcrypt [-orc][-sN] file ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
bcrypt encrypts and decrypts files using the blowfish
algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encrypted files will be saved
with an extension of .bfe. Any files ending in .bfe will be
assumed to be encrypted with bcrypt and will attempt to
decrypt them. Any other input <br>
files will be encrypted. If more than one type of file is
given, bcrypt will process all files which are the same as
the first filetype given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, bcrypt will compress
input files before encryption, remove input files after they
are processed (assuming they are processed successfully) and
overwrite input files <br>
with random data to prevent data recovery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Passphrases may be between 8 and
56 characters. Regardless of the passphrase size, the key is
hashed internally to 448 bits - the largest keysize
supported by the blowfish algo&acirc; <br>
rithm. However, it is still wise to use a strong
passphrase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-o print output to standard out. Implies -r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c DO NOT compress files before
encryption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r DO NOT remove input files
after processing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sN How many times to overwrite
input files with random data before deleting. The default
number of overwrites is 3. Use -s0 to disable this feature.
No effect if -r is sup&acirc; <br>
plied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The -o ,-r ,and -c options each have the opposite effects if
the appropriate settings are altered from the defaults in
config.h. To determine what effect each of these have on
<br>
your system, run bcrypt without any options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encrypted files should be
compatible between most systems. Binary compatibility has
been tested on all supported systems. There is a list of
supported systems in the README file <br>
that was included with this software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Probably. If you find that it will not compile and run on
your system, or that encrypted files are not compatible with
other platforms, its probably because I don&rsquo;t have
access <br>
to the platform in question. Patches or access to an
unsupported machine are welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISTRIBUTION <br>
bcrypt includes Paul Kocher&rsquo;s implementation of the
blowfish algorithm. The version distributed with bcrypt has
been altered. Original sources are available from
