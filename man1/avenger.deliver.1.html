<p>deliver(1) Mail Avenger 0.8.4 deliver(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
deliver - deliver mail to a mailbox or maildir spool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
deliver [--umask[=val]] destination1 [destination2 ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Takes a mail message on standard input, and delivers it to
one or more destination mailboxes. If a destination ends
with a &quot;/&quot; character, it is interpreted as a qmail
maildir <br>
format directory (which will be created if it doesn&rsquo;t
already exist). Otherwise, if the destination does not end
with a &quot;/&quot; character, it is interpreted as a Unix
mbox format <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one of the mailboxes is
specified as -, deliver will send a copy of the message to
its standard output after generating the appropriate
&quot;From &quot; and &quot;Return-Path:&quot; lines, if
<br>
necessary. This is useful when piping messages to programs
from avenger.local(8) scripts, as avenger.local does not
generate any &quot;From &quot; or &quot;Return-Path: &quot;
lines, while deliver <br>
will generate these based on the SENDER environment
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--copy <br>
If deliver cannot seek on its standard input, it will first
copy the message to a temporary file before attempting any
deliveries. Usually this only occurs when deliver is <br>
being fed the output of another program through a pipe. The
--copy option forces copying regardless of whether deliver
could rewind the file pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fcntl (-P) <br>
This option enables fcntl (a.k.a. POSIX) file locking of
mail spools, in addition to flock and dotfile locking. The
advantage of fcntl locking is that it may do the right <br>
thing over NFS. However, if either the NFS client or server
does not properly support fcntl locking, or if the file
system is not mounted with the appropriate options, fcntl
<br>
locking can fail in one of several ways. It can allow
different processes to lock the same file concurrently--even
on the same machine. It can simply hang when trying to <br>
acquire a lock, even if no other process holds a lock on the
file. Also, on some OSes it can interact badly with flock
locking, because those OSes actually implement flock <br>
in terms of fcntl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--norewind <br>
By default, if deliver can rewind its standard input, it
will do so before reading the message. This lets scripts
more easily run several commands over their standard input
<br>
when that input is a file. For example, a shell script might
do the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if test YES =
&quot;&lsquo;formail -cxz X-Spam-Status:&lsquo;&quot;; then
<br>
deliver $HOME/Mail/spam/ <br>
else <br>
deliver $HOME/Mail/ham/ <br>
fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --norewind inhibits that
behavior, so that the above script would likely give
unintended results. --norewind is useful for testing scripts
that aren&rsquo;t supposed to assume <br>
they are getting input from a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--umask <br>
--umask=val <br>
By default, deliver creates all files and directories with a
umask value of 077--meaning files are not readable or
writable by others. The --umask option tells deliver to <br>
keep whatever umask it was invoked with. The --umask=val
option tells deliver to use a umask of val. Note that to
specify val in octal, you must prefix it with a 0, so the
<br>
default is equivalent to --umask=077, but not
--umask=77.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The following environment variable affects deliver&rsquo;s
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SENDER <br>
Specifies the envelope sender (bounce address) of the
message. For maildir format mailboxes, the sender will be
included in a &quot;Return-Path:&quot; header. For mbox
format <br>
mailboxes, the sender is reflected in the first line, which
will contain &quot;From SENDER ...&quot;. If SENDER is
unspecified, deliver will attempt to extract it from the
first line <br>
of the message, if that line begins &quot;From &quot; or
&quot;Return-Path:&quot;. Otherwise, the sender will
probably be incorrectly set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Using avenger.local, to set up an address as a spam trap
that reports any messages it receives as spam, you might
place the following in the appropriate .avenger/local
file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">| deliver - | spamassassin
-r</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to reject spam
messages during SMTP transactions using spamassassin, but
still want to keep a copy of the spams in
$HOME/Mail/spam-log to keep an eye on how <br>
spamassassin is doing, you might place the line
&quot;bodytest $HOME/.avenger/spam-check&quot;, and write
the spam-check shell script as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh <br>
edinplace -x 111 spamassassin -e 100 <br>
case &quot;$?&quot; in <br>
0) <br>
;; <br>
100) <br>
echo Sorry, spamassassin has flagged this message as spam
<br>
deliver $HOME/Mail/spam-log <br>
exit 100 <br>
;; <br>
111) <br>
echo Sorry, spamassassin has encountered a temporary error
<br>
exit 111 <br>
;; <br>
*) <br>
echo Sorry, spamassassin exited witn an unknown status <br>
exit 111 <br>
;; <br>
esac</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note here that the bodytest
script does not need to pipe the message through
&quot;deliver -&quot; before spamassassin, because
bodytest&rsquo;s standard input does contain &quot;From
&quot; and <br>
&quot;Return-Path:&quot; lines, even though avenger.local
command input does not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
When delivering to multiple destinations, if one of them
fails, deliver will halt with a non-zero exit status.
However, it is not possible to know which destination caused
the <br>
delivery failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To protect against concurrent
accesses to mbox format files, deliver uses both flock and
dotfiles to lock mailboxes. However, it does not use
fcntl/lockf-style locking by <br>
default. Thus, if your mail reader exclusively uses fcntl
for locking, there will be race conditions unless you
specify the --fcntl option.</p>
