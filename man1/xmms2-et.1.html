XMMS2 team on each song change</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xmms2-et</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
XMMS2 is a redesign of the XMMS (http://xmms2.org) music
player. It features a client-server model, allowing multiple
(even simultaneous!) user interfaces, both textual and <br>
graphical. All common audio formats are supported using
plugins. On top of this, there is a flexible media library
to organize your music.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xmms2-et is the ET Phone Home
Client for XMMS2. xmms2-et is designed to transmit a packet
of information to the XMMS2 team whenever a new song is
played. The packet is anonymous <br>

The specifics of what data is transmitted to the XMMS2 team
can be found in the ET PACKET section of this manual
page.</p>

engineering by the XMMS2 team. During a release cycle, the
usage of various plugins, operating systems, and XMMS2
components is collected from data <br>
transmitted by the xmms2-et client. A release is made when
sufficient testing has occured as determined by the number
of related xmms2-et packets that the XMMS2 team has <br>
received.</p>
