<p>gpg-remailer(1) gpg-remailer - reencrypt PGP/GPG maill
gpg-remailer(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gpg-remailer - forward re-encrypted/signed PGP/GPG
encrypted/signed mail to a group</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gpg-remailer [OPTIONS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Gpg-remailer decrypts received PGP/GPG messages, verifies
the received signature, and re-encrypts the e-mail for a
well defined group of recipients. Gpg-remailer can also be
con&acirc; <br>
figured so as to process clear-text e-mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using gpg-remailer the list of
members of a group of people who want to exchange encrypted
and authenticated e-mails (and maybe also clear-text
messages) can be maintained at one <br>
location, allowing the members of the group to specify just
one e-mail address to send PGP/GPG signed and encrypted (or
optionally clear-text) e-mail to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gpg-remailer reads incoming
e-mail from its standard input stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the incoming e-mail is
clear-text, it resends the e-mail to one or more
configurable e-mail addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the incoming e-mail is
PGP/GPG encrypted (and optionally signed) it re-encrypts the
received information for every member of a configurable
group, and send the re-encrypted <br>
information to one or more configurable e-mail
addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By itself, gpg-remailer is not a
mailing list. However, the configured recipient address
could be, e.g., a mailing list address, for further
distribution of the processed e-mail. <br>
Gpg-remailer is a remailer: it uses the message&acirc;s
data, but not its headers. Having received an e-mail it
resends, rather than forwards, the received e-mail. The
e-mail that is <br>
received via gpg-remailer therefore contains a completely
new set of e-mail headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A configuration file as well as
command line options can be used to fine-tune
gpg-remailer&acirc;s behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUE <br>
Gpg-remailer always returns 0 to the operating system to
prevent unknown mailer error messages in the MTA&acirc;s
logs. However, when gpg-remailer ends prematurely an error
message is <br>
written to the standard error stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIREMENTS <br>
In order to use gpg-remailer the following requirements must
be met (all commands should be issued by the root user):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Since multiple groups may use
gpg-remailer it is advised to define functional accounts
handling e-mail to be processed by gpg-remailer. A
functional account secmail can be <br>
defined using a command like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">adduser --home /var/lib/secmail
--disabled-password secmail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o All locations used by the
gpg-remailer must be given highly restrictive permissions.
E.g., the functional accounts should set umask 077. It is
the responsibility of the <br>
user to make sure that the access rights are correctly
configured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Consider making all functional
gpg-remailer accounts members of a special group (e.g.,
gpg-remailer) and allow execution of /usr/sbin/gpg-remailer
only my members of that <br>
group:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">addgroup gpg-remailer <br>
adduser secmail gpg-remailer <br>
chown root.gpg-remailer /usr/sbin/gpg-remailer <br>
chmod o-rx /usr/bin/gpg-remailer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o To allow the functional
account to handle incoming e-mail sudo(1) can be used. In
the file /etc/sudoers the following lines can be entered
(REMAILERS can be given a comma <br>
separated list of functional account names, mailhost.org
should be replaced by the name of the host handling incoming
e-mail):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Runas_Alias REMAILERS =
secmail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mail mailhost.org=(REMAILERS)
NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/gpg-remailer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E.g., if gpg-remailer runs on a
computer named remailer.mydomain.nl which may receive
incoming e-mails, then specify remailer.mydomain.nl for
mailhost.org.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o An e-mail address must be
defined to where the mail to reencrypt must be sent to. This
e-mail address must be known by the members of the group who
want to use the <br>
gpg-remailer. Such an account could be, e.g.,
secmail@mailhost.org, appearing as a defined mail address
in, e.g., /etc/mail/aliases. The address for this example
would be <br>
entered in the /etc/mail/aliases file (some installations
use /etc/aliases) in this way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">secmail: &quot;|sudo -u secmail
/usr/sbin/gpg-remailer&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE PSEUDO USER&acirc;S PGP KEY
RINGS <br>
o The functional account must be provided with a GPG/PGP
keypair. Its public key must be distributed over the people
who are allowed to send mail to the gpg-remailer (which <br>
may be the world if the public key is published at a PGP key
server). Since the gpg-remailer must be able to act on its
own, the secret key must not require a passphrase. <br>
The key can be created as follows (after the initial
command, which is specified by root, the remaining commands
through the final exit command at the end of this section
<br>
are executed by the pseudo-user secmail):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">su - secmail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpg --gen-key</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the gpg --gen-key command the
gpg program asks for some details. Accept the defaults
unless you have reason not to, but make sure you do not
require a pass-phrase: <br>
press Enter twice when asked for one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some additional suggestions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Details for defining a PGP key
without password:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">define default RSA key, size
2048, never to expire <br>
real name: secmail gpg-remailer functional account <br>
email address: secmail@mailhost.org <br>
No passphrase required: press Enter twice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Specify the key-id of the just
created gpg-key as the default key in the file
~/.gnupg/gpg.conf (or ~/.gnupg/options, whichever is used).
E.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default-key 1234ABCD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Also add a line containing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">force-mdc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf. This
prevents the warning</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: message was not
integrity protected</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o If you want to allow non-group
members to send e-mail to the gpg-remailer consider adding a
key server specification to ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf as well, to
allow the automatic <br>
retrieval of missing public keys. E.g., add a line like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keyserver keys.gnupg.net</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Next use gpg --search-keys,
gpg --recv-keys or gpg --import (see the gpg(1) man-page for
the required formats of these commands) to already add the
public keys of all the <br>
members of the group who will be using gpg-remailer to the
pseudo user&acirc;s public key ring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o If a group member exists who
has signed the GPG/PGP keys of all other members, then
consider to trust this member fully, to prevent warnings
resulting from using untrusted <br>
keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Once the gpg-remailer&acirc;s
GPG key pair has been created, provide the remailer&acirc;s
public key to the members of the group. These members should
import the public key and they <br>
should be advised to sign the remailer&acirc;s public key to
prevent warnings about using an unverified public key. The
remailer&acirc;s public key can be be exported to file
using</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpg --armor --export secmail
&gt; secmail.pub</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and the members of the group can
import the remailer&acirc;s public key using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpg --import secmail.pub</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o When a new member is added to
the group he/she should add the remailer&acirc;s public key
to his/her public key ring and provide his/her public key
for import into the func&acirc; <br>
tional account&acirc;s public key ring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Gpg-remailer requires the
existence of a configuration file and of a directory to
store its temporary files in. See the section CONFIGURATION
FILE below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Having prepared the pseudo
user&acirc;s PGP key rings, the command exit takes you back
to the root user&acirc;s session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
If available, single letter options are listed between
parentheses following their associated long-option variants.
Single letter options require arguments if their associated
<br>
long options require arguments as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o --debug (-d) <br>
When specified, debug messages are logged to the log-file
(see below). When this option is specified the files written
by gpg-remailer are not removed after gpg-remailer <br>
has processed an incoming e-mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o --help (-h) <br>
A short summary of the usage is displayed to the standard
output after which gpg-remailer terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o --logfile=filename (-l) <br>
Specifies the file on which gpg-remailer&acirc;s log
messages are written (by default
~/etc/gpg-remailer.log).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o --loglevel=level (-L) <br>
LogLevel 0 provides extensive debug output as well as all
other logmessages; <br>
LogLevel 1 logs the executed commands and the default
messages; <br>
LogLevel 2 logs the default messages (characteristics of
incoming and outgoing e-mail) (default); <br>
Higher levels will suppress logging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o --member=PGP e-mail address
(-m) <br>
The PGP-key e-mail address to re-encrypt the message for.
Overrides the member(s) listed in the configuration file.
This option may be specified multiple times when
multi&acirc; <br>
ple members must be specified on the command line. With each
--member option only provide one e-mail address (e.g.,
member@domain.iso. This format is not checked by <br>
gpg-remailer, but a failure to comply may result in
gpg-remailer being unable to re-encrypt or e-mail messages.
The --member specifications can also be used to specify a
<br>
set of e-mail envelope addresses from where clear-text
e-mail is accepted, using the envelope: members and
clear-text: envelope configuration file specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o --noMail <br>
When specified no mail is sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o --nr=file-number (-n) <br>
Files created by the gpg-remailer while processing incoming
e-mails are kept, and receive suffix file-number, which
should be a number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o --recipient=e-mail address
(-r) <br>
The recipient address(es) of the (re-encrypted or plain)
resent e-mail. Overrides the recipient(s) listed in the
configuration file. As with the --members option, multiple
<br>
recipients may be specified by providing multiple
--recipient options. These addresses may or may not be
unique. If multiple identical addresses are specified
gpg-remailer <br>
will send e-mail to each of these multiply specified
addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each --recipient option should
normally only define one plain e-mail address (e.g.,
recipient@domain.iso, but multiple --recipient options are
also accepted. The format of <br>
the e-mail addresses is not checked by gpg-remailer, but
providing any information in addition to or differing from a
plain e-mail address may result in gpg-remailer being <br>
unable to re-encrypt or resend e-mail messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to plain e-mail
addresses, the specification --recipient members can be used
to indicate that the re-encrypted mail must be sent to all
e-mail addresses speci&acirc; <br>
fied using member specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o --step=name <br>
Perform the indicated step of the remailing process. Step
names are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hdrs (write the mail headers),
<br>
org (write the mail data), <br>
dec (only for PGP encrypted e-mail: write the decrypted
info), <br>
doc (only for PGP encrypted e-mail: create the info to
send), <br>
enc (only for PGP encrypted e-mail: encrypt the info to
send), <br>
clearmail (send clear-text mail), <br>
clearmail:address (send mail only to the provided address,
ignore recipient(s) specified otherwise). pgpmail (send
pgp-encrypted mail), <br>
pgpmail:address (send pgp-encrypted mail only to the
provided address, ignore recipient(s) specified
otherwise).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Step hdrs is completely
optional. Later steps depend on earlier steps. E.g., --step
doc can only be requested after having specified --step dec
in a previous run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With clear-text e-mail steps
dec, doc, enc and pgpmail should not be provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With PGP encrypted mail step
clearmail should not be provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o --tmp=path (-t) <br>
The path of the directory where the temporary files are
written (by default: $HOME/tmp). This should be an absolute
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o --umask=octalValue <br>
By default, gpg-remailer uses umask 077 for all files it
creates: only the pseudo-user has read and write
permissions. In normal circumstances there should be no
reason <br>
for changing this umask value, but if necessary the --umask
option can be used, providing an octal value, to specify an
alternative umask value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o --version (-v) <br>
Gpg-remailer&acirc;s version number is is written to the
standard output stream after which gpg-remailer terminates.
)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFGURATION FILE <br>
The default configuration file is ~/etc/gpg-remailer.rc
under the pseudo user&acirc;s home directory. Its path may
be altered using a program option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Empty lines are ignored.
Information at and beyond #-characters is interpreted as
comment and is ignored as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All directives in the
configuration file obey the pattern</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">directive: value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A line may at most contain one
directive, but white space (including comment at the end of
the line) is OK. Several directives may be specified
multiple times; otherwise <br>
the first occurrence of a directive is used. All directives
are interpreted case insensitively, but their values are
used as specified. E.g., DeBUG: true is as good as <br>
debug: true, but debug: TRUE is not recognized. Non-empty
lines not starting with a recognized directive are silently
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following directives are
supported (default values are shown between parentheses;
when none is specified there is no default). When equivalent
command line options are <br>
used then they overrule the configuration file
specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o debug: logic (false) <br>
When logic is specified as true debug messages will be
logged to the log-file (see below). Command line options:
--debug, -d. When this option is specified the files
writ&acirc; <br>
ten by gpg-remailer will not be removed when gpg-remailer
terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o clear-text: specification
(rejected) <br>
By default, the gpg-remailer does not accept clear-text
e-mail. This can explicitly be indicated in the
configuration file using the</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clear-text: rejected</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">specification. If clear-text
e-mail should be allowed specify</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clear-text: accepted</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also possible to specify
the envelope addresses that are accepted for received
clear-text e-mail. If this is required, specify</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clear-text: envelope</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and define the accepted envelope
e-mail addresses using the envelope: configuration
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o envelope: e-mail address <br>
The envelope specifications are only interpreted when
clear-text: envelope has been specified. When clear-text:
envelope was specified only clear-text e-mail using one of
<br>
the configured envelope addresses will be re-mailed to the
configured recipients. The special envelope
specification</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">envelope: members</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">may be used to indicate that
envelope addresses which are equal to the addresses
specified using member specifications are all accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All envelope addresses are
interpreted case-insensitively. By default (if no envelope
specification has been provided) all envelope addresses are
accepted, in which case <br>
the specification clear-text: envelope reduces to
clear-text: accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o keepFiles: nr <br>
When a number is specified all files written by gpg-remailer
use the specified number and are not removed when
gpg-remailer terminates. When this option is not specified
<br>
the files receive a random numeric extension resulting in
the creation of new, as yet non-existing *.&lt;nr&gt;
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o logfile: filename
(etc/gpg-remailer.log) <br>
The file on which gpg-remailer&acirc;s log messages are
written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o loglevel: value (2) <br>
LogLevel 0 provides extensive debug output as well as all
other logmessages; <br>
LogLevel 1 logs the executed commands and the default
messages; <br>
LogLevel 2 logs the default messages (characteristics of
incoming and outgoing e-mail); <br>
With higher levels logging is suppressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o member: address <br>
Multiple members may be specified. Each member specification
specifies a PGP-key e-mail address to re-encrypt the message
for. The addresses should be plain e-mail <br>
addresses (e.g., member@domain.iso), and should not contain
other elements (like the name of the person using the
address). This format is not checked by gpg-remailer, but
<br>
a failure to comply may result in gpg-remailer being unable
to re-encrypt or e-mail messages. The member specifications
can also be used to specify a set of e-mail enve&acirc; <br>
lope addresses from where clear-text e-mail is accepted,
using the envelope: members and clear-text: envelope
specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o noMail: logic (false) <br>
When specified as true no mail is sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o recipient: e-mail address <br>
The recipient address(es) of the (re-encrypted or plain)
resent e-mail. Multiple recipients may be specified. These
addresses may or may not be unique. If multiple
identi&acirc; <br>
cal addresses are specified gpg-remailer will send e-mail to
each of these multiply specified addresses. Recipients
should be specified using plain e-mail addresses (e.g., <br>
destination@some.host.org). The re-encrypted mail is sent to
each recipient in turn. The specification</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recipient: members</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">can be used to indicate that the
re-encrypted mail must be sent to all e-mail addresses
specified using member specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o replyTo: full address <br>
The reply to address may be any e-mail reply-to address. The
reply-to becomes the default reply address for the recipient
receiving gpg-remailer&acirc;s e-mail message. Quotes <br>
and double quotes are removed from the reply to address. A
reply-to specification could be, e.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECMAIL signed AND encrypted
&lt;secmail@mailhost.org&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This specification should be
according to the requirements defined in RFC 822: Standard
for ARPA Internet Text Messages. Failing to comply with RFC
822 may result in the <br>
e-mail sending program rejecting the e-mail that is
submitted by the gpg-remailer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o signature: requirement
(required) <br>
This option is used to control signature checking.
Recognized values are: <br>
none (or not specified): no signature checking is performed;
<br>
required: a PGP signature must have been provided; <br>
good: the PGP signature must be recognized as a a
&lsquo;good signature&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o tmp directory (tmp/) <br>
The directory into which gpg-remailer writes its temporary
files. )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FORMATS <br>
Although using PGP/GPG in e-mail is established technology,
various formats of the e-mail are possible. Currently
gpg-remailer recognizes the following formats:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Simple encrypted messages,
consisting of an encrypted e-mail body;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Multi-part encrypted
messages;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Encrypted messages containing
detached signatures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Below a description is given of

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During decryption the signature
is not verified (but the recipient(s) is (are) shown) and
the decrypted file is organized as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last part represents the
detached signature, The contents section must be separated
from the decrypted file (named, e.g., decrypted) (creating,
e.g., the file con&acirc; <br>
tents). That latter file&acirc;s signature may then be
verified using the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpg --verify decrypted
contents</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resulting in the signature
verification written to the standard error (as usual). The
contents start immediately following the first boundary, and
continues up to, but not <br>
including, the new line just before the next boundary.</p>
