Retrieves and outputs the Access Control List (ACL) of buckets and of items in
  buckets in the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Principals"><a class="selflink" href="#Principals">Principals</a></h2>
(Much of the following text is taken from the &quot;Amazon S3 Developer Guide
  (API Version 2006-03-01)&quot;.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Every bucket and item has an Access Control List (ACL). When a request is made,
  S3 determines the principal making the request, and then checks the access
  control list to see if that principal is authorized to make the request. If
  the ACL contains an entry authorizing that principal to make this request, the
  request is allowed to proceed, otherwise an error is returned.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A principal may be someone with an AWS S3 account who has logged in, or
  &quot;authenticated&quot;. The principal might be the creator and owner of the
  bucket or item. Or the principal might be some anonymous web browser out on
  the internet.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="ACL_is_sequence_of_grants._A_grant_is_1_grantee_and_1_permission."><a class="selflink" href="#ACL_is_sequence_of_grants._A_grant_is_1_grantee_and_1_permission.">ACL
  is sequence of grants. A grant is 1 grantee and 1 permission.</a></h2>
An access control list is a sequence of grants. It may contain up to 100 grants.
  A grant is composed of one grantee, which is a description of the principal
  who will be allowed access, and one permission, which is a description of what
  that principal is allowed to do with that bucket or item.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="User_Grantee"><a class="selflink" href="#User_Grantee">User
  Grantee</a></h2>
A user grantee must be registered as an Amazon.com customer, but does not have
  to be registered as an AWS customer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When an ACL is read, the user grantee will be displayed in a canonical format,
  which consists of 64 hex characters. The exception is if the grantee is the
  owner. Amazon still stores and returns the grantee in canonical form, but this
  tool displays it as &quot;OWNER&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Group_Grantee"><a class="selflink" href="#Group_Grantee">Group
  Grantee</a></h2>
The only groups available are those pre-defined by S3. In the current release of
  S3, you cannot create your own group. There are currently two pre-defined
  groups.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first is represented by the string &quot;WORLD&quot; by this tool. All
  principals, whether they are anonymous or authenticated, are considered part
  of this group.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second is represented by the string &quot;USERS&quot; by this tool. Every
  non-anonymous principal is considered part of the group. Note that permission
  granted by virtue of this grant does not trump other access control
  considerations. For example, if a user is registered with AWS, they may be
  part of this group, but if they have not subscribed to S3, they will still not
  be granted access.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is also a special pseudo group with the string &quot;ANY&quot;. It is used
  by the <b>--del</b> option to match against a ACL item to select for deletion.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If Amazon updates S3 to define any additional groups before this tool is
  updated, they will be represented as a URI surrounded by angle brackets.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Owner"><a class="selflink" href="#Owner">Owner</a></h2>
Every bucket and item in S3 has an owner attribute associated with it. The owner
  the user that created the bucket or item. The only way to change the owner of
  a bucket is to delete the bucket and create it again under a different user
  identity. The only way to change the owner of an item is to overwrite the item
  using a different identity.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The owner of a bucket or item is subject to the access control policy of that
  bucket or item just like everybody else, with two notable exceptions: The
  owner of a resource always has the ability to read and write the ACL of that
  resource, no matter what the associated ACL says. For example, as the owner of
  an item, you could remove yourself from the associated access control list,
  and find that you can no longer read the item's data and metadata. However, by
  virtue of being owner, you always have the right to re-grant yourself
  permissions to it. This policy prevents the situation where an item becomes
  &quot;stranded,&quot; with nobody able to ever modify or even delete it.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Permissions"><a class="selflink" href="#Permissions">Permissions</a></h2>
The permission in a grant describes the type of access to be granted to the
  respective grantee. The following permissions are supported:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">READ</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When applied to a bucket, this grants permission to list
      the bucket. When applied to an item, this grants permission to read the
      item data and/or metadata.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">WRITE</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When applied to a bucket, this grants permission to create,
      overwrite, and delete any item in the bucket. This permission is not
      supported for items (it is reserved for future use).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">READ_ACP</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Grants permission to read the access control policy (ACL
      and owner) for the applicable bucket or item. The owner of a bucket or
      item always has this permission implicitly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">WRITE_ACP</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Grants permission to overwrite the ACP for the applicable
      bucket or item. The owner of a bucket or item always has this permission
      implicitly. Note that granting this permission is equivalent to granting
      FULL_CONTROL, because the grant recipient can now make any whatever
      changes to the ACP he or she likes!</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">FULL_CONTROL</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This permission is short-hand for the union of READ, WRITE,
      READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions. It does not convey additional rights,
      and is provided only for convenience. It is probably unwise to give this
      permission to WORLD.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">ANY</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is not really a permission, but is used by the
      <b>--del</b> option. It matches any permission to select a grant for
      deletion.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Default_ACL"><a class="selflink" href="#Default_ACL">Default
  ACL</a></h2>
If no ACL is provided at the time a bucket is created or an item written then a
  default ACL is created. The default ACL for new resources consists of a single
  grant that gives the owner of the resource (i.e. the principal making the
  request to create the bucket or to write the item) FULL_CONTROL permission.
  Note that if you overwrite an existing item, the ACL for the existing item is
  always overwritten as well, and defaulted back to OWNER:FULL_CONTROL if no
  explicit ACL is provided.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Raw_XML_ACL_Format"><a class="selflink" href="#Raw_XML_ACL_Format">Raw
  XML ACL Format</a></h2>
The XML ACL format is documented in the &quot;Amazon S3 Developer Guide&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Parsed_ACL_Format"><a class="selflink" href="#Parsed_ACL_Format">Parsed
  ACL Format</a></h2>
This tool parses the raw XML ACL format into a more readable form.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A parsed ACL consists of several lines. Comments are lines that begin with a
  hash character. Lines that are not comments are grants.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For buckets, the comments give the bucket name, and the Amazon canonical user
  string for the owner.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For items, the comments give the bucket name, the item key, and the Amazon
  canonical user string for the owner.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A grant is grantee string and a permission string, separated with a colon
  character. A grantee can be one of the strings &quot;OWNER&quot;,
  &quot;WORLD&quot;, or &quot;USERS&quot;, or a URI wrapped in angle brackets,
  or the email address of an Amazon user, or a Amazon canonical user string,
  which is 64 hex characters. A permission is one of the strings
  &quot;READ&quot;, &quot;WRITE&quot;, &quot;READ_ACP&quot;,
  &quot;WRITE_ACP&quot;, or &quot;FULL_CONTROL&quot;.

<div class="Pp"></div>
Occasionally the S3 service will randomly fail for no externally apparent
  reason. When that happens, this tool should retry, with a delay and a backoff.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Access to the S3 service can be authenticated with a X.509 certificate, instead
  of via the &quot;AWS Access Key Identifiers&quot;. This tool should support
  that.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It might be useful to be able to specify the &quot;AWS Access Key
  Identifiers&quot; in the user's &quot;~/.netrc&quot; file. This tool should
  support that.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Errors and warnings are very &quot;Perl-ish&quot;, and can be confusing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Trying to access a bucket or item that does not exist or is not accessible by
  the user generates less than helpful error messages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Net::Amazon::S3 already uses XML::LibXML and XML::LibXML::XPathContext, so this
  tool should use those instead of using XML::Writer, to have fewer module
  dependences.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is possible to add the same grant to a bucket or item more than once. This is
  a surprising behavior of the S3 service. Both identical grants will be removed
  by using the <b>--del</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Due to a limitation in the semantics of the S3 API, it is not possible to delete
  a grantee by email address, only by canonical ID.
