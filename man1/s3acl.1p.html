<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
s3acl - Display or manipulate the ACL of AWS S3 buckets and
items</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
s3acl [options] [[bucket|bucket/key] ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options: <br>
--access-key AWS Access Key ID <br>
--secret-key AWS Secret Access Key <br>
--get Output the ACL to STDOUT <br>
--xml in raw XML form instead of parsed form <br>
--set Modify the ACL <br>
--clear remove all grants from the ACL <br>
--add grant,grant,... add grants to the ACL <br>
--del grant,grant,... remove matching grants from the ACL
<br>
--xml apply the XML ACL from STDIN to the item <br>
--acl-short cannedacl apply the &quot;canned&quot; ACL to
the item <br>
Environment: <br>
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID <br>
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--help Print a brief help message and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--man Prints the manual page and
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose <br>
Output what is being done as it is done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--access-key and --secret-key
<br>
Specify the &quot;AWS Access Key Identifiers&quot; for the
AWS account. --access-key is the &quot;Access Key ID&quot;,
and --secret-key is the &quot;Secret Access Key&quot;. These
are effectively <br>
the &quot;username&quot; and &quot;password&quot; to the AWS
account, and should be kept confidential.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The access keys MUST be
specified, either via these command line parameters, or via
the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET environment
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying them on the command
line overrides the environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--secure <br>
Uses SSL/TLS HTTPS to communicate with the AWS service,
instead of HTTP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--get Retrieve and display the
ACL for each specified bucket or item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--xml When used with the --get
option, outputs to stdout the raw XML, instead of parsed
format. This raw XML is documented in the &quot;Amazon S3
Developer Guide&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If more than one bucket or item
is specified, the XML ACL for each will be output,
concatenated together. This is probably not very useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The raw XML output can be used
as input for the --set option, like so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s3acl --get --xml bucketA |
s3acl --set --xml bucketB bucketC</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This does not work when
specifying more than one bucket or item to the --get option,
because the concatenation of multiple XML ACLs is not a
valid XML ACL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--set Instead of displaying the
ACL, modify it. An ACL can be modified by using --clear,
--add, and --del, or by using --xml, or by using
--acl-short.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--clear Removes all of the
grants from the ACL. This includes access by the owner of
the bucket or item. This is done before the --add or --del
options are applied, no matter <br>
what order options are specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is usually accompanied by the
--add option to add some grants back to the now empty
ACL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--del Remove matching grants
from the ACL. This is done before the --add option is
applied, no matter what order options are specified on the
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grants are specified in parsed
form, and then joined together by commas with no
whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is an extension to the
parsed grant format. If the grantee is specified as
&quot;ANY&quot;, then it matches any and all grantees in the
ACL. If the permission is specified <br>
as &quot;ANY&quot;, then it matches any permission. Thus</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s3acl --set --del ANY:READ
mybucket</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">removes all grants that give
READ permission, and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s3acl --set --del someuserid:ANY
mybucket</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">removes all grants to the user
someuserid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s3acl --set --del ANY:ANY
mybucket</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">does the same thing as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s3acl --set --clear mybucket</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to a limitation in the
semantics of the S3 API, it is not possible to delete a
grantee by email address, only by canonical ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--add Add the specified grants
to the ACL. Grants are specified in parsed form, and then
joined together by commas with no whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to add the same
grant to a bucket or item more than once. This is a
surprising behavior of the S3 service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--xml When used with --set, and
instead of using &lt;--clear&gt;, &lt;--del&gt;, and --add,
read a raw XML ACL from STDIN, and then apply it to each
given bucket or item. This will <br>
completely overwrite the existing ACL for each given bucket
or item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--acl-short <br>
Instead of using &lt;--clear&gt;, &lt;--del&gt;, and --add,
or using &lt;--xml&gt;, apply a &quot;canned ACL&quot; to
each given bucket or item. This will completely overwrite
the existing ACL for <br>
each given bucket or item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following canned ACLs are
currently defined by S3:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">private Owner gets
&quot;FULL_CONTROL&quot;. No one else has any access rights.
This is the default for newly created buckets and items.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">public-read <br>
Owner gets &quot;FULL_CONTROL&quot;. The anonymous principal
is granted &quot;READ&quot; access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">public-read-write <br>
Owner gets &quot;FULL_CONTROL&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The anonymous principal is
granted &quot;READ&quot; and &quot;WRITE&quot; access. This
is a useful policy to apply to a bucket, if you intend for
any anonymous user to PUT objects <br>
into the bucket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">authenticated-read <br>
Owner gets &quot;FULL_CONTROL&quot; . Any principal
authenticated as a registered Amazon S3 user is granted
&quot;READ&quot; access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bucket or bucket/key <br>
One or more bucket names or bucket and key names, specifies
an item. As many as possible will be be processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If just a bucket name is given,
the ACL for that bucket is retrieved or modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a bucket name and a key,
separated by a slash, is given, the ACL for that key in that
bucket is retrieved or modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a bucket name begins with one
or more dashes, it might be mistaken for a command line
option. If this is the case, separate the command line
options from the bucket <br>
or bucket/key names with two dashes, like so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s3acl --get --
--bucketname/keyname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET <br>
Specify the &quot;AWS Access Key Identifiers&quot; for the
AWS account. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID contains the &quot;Access Key
ID&quot;, and AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET contains the
&quot;Secret Access Key&quot;. <br>
These are effectively the &quot;username&quot; and
&quot;password&quot; to the AWS service, and should be kept
confidential.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The access keys MUST be
specified, either via these environment variables, or via
the --access-key and --secret-key command line
parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the command line parameters
are set, they override these environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
The configuration options will be read from the file
&quot;~/.s3-tools&quot; if it exists. The format is the same
as the command line options with one option per line. For
example, the <br>
file could contain:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--access-key &lt;AWS access
key&gt; <br>
--secret-key &lt;AWS secret key&gt; <br>
--secure</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example configuration file
would specify the AWS access keys and that a secure
connection using HTTPS should be used for all
communications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Retrieves and outputs the Access Control List (ACL) of
buckets and of items in buckets in the Amazon Simple Storage
Service (S3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Principals <br>
(Much of the following text is taken from the &quot;Amazon
S3 Developer Guide (API Version 2006-03-01)&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every bucket and item has an
Access Control List (ACL). When a request is made, S3
determines the principal making the request, and then checks
the access control list to see if <br>
that principal is authorized to make the request. If the ACL
contains an entry authorizing that principal to make this
request, the request is allowed to proceed, otherwise an
<br>
error is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A principal may be someone with
an AWS S3 account who has logged in, or
&quot;authenticated&quot;. The principal might be the
creator and owner of the bucket or item. Or the principal
<br>
might be some anonymous web browser out on the internet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACL is sequence of grants. A
grant is 1 grantee and 1 permission. <br>
An access control list is a sequence of grants. It may
contain up to 100 grants. A grant is composed of one
grantee, which is a description of the principal who will be
allowed <br>
access, and one permission, which is a description of what
that principal is allowed to do with that bucket or
item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User Grantee <br>
A user grantee must be registered as an Amazon.com customer,
but does not have to be registered as an AWS customer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an ACL is read, the user
grantee will be displayed in a canonical format, which
consists of 64 hex characters. The exception is if the
grantee is the owner. Amazon still <br>
stores and returns the grantee in canonical form, but this
tool displays it as &quot;OWNER&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Group Grantee <br>
The only groups available are those pre-defined by S3. In
the current release of S3, you cannot create your own group.
There are currently two pre-defined groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first is represented by the
string &quot;WORLD&quot; by this tool. All principals,
whether they are anonymous or authenticated, are considered
part of this group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second is represented by the
string &quot;USERS&quot; by this tool. Every non-anonymous
principal is considered part of the group. Note that
permission granted by virtue of this grant <br>
does not trump other access control considerations. For
example, if a user is registered with AWS, they may be part
of this group, but if they have not subscribed to S3, they
<br>
will still not be granted access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also a special pseudo
group with the string &quot;ANY&quot;. It is used by the
--del option to match against a ACL item to select for
deletion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Amazon updates S3 to define
any additional groups before this tool is updated, they will
be represented as a URI surrounded by angle brackets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Owner <br>
Every bucket and item in S3 has an owner attribute
associated with it. The owner the user that created the
bucket or item. The only way to change the owner of a bucket
is to <br>
delete the bucket and create it again under a different user
identity. The only way to change the owner of an item is to
overwrite the item using a different identity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The owner of a bucket or item is
subject to the access control policy of that bucket or item
just like everybody else, with two notable exceptions: The
owner of a resource always <br>
has the ability to read and write the ACL of that resource,
no matter what the associated ACL says. For example, as the
owner of an item, you could remove yourself from the <br>
associated access control list, and find that you can no
longer read the item&rsquo;s data and metadata. However, by
virtue of being owner, you always have the right to re-grant
<br>
yourself permissions to it. This policy prevents the
situation where an item becomes &quot;stranded,&quot; with
nobody able to ever modify or even delete it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Permissions <br>
The permission in a grant describes the type of access to be
granted to the respective grantee. The following permissions
are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">READ When applied to a bucket,
this grants permission to list the bucket. When applied to
an item, this grants permission to read the item data and/or
metadata.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WRITE When applied to a bucket,
this grants permission to create, overwrite, and delete any
item in the bucket. This permission is not supported for
items (it is reserved for <br>
future use).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">READ_ACP <br>
Grants permission to read the access control policy (ACL and
owner) for the applicable bucket or item. The owner of a
bucket or item always has this permission <br>
implicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WRITE_ACP <br>
Grants permission to overwrite the ACP for the applicable
bucket or item. The owner of a bucket or item always has
this permission implicitly. Note that granting this <br>
permission is equivalent to granting FULL_CONTROL, because
the grant recipient can now make any whatever changes to the
ACP he or she likes!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FULL_CONTROL <br>
This permission is short-hand for the union of READ, WRITE,
READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions. It does not convey
additional rights, and is provided only for <br>
convenience. It is probably unwise to give this permission
to WORLD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ANY This is not really a
permission, but is used by the --del option. It matches any
permission to select a grant for deletion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default ACL <br>
If no ACL is provided at the time a bucket is created or an
item written then a default ACL is created. The default ACL
for new resources consists of a single grant that gives <br>
the owner of the resource (i.e. the principal making the
request to create the bucket or to write the item)
FULL_CONTROL permission. Note that if you overwrite an
existing item, <br>
the ACL for the existing item is always overwritten as well,
and defaulted back to OWNER:FULL_CONTROL if no explicit ACL
is provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Raw XML ACL Format <br>
The XML ACL format is documented in the &quot;Amazon S3
Developer Guide&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parsed ACL Format <br>
This tool parses the raw XML ACL format into a more readable
form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A parsed ACL consists of several
lines. Comments are lines that begin with a hash character.
Lines that are not comments are grants.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For buckets, the comments give
the bucket name, and the Amazon canonical user string for
the owner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For items, the comments give the
bucket name, the item key, and the Amazon canonical user
string for the owner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A grant is grantee string and a
permission string, separated with a colon character. A
grantee can be one of the strings &quot;OWNER&quot;,
&quot;WORLD&quot;, or &quot;USERS&quot;, or a URI wrapped in
angle <br>
brackets, or the email address of an Amazon user, or a
Amazon canonical user string, which is 64 hex characters. A
permission is one of the strings &quot;READ&quot;,
&quot;WRITE&quot;, &quot;READ_ACP&quot;, <br>
&quot;WRITE_ACP&quot;, or &quot;FULL_CONTROL&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Report bugs to Mark Atwood mark@fallenpegasus.com.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Occasionally the S3 service will
randomly fail for no externally apparent reason. When that
happens, this tool should retry, with a delay and a
backoff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Access to the S3 service can be
authenticated with a X.509 certificate, instead of via the
&quot;AWS Access Key Identifiers&quot;. This tool should
support that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It might be useful to be able to
specify the &quot;AWS Access Key Identifiers&quot; in the
user&rsquo;s &quot;~/.netrc&quot; file. This tool should
support that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Errors and warnings are very
&quot;Perl-ish&quot;, and can be confusing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trying to access a bucket or
item that does not exist or is not accessible by the user
generates less than helpful error messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Net::Amazon::S3 already uses
XML::LibXML and XML::LibXML::XPathContext, so this tool
should use those instead of using XML::Writer, to have fewer
module dependences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to add the same
grant to a bucket or item more than once. This is a
surprising behavior of the S3 service. Both identical grants
will be removed by using the <br>
--del option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to a limitation in the
semantics of the S3 API, it is not possible to delete a
grantee by email address, only by canonical ID.</p>
