<p>LOGGER(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
LOGGER(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
logger &acirc; log messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
logger string...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The logger utility saves a message, in an unspecified manner
and format, containing the string operands provided by the
user. The messages are expected to be evaluated later by
<br>
personnel performing system administration tasks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is implementation-defined
whether messages written in locales other than the POSIX
locale are effective.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string One of the string
arguments whose contents are concatenated together, in the
order specified, separated by single &lt;space&gt;
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of logger:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in argu&acirc; <br>
ments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error. (This means diagnostics from logger to the
<br>
user or application, not diagnostic messages that the user
is sending to the system administrator.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
Unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
This utility allows logging of information for later use by
a system administrator or programmer in determining why
non-interactive utilities have failed. The locations of the
<br>
saved messages, their format, and retention period are all
unspecified. There is no method for a conforming application
to read messages, once written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
A batch application, running non-interactively, tries to
read a configuration file and fails; it may attempt to
notify the system administrator with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logger myname: unable to read
file foo. [timestamp]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The standard developers believed strongly that some method
of alerting administrators to errors was necessary. The
obvious example is a batch utility, running
non-interactively, <br>
that is unable to read its configuration files or that is
unable to create or write its results file. However, the
standard developers did not wish to define the format or
deliv&acirc; <br>
ery mechanisms as they have historically been (and will
probably continue to be) very system-specific, as well as
involving functionality clearly outside the scope of this
volume <br>
of POSIX.1&acirc;2008.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The text with LC_MESSAGES about
diagnostic messages means diagnostics from logger to the
user or application, not diagnostic messages that the user
is sending to the system <br>
administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple string arguments are
allowed, similar to echo, for ease-of-use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like the utilities mailx and lp,
logger is admittedly difficult to test. This was not deemed
sufficient justification to exclude these utilities from
this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008. <br>
It is also arguable that they are, in fact, testable, but
that the tests themselves are not portable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
