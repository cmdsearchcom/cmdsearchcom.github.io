<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
nut - analyze meals with the USDA Nutrient Database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
nut [dbname] <br>
Nut [FLTK OPTION]... [dbname]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
NUT allows you to record what you eat and analyze your meals
for nutrient composition. The database included is the USDA
Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 26.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This database of food
composition tables contains values for calories, protein,
carbohydrates, fiber, total fat, etc., and includes all the
nutrient data in the USDA database, <br>
including the Omega-6 and Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty
acids. Nutrient levels are expressed as a percentage of the
DV or Daily Value, the familiar standard of food labeling in
<br>
the United States. The essential fatty acids, Omega-6 and
Omega-3, are not currently mentioned in these standards, and
a reference value has been supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may search this list of
foods and view nutrient values for different serving sizes;
you may also rank foods in order of level of a particular
nutrient. You may change the <br>
daily calorie level to correspond to your personal
metabolism, and the levels for fat, carbohydrates, fiber,
and protein are automatically adjusted. You may customize
the ratios <br>
of carbohydrates to protein to fat to suit your personal
regimen. You may add your own recipes to the database, by
creating them from the foods in the database. You can also
<br>
add foods from the information on commercial food labels.
The program is completely menu-driven and there are no
commands to learn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NUT can be called with an
optional argument to specify a database subdirectory. For
example, if a user tracks meals for other family members,
each person can have his own data&acirc; <br>
base, and each database is entirely separate. The database
subdirectory name (if there is one) is displayed on all
screens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The functions included are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Record Meals: Foods are found in
the database, a number of servings, weight, or calories is
entered, and thus a meal is recorded showing the amount of
each food eaten. The meal <br>
date can be entered in full &quot;yyyymmdd&quot; format or
as a positive or negative offset from today, such as
&quot;-3&quot; or &quot;+1&quot;. All numbers expressing
food quantities are entered as decimal <br>
numbers, but the number of servings can also be entered as a
common fraction such as 3/4. An analysis screen can be
brought up by typing a dot. Individual foods are deleted
<br>
from the meal list by entering the food number shown, but
you can also modify the quantity by typing the food number
and a new quantity, for example &quot;2 100g&quot;, i.e.
change food #2 <br>
to 100 grams.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatic Portion Control: A
major feature of NUT is to be able to associate a meal food
with an automatically-adjusted quantity to enable easy
portion control. For instance, if <br>
you want food #4 on the menu to always be adjusted so that
the entire meal exactly meets the Daily Value for protein,
type &quot;4 p&quot;; if food #7 is a carb food, type
&quot;7 c&quot; to adjust <br>
non-fiber carb; or if food #1 is a fat food, type &quot;1
f&quot; to automatically adjust the total fat of the meal.
An alternate way to specify the previous three commands in a
single <br>
command is &quot;pcf 4 7 1&quot;. Then, as you edit other
food quantities or add or subtract foods, the automatic
portion control produces an entire meal that exactly fits
your plan. <br>
There can only be one protein food, one carb food, and one
fat food designated per meal. An inappropriate designation
such as designating table salt as a fat food will usually
<br>
result in a quantity of zero. Negative quantities in
designated foods indicate too much protein, carb, or fat in
non-designated foods. To remove a portion control
designation, <br>
type the food number and the designation you want to remove;
for instance, if food #5 is designated as a fat food, type
&quot;5 f&quot; to remove the designation, or else type a
new pcf <br>
command that does not include food #5 as a fat food. There
is also an extension to the feature to balance a meal for
Thiamin &quot;t&quot;, Pantothenic Acid &quot;n&quot;,
Vitamin E &quot;e&quot;, Calcium <br>
&quot;l&quot;, Iron &quot;i&quot;, Potassium &quot;k&quot;,
and Zinc &quot;z&quot;, but these commands have to be issued
individually and not as part of a &quot;pcf&quot; command.
These additional commands &quot;t&quot;, &quot;n&quot;,
&quot;e&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, <br>
&quot;i&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; are only
valuable when meals habitually lack the specified nutrient
and it makes sense to try to get some of the nutrient at
every meal to avoid a large cumula&acirc; <br>
tive deficiency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the program analysis to come
out right you must record all the meals the program is set
for. For instance, if set for three meals, and you eat more
than three, combine them <br>
into three; if you eat less than three, record some mimimal
item such as an ounce of water for each missing meal. (See
below under &quot;Delete Meals and Set Meals Per Day&quot;
for the <br>
means to set the program to between 1 and 19 meals per day
instead of the default 3.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Analyze Meals and Food
Suggestions: An analysis of meals in the database is
presented in terms of the percentage of each nutrient, where
100% signifies a rate of 100% of the DV <br>
(Daily Value) per day. The program will analyze any subset
of the latest meals recorded, considering each meal to be an
appropriate fraction of a day. By pressing &quot;s&quot; on
the <br>
analysis screen, nutrients for which the DV have not been
achieved are listed, and some random foods are chosen from
the database which contain the additional nutrients. By <br>
pressing &quot;e&quot; all values are reset to the absolute
values in the analysis to provide an easy method to compare
periods (this feature is not in the graphical interface). By
press&acirc; <br>
ing &quot;o&quot; all DV defaults are restored replacing
comparison mode. By pressing &quot;d&quot; the display
alternates between DV percentages, absolute values of the DV
nutrients, and a series <br>
of screens of all additional nutrients in the database.
There is a &quot;p&quot; option that moves the screens back
the other way. When you leave the analysis screen (or the
&quot;View <br>
Foods&quot; screen) with a particular set of nutrients
showing, that set of nutrients will be used in the other
functions in the program, including printing menus, ranking
foods, and <br>
drawing graphs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the value &quot;(nd)&quot;
shows up on a screen, it signifies the database has no data
for that particular nutrient for the foods viewed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the analysis screen is
brought up during &quot;Record Meals&quot;, it analyzes
backwards from the meal being viewed, which might not be the
last meal; however, the &quot;Analyze Meals&quot; <br>
screen from main menu option 2 always analyzes from the last
meal in the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Record Meals&quot; and
&quot;Analyze Meals&quot; analyses each separately remember
how many meals were last analyzed, so that a user could, for
example, always look at a single meal on <br>
the &quot;Record Meals&quot; analysis, and always look at a
couple of weeks of meals on &quot;Analyze Meals&quot;, but
not have to specify how many meals each time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shortcut to food rankings and
graphs: From the analysis screen you can type the name of a
nutrient as shown, such as Calcium with the capital
&quot;C&quot;, and if NUT can find the nutri&acirc; <br>
ent, it will provide the food ranking and graph functions
for that nutrient directly without having to go back to the
Main Menu and navigate the hierarchy. You only have to type
<br>
enough of the beginning of the nutrient name so that NUT can
uniquely identify the nutrient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete Meals and Set Meals Per
Day: Some or all of the collected meals may be removed from
the database; or an automatic feature may be selected which
keeps the meal database <br>
from getting unnecessarily huge, deleting the oldest meals
in excess of a number of meals set by the user. When all
meals are deleted, an option may be set to change the
pro&acirc; <br>
gram&rsquo;s default from 3 meals a day to 1 to 19 meals a
day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">View Foods: Foods can be viewed
using the same interface as for &quot;Record Meals,&quot;
specifying whatever serving size the user wishes to see
analyzed for nutrient content, and if nec&acirc; <br>
essary typing a &quot;d&quot; or &quot;p&quot; to change the
display to a different set of nutrients. You can type just
the beginning of a food name or a part of a food name, and a
numbered menu of <br>
all possible completions continues to be shown until a
unique food is chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the value &quot;(nd)&quot;
shows up on a screen, it signifies the database has no data
for that particular nutrient for the foods viewed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add Foods and Modify Serving
Sizes: This item has three selections, &quot;Add a
Recipe,&quot; &quot;Add a Labeled Food,&quot; and
&quot;Modify Serving Sizes.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To add a recipe, foods are
selected in exactly the same way as adding a meal, a number
of servings or weight is entered for each food, and the
recipe is recorded. Then the soft&acirc; <br>
ware divides the recipe into the number of servings desired,
and provides an opportunity to adjust the weight of the
servings to allow for water gained or lost in
preparation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NUT allows you to add a labeled
food with an ordered list of ingredients and a nutrition
statement (this feature is not in the graphical interface).
The new food will have <br>
additional nutrients that were not on the nutrition
statement, but that the database says are in the food.
First, the labeled food is named. Next the program requests
that the <br>
food&rsquo;s listed ingredients be found in the order of
greatest to least. Do not worry about ingredients you cannot
find. No amount or weight is set for any ingredient--the
ingre&acirc; <br>
dient is simply selected. Selected ingredients may be
grouped with parentheses where an ingredient number is
followed by either &quot;(&quot;, &quot;)&quot;, or
&quot;!&quot; to begin a group, end a group, <br>
or remove a group indicator. To delete an ingredient, simply
type its number; to move an ingredient, type its number, an
&quot;m&quot;, and the destination--such as &quot;5m2&quot;.
When the <br>
ingredient list is complete, the nutrient lists are
presented so the nutritional information can be copied into
the program. Whenever you quit a nutrient screen, an
opportunity <br>
is presented to select a different set of nutrients. The
&quot;DV&quot; percentages for this part of the program are
the USA standard 2000-calorie Daily Values, and not any
customized <br>
options--but users can always set the label&rsquo;s nutrient
information in grams. Only Daily Value nutrients greater
than zero are considered as constraints when NUT constructs
an <br>
approximate recipe in order to fill in nutrient values that
were not expressed on the food label. Occasionally the
&quot;recipe&quot; that NUT estimates for a packaged food
will only <br>
show a &quot;trace&quot; of every ingredient, and this is
NUT&rsquo;s way of saying that according to the food
database, there is no way to match the ingredients with the
constraints of the <br>
nutrition statement. After the recipe is displayed there is
an additional opportunity to edit the nutrient values.
Perhaps the food was so heavily fortified with vitamins that
<br>
the user waited until after NUT constructed a recipe to
specify the additional vitamin amounts. Whatever the
rationale for additional editing, the user has total control
over <br>
the nutritional information no matter what NUT&rsquo;s
approximate recipe suggested. The new food record is saved
in the database in the same manner as a recipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To modify the serving size of an
existing food, the food is selected and the serving sizes on
file are displayed so one can be selected. Alternately, the
user may simply type in <br>
his own serving size consisting of number of grams, the
serving unit (such as cups or tablespoons), and the serving
quantity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">View Nutrients and Rank Foods:
The nutrients are reviewed and one of the nutrients is
selected to list all the foods rich in that nutrient. The
food database can be queried in <br>
this manner for nutrients per 100 grams, per 100 grams dry
weight, per 100 grams within a USDA-defined food group, per
100 calories, per serving, per serving minimizing some <br>
other nutrient, and per recorded meals (average intake per
day). The set of nutrients operated on are the last set
viewed or analyzed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Rank Foods per
Recorded Meals&quot; option is useful for discovering which
foods contribute the most to your intake of a particular
nutrient. When you use &quot;Record Meals&quot; to view <br>
a meal earlier than your last meal, this &quot;per recorded
meals&quot; option looks back from that same meal, to show
which foods you were eating during that earlier period.
Likewise, <br>
the program remembers how many meals were last analyzed, and
only searches that subset of meals to find which foods to
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that processed foods which
contain hydrogenated vegetable oil or significant
&quot;trans-&quot; fats may not contain as much of the
essential fatty acids as the program shows because <br>
the USDA database does not yet completely distinguish
between essential fatty acids and the &quot;trans-&quot;
fats, which cannot serve for essential fatty acids in the
body.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set Personal Options and Log
Weight: These screens set options for nutrient levels to use
when analyzing meals. Some of the carbohydrate and protein
settings are mutually exclu&acirc; <br>
sive and affect the fat percentages as carbs, protein, and
fat of course must total 100%; however, calories per gram
vary from food to food, so the percentage of calories from
<br>
carbs, protein, and fat will vary even if grams of each
remain constant, so consider these settings
approximations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options for polyunsatured
fat and the &quot;Omega-6/3 Balance&quot; target select
reference values (there are no &quot;Daily Values&quot; for
these) based on Dr. William Lands&rsquo; empirical
equa&acirc; <br>
tion for the percentages of Omega-6 and Omega-3 fatty acids
in tissue phospholipids based on diet. The program
recomputes all fatty acid values automatically whenever the
analy&acirc; <br>
sis changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Weight Log
Regression&quot; does not tell you what you weigh; what it
does is apply linear regression to a series of daily weight
and body fat percentage entries to smooth out the <br>
random noise and tell you which direction your weight is
trending, how fast it is going there, and how much of the
change is lean or fat. To make a daily entry, type the
weight <br>
and body fat percentage at the prompt, like this:
&quot;150.2 17.9&quot;. If you did not measure the body fat
percentage, just type the weight. This algorithm is free of
units, so it <br>
will work with weights in pounds or kilos or even stone (but
not stone plus pounds). The daily entry is automatically
timestamped, so it should be entered into the program
imme&acirc; <br>
diately after measurement and the program will not accept
more than one entry per day. If you want to erase the weight
log and start over, just type a &quot;!&quot;, or you may
directly <br>
edit the file &quot;WLOG.txt&quot; in the &quot;.nutdb&quot;
directory. Clearing the weight log leaves the very last
entry in order to quickly start a new cycle of logging. The
daily lean and fat <br>
mass totals can be seen explicitly by looking at the
&quot;WLOG.aux&quot; file in the &quot;.nutdb&quot;
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Calorie Auto-Set&quot;
feature utilizes &quot;Weight Log Regression&quot; in a
special way to automatically optimize the calorie level to
improve body composition. Since the user is <br>
inputting daily weight and body fat percentage measurements
and eating according to the calorie level shown, NUT can
determine if fat mass is going down and lean mass is going
up <br>
at that particular calorie level. If so, NUT does nothing.
If fat mass is going up, NUT lowers the calories by 20. If
both fat mass and lean mass are going down, NUT raises <br>
the calories by 20. If NUT makes calorie adjustments and is
able to correct the direction of the regression lines and
thus achieve true progress, NUT then automatically clears
<br>
the weight log to start the cycle again, and initializes the
new weight log with the terminus of the previous regression.
Therefore, each regression cycle between clearings <br>
should reflect lean mass going up and and fat mass going
down. Cycles alternate between the previously described
cycle which preferentially prevents fat mass gain and an
inverse <br>
cycle which preferentially prevents lean mass loss: In this
alternate cycle, if lean mass is going down, NUT raises the
calories by 20, but if both lean and fat mass are going <br>
up, NUT lowers the calories by 20. The automatic clearing of
the weight log signals success for a cycle, but there may be
periods of progress when no calorie adjustments are <br>
necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Plot Daily and Monthly Trends:
The list of nutrients is presented and one nutrient is
chosen for its level to be graphed facing a plot of protein,
carbohydrate, and fat calories. <br>
The user enters the number of the nutrient plus a letter,
either &quot;d&quot; or &quot;m&quot; to specify
&quot;daily&quot; or &quot;monthly&quot; i.e.,
&quot;22m&quot;. It is only necessary to enter the
&quot;d&quot; or &quot;m&quot; once in <br>
order to set the mode. Monthly graphs cover the entire
period of the meal database; daily graphs cover 36 days back
from the last meal viewed or analyzed. The graphs of Daily
<br>
Values for fat are special and show the constituent fat
types symbolically where . = non-fatty acid constituents, s
= saturated, m = monounsaturated, 6 = unspecified Omega-6, 3
= <br>
unspecified Omega-3, L = linoleic acid, A = arachidonic
acid, n = linolenic acid, e = EPA, and d = DHA. In a similar
vein, the &quot;Total Carb&quot; graph shows non-fiber carb
as &quot;.&quot; <br>
and fiber as &quot;:&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Record &rsquo;The
Usual&rsquo;--Customary Meals: When NUT asks what you are
having, you can answer &quot;the usual.&quot; Specifically,
this function allows you to record a customary meal, and
give <br>
it a name. Later, when recording a regular meal, all these
foods can be added to the meal quickly by typing
&quot;theusualname&quot;, where &quot;name&quot; is the name
you gave to the customary <br>
meal. Foods added this way can be individually deleted from
the meal, and other foods added, because this function does
not make the individual foods lose their identity as in <br>
&quot;Add a Recipe.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print Menus from Meal Database:
Makes a printable file (called &quot;menus.txt&quot; in the
current directory) which lists foods and quantities recorded
for each meal, and a nutrient anal&acirc; <br>
ysis that is the sum of nutrients for each meal, not the
rate of nutrient intake as on the &quot;Analyze Meals&quot;
screen. In common with other functions in the program, it
looks back <br>
from the last meal recorded or analyzed, only prints the
number of meals last analyzed, and prints that set of
nutrients last displayed on an analysis or &quot;View
Foods&quot; screen.</p>
