<b>Nut [FLTK OPTION]... [dbname]</b>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>NUT</b> allows you to record what you eat and analyze your meals for nutrient
  composition. The database included is the USDA Nutrient Database for Standard
  Reference, Release 26.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This database of food composition tables contains values for calories, protein,
  carbohydrates, fiber, total fat, etc., and includes all the nutrient data in
  the USDA database, including the Omega-6 and Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty
  acids. Nutrient levels are expressed as a percentage of the DV or Daily Value,
  the familiar standard of food labeling in the United States. The essential
  fatty acids, Omega-6 and Omega-3, are not currently mentioned in these
  standards, and a reference value has been supplied.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You may search this list of foods and view nutrient values for different serving
  sizes; you may also rank foods in order of level of a particular nutrient. You
  may change the daily calorie level to correspond to your personal metabolism,
  and the levels for fat, carbohydrates, fiber, and protein are automatically
  adjusted. You may customize the ratios of carbohydrates to protein to fat to
  suit your personal regimen. You may add your own recipes to the database, by
  creating them from the foods in the database. You can also add foods from the
  information on commercial food labels. The program is completely menu-driven
  and there are no commands to learn.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>NUT</b> can be called with an optional argument to specify a database
  subdirectory. For example, if a user tracks meals for other family members,
  each person can have his own database, and each database is entirely separate.
  The database subdirectory name (if there is one) is displayed on all screens.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The functions included are:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Record Meals:</b> Foods are found in the database, a number of servings,
  weight, or calories is entered, and thus a meal is recorded showing the amount
  of each food eaten. The meal date can be entered in full &quot;yyyymmdd&quot;
  format or as a positive or negative offset from today, such as &quot;-3&quot;
  or &quot;+1&quot;. All numbers expressing food quantities are entered as
  decimal numbers, but the number of servings can also be entered as a common
  fraction such as 3/4. An analysis screen can be brought up by typing a dot.
  Individual foods are deleted from the meal list by entering the food number
  shown, but you can also modify the quantity by typing the food number and a
  new quantity, for example &quot;2 100g&quot;, i.e. change food #2 to 100
  grams.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Automatic Portion Control: A major feature of NUT is to be able to associate a
  meal food with an automatically-adjusted quantity to enable easy portion
  control. For instance, if you want food #4 on the menu to always be adjusted
  so that the entire meal exactly meets the Daily Value for protein, type
  &quot;4 p&quot;; if food #7 is a carb food, type &quot;7 c&quot; to adjust
  non-fiber carb; or if food #1 is a fat food, type &quot;1 f&quot; to
  automatically adjust the total fat of the meal. An alternate way to specify
  the previous three commands in a single command is &quot;pcf 4 7 1&quot;.
  Then, as you edit other food quantities or add or subtract foods, the
  automatic portion control produces an entire meal that exactly fits your plan.
  There can only be one protein food, one carb food, and one fat food designated
  per meal. An inappropriate designation such as designating table salt as a fat
  food will usually result in a quantity of zero. Negative quantities in
  designated foods indicate too much protein, carb, or fat in non-designated
  foods. To remove a portion control designation, type the food number and the
  designation you want to remove; for instance, if food #5 is designated as a
  fat food, type &quot;5 f&quot; to remove the designation, or else type a new
  pcf command that does not include food #5 as a fat food. There is also an
  extension to the feature to balance a meal for Thiamin &quot;t&quot;,
  Pantothenic Acid &quot;n&quot;, Vitamin E &quot;e&quot;, Calcium
  &quot;l&quot;, Iron &quot;i&quot;, Potassium &quot;k&quot;, and Zinc
  &quot;z&quot;, but these commands have to be issued individually and not as
  part of a &quot;pcf&quot; command. These additional commands &quot;t&quot;,
  &quot;n&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, and
  &quot;z&quot; are only valuable when meals habitually lack the specified
  nutrient and it makes sense to try to get some of the nutrient at every meal
  to avoid a large cumulative deficiency.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For the program analysis to come out right you must record all the meals the
  program is set for. For instance, if set for three meals, and you eat more
  than three, combine them into three; if you eat less than three, record some
  mimimal item such as an ounce of water for each missing meal. (See below under
  &quot;Delete Meals and Set Meals Per Day&quot; for the means to set the
  program to between 1 and 19 meals per day instead of the default 3.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Analyze Meals and Food Suggestions:</b> An analysis of meals in the database
  is presented in terms of the percentage of each nutrient, where 100% signifies
  a rate of 100% of the DV (Daily Value) per day. The program will analyze any
  subset of the latest meals recorded, considering each meal to be an
  appropriate fraction of a day. By pressing &quot;s&quot; on the analysis
  screen, nutrients for which the DV have not been achieved are listed, and some
  random foods are chosen from the database which contain the additional
  nutrients. By pressing &quot;e&quot; all values are reset to the absolute
  values in the analysis to provide an easy method to compare periods (this
  feature is not in the graphical interface). By pressing &quot;o&quot; all DV
  defaults are restored replacing comparison mode. By pressing &quot;d&quot; the
  display alternates between DV percentages, absolute values of the DV
  nutrients, and a series of screens of all additional nutrients in the
  database. There is a &quot;p&quot; option that moves the screens back the
  other way. When you leave the analysis screen (or the &quot;View Foods&quot;
  screen) with a particular set of nutrients showing, that set of nutrients will
  be used in the other functions in the program, including printing menus,
  ranking foods, and drawing graphs.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the value &quot;(nd)&quot; shows up on a screen, it signifies the database
  has no data for that particular nutrient for the foods viewed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the analysis screen is brought up during &quot;Record Meals&quot;, it
  analyzes backwards from the meal being viewed, which might not be the last
  meal; however, the &quot;Analyze Meals&quot; screen from main menu option 2
  always analyzes from the last meal in the database.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The &quot;Record Meals&quot; and &quot;Analyze Meals&quot; analyses each
  separately remember how many meals were last analyzed, so that a user could,
  for example, always look at a single meal on the &quot;Record Meals&quot;
  analysis, and always look at a couple of weeks of meals on &quot;Analyze
  Meals&quot;, but not have to specify how many meals each time.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Shortcut to food rankings and graphs: From the analysis screen you can type the
  name of a nutrient as shown, such as Calcium with the capital &quot;C&quot;,
  and if NUT can find the nutrient, it will provide the food ranking and graph
  functions for that nutrient directly without having to go back to the Main
  Menu and navigate the hierarchy. You only have to type enough of the beginning
  of the nutrient name so that NUT can uniquely identify the nutrient.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Delete Meals and Set Meals Per Day:</b> Some or all of the collected meals
  may be removed from the database; or an automatic feature may be selected
  which keeps the meal database from getting unnecessarily huge, deleting the
  oldest meals in excess of a number of meals set by the user. When all meals
  are deleted, an option may be set to change the program's default from 3 meals
  a day to 1 to 19 meals a day.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>View Foods:</b> Foods can be viewed using the same interface as for
  &quot;Record Meals,&quot; specifying whatever serving size the user wishes to
  see analyzed for nutrient content, and if necessary typing a &quot;d&quot; or
  &quot;p&quot; to change the display to a different set of nutrients. You can
  type just the beginning of a food name or a part of a food name, and a
  numbered menu of all possible completions continues to be shown until a unique
  food is chosen.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the value &quot;(nd)&quot; shows up on a screen, it signifies the database
  has no data for that particular nutrient for the foods viewed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Add Foods and Modify Serving Sizes:</b> This item has three selections,
  &quot;Add a Recipe,&quot; &quot;Add a Labeled Food,&quot; and &quot;Modify
  Serving Sizes.&quot;
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To add a recipe, foods are selected in exactly the same way as adding a meal, a
  number of servings or weight is entered for each food, and the recipe is
  recorded. Then the software divides the recipe into the number of servings
  desired, and provides an opportunity to adjust the weight of the servings to
  allow for water gained or lost in preparation.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
NUT allows you to add a labeled food with an ordered list of ingredients and a
  nutrition statement (this feature is not in the graphical interface). The new
  food will have additional nutrients that were not on the nutrition statement,
  but that the database says are in the food. First, the labeled food is named.
  Next the program requests that the food's listed ingredients be found in the
  order of greatest to least. Do not worry about ingredients you cannot find. No
  amount or weight is set for any ingredient--the ingredient is simply selected.
  Selected ingredients may be grouped with parentheses where an ingredient
  number is followed by either &quot;(&quot;, &quot;)&quot;, or &quot;!&quot; to
  begin a group, end a group, or remove a group indicator. To delete an
  ingredient, simply type its number; to move an ingredient, type its number, an
  &quot;m&quot;, and the destination--such as &quot;5m2&quot;. When the
  ingredient list is complete, the nutrient lists are presented so the
  nutritional information can be copied into the program. Whenever you quit a
  nutrient screen, an opportunity is presented to select a different set of
  nutrients. The &quot;DV&quot; percentages for this part of the program are the
  USA standard 2000-calorie Daily Values, and not any customized options--but
  users can always set the label's nutrient information in grams. Only Daily
  Value nutrients greater than zero are considered as constraints when NUT
  constructs an approximate recipe in order to fill in nutrient values that were
  not expressed on the food label. Occasionally the &quot;recipe&quot; that NUT
  estimates for a packaged food will only show a &quot;trace&quot; of every
  ingredient, and this is NUT's way of saying that according to the food
  database, there is no way to match the ingredients with the constraints of the
  nutrition statement. After the recipe is displayed there is an additional
  opportunity to edit the nutrient values. Perhaps the food was so heavily
  fortified with vitamins that the user waited until after NUT constructed a
  recipe to specify the additional vitamin amounts. Whatever the rationale for
  additional editing, the user has total control over the nutritional
  information no matter what NUT's approximate recipe suggested. The new food
  record is saved in the database in the same manner as a recipe.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To modify the serving size of an existing food, the food is selected and the
  serving sizes on file are displayed so one can be selected. Alternately, the
  user may simply type in his own serving size consisting of number of grams,
  the serving unit (such as cups or tablespoons), and the serving quantity.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>View Nutrients and Rank Foods:</b> The nutrients are reviewed and one of the
  nutrients is selected to list all the foods rich in that nutrient. The food
  database can be queried in this manner for nutrients per 100 grams, per 100
  grams dry weight, per 100 grams within a USDA-defined food group, per 100
  calories, per serving, per serving minimizing some other nutrient, and per
  recorded meals (average intake per day). The set of nutrients operated on are
  the last set viewed or analyzed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The &quot;Rank Foods per Recorded Meals&quot; option is useful for discovering
  which foods contribute the most to your intake of a particular nutrient. When
  you use &quot;Record Meals&quot; to view a meal earlier than your last meal,
  this &quot;per recorded meals&quot; option looks back from that same meal, to
  show which foods you were eating during that earlier period. Likewise, the
  program remembers how many meals were last analyzed, and only searches that
  subset of meals to find which foods to list.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that processed foods which contain hydrogenated vegetable oil or
  significant &quot;trans-&quot; fats may not contain as much of the essential
  fatty acids as the program shows because the USDA database does not yet
  completely distinguish between essential fatty acids and the
  &quot;trans-&quot; fats, which cannot serve for essential fatty acids in the
  body.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Set Personal Options and</b> <b>Log Weight:</b> These screens set options for
  nutrient levels to use when analyzing meals. Some of the carbohydrate and
  protein settings are mutually exclusive and affect the fat percentages as
  carbs, protein, and fat of course must total 100%; however, calories per gram
  vary from food to food, so the percentage of calories from carbs, protein, and
  fat will vary even if grams of each remain constant, so consider these
  settings approximations.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The options for polyunsatured fat and the &quot;Omega-6/3 Balance&quot; target
  select reference values (there are no &quot;Daily Values&quot; for these)
  based on Dr. William Lands' empirical equation for the percentages of Omega-6
  and Omega-3 fatty acids in tissue phospholipids based on diet. The program
  recomputes all fatty acid values automatically whenever the analysis changes.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
&quot;Weight Log Regression&quot; does not tell you what you weigh; what it does
  is apply linear regression to a series of daily weight and body fat percentage
  entries to smooth out the random noise and tell you which direction your
  weight is trending, how fast it is going there, and how much of the change is
  lean or fat. To make a daily entry, type the weight and body fat percentage at
  the prompt, like this: &quot;150.2 17.9&quot;. If you did not measure the body
  fat percentage, just type the weight. This algorithm is free of units, so it
  will work with weights in pounds or kilos or even stone (but not stone plus
  pounds). The daily entry is automatically timestamped, so it should be entered
  into the program immediately after measurement and the program will not accept
  more than one entry per day. If you want to erase the weight log and start
  over, just type a &quot;!&quot;, or you may directly edit the file
  &quot;WLOG.txt&quot; in the &quot;.nutdb&quot; directory. Clearing the weight
  log leaves the very last entry in order to quickly start a new cycle of
  logging. The daily lean and fat mass totals can be seen explicitly by looking
  at the &quot;WLOG.aux&quot; file in the &quot;.nutdb&quot; directory.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The &quot;Calorie Auto-Set&quot; feature utilizes &quot;Weight Log
  Regression&quot; in a special way to automatically optimize the calorie level
  to improve body composition. Since the user is inputting daily weight and body
  fat percentage measurements and eating according to the calorie level shown,
  NUT can determine if fat mass is going down and lean mass is going up at that
  particular calorie level. If so, NUT does nothing. If fat mass is going up,
  NUT lowers the calories by 20. If both fat mass and lean mass are going down,
  NUT raises the calories by 20. If NUT makes calorie adjustments and is able to
  correct the direction of the regression lines and thus achieve true progress,
  NUT then automatically clears the weight log to start the cycle again, and
  initializes the new weight log with the terminus of the previous regression.
  Therefore, each regression cycle between clearings should reflect lean mass
  going up and and fat mass going down. Cycles alternate between the previously
  described cycle which preferentially prevents fat mass gain and an inverse
  cycle which preferentially prevents lean mass loss: In this alternate cycle,
  if lean mass is going down, NUT raises the calories by 20, but if both lean
  and fat mass are going up, NUT lowers the calories by 20. The automatic
  clearing of the weight log signals success for a cycle, but there may be
  periods of progress when no calorie adjustments are necessary.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Plot Daily and Monthly Trends:</b> The list of nutrients is presented and one
  nutrient is chosen for its level to be graphed facing a plot of protein,
  carbohydrate, and fat calories. The user enters the number of the nutrient
  plus a letter, either &quot;d&quot; or &quot;m&quot; to specify
  &quot;daily&quot; or &quot;monthly&quot; i.e., &quot;22m&quot;. It is only
  necessary to enter the &quot;d&quot; or &quot;m&quot; once in order to set the
  mode. Monthly graphs cover the entire period of the meal database; daily
  graphs cover 36 days back from the last meal viewed or analyzed. The graphs of
  Daily Values for fat are special and show the constituent fat types
  symbolically where . = non-fatty acid constituents, s = saturated, m =
  monounsaturated, 6 = unspecified Omega-6, 3 = unspecified Omega-3, L =
  linoleic acid, A = arachidonic acid, n = linolenic acid, e = EPA, and d = DHA.
  In a similar vein, the &quot;Total Carb&quot; graph shows non-fiber carb as
  &quot;.&quot; and fiber as &quot;:&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Record 'The Usual'--Customary Meals:</b> When <b>NUT</b> asks what you are
  having, you can answer &quot;the usual.&quot; Specifically, this function
  allows you to record a customary meal, and give it a name. Later, when
  recording a regular meal, all these foods can be added to the meal quickly by
  typing &quot;theusualname&quot;, where &quot;name&quot; is the name you gave
  to the customary meal. Foods added this way can be individually deleted from
  the meal, and other foods added, because this function does not make the
  individual foods lose their identity as in &quot;Add a Recipe.&quot;
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Print Menus from Meal Database:</b> Makes a printable file (called
  &quot;menus.txt&quot; in the current directory) which lists foods and
  quantities recorded for each meal, and a nutrient analysis that is the sum of
  nutrients for each meal, not the rate of nutrient intake as on the
  &quot;Analyze Meals&quot; screen. In common with other functions in the
  program, it looks back from the last meal recorded or analyzed, only prints
  the number of meals last analyzed, and prints that set of nutrients last
  displayed on an analysis or &quot;View Foods&quot; screen.
