<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
SPLAT! is a powerful terrestrial RF propagation and terrain
analysis tool for the spectrum between 20 MHz and 20 GHz.
SPLAT! is free software, and is designed for operation on
<br>
Unix and Linux-based work- stations. Redistribution and/or
modification is permitted under the terms of the GNU General
Public License, Version 2, as published by the Free
Soft&acirc; <br>
ware Foundation. Adoption of SPLAT! source code in
proprietary or closed-source applications is a violation of
this license and is strictly forbidden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPLAT! is distributed in the
hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY,
without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See <br>
the GNU General Public License for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION <br>
Applications of SPLAT! include the visualization, design,
and link budget analysis of wireless Wide Area Networks
(WANs), commercial and amateur radio communication systems
above <br>
20 MHz, microwave links, frequency coordination and
interference studies, and the prediction of analog and
digital terrestrial radio and television contour
regions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPLAT! provides RF site
engineering data such as great circle distances and bearings
between sites, antenna elevation angles (uptilt), depression
angles (downtilt), antenna <br>
height above mean sea level, antenna height above average
terrain, bearings, distances, and elevations to known
obstructions, Irregular Terrain Model path attenuation, and
<br>
received signal strength. In addition, the minimum antenna
height requirements needed to clear terrain, the first
Fresnel zone, and any user-definable percentage of the first
<br>
Fresnel zone are also provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPLAT! produces reports, graphs,
and high resolution topographic maps that depict
line-of-sight paths, and regional path loss and signal
strength contours through which expected <br>
coverage areas of transmitters and repeater systems can be
obtained. When performing line-of-sight and Irregular
Terrain Model analyses in situations where multiple
transmitter <br>
or repeater sites are employed, SPLAT! determines individual
and mutual areas of coverage within the network
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
SPLAT! is a command-line driven application and reads input
data through a number of data files. Some files are
mandatory for successful execution of the program, while
others <br>
are optional. Mandatory files include digital elevation
topography models in the form of SPLAT Data Files (SDF
files), site location files (QTH files), and Irregular
Terrain <br>
Model parameter files (LRP files). Optional files include
city location files, cartographic boundary files,
user-defined terrain files, path loss input files, antenna
radiation <br>
pattern files, and color definition files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPLAT DATA FILES <br>
SPLAT! imports topographic data in the form of SPLAT Data
Files (SDFs). These files may be generated from a number of
information sources. In the United States, SPLAT Data Files
<br>
can be generated through U.S. Geological Survey Digital
Elevation Models (DEMs) using the postdownload and usgs2sdf
utilities included with SPLAT!. USGS Digital Elevation
Models <br>
compatible with these utilities may be down- loaded
from:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://edcftp.cr.usgs.gov/pub/data/DEM/250/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Significantly better resolution
and accuracy can be obtained through the use of SRTM Version
2 digital elevation models, especially when supplemented by
USGS-derived SDF data. <br>
These one-degree by one- degree models are the product of
the Space Shuttle STS-99 Radar Topography Mission, and are
available for most populated regions of the Earth. SPLAT
Data <br>
Files may be generated from 3 arc-second SRTM-3 data using
the included srtm2sdf utility. SRTM-3 Version 2.1 data may
be obtained through anonymous FTP from:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/SRTM3/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that SRTM filenames refer
to the latitude and longitude of the southwest corner of the
topographic dataset contained within the file. Therefore,
the region of interest must <br>
lie north and east of the latitude and longitude provided in
the SRTM filename. Even greater resolution and accuracy can
be obtained by using 1 arc-second SRTM-1 Version 2.1 <br>
topography data. This data is available for the United
States and its territories and possessions, and may be down-
loaded from:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/SRTM1/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">High resolution SDF files for
use with SPLAT! HD may begenerated from data in this format
using the srtm2sdf-hd utility. Despite the higher accuracy
that SRTM data has to offer, <br>
some voids in the data sets exist. When voids are detected,
the srtm2sdf and srtm2sdf-hd utilities replace them with
corresponding data found in usgs2sdf generated SDF files. If
<br>
USGS-derived SDF data is not available, voids are handled
through adjacent pixel averaging, or direct replacement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPLAT! Data Files contain
integer value topographic elevations in meters referenced to
mean sea level for 1-degree by 1-degree regions of the
Earth. SDF files can be read by <br>
SPLAT! in either standard format (.sdf) as generated
directly by the usgs2sdf, srtm2sdf, and srtm2sdf-hd
utilities, or in bzip2 compressed format (.sdf.bz2). Since
uncompressed <br>
files can be read slightly faster than files that have been
compressed, SPLAT! searches for needed SDF data in
uncompressed format first. If uncompressed data cannot be
located, <br>
SPLAT! then searches for data in bzip2 compressed format. If
no compressed SDF files can be found for the region
requested, SPLAT! assumes the region is over water, and will
<br>
assign an elevation of sea-level to these areas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature of SPLAT! makes it
possible to perform path analysis not only over land, but
also between coastal areas not represented by Digital
Elevation Model data. However, <br>
this behavior of SPLAT! underscores the importance of having
all the SDF files required for the region being analyzed if
meaningful results are to be expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SITE LOCATION (QTH) FILES <br>
SPLAT! imports site location information of transmitter and
receiver sites analyzed by the program from ASCII files
having a .qth extension. QTH files contain the site&acirc;s
name, <br>
the site&acirc;s latitude (positive if North of the equator,
negative if South), the site&acirc;s longitude (in degrees
West, 0 to 360 degrees, or degrees East 0 to -360 degrees),
and the <br>
site&acirc;s antenna height above ground level (AGL), each
separated by a single line- feed character. The antenna
height is assumed to be specified in feet unless followed by
the let&acirc; <br>
ter m or the word meters in either upper or lower case.
Latitude and longitude information may be expressed in
either decimal format (74.6864) or degree, minute, second
(DMS) <br>
format (74 41 11.0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, aread as follows:
site locationfile describing television station WNJT-DT,
Trenton, NJ (wnjt-dt.qth) might read as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WNJT-DT <br>
40.2828 <br>
74.6864 <br>
990.00</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each transmitter and receiver
site analyzed by SPLAT! must be represented by its own site
location (QTH) file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IRREGULAR TERRAIN MODEL
PARAMETER (LRP) FILES <br>
Irregular Terrain Model Parameter data files are required
for SPLAT! to determine RF path loss, field strength, or
received signal power level in either point-to-point or area
<br>
prediction mode. Irregular Terrain Model parameter data is
read from files having the same base name as the transmitter
site QTH file, but with a .lrp extension. SPLAT! LRP files
<br>
share the following format (wnjt-dt.lrp):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">15.000 ; Earth Dielectric
Constant (Relative permittivity) <br>
0.005 ; Earth Conductivity (Siemens per meter) <br>
301.000 ; Atmospheric Bending Constant (N-units) <br>
647.000 ; Frequency in MHz (20 MHz to 20 GHz) <br>
5 ; Radio Climate (5 = Continental Temperate) <br>
0 ; Polarization (0 = Horizontal, 1 = Vertical) <br>
0.50 ; Fraction of situations (50% of locations) <br>
0.90 ; Fraction of time (90% of the time) <br>
46000.0 ; Effective Radiated Power (ERP) in Watts
(optional)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an LRP file corresponding to
the tx_site QTH file cannot be found, SPLAT! scans the
current working directory for the file
&quot;splat.lrp&quot;. If this file cannot be found, then
<br>
default parameters will be assigned by SPLAT! and a
corresponding &quot;splat.lrp&quot; file containing these
default parameters will be written to the cur- rent working
directory. The <br>
generated &quot;splat.lrp&quot; file can then be edited by
the user as needed. Typical Earth dielectric constants and
conductivity values are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dielectric Constant Conductivity
<br>
Salt water : 80 5.000 <br>
Good ground : 25 0.020 <br>
Fresh water : 80 0.010 <br>
Marshy land : 12 0.007 <br>
Farmland, forest : 15 0.005 <br>
Average ground : 15 0.005 <br>
Mountain, sand : 13 0.002 <br>
City : 5 0.001 <br>
Poor ground : 4 0.001</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Radio climate codes used by
SPLAT! are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1: Equatorial (Congo) <br>
2: Continental Subtropical (Sudan) <br>
3: Maritime Subtropical (West coast of Africa) <br>
4: Desert (Sahara) <br>
5: Continental Temperate <br>
6: Maritime Temperate, over land (UK and west coasts of US
&amp; EU) <br>
7: Maritime Temperate, over sea</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Continental Temperate
climate is common to large land masses in the temperate
zone, such as the United States. For paths shorter than 100
km, there is little difference <br>
between Continental and Maritime Temperate climates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The seventh and eighth
parameters in the .lrp file correspond to the statistical
analysis provided by the ITM model. In this example, SPLAT!
will return the maximum path loss <br>
occurring 50% of the time (fraction of time, or Time
Variability) in 90% of situations (fraction of situations,
or Location Variability). This is often denoted as F(50,90)
in <br>
Longley-Rice studies. In the United States, an F(50,90)
criteria is typically used for digital television (8-level
VSB modulation), while F(50,50) is used for analog (VSB-
<br>
AM+NTSC) broadcasts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For further information on ITM
propagation model parameters, please refer to:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/resources/radio-propagation-software/itm/itm.aspx
<br>

http://www.softwright.com/faq/engineering/prop_longley_rice.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last parameter in the .lrp
file corresponds to the transmitter&acirc;s Effective
Radiated Power (ERP), and is optional. If it is included in
the .lrp file, then SPLAT! will compute <br>
received signal strength levels and field strength level
contours when performing ITM studies. If the parameter is
omitted, path loss is com- puted instead. The ERP provided
in <br>
the .lrp file can be overridden by using SPLAT!&acirc;s -erp
command-line switch. If the .lrp file contains an ERP
parameter and the generation of path loss rather than field
strength <br>
contours is desired, the ERP can be assigned to zero using
the -erp switch without having to edit the .lrp file to
accomplish the same result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CITY LOCATION FILES <br>
The names and locations of cities, tower sites, or other
points of interest may be imported and plotted on
topographic maps generated by SPLAT!. SPLAT! imports the
names of <br>
cities and locations from ASCII files containing the
location of interest&acirc;s name, latitude, and longitude.
Each field is separated by a comma. Each record is separated
by a sin&acirc; <br>
gle line feed character. As was the case with the .qth
files, latitude and longitude information may be entered in
either decimal or degree, minute, second (DMS) format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example (cities.dat):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Teaneck, 40.891973, 74.014506
<br>
Tenafly, 40.919212, 73.955892 <br>
Teterboro, 40.859511, 74.058908 <br>
Tinton Falls, 40.279966, 74.093924 <br>
Toms River, 39.977777, 74.183580 <br>
Totowa, 40.906160, 74.223310 <br>
Trenton, 40.219922, 74.754665</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A total of five separate city
data files may be imported at a time, and there is no limit
to the size of these files. SPLAT! reads city data on a
&quot;first come/first served&quot; basis, <br>
and plots only those locations whose annotations do not
conflict with annotations of locations read earlier in the
current city data file, or in previ- ous files. This
behavior <br>
minimizes clutter in SPLAT! generated topographic maps, but
also mandates that important locations be placed toward the
beginning of the first city data file, and locations less
<br>
important be positioned further down the list or in
subsequent data files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">City data files may be generated
manually using any text editor, imported from other sources,
or derived from data available from the U.S. Census Bureau
using the itydecoder <br>
utility included with SPLAT!. Such data is available free of
charge via the Internet at:
http://web.archive.org/web/20130331172800/http://www.cen&acirc;
<br>
sus.gov/geo/www/cob/bdy_files.html, and must be in ASCII
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CARTOGRAPHIC BOUNDARY DAT A
FILES <br>
Cartographic boundary data may also be imported to plot the
boundaries of cities, counties, or states on topographic
maps generated by SPLAT!. Such data must be of the form of
<br>
ARC/INFO Ungenerate (ASCII Format) Metadata Cartographic
Boundary Files, and are available from the U.S. Census
Bureau via the Internet at these sites:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://web.archive.org/web/20130331144934/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/co2000.html#ascii
<br>

http://web.archive.org/web/20130507075658/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/pl2000.html#ascii</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A total of five separate
cartographic boundary files may be imported at a time. It is
not necessary to import state boundaries if county
boundaries have already been imported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROGRAM OPERATION <br>
SPLAT! is invoked via the command-line using a series of
switches and arguments. Since SPLAT! is a CPU and memory
intensive application, this type of interface minimizes
overhead <br>
and lends itself well to scripted (batch) operations.
SPLAT!&acirc;s CPU and memory scheduling priority may be
modified through the use of the Unix nice command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number and type of switches
passed to SPLAT! determine its mode of operation and method
of output data generation. Nearly all of SPLAT!&acirc;s
switches may be cascaded in any <br>
order on the command line when invoking the program. Simply
typing splat on the command line will return a summary of
SPLAT!&acirc;s command line options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BSPLAT! v1.4.1 Available

-metric employ metric rather than imperial units for all
user I/O <br>
-olditm invoke older ITM propagation model rather than the
newer ITWOM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command-line options for
splat and splat-hd are identical. The -log command line
switch causes all invoked command line options to be logged
to a file of your choosing (log&acirc; <br>
file.txt):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -s
nj_cities -o topo_map -log logfile.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPLAT! operates in two distinct
modes: point-to-point mode, and area prediction mode. Either
a line-of- sight (LOS) or Irregular Terrain (ITM)
propagation model may be invoked by <br>
the user. True Earth, fourthirds Earth, or any other
user-defined Earth radius may be specified when performing
line-of-sight analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POINT-TO-POINT ANALYSIS <br>
SPLAT! may be used to perform line-of-sight terrain analysis
between two specified site locations. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t tx_site.qth -r
rx_site.qth</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invokes a line-of-sight terrain
analysis between the transmitter specified in tx_site.qth
and receiver specified in rx_site.qth using a True Earth
radius model, and writes a <br>
SPLAT! Path Analysis Report to the current working
directory. The report contains details of the transmitter
and receiver sites, and identifies the loca- tion of any
obstructions <br>
detected along the line-of-sight path. If an obstruction can
be cleared by raising the receive antenna to a greater
altitude, SPLAT! will indicate the minimum antenna height
<br>
required for a line- of-sight path to exist between the
transmitter and receiver locations specified. Note that
imperial units (miles, feet) are specified unless the
-metric <br>
switch is added to SPLAT!&acirc;s command line options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t tx_site.qth -r
rx_site.qth -metric</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the antenna must be raised a
significant amount, this determination may take a few
moments. Note that the results provided are the minimum
necessary for a line-of-sight path <br>
to exist, and in the case of this sim- ple example, do not
take Fresnel zone clearance requirements into consideration.
qth extensions are assumed by SPLAT! for QTH files, and <br>
are optional when specifying -t and -r arguments on the
command-line. SPLAT! automatically reads all SPLAT Data
Files necessary to conduct the terrain analysis between the
sites <br>
specified. SPLAT! searches for the required SDF files in the
current working directory first. If the needed files are not
found, SPLAT! then searches in the path specified by the
<br>
-d com- mand-line switch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -d
/cdrom/sdf/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An external directory path may
be specified by placing a &quot;.splat_path&quot; file under
the user&acirc;s home directory. This file must contain the
full directory path of last resort to all <br>
the SDF files. The path in the $HOME/.splat_path file must
be of the form of a single line of ASCII text:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/opt/splat/sdf/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and can be generated using any
text editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A graph of the terrain profile
between the receiver and transmitter locations as a function
of distance from the receiver can be generated by adding the
-p switch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -p
terrain_profile.png</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPLAT! invokes gnuplot when
generating graphs. The filename extension specified to
SPLAT! deter- mines the format of the graph produced. .png
will produce a 640x480 color PNG <br>
graphic file, while .ps or .postscript will produce
postscript output. Output in formats such as GIF, Adobe
Illustrator, AutoCAD dxf, LaTeX, and many others are
available. Please <br>
consult gnuplot, and gnuplot&acirc;s documentation for
details on all the supported output formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A graph of elevations subtended
by the terrain between the receiver and transmitter as a
function of distance from the receiver can be generated by
using the -e switch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -e
elevation_profile.png</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The graph produced using this
switch illustrates the elevation and depression angles
resulting from the terrain between the receiver&acirc;s
location and the transmitter site from the <br>
perspective of the receiver&acirc;s location. A second trace
is plotted between the left side of the graph
(receiver&acirc;s location) and the location of the
transmitting antenna on the <br>
right. This trace illustrates the elevation angle required
for a line-of-sight path to exist between the receiver and
transmitter locations. If the trace intersects the elevation
<br>
profile at any point on the graph, then this is an
indication that a line-of-sight path does not exist under
the conditions given, and the obstructions can be clearly
identified <br>
on the graph at the point(s) of intersection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A graph illustrating terrain
height referenced to a line-of-sight path between the
transmitter and receiver may be generated using the -h
switch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -h
height_profile.png</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A terrain height plot normalized
to the transmitter and receiver antenna heights can be
obtained using the -H switch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -H
normalized_height_profile.png</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A contour of the Earth&acirc;s
curvature is also plotted in this mode. The first Fresnel
Zone, and 60% of the first Fresnel Zone can be added to
height profile graphs by adding the -f <br>
switch, and specifying a frequency (in MHz) at which the
Fresnel Zone should be modeled:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -f

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -l

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As before, adding the -metric
switch forces the graphs to be plotted using metric units of
measure. The -gpsav switch instructs SPLAT! to preserve
(rather than delete) the gnu&acirc; <br>
plot working files generated during SPLAT! execution,
allowing the user to edit these files and re-run gnuplot if
desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When performing a point-to-point
analysis, a SPLAT! Path Analysis Report is generated in the
form of a text file with a .txt filename extension. The
report contains bearings and <br>
distances between the transmitter and receiver, as well as
the free-space and ITM path loss for the path being
analyzed. The mode of propagation for the path is given as
Line-of- <br>
Sight, Single Horizon, Double Horizon, Diffraction Dominant,
or Tr oposcatter Dominant. Additionally, if the receiver is
located at the peak of a single obstruction or at the <br>
peak of a second obstruction, SPLAT! will report RX at Peak
Terrain Along Path when operating under the ITWOM
propagation model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Distances and locations to known
obstructions along the path between transmitter and receiver
are also pro- vided. If the transmitter&acirc;s effective
radiated power is specified in <br>
the transmitter&acirc;s corresponding .lrp file, then
predicted signal strength and antenna voltage at the
receiving location is also provided in the Path Analysis
Report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To determine the signal-to-noise
(SNR) ratio at remote location where random Johnson
(thermal) noise is the primary limiting factor in
reception:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SNR = T &acirc; NJ &acirc; L + G
&acirc; NF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where T is the ERP of the
transmitter in dBW in the direction of the receiver, NJ is
Johnson Noise in dBW (-136 dBW for a 6 MHz television
channel), L is the path loss provided <br>
by SPLAT! in dB (as a positive number), G is the receive
antenna gain in dB over isotropic, and NF is the receiver
noise figure in dB. ,T may be computed as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T = TI + GT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where TI is actual amount of RF
power delivered to the transmitting antenna in dBW, GT is
the transmit- ting antenna gain (over isotropic) in the
direction of the receiver (or <br>
the horizon if the receiver is over the horizon).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To compute how much more signal
is available over the minimum to necessary to achieve a
specific signal-to-noise ratio:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Signal_Margin = SNR &acirc;
S</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where S is the minimum required
SNR ratio (15.5 dB for ATSC (8-level VSB) DTV, 42 dB for
analog NTSC television).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A topographic map may be
generated by SPLAT! to visualize the path between the
transmitter and receiver sites from yet another perspective.
Topographic maps generated by SPLAT! <br>
display elevations using a log- arithmic grayscale, with
higher elevations represented through brighter shades of
gray. The dynamic range of the image is scaled between the
high&acirc; <br>
est and lowest elevations present in the map. The only
exception to this is sea-level, which is represented using
the color blue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Topographic output is invoked
using the -o switch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -o
topo_map.ppm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .ppm extension on the output
filename is assumed by SPLAT!, and is optional. In this
example, topo_map.ppm will illustrate the locations of the
transmitter and receiver <br>
sites specified. In addition, the great circle path between
the two sites will be drawn over locations for which an
unobstructed path exists to the transmitter at a receiving
<br>
antenna height equal to that of the receiver site (specified
in rx_site.qth).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It may desirable to populate the
topographic map with names and locations of cities, tower
sites, or other important locations. A city file may be
passed to SPLAT! using the -s <br>
switch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -s
cities.dat -o topo_map</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Up to five separate city files
may be passed to SPLAT! at a time following the -s switch.
County and state boundaries may be added to the map by
specifying up to five U.S. Cen&acirc; <br>
sus Bureau cartographic boundary files using the -b
switch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -b
co34_d00.dat -o topo_map</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In situations where multiple
transmitter sites are in use, as many as four site locations
may be passed to SPLAT! at a time for analysis:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t tx_site1 tx_site2
tx_site3 tx_site4 -r rx_site -p profile.png</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, four separate
terrain profiles and obstruction reports will be generated
by SPLAT!. A sin- gle topographic map can be specified using
the -o switch, and line-of- <br>
sight paths between each transmitter and the receiver site
indicated will be produced on the map, each in its own
color. The path between the first transmitter specified to
the <br>
receiver will be in green, the path between the second
transmitter and the receiver will be in cyan, the path
between the third transmitter and the receiver will be in
violet, <br>
and the path between the fourth transmitter and the receiver
will be in sienna.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPLAT! generated topographic
maps are 24-bit TrueColor Portable PixMap (PPM) images. They
may be viewed, edited, or converted to other graphic formats
by popular image viewing <br>
applications such as xv, The GIMP, ImageMagick, and XPaint.
PNG format is highly recommended for lossless compressed
storage of SPLAT! generated topographic output files. <br>
ImageMagick&acirc;s command-line utility easily con- verts
SPLAT!&acirc;s PPM files to PNG format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">convert splat_map.ppm
splat_map.png</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another excellent PPM to PNG
command-line utility is available at:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/book/sources.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a last resort, PPM files may
be compressed using the bzip2 utility, and read directly by
The GIMP in this format. The -ngs option assigns all terrain
to the color white, and <br>
can be used when it is desirable to generate a map that is
devoid of terrain:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -b
co34_d00.dat -ngs -o white_map</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The resulting .ppm image file
can be converted to .png format with a transparent
background using ImageMagick&acirc;s convert utility:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">convert -transparent #FFFFFF

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REGIONAL COVERAGE ANALYSIS <br>
SPLAT! can analyze a transmitter or repeater site, or
network of sites, and predict the regional coverage for each
site specified. In this mode, SPLAT! can generate a
topographic <br>
map displaying the geometric line- of-sight coverage area of
the sites based on the location of each site and the height
of receive antenna wish- ing to communicate with the site
<br>
in question. A regional analysis may be performed by SPLAT!
using the -c switch as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t tx_site -c 30.0 -s
cities.dat -b co34_d00.dat -o tx_coverage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, SPLAT!
generates a topographic map called tx_coverage.ppm that
illustrates the predicted line-of-sight regional coverage of
tx_site to receiving locations having <br>
antennas 30.0 feet above ground level (AGL). If the -metric
switch is used, the argument following the -c switch is
interpreted as being in meters rather than in feet. The
con&acirc; <br>
tents of cities.dat are plotted on the map, as are the
cartographic bound- aries contained in the file
co34_d00.dat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When plotting line-of-sight
paths and areas of regional coverage, SPLAT! by default does
not account for the effects of atmospheric bending. However,
this behavior may be modi&acirc; <br>
fied by using the Earth radius mul- tiplier (-m) switch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t wnjt-dt -c 30.0 -m
1.333 -s cities.dat -b counties.dat -o map.ppm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An earth radius multiplier of
1.333 instructs SPLAT! to use the &quot;four-thirds
earth&quot; model for line-of-sight propagation analysis.
Any appropriate earth radius multiplier may be <br>
selected by the user. When performing a regional analysis,
SPLAT! generates a site report for each station analyzed.
SPLAT! site reports contain details of the site&acirc;s
geo&acirc; <br>
graphic location, its height above mean sea level, the
antenna&acirc;s height above mean sea level, the
antenna&acirc;s height above average terrain, and the height
of the average ter- rain <br>
calculated toward the bearings of 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225,
270, and 315 degrees azimuth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DETERMINING MULTIPLE REGIONS OF
LOS COVERAGE <br>
SPLAT! can also display line-of-sight coverage areas for as
many as four separate transmitter sites on a common
topographic map. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t site1 site2 site3 site4
-c 10.0 -metric -o network.ppm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plots the regional line-of-sight
coverage of site1, site2, site3, and site4 based on a
receive antenna located 10.0 meters above ground level. A
topographic map is then written <br>
to the file network.ppm. The line-of-sight coverage area of
the transmitters are plotted as follows in the colors
indicated (along with their corre- sponding RGB values in
deci&acirc; <br>
mal):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">site1: Green (0,255,0) <br>
site2: Cyan (0,255,255) <br>
site3: Medium Violet (147,112,219) <br>
site4: Sienna 1 (255,130,71) <br>
site1 + site2: Yellow (255,255,0) <br>
site1 + site3: Pink (255,192,203) <br>
site1 + site4: Green Yellow (173,255,47) <br>
site2 + site3: Orange (255,165,0) <br>
site2 + site4: Dark Sea Green 1 (193,255,193) <br>
site3 + site4: Dark Turquoise (0,206,209) <br>
site1 + site2 + site3: Dark Green (0,100,0) <br>
site1 + site2 + site4: Blanched Almond (255,235,205) <br>
site1 + site3 + site4: Medium Spring Green (0,250,154) <br>
site2 + site3 + site4: Tan (210,180,140) <br>
site1 + site2 + site3 + site4: Gold2 (238,201,0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If separate .qth files are
generated, each representing a common site location but a
different antenna height, a single topographic map
illustrating the regional coverage from as <br>
many as four separate locations on a single tower may be
generated by SPLAT!.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH LOSS ANALYSIS <br>
If the -c switch is replaced by a -L switch, an ITM path
loss map for a transmitter site may be generated: splat -t
wnjt -L 30.0 -s cities.dat -b co34_d00.dat -o path_loss_map
In <br>
this mode, SPLAT! generates a multi-color map illustrating
expected signal levels in areas surrounding the transmitter
site. A legend at the bottom of the map correlates each <br>
color with a specific path loss range in decibels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -db switch allows a
threshold to be set beyond which contours will not be
plotted on the map. For example, if a path loss beyond -140
dB is irrelevant to the survey being <br>
conducted, SPLAT!&acirc;s path loss plot can be constrained
to the region bounded by the 140 dB attenuation contour as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t wnjt-dt -L 30.0 -s
cities.dat -b co34_d00.dat -db 140 -o plot.ppm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The path loss contour threshold
may be expressed as either a positive or negative
quantity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The path loss analysis range may
be modified to a user-specific distance using the -R switch.
The argument must be given in miles (or kilometers if the
-metric switch is used). <br>
If a range wider than the generated topographic map is
specified, SPLAT! will perform ITM path loss calculations
between all four corners of the area prediction map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The colors used to illustrate
contour regions in SPLAT! generated coverage maps may be
tailored by the user by creating or modifying SPLAT!&acirc;s
color definition files. SPLAT! color <br>
definition files have the same base name as the
transmitter&acirc;s .qth file, but carry .lcf, .scf, and
.dcf extensions. If the necessary file does not exist in the
current working <br>
when SPLAT! is run, a file containing default color
definition parameters that is suitable for manual editing by
the user is written into the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a regional ITM analysis is
performed and the transmitter&acirc;s ERP is not specified
or is zero, a .lcf path loss color definition file
corresponding to the transmitter site <br>
(.qth) is read by SPLAT! from the current working directory.
If a .lcf file corresponding to the transmitter site is not
found, then a default file suitable for manual editing by
<br>
the user is automatically generated by SPLAT!.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A path loss color definition
file possesses the following structure (wnjt-dt.lcf):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the path loss is less than 80
dB, the color Red (RGB = 255, 0, 0) is assigned to the

Orange (255, 128, 0) is assigned to the region. Orange (255,
165, 0) is assigned to regions having a path loss greater
than or equal to 90 dB, but less than 100 dB, and so on.
<br>
Greyscale terrain is displayed beyond the 230 dB path loss
contour. Adding the -sc switch will smooth the transitions
between the specified quantized contour levels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FIELD STRENGTH ANALYSIS <br>
If the transmitter&acirc;s effective radiated power (ERP) is
specified in the transmitter&acirc;s .lrp file, or expressed
on the command-line using the -erp switch, field strength
contours <br>
referenced to decibels over one microvolt per meter (dBuV/m)
rather than path loss are produced:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -db switch can be used in
this mode as before to limit the extent to which field
strength contours are plotted. When plotting field strength
contours, however, the argument <br>
given is interpreted as being expressed in dBuV/m. SPLAT!

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ANTENNA RADIATION PATTERN
PARAMETERS <br>
Normalized field voltage patterns for a transmitting
antenna&acirc;s horizontal and vertical planes are imported
automatically into SPLAT! when a path loss, field strength,
or received <br>
power level coverage analysis is performed. Antenna pattern
data is read from a pair of files having the same base name
as the transmitter and LRP files, but with .az and .el <br>
extensions for azimuth and elevation pattern files,
respectively. Specifi- cations regarding pattern rotation
(if any) and mechanical beam tilt and tilt direction (if
any) are <br>
also con- tained within SPLAT! antenna pattern files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the first few lines
of a SPLAT! azimuth pattern file might appear as follows
(kvea.az):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">183.0 <br>

the .az file. This is followed by azimuth headings (0 to 360
degrees) and their associated normalized field patterns
(0.000 to 1.000) sepa- rated by whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The structure of SPLAT!
elevation pattern files is slightly different. The first
line of the .el file specifies the amount of mechanical beam
tilt applied to the antenna. Note <br>
that a downward tilt (below the horizon) is expressed as a
positive angle, while an upward tilt (above the horizon) is
expressed as a negative angle. This data is followed by <br>
the azimuthal direction of the tilt, separated by
whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remainder of the file
consists of elevation angles and their corresponding
normalized voltage radiation pattern (0.000 to 1.000) values
separated by whitespace. Elevation <br>
angles must be specified over a -10.0 to +90.0 degree range.
As was the convention with mechanical beamtilt, negative
elevation angles are used to represent elevations above the
<br>
horizon, while positive angles represents elevations below
the horizon. For example, the first few lines a SPLAT!
elevation pattern file might appear as follows
(kvea.el):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.1 130.0 <br>
-10.0 0.172 <br>
-9.5 0.109 <br>
-9.0 0.115 <br>
-8.5 0.155 <br>
-8.0 0.157 <br>
-7.5 0.104 <br>
-7.0 0.029 <br>
-6.5 0.109 <br>
-6.0 0.185</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, the antenna is
mechanically tilted downward 1.1 degrees towards an azimuth
of 130.0 degrees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For best results, the resolution
of azimuth pattern data should be specified to the nearest
degree azimuth, and elevation pattern data resolution should
be specified to the near&acirc; <br>
est 0.01 degrees. If the pattern data specified does not
reach this level of resolution, SPLAT! will interpolate the
values provided to determine the data at the required
resolu&acirc; <br>
tion, although this may result in a loss in accuracy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXPORTING AND IMPORTING REGIONAL
CONTOUR DAT A <br>
Performing a regional coverage analysis based on an ITM path
analysis can be a very time consuming process, especially if
the analysis is performed repeatedly to discover what <br>
effects changes to a transmit- ter&acirc;s antenna radiation
pattern make to the predicted coverage area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This process can be expedited by
exporting the contour data produced by SPLAT! to an
alphanumeric out- put (.ano) file. The data contained in
this file can then be modified to <br>
incorporate antenna pattern effects, and imported back into
SPLAT! to quickly produce a revised contour map. Depending
on the way in which SPLAT! is invoked, alphanumeric output
<br>
files can describe regional path loss, signal strength, or
received signal power levels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, an alphanumeric
output file containing path loss information can be
generated by SPLAT! for a receive site 30 feet above ground
level over a 50 mile radius surround&acirc; <br>
ing a transmitter site to a maximum path loss of 140 dB
(assuming ERP is not specified in the transmitter&acirc;s
.lrp file) using the following syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t kvea -L 30.0 -R 50.0
-db 140 -ano pathloss.dat</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If ERP is specified in the .lrp
file or on the command line through the -erp switch, the
alphanumeric output file will instead contain predicted
field values in dBuV/m. If the <br>
-dBm command line switch is used, then the alphanumeric
output file will contain receive signal power levels in
dBm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPLAT! alphanumeric output files
can exceed many hundreds of megabytes in size. They contain
informa- tion relating to the boundaries of the region they
describe followed by lat&acirc; <br>
itudes (degrees North), longitudes (degrees West), azimuths
(referenced to True North), elevations (to the first
obstruction), followed by either path loss (in dB), received
<br>
field strength (in dBuV/m), or received signal power level
(in dBm) without regard to the transmitting antenna&acirc;s
radiation pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first few lines of a SPLAT!
alphanumeric output file could take on the following
appearance (pathloss.dat):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">119, 117 ; max_west, min_west

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comments can be placed in the
file if they are preceeded by a semicolon. The vim text
editor has proven capable of editing files of this size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note as was the case in the
antenna pattern files, negative elevation angles refer to
upward tilt (above the horizon), while positive angles refer
to downward tilt (below the <br>
horizon). These angles refer to the eleva- tion to the
receiving antenna at the height above ground level specified
using the -L switch if the path between transmitter and <br>
receiver is unobstructed. If the path between the
transmitter and receiver is obstructed, an asterisk (*) is
placed on the end of the line, and the elevation angle
returned by <br>
SPLAT! refers the elevation angle to the first obstruction
rather than the geographic location specified on the line.
This is done in response to the fact that the ITM model <br>
considers the energy reaching a distant point over an
obstructed path to be the result of the energy scattered
over the top of the first obstruction along the path. Since
energy <br>
cannot reach the obstructed location directly, the actual
elevation angle to the destination over such a path becomes
irrelevant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When modifying SPLAT! path loss
files to reflect antenna pattern data, only the last numeric
column should be amended to reflect the antenna&acirc;s
normalized gain at the azimuth and <br>
elevation angles specified in the file. Programs and scripts
capable of performing this task are left as an exercise for
the user. Modified alphanumeric output files can be <br>
imported back into SPLAT! for generating revised coverage
maps provided that the ERP and -dBm options are used as they
were when the alphanumeric output file was originally
gen&acirc; <br>
erated:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t kvea -ani pathloss.dat
-s city.dat -b county.dat -o map.ppm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that alphanumeric output
files generated by splat cannot be used with splat-hd, or
vice-versa due to the resolution incompatibility between the
two versions of the program. <br>
Also, each of the three types of alphanumeric output files
are incompatible with one another, so a file containing path
loss data cannot be imported into SPLAT! to produce signal
<br>
strength or received power level contours, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER-DEFINED TERRAIN INPUT FILES
<br>
A user-defined terrain file is a user-generated text file
containing latitudes, longitudes, and heights above ground
level of specific terrain features believed to be of
impor&acirc; <br>
tance to the SPLAT! analysis being con- ducted, but
noticeably absent from the SDF files being used. A
user-defined terrain file is imported into a SPLAT! analysis
using the -udt <br>
switch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -udt
udt_file.txt -o map.ppm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A user-defined terrain file has
the following appearance and structure:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">40.32180556, 74.1325, 100.0
meters <br>
40.321805, 74.1315, 300.0 <br>
40.3218055, 74.1305, 100.0 meters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Terrain height is interpreted as
being described in feet above ground level unless followed
by the word meters, and is added on top of the terrain
specified in the SDF data for <br>
the locations specified. Be aware that each user-defined
terrain feature specified will be interpreted as being 3-arc
seconds in both latitude and longitude in splat and 1 arc-
<br>
second in latitude and longitude in splat-hd. Features
described in the user-defined terrain file that overlap
previously defined features in the file are ignored by
SPLAT! to <br>
avoid ambiguity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GROUND CLUTTER <br>
The height of ground clutter can be specified using the -gc
switch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t wnjt-dt -r kd2bd -gc
30.0 -H wnjt-dt_path.png</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -gc switch as the effect of
raising the overall terrain by the specified amount in feet
(or meters if the -metric switch is invoked), except over
areas at sea-level and at <br>
the transmitting and receiving antenna loca- tions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIMPLE TOPOGRAPHIC MAP
GENERATION <br>
In certain situations it may be desirable to generate a
topographic map of a region without plotting coverage areas,
line-of-sight paths, or generating obstruction reports.
There <br>
are several ways of doing this. If one wishes to generate a
topographic map illustrating the location of a transmitter
and receiver site along with a brief text report describing
<br>
the locations and distances between the sites, the -n switch
should be invoked as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -n
-o topo_map.ppm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no text report is desired,
then the -N switch is used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -N
-o topo_map.ppm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a topographic map centered
about a single site out to a minimum specified radius is
desired instead, a command similar to the following can be
used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t tx_site -R 50.0 -s
NJ_Cities -b NJ_Counties -o topo_map.ppm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where -R specifies the minimum
radius of the map in miles (or kilometers if the -metric
switch is used). Note that the tx_site name and location are
not displayed in this exam&acirc; <br>
ple. If display of this information is desired, simply
create a SPLAT! city file (-s option) and append it to the
list of command-line options illustrated above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -o switch and output
filename are omitted in these operations, topographic output
is written to a file named tx_site.ppm in the current
working directory by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GEOREFERENCE FILE GENERATION
<br>
Topographic, coverage (-c), and path loss contour (-L) maps
generated by SPLAT! may be imported into Xastir (X Amateur
Station Tracking and Information Reporting) software by <br>
generating a georeference file using SPLAT!&acirc;s -geo
switch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t kd2bd -R 50.0 -s
NJ_Cities -b NJ_Counties -geo -o map.ppm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The georeference file generated
will have the same base name as the -o file specified, but
have a .geo extension, and permit proper interpretation and
display of SPLAT!&acirc;s .ppm <br>
graphics in Xastir software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GOOGLE MAP KML FILE GENERATION
<br>
Keyhole Markup Language files compatible with Google Earth
may be generated by SPLAT! when per- forming point-to-point
or regional coverage analyses by invoking the -kml
switch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splat -t wnjt-dt -r kd2bd
-kml</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The KML file generated will have
the same filename structure as a Path Analysis Report for
the transmitter and receiver site names given, except it
will carry a .kml extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once loaded into Google Earth
(File --&gt; Open), the KML file will annotate the map
display with the names of the transmitter and receiver site
locations. The viewpoint of the <br>
image will be from the position of the transmitter site
looking towards the location of the receiver. The
point-to-point path between the sites will be displayed as a
white line <br>
while the RF line-of-sight path will be displayed in green.
Google Earth&acirc;s navigation tools allow the user to
&quot;fly&quot; around the path, identify landmarks, roads,
and other fea- <br>
tured content.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When performing regional
coverage analysis, the .kml file generated by SPLAT! will
permit path loss or signal strength contours to be layered
on top of Google Earth&acirc;s display <br>
along with a corresponding color key in the upper left-hand
corner. The generated .kml file will have the same basename
as that of the .ppm file normally generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DETERMINATION OF ANTENNA HEIGHT
ABOVE AVERAGE TERRAIN <br>
SPLAT! determines antenna height above average terrain
(HAAT) according to the procedure defined by Federal
Communications Commission Part 73.313(d). According to this
defini&acirc; <br>
tion, terrain elevations along eight radials between 2 and
10 miles (3 and 16 kilometers) from the site being analyzed
are sampled and averaged for each 45 degrees of azimuth <br>
starting with True North. If one or more radials lie
entirely over water or over land outside the United States
(areas for which no USGS topography data is available), then
those <br>
radials are omitted from the calculation of average
terrain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that SRTM-3 elevation data,
unlike older USGS data, extends beyond the borders of the
United States. Therefore, HAAT results may not be in full
compliance with FCC Part <br>
73.313(d) in areas along the borders of the United States if
the SDF files used by SPLAT! are SRTM-derived.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When performing point-to-point
terrain analysis, SPLAT! determines the antenna height above
average ter- rain only if enough topographic data has
already been loaded by the pro&acirc; <br>
gram to perform the point-to-point analysis. In most cases,
this will be true, unless the site in question does not lie
within 10 miles of the boundary of the topography data in
<br>
memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When performing area prediction
analysis, enough topography data is normally loaded by
SPLAT! to per- form average terrain calculations. Under such
conditions, SPLAT! will pro&acirc; <br>
vide the antenna height above average terrain as well as the
average terrain above mean sea level for azimuths of 0, 45,
90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315 degrees, and include such
<br>
information in the generated site report. If one or more of
the eight radials surveyed fall over water, or over regions
for which no SDF data is available, SPLAT! reports No
Ter&acirc; <br>
rain for the radial paths affected.</p>
