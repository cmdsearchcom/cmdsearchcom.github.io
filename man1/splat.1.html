<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>SPLAT!</b> is a powerful terrestrial RF propagation and terrain analysis tool
  for the spectrum between 20 MHz and 20 GHz. <b>SPLAT!</b> is free software,
  and is designed for operation on Unix and Linux-based work- stations.
  Redistribution and/or modification is permitted under the terms of the GNU
  General Public License, Version 2, as published by the Free Software
  Foundation. Adoption of <b>SPLAT!</b> source code in proprietary or
  closed-source applications is a violation of this license and is strictly
  forbidden.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>SPLAT!</b> is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
  WARRANTY, without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR
  A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INTRODUCTION"><a class="selflink" href="#INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h1>
Applications of <b>SPLAT!</b> include the visualization, design, and link budget
  analysis of wireless Wide Area Networks (WANs), commercial and amateur radio
  communication systems above 20 MHz, microwave links, frequency coordination
  and interference studies, and the prediction of analog and digital terrestrial
  radio and television contour regions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>SPLAT!</b> provides RF site engineering data such as great circle distances
  and bearings between sites, antenna elevation angles (uptilt), depression
  angles (downtilt), antenna height above mean sea level, antenna height above
  average terrain, bearings, distances, and elevations to known obstructions,
  Irregular Terrain Model path attenuation, and received signal strength. In
  addition, the minimum antenna height requirements needed to clear terrain, the
  first Fresnel zone, and any user-definable percentage of the first Fresnel
  zone are also provided.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>SPLAT!</b> produces reports, graphs, and high resolution topographic maps
  that depict line-of-sight paths, and regional path loss and signal strength
  contours through which expected coverage areas of transmitters and repeater
  systems can be obtained. When performing line-of-sight and Irregular Terrain
  Model analyses in situations where multiple transmitter or repeater sites are
  employed, <b>SPLAT!</b> determines individual and mutual areas of coverage
  within the network specified.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INPUT_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#INPUT_FILES">INPUT
  FILES</a></h1>
<b>SPLAT!</b> is a command-line driven application and reads input data through
  a number of data files. Some files are mandatory for successful execution of
  the program, while others are optional. Mandatory files include digital
  elevation topography models in the form of SPLAT Data Files (SDF files), site
  location files (QTH files), and Irregular Terrain Model parameter files (LRP
  files). Optional files include city location files, cartographic boundary
  files, user-defined terrain files, path loss input files, antenna radiation
  pattern files, and color definition files.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SPLAT_DATA_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#SPLAT_DATA_FILES">SPLAT
  DATA FILES</a></h1>
<b>SPLAT!</b> imports topographic data in the form of SPLAT Data Files (SDFs).
  These files may be generated from a number of information sources. In the
  United States, SPLAT Data Files can be generated through U.S. Geological
  Survey Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) using the <b>postdownload</b> and
  <b>usgs2sdf</b> utilities included with <b>SPLAT!</b>. USGS Digital Elevation
  Models compatible with these utilities may be down- loaded from:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">http://edcftp.cr.usgs.gov/pub/data/DEM/250/</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Significantly better resolution and accuracy can be obtained through the use of
  SRTM Version 2 digital elevation models, especially when supplemented by
  USGS-derived SDF data. These one-degree by one- degree models are the product
  of the Space Shuttle STS-99 Radar Topography Mission, and are available for
  most populated regions of the Earth. SPLAT Data Files may be generated from 3
  arc-second SRTM-3 data using the included srtm2sdf utility. SRTM-3 Version 2.1
  data may be obtained through anonymous FTP from:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">http://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/SRTM3/</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that SRTM filenames refer to the latitude and longitude of the southwest
  corner of the topographic dataset contained within the file. Therefore, the
  region of interest must lie north and east of the latitude and longitude
  provided in the SRTM filename. Even greater resolution and accuracy can be
  obtained by using 1 arc-second SRTM-1 Version 2.1 topography data. This data
  is available for the United States and its territories and possessions, and
  may be down- loaded from:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">http://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/SRTM1/</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
High resolution SDF files for use with <b>SPLAT! HD</b> may begenerated from
  data in this format using the <b>srtm2sdf-hd</b> utility. Despite the higher
  accuracy that SRTM data has to offer, some voids in the data sets exist. When
  voids are detected, the <b>srtm2sdf</b> and <b>srtm2sdf-hd</b> utilities
  replace them with corresponding data found in <b>usgs2sdf</b> generated SDF
  files. If USGS-derived SDF data is not available, voids are handled through
  adjacent pixel averaging, or direct replacement.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>SPLAT!</b> Data Files contain integer value topographic elevations in meters
  referenced to mean sea level for 1-degree by 1-degree regions of the Earth.
  SDF files can be read by <b>SPLAT!</b> in either standard format (.sdf) as
  generated directly by the <b>usgs2sdf</b>, <b>srtm2sdf</b>, and
  <b>srtm2sdf-hd</b> utilities, or in bzip2 compressed format (.sdf.bz2). Since
  uncompressed files can be read slightly faster than files that have been
  compressed, <b>SPLAT!</b> searches for needed SDF data in uncompressed format
  first. If uncompressed data cannot be located, <b>SPLAT!</b> then searches for
  data in bzip2 compressed format. If no compressed SDF files can be found for
  the region requested, <b>SPLAT!</b> assumes the region is over water, and will
  assign an elevation of sea-level to these areas.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This feature of <b>SPLAT!</b> makes it possible to perform path analysis not
  only over land, but also between coastal areas not represented by Digital
  Elevation Model data. However, this behavior of <b>SPLAT!</b> underscores the
  importance of having all the SDF files required for the region being analyzed
  if meaningful results are to be expected.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SITE_LOCATION_(QTH)_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#SITE_LOCATION_(QTH)_FILES">SITE
  LOCATION (QTH) FILES</a></h1>
<b>SPLAT!</b> imports site location information of transmitter and receiver
  sites analyzed by the program from ASCII files having a .qth extension. QTH
  files contain the site&#x2019;s name, the site&#x2019;s latitude (positive if
  North of the equator, negative if South), the site&#x2019;s longitude (in
  degrees West, 0 to 360 degrees, or degrees East 0 to -360 degrees), and the
  site&#x2019;s antenna height above ground level (AGL), each separated by a
  single line- feed character. The antenna height is assumed to be specified in
  feet unless followed by the letter m or the word meters in either upper or
  lower case. Latitude and longitude information may be expressed in either
  decimal format (74.6864) or degree, minute, second (DMS) format (74 41 11.0).
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, aread as follows: site locationfile describing television station
  WNJT-DT, Trenton, NJ (wnjt-dt.qth) might read as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">WNJT-DT
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    40.2828
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    74.6864
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    990.00</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each transmitter and receiver site analyzed by <b>SPLAT!</b> must be represented
  by its own site location (QTH) file.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="IRREGULAR_TERRAIN_MODEL_PARAMETER_(LRP)_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#IRREGULAR_TERRAIN_MODEL_PARAMETER_(LRP)_FILES">IRREGULAR
  TERRAIN MODEL PARAMETER (LRP) FILES</a></h1>
Irregular Terrain Model Parameter data files are required for <b>SPLAT!</b> to
  determine RF path loss, field strength, or received signal power level in
  either point-to-point or area prediction mode. Irregular Terrain Model
  parameter data is read from files having the same base name as the transmitter
  site QTH file, but with a .lrp extension. <b>SPLAT!</b> LRP files share the
  following format (wnjt-dt.lrp):
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">15.000 ; Earth Dielectric Constant (Relative permittivity)

</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If an LRP file corresponding to the tx_site QTH file cannot be found,
  <b>SPLAT!</b> scans the current working directory for the file
  &quot;splat.lrp&quot;. If this file cannot be found, then default parameters
  will be assigned by <b>SPLAT!</b> and a corresponding &quot;splat.lrp&quot;
  file containing these default parameters will be written to the cur- rent
  working directory. The generated &quot;splat.lrp&quot; file can then be edited
  by the user as needed. Typical Earth dielectric constants and conductivity
  values are as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">

Radio climate codes used by <b>SPLAT!</b> are as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">1: Equatorial (Congo)
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    2: Continental Subtropical (Sudan)
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    3: Maritime Subtropical (West coast of Africa)
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    4: Desert (Sahara)
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    5: Continental Temperate
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    6: Maritime Temperate, over land (UK and west coasts of US &amp; EU)
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    7: Maritime Temperate, over sea</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Continental Temperate climate is common to large land masses in the
  temperate zone, such as the United States. For paths shorter than 100 km,
  there is little difference between Continental and Maritime Temperate
  climates.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The seventh and eighth parameters in the .lrp file correspond to the statistical
  analysis provided by the ITM model. In this example, <b>SPLAT!</b> will return
  the maximum path loss occurring 50% of the time (fraction of time, or Time
  Variability) in 90% of situations (fraction of situations, or Location
  Variability). This is often denoted as F(50,90) in Longley-Rice studies. In
  the United States, an F(50,90) criteria is typically used for digital
  television (8-level VSB modulation), while F(50,50) is used for analog
  (VSB-AM+NTSC) broadcasts.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For further information on ITM propagation model parameters, please refer to:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>

    http://www.softwright.com/faq/engineering/prop_longley_rice.html</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The last parameter in the .lrp file corresponds to the transmitter&#x2019;s
  Effective Radiated Power (ERP), and is optional. If it is included in the .lrp
  file, then <b>SPLAT!</b> will compute received signal strength levels and
  field strength level contours when performing ITM studies. If the parameter is
  omitted, path loss is com- puted instead. The ERP provided in the .lrp file
  can be overridden by using <b>SPLAT!</b>&#x2019;s -erp command-line switch. If
  the .lrp file contains an ERP parameter and the generation of path loss rather
  than field strength contours is desired, the ERP can be assigned to zero using
  the -erp switch without having to edit the .lrp file to accomplish the same
  result.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CITY_LOCATION_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#CITY_LOCATION_FILES">CITY
  LOCATION FILES</a></h1>
The names and locations of cities, tower sites, or other points of interest may
  be imported and plotted on topographic maps generated by <b>SPLAT!</b>.
  <b>SPLAT!</b> imports the names of cities and locations from ASCII files
  containing the location of interest&#x2019;s name, latitude, and longitude.
  Each field is separated by a comma. Each record is separated by a single line
  feed character. As was the case with the .qth files, latitude and longitude
  information may be entered in either decimal or degree, minute, second (DMS)
  format.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example (cities.dat):

<div class="Pp"></div>
A total of five separate city data files may be imported at a time, and there is
  no limit to the size of these files. <b>SPLAT!</b> reads city data on a
  &quot;first come/first served&quot; basis, and plots only those locations
  whose annotations do not conflict with annotations of locations read earlier
  in the current city data file, or in previ- ous files. This behavior minimizes
  clutter in <b>SPLAT!</b> generated topographic maps, but also mandates that
  important locations be placed toward the beginning of the first city data
  file, and locations less important be positioned further down the list or in
  subsequent data files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
City data files may be generated manually using any text editor, imported from
  other sources, or derived from data available from the U.S. Census Bureau
  using the <b>itydecoder</b> utility included with <b>SPLAT!</b>. Such data is
  available free of charge via the Internet at:
  http://web.archive.org/web/20130331172800/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/bdy_files.html,

Cartographic boundary data may also be imported to plot the boundaries of
  cities, counties, or states on topographic maps generated by <b>SPLAT!</b>.
  Such data must be of the form of ARC/INFO Ungenerate (ASCII Format) Metadata
  Cartographic Boundary Files, and are available from the U.S. Census Bureau via

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PROGRAM_OPERATION"><a class="selflink" href="#PROGRAM_OPERATION">PROGRAM
  OPERATION</a></h1>
<b>SPLAT!</b> is invoked via the command-line using a series of switches and
  arguments. Since <b>SPLAT!</b> is a CPU and memory intensive application, this
  type of interface minimizes overhead and lends itself well to scripted (batch)
  operations. <b>SPLAT!</b>&#x2019;s CPU and memory scheduling priority may be
  modified through the use of the Unix <b>nice</b> command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The number and type of switches passed to <b>SPLAT!</b> determine its mode of
  operation and method of output data generation. Nearly all of
  <b>SPLAT!</b>&#x2019;s switches may be cascaded in any order on the command
  line when invoking the program. Simply typing splat on the command line will
  return a summary of <b>SPLAT!</b>&#x2019;s command line options:

<b>SPLAT!</b> operates in two distinct modes: point-to-point mode, and area
  prediction mode. Either a line-of- sight (LOS) or Irregular Terrain (ITM)
  propagation model may be invoked by the user. True Earth, fourthirds Earth, or
  any other user-defined Earth radius may be specified when performing
  line-of-sight analysis.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="POINT-TO-POINT_ANALYSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#POINT-TO-POINT_ANALYSIS">POINT-TO-POINT
  ANALYSIS</a></h1>
<b>SPLAT!</b> may be used to perform line-of-sight terrain analysis between two
  specified site locations. For example:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t tx_site.qth -r rx_site.qth</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
invokes a line-of-sight terrain analysis between the transmitter specified in
  tx_site.qth and receiver specified in rx_site.qth using a True Earth radius
  model, and writes a <b>SPLAT!</b> Path Analysis Report to the current working
  directory. The report contains details of the transmitter and receiver sites,
  and identifies the loca- tion of any obstructions detected along the
  line-of-sight path. If an obstruction can be cleared by raising the receive
  antenna to a greater altitude, <b>SPLAT!</b> will indicate the minimum antenna
  height required for a line- of-sight path to exist between the transmitter and
  receiver locations specified. Note that imperial units (miles, feet) are
  specified unless the -metric switch is added to <b>SPLAT!</b>&#x2019;s command
  line options:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t tx_site.qth -r rx_site.qth -metric</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the antenna must be raised a significant amount, this determination may take
  a few moments. Note that the results provided are the minimum necessary for a
  line-of-sight path to exist, and in the case of this sim- ple example, do not
  take Fresnel zone clearance requirements into consideration. qth extensions
  are assumed by <b>SPLAT!</b> for QTH files, and are optional when specifying
  -t and -r arguments on the command-line. <b>SPLAT!</b> automatically reads all
  SPLAT Data Files necessary to conduct the terrain analysis between the sites
  specified. <b>SPLAT!</b> searches for the required SDF files in the current
  working directory first. If the needed files are not found, <b>SPLAT!</b> then
  searches in the path specified by the -d com- mand-line switch:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -d /cdrom/sdf/</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
An external directory path may be specified by placing a &quot;.splat_path&quot;
  file under the user&#x2019;s home directory. This file must contain the full
  directory path of last resort to all the SDF files. The path in the
  $HOME/.splat_path file must be of the form of a single line of ASCII text:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>/opt/splat/sdf/</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and can be generated using any text editor.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A graph of the terrain profile between the receiver and transmitter locations as
  a function of distance from the receiver can be generated by adding the -p
  switch:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -p
    terrain_profile.png</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>SPLAT!</b> invokes <b>gnuplot</b> when generating graphs. The filename
  extension specified to <b>SPLAT!</b> deter- mines the format of the graph
  produced. .png will produce a 640x480 color PNG graphic file, while <i>.ps</i>
  or <i>.postscript</i> will produce postscript output. Output in formats such
  as GIF, Adobe Illustrator, AutoCAD dxf, LaTeX, and many others are available.
  Please consult <b>gnuplot</b>, and <b>gnuplot</b>&#x2019;s documentation for
  details on all the supported output formats.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A graph of elevations subtended by the terrain between the receiver and
  transmitter as a function of distance from the receiver can be generated by
  using the -e switch:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -e
    elevation_profile.png</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The graph produced using this switch illustrates the elevation and depression
  angles resulting from the terrain between the receiver&#x2019;s location and
  the transmitter site from the perspective of the receiver&#x2019;s location. A
  second trace is plotted between the left side of the graph (receiver&#x2019;s
  location) and the location of the transmitting antenna on the right. This
  trace illustrates the elevation angle required for a line-of-sight path to
  exist between the receiver and transmitter locations. If the trace intersects
  the elevation profile at any point on the graph, then this is an indication
  that a line-of-sight path does not exist under the conditions given, and the
  obstructions can be clearly identified on the graph at the point(s) of
  intersection.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A graph illustrating terrain height referenced to a line-of-sight path between
  the transmitter and receiver may be generated using the -h switch:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -h
    height_profile.png</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A terrain height plot normalized to the transmitter and receiver antenna heights
  can be obtained using the -H switch:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -H
      normalized_height_profile.png</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A contour of the Earth&#x2019;s curvature is also plotted in this mode. The
  first Fresnel Zone, and 60% of the first Fresnel Zone can be added to height
  profile graphs by adding the -f switch, and specifying a frequency (in MHz) at
  which the Fresnel Zone should be modeled:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -f 439.250 -H
      normalized_height_profile.png</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Fresnel Zone clearances other 60% can be specified using the -fz switch as
  follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -f 439.250 -fz 75 -H
      height_profile2.png</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A graph showing ITM path loss may be plotted using the -l switch:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -l
    path_loss_profile.png</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As before, adding the -metric switch forces the graphs to be plotted using
  metric units of measure. The -gpsav switch instructs <b>SPLAT!</b> to preserve
  (rather than delete) the <b>gnuplot</b> working files generated during
  <b>SPLAT!</b> execution, allowing the user to edit these files and re-run
  <b>gnuplot</b> if desired.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When performing a point-to-point analysis, a <b>SPLAT!</b> Path Analysis Report
  is generated in the form of a text file with a .txt filename extension. The
  report contains bearings and distances between the transmitter and receiver,
  as well as the free-space and ITM path loss for the path being analyzed. The
  mode of propagation for the path is given as Line-of-Sight, Single Horizon,
  Double Horizon, Diffraction Dominant, or Tr oposcatter Dominant. Additionally,
  if the receiver is located at the peak of a single obstruction or at the peak
  of a second obstruction, <b>SPLAT!</b> will report RX at Peak Terrain Along
  Path when operating under the ITWOM propagation model.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Distances and locations to known obstructions along the path between transmitter
  and receiver are also pro- vided. If the transmitter&#x2019;s effective
  radiated power is specified in the transmitter&#x2019;s corresponding .lrp
  file, then predicted signal strength and antenna voltage at the receiving
  location is also provided in the Path Analysis Report.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To determine the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio at remote location where random
  Johnson (thermal) noise is the primary limiting factor in reception:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>SNR = T &#x2212; NJ &#x2212; L + G &#x2212; NF</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where T is the ERP of the transmitter in dBW in the direction of the receiver,
  NJ is Johnson Noise in dBW (-136 dBW for a 6 MHz television channel), L is the
  path loss provided by <b>SPLAT!</b> in dB (as a positive number), G is the
  receive antenna gain in dB over isotropic, and NF is the receiver noise figure
  in dB. ,T may be computed as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>T = TI + GT</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where TI is actual amount of RF power delivered to the transmitting antenna in
  dBW, GT is the transmit- ting antenna gain (over isotropic) in the direction
  of the receiver (or the horizon if the receiver is over the horizon).
<div class="Pp"></div>
To compute how much more signal is available over the minimum to necessary to
  achieve a specific signal-to-noise ratio:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>Signal_Margin = SNR &#x2212; S</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where S is the minimum required SNR ratio (15.5 dB for ATSC (8-level VSB) DTV,
  42 dB for analog NTSC television).
<div class="Pp"></div>
A topographic map may be generated by <b>SPLAT!</b> to visualize the path
  between the transmitter and receiver sites from yet another perspective.
  Topographic maps generated by <b>SPLAT!</b> display elevations using a log-
  arithmic grayscale, with higher elevations represented through brighter shades
  of gray. The dynamic range of the image is scaled between the highest and
  lowest elevations present in the map. The only exception to this is sea-level,
  which is represented using the color blue.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Topographic output is invoked using the -o switch:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -o topo_map.ppm</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The .ppm extension on the output filename is assumed by <b>SPLAT!</b>, and is
  optional. In this example, <i>topo_map.ppm</i> will illustrate the locations
  of the transmitter and receiver sites specified. In addition, the great circle
  path between the two sites will be drawn over locations for which an
  unobstructed path exists to the transmitter at a receiving antenna height
  equal to that of the receiver site (specified in <i>rx_site.qth</i>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
It may desirable to populate the topographic map with names and locations of
  cities, tower sites, or other important locations. A city file may be passed
  to <b>SPLAT!</b> using the -s switch:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -s cities.dat -o
      topo_map</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Up to five separate city files may be passed to <b>SPLAT!</b> at a time
  following the -s switch. County and state boundaries may be added to the map
  by specifying up to five U.S. Census Bureau cartographic boundary files using
  the -b switch:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -b co34_d00.dat -o
      topo_map</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In situations where multiple transmitter sites are in use, as many as four site
  locations may be passed to <b>SPLAT!</b> at a time for analysis:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t tx_site1 tx_site2 tx_site3 tx_site4 -r rx_site
      -p profile.png</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In this example, four separate terrain profiles and obstruction reports will be
  generated by <b>SPLAT!</b>. A sin- gle topographic map can be specified using
  the -o switch, and line-of-sight paths between each transmitter and the
  receiver site indicated will be produced on the map, each in its own color.
  The path between the first transmitter specified to the receiver will be in
  green, the path between the second transmitter and the receiver will be in
  cyan, the path between the third transmitter and the receiver will be in
  violet, and the path between the fourth transmitter and the receiver will be
  in sienna.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>SPLAT!</b> generated topographic maps are 24-bit TrueColor Portable PixMap
  (PPM) images. They may be viewed, edited, or converted to other graphic
  formats by popular image viewing applications such as xv, The GIMP,
  ImageMagick, and XPaint. PNG format is highly recommended for lossless
  compressed storage of <b>SPLAT!</b> generated topographic output files.
  ImageMagick&#x2019;s command-line utility easily con- verts
  <b>SPLAT!</b>&#x2019;s PPM files to PNG format:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>convert splat_map.ppm splat_map.png</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another excellent PPM to PNG command-line utility is available at:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/book/sources.html</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a last resort, PPM files may be compressed using the bzip2 utility, and read
  directly by The GIMP in this format. The -ngs option assigns all terrain to
  the color white, and can be used when it is desirable to generate a map that
  is devoid of terrain:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -b co34_d00.dat -ngs -o
      white_map</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The resulting .ppm image file can be converted to .png format with a transparent
  background using ImageMagick&#x2019;s convert utility:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>convert -transparent #FFFFFF white_map.ppm
      transparent_map.png</b></dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="REGIONAL_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#REGIONAL_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS">REGIONAL
  COVERAGE ANALYSIS</a></h1>
<b>SPLAT!</b> can analyze a transmitter or repeater site, or network of sites,
  and predict the regional coverage for each site specified. In this mode,
  <b>SPLAT!</b> can generate a topographic map displaying the geometric line-
  of-sight coverage area of the sites based on the location of each site and the
  height of receive antenna wish- ing to communicate with the site in question.
  A regional analysis may be performed by <b>SPLAT!</b> using the -c switch as
  follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t tx_site -c 30.0 -s cities.dat -b co34_d00.dat
      -o tx_coverage</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In this example, <b>SPLAT!</b> generates a topographic map called
  tx_coverage.ppm that illustrates the predicted line-of-sight regional coverage
  of tx_site to receiving locations having antennas 30.0 feet above ground level
  (AGL). If the -metric switch is used, the argument following the -c switch is
  interpreted as being in meters rather than in feet. The contents of cities.dat
  are plotted on the map, as are the cartographic bound- aries contained in the
  file co34_d00.dat.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When plotting line-of-sight paths and areas of regional coverage, <b>SPLAT!</b>
  by default does not account for the effects of atmospheric bending. However,
  this behavior may be modified by using the Earth radius mul- tiplier (-m)
  switch:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t wnjt-dt -c 30.0 -m 1.333 -s cities.dat -b
      counties.dat -o map.ppm</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
An earth radius multiplier of 1.333 instructs <b>SPLAT!</b> to use the
  &quot;four-thirds earth&quot; model for line-of-sight propagation analysis.
  Any appropriate earth radius multiplier may be selected by the user. When
  performing a regional analysis, <b>SPLAT!</b> generates a site report for each
  station analyzed. <b>SPLAT!</b> site reports contain details of the
  site&#x2019;s geographic location, its height above mean sea level, the
  antenna&#x2019;s height above mean sea level, the antenna&#x2019;s height
  above average terrain, and the height of the average ter- rain calculated
  toward the bearings of 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315 degrees azimuth.

  MULTIPLE REGIONS OF LOS COVERAGE</a></h1>
<b>SPLAT!</b> can also display line-of-sight coverage areas for as many as four
  separate transmitter sites on a common topographic map. For example:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t site1 site2 site3 site4 -c 10.0 -metric -o
      network.ppm</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
plots the regional line-of-sight coverage of site1, site2, site3, and site4
  based on a receive antenna located 10.0 meters above ground level. A
  topographic map is then written to the file network.ppm. The line-of-sight
  coverage area of the transmitters are plotted as follows in the colors
  indicated (along with their corre- sponding RGB values in decimal):
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">site1: Green (0,255,0)

</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If separate .qth files are generated, each representing a common site location
  but a different antenna height, a single topographic map illustrating the
  regional coverage from as many as four separate locations on a single tower
  may be generated by <b>SPLAT!</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PATH_LOSS_ANALYSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#PATH_LOSS_ANALYSIS">PATH
  LOSS ANALYSIS</a></h1>
If the -c switch is replaced by a -L switch, an ITM path loss map for a
  transmitter site may be generated: splat -t wnjt -L 30.0 -s cities.dat -b
  co34_d00.dat -o path_loss_map In this mode, <b>SPLAT!</b> generates a
  multi-color map illustrating expected signal levels in areas surrounding the
  transmitter site. A legend at the bottom of the map correlates each color with
  a specific path loss range in decibels.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The -db switch allows a threshold to be set beyond which contours will not be
  plotted on the map. For example, if a path loss beyond -140 dB is irrelevant
  to the survey being conducted, <b>SPLAT!</b>&#x2019;s path loss plot can be
  constrained to the region bounded by the 140 dB attenuation contour as
  follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t wnjt-dt -L 30.0 -s cities.dat -b co34_d00.dat
      -db 140 -o plot.ppm</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The path loss contour threshold may be expressed as either a positive or
  negative quantity.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The path loss analysis range may be modified to a user-specific distance using
  the -R switch. The argument must be given in miles (or kilometers if the
  -metric switch is used). If a range wider than the generated topographic map
  is specified, <b>SPLAT!</b> will perform ITM path loss calculations between
  all four corners of the area prediction map.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The colors used to illustrate contour regions in <b>SPLAT!</b> generated
  coverage maps may be tailored by the user by creating or modifying
  <b>SPLAT!</b>&#x2019;s color definition files. <b>SPLAT!</b> color definition
  files have the same base name as the transmitter&#x2019;s .qth file, but carry
  .lcf, .scf, and .dcf extensions. If the necessary file does not exist in the
  current working when <b>SPLAT!</b> is run, a file containing default color
  definition parameters that is suitable for manual editing by the user is
  written into the current directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a regional ITM analysis is performed and the transmitter&#x2019;s ERP is
  not specified or is zero, a .lcf path loss color definition file corresponding
  to the transmitter site (.qth) is read by <b>SPLAT!</b> from the current
  working directory. If a .lcf file corresponding to the transmitter site is not
  found, then a default file suitable for manual editing by the user is
  automatically generated by <b>SPLAT!</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A path loss color definition file possesses the following structure

If the path loss is less than 80 dB, the color Red (RGB = 255, 0, 0) is assigned
  to the region. If the path loss is greater than or equal to 80 dB, but less
  than 90 db, then Dark Orange (255, 128, 0) is assigned to the region. Orange
  (255, 165, 0) is assigned to regions having a path loss greater than or equal
  to 90 dB, but less than 100 dB, and so on. Greyscale terrain is displayed
  beyond the 230 dB path loss contour. Adding the -sc switch will smooth the

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ANTENNA_RADIATION_PATTERN_PARAMETERS"><a class="selflink" href="#ANTENNA_RADIATION_PATTERN_PARAMETERS">ANTENNA
  RADIATION PATTERN PARAMETERS</a></h1>
Normalized field voltage patterns for a transmitting antenna&#x2019;s horizontal
  and vertical planes are imported automatically into <b>SPLAT!</b> when a path
  loss, field strength, or received power level coverage analysis is performed.
  Antenna pattern data is read from a pair of files having the same base name as
  the transmitter and LRP files, but with .az and .el extensions for azimuth and
  elevation pattern files, respectively. Specifi- cations regarding pattern
  rotation (if any) and mechanical beam tilt and tilt direction (if any) are
  also con- tained within <b>SPLAT!</b> antenna pattern files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, the first few lines of a <b>SPLAT!</b> azimuth pattern file might
  appear as follows (kvea.az):
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">183.0
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>

    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    8 0.9060051</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first line of the .az file specifies the amount of azimuthal pattern
  rotation (measured clockwise in degrees from True North) to be applied by
  <b>SPLAT!</b> to the data contained in the .az file. This is followed by
  azimuth headings (0 to 360 degrees) and their associated normalized field
  patterns (0.000 to 1.000) sepa- rated by whitespace.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The structure of <b>SPLAT!</b> elevation pattern files is slightly different.
  The first line of the .el file specifies the amount of mechanical beam tilt
  applied to the antenna. Note that a downward tilt (below the horizon) is
  expressed as a positive angle, while an upward tilt (above the horizon) is
  expressed as a negative angle. This data is followed by the azimuthal
  direction of the tilt, separated by whitespace.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The remainder of the file consists of elevation angles and their corresponding
  normalized voltage radiation pattern (0.000 to 1.000) values separated by
  whitespace. Elevation angles must be specified over a -10.0 to +90.0 degree
  range. As was the convention with mechanical beamtilt, negative elevation
  angles are used to represent elevations above the horizon, while positive
  angles represents elevations below the horizon. For example, the first few
  lines a <b>SPLAT!</b> elevation pattern file might appear as follows
  (kvea.el):
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>

<div class="Pp"></div>
In this example, the antenna is mechanically tilted downward 1.1 degrees towards
  an azimuth of 130.0 degrees.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For best results, the resolution of azimuth pattern data should be specified to
  the nearest degree azimuth, and elevation pattern data resolution should be
  specified to the nearest 0.01 degrees. If the pattern data specified does not
  reach this level of resolution, <b>SPLAT!</b> will interpolate the values
  provided to determine the data at the required resolution, although this may
  result in a loss in accuracy.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXPORTING_AND_IMPORTING_REGIONAL_CONTOUR_DAT_A"><a class="selflink" href="#EXPORTING_AND_IMPORTING_REGIONAL_CONTOUR_DAT_A">EXPORTING
  AND IMPORTING REGIONAL CONTOUR DAT A</a></h1>
Performing a regional coverage analysis based on an ITM path analysis can be a
  very time consuming process, especially if the analysis is performed
  repeatedly to discover what effects changes to a transmit- ter&#x2019;s
  antenna radiation pattern make to the predicted coverage area.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This process can be expedited by exporting the contour data produced by
  <b>SPLAT!</b> to an alphanumeric out- put (.ano) file. The data contained in
  this file can then be modified to incorporate antenna pattern effects, and
  imported back into <b>SPLAT!</b> to quickly produce a revised contour map.
  Depending on the way in which <b>SPLAT!</b> is invoked, alphanumeric output
  files can describe regional path loss, signal strength, or received signal
  power levels.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, an alphanumeric output file containing path loss information can be
  generated by <b>SPLAT!</b> for a receive site 30 feet above ground level over
  a 50 mile radius surrounding a transmitter site to a maximum path loss of 140
  dB (assuming ERP is not specified in the transmitter&#x2019;s .lrp file) using
  the following syntax:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t kvea -L 30.0 -R 50.0 -db 140 -ano
      pathloss.dat</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If ERP is specified in the .lrp file or on the command line through the -erp
  switch, the alphanumeric output file will instead contain predicted field
  values in dBuV/m. If the -dBm command line switch is used, then the
  alphanumeric output file will contain receive signal power levels in dBm.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>SPLAT!</b> alphanumeric output files can exceed many hundreds of megabytes in
  size. They contain informa- tion relating to the boundaries of the region they
  describe followed by latitudes (degrees North), longitudes (degrees West),
  azimuths (referenced to True North), elevations (to the first obstruction),
  followed by either path loss (in dB), received field strength (in dBuV/m), or
  received signal power level (in dBm) without regard to the transmitting
  antenna&#x2019;s radiation pattern.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first few lines of a <b>SPLAT!</b> alphanumeric output file could take on
  the following appearance ( <i>pathloss.dat</i>):

Comments can be placed in the file if they are preceeded by a semicolon. The
  <b>vim</b> text editor has proven capable of editing files of this size.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note as was the case in the antenna pattern files, negative elevation angles
  refer to upward tilt (above the horizon), while positive angles refer to
  downward tilt (below the horizon). These angles refer to the eleva- tion to
  the receiving antenna at the height above ground level specified using the -L
  switch if the path between transmitter and receiver is unobstructed. If the
  path between the transmitter and receiver is obstructed, an asterisk (*) is
  placed on the end of the line, and the elevation angle returned by
  <b>SPLAT!</b> refers the elevation angle to the first obstruction rather than
  the geographic location specified on the line. This is done in response to the
  fact that the ITM model considers the energy reaching a distant point over an
  obstructed path to be the result of the energy scattered over the top of the
  first obstruction along the path. Since energy cannot reach the obstructed
  location directly, the actual elevation angle to the destination over such a
  path becomes irrelevant.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When modifying <b>SPLAT!</b> path loss files to reflect antenna pattern data,
  only the last numeric column should be amended to reflect the antenna&#x2019;s
  normalized gain at the azimuth and elevation angles specified in the file.
  Programs and scripts capable of performing this task are left as an exercise
  for the user. Modified alphanumeric output files can be imported back into
  <b>SPLAT!</b> for generating revised coverage maps provided that the ERP and
  -dBm options are used as they were when the alphanumeric output file was
  originally generated:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t kvea -ani pathloss.dat -s city.dat -b
      county.dat -o map.ppm</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that alphanumeric output files generated by splat cannot be used with
  splat-hd, or vice-versa due to the resolution incompatibility between the two
  versions of the program. Also, each of the three types of alphanumeric output
  files are incompatible with one another, so a file containing path loss data
  cannot be imported into <b>SPLAT!</b> to produce signal strength or received
  power level contours, etc.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USER-DEFINED_TERRAIN_INPUT_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#USER-DEFINED_TERRAIN_INPUT_FILES">USER-DEFINED
  TERRAIN INPUT FILES</a></h1>
A user-defined terrain file is a user-generated text file containing latitudes,
  longitudes, and heights above ground level of specific terrain features
  believed to be of importance to the <b>SPLAT!</b> analysis being con- ducted,
  but noticeably absent from the SDF files being used. A user-defined terrain
  file is imported into a <b>SPLAT!</b> analysis using the -udt switch:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -udt udt_file.txt -o
      map.ppm</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A user-defined terrain file has the following appearance and structure:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <br/>
     40.32180556, 74.1325, 100.0 meters
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     40.321805, 74.1315, 300.0
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     40.3218055, 74.1305, 100.0 meters</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Terrain height is interpreted as being described in feet above ground level
  unless followed by the word meters, and is added on top of the terrain
  specified in the SDF data for the locations specified. Be aware that each
  user-defined terrain feature specified will be interpreted as being 3-arc
  seconds in both latitude and longitude in splat and 1 arc-second in latitude
  and longitude in splat-hd. Features described in the user-defined terrain file
  that overlap previously defined features in the file are ignored by
  <b>SPLAT!</b> to avoid ambiguity.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GROUND_CLUTTER"><a class="selflink" href="#GROUND_CLUTTER">GROUND
  CLUTTER</a></h1>
The height of ground clutter can be specified using the -gc switch:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t wnjt-dt -r kd2bd -gc 30.0 -H
      wnjt-dt_path.png</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The -gc switch as the effect of raising the overall terrain by the specified
  amount in feet (or meters if the -metric switch is invoked), except over areas
  at sea-level and at the transmitting and receiving antenna loca- tions.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SIMPLE_TOPOGRAPHIC_MAP_GENERATION"><a class="selflink" href="#SIMPLE_TOPOGRAPHIC_MAP_GENERATION">SIMPLE
  TOPOGRAPHIC MAP GENERATION</a></h1>
In certain situations it may be desirable to generate a topographic map of a
  region without plotting coverage areas, line-of-sight paths, or generating
  obstruction reports. There are several ways of doing this. If one wishes to
  generate a topographic map illustrating the location of a transmitter and
  receiver site along with a brief text report describing the locations and
  distances between the sites, the -n switch should be invoked as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -n -o topo_map.ppm</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If no text report is desired, then the -N switch is used:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -N -o topo_map.ppm</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a topographic map centered about a single site out to a minimum specified
  radius is desired instead, a command similar to the following can be used:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t tx_site -R 50.0 -s NJ_Cities -b NJ_Counties -o
      topo_map.ppm</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where -R specifies the minimum radius of the map in miles (or kilometers if the
  -metric switch is used). Note that the tx_site name and location are not
  displayed in this example. If display of this information is desired, simply
  create a <b>SPLAT!</b> city file (-s option) and append it to the list of
  command-line options illustrated above.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the -o switch and output filename are omitted in these operations,
  topographic output is written to a file named tx_site.ppm in the current
  working directory by default.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GEOREFERENCE_FILE_GENERATION"><a class="selflink" href="#GEOREFERENCE_FILE_GENERATION">GEOREFERENCE
  FILE GENERATION</a></h1>
Topographic, coverage (-c), and path loss contour (-L) maps generated by
  <b>SPLAT!</b> may be imported into Xastir (X Amateur Station Tracking and
  Information Reporting) software by generating a georeference file using
  <b>SPLAT!</b>&#x2019;s -geo switch:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t kd2bd -R 50.0 -s NJ_Cities -b NJ_Counties -geo
      -o map.ppm</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The georeference file generated will have the same base name as the -o file
  specified, but have a .geo extension, and permit proper interpretation and
  display of <b>SPLAT!</b>&#x2019;s .ppm graphics in Xastir software.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GOOGLE_MAP_KML_FILE_GENERATION"><a class="selflink" href="#GOOGLE_MAP_KML_FILE_GENERATION">GOOGLE
  MAP KML FILE GENERATION</a></h1>
Keyhole Markup Language files compatible with Google Earth may be generated by
  <b>SPLAT!</b> when per- forming point-to-point or regional coverage analyses
  by invoking the -kml switch:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>splat -t wnjt-dt -r kd2bd -kml</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The KML file generated will have the same filename structure as a Path Analysis
  Report for the transmitter and receiver site names given, except it will carry
  a .kml extension.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once loaded into Google Earth (File --&gt; Open), the KML file will annotate the
  map display with the names of the transmitter and receiver site locations. The
  viewpoint of the image will be from the position of the transmitter site
  looking towards the location of the receiver. The point-to-point path between
  the sites will be displayed as a white line while the RF line-of-sight path
  will be displayed in green. Google Earth&#x2019;s navigation tools allow the
  user to &quot;fly&quot; around the path, identify landmarks, roads, and other
  fea- tured content.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When performing regional coverage analysis, the .kml file generated by
  <b>SPLAT!</b> will permit path loss or signal strength contours to be layered
  on top of Google Earth&#x2019;s display along with a corresponding color key
  in the upper left-hand corner. The generated .kml file will have the same
  basename as that of the .ppm file normally generated.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DETERMINATION_OF_ANTENNA_HEIGHT_ABOVE_AVERAGE_TERRAIN"><a class="selflink" href="#DETERMINATION_OF_ANTENNA_HEIGHT_ABOVE_AVERAGE_TERRAIN">DETERMINATION
  OF ANTENNA HEIGHT ABOVE AVERAGE TERRAIN</a></h1>
<b>SPLAT!</b> determines antenna height above average terrain (HAAT) according
  to the procedure defined by Federal Communications Commission Part 73.313(d).
  According to this definition, terrain elevations along eight radials between 2
  and 10 miles (3 and 16 kilometers) from the site being analyzed are sampled
  and averaged for each 45 degrees of azimuth starting with True North. If one
  or more radials lie entirely over water or over land outside the United States
  (areas for which no USGS topography data is available), then those radials are
  omitted from the calculation of average terrain.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that SRTM-3 elevation data, unlike older USGS data, extends beyond the
  borders of the United States. Therefore, HAAT results may not be in full
  compliance with FCC Part 73.313(d) in areas along the borders of the United
  States if the SDF files used by <b>SPLAT!</b> are SRTM-derived.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When performing point-to-point terrain analysis, <b>SPLAT!</b> determines the
  antenna height above average ter- rain only if enough topographic data has
  already been loaded by the program to perform the point-to-point analysis. In
  most cases, this will be true, unless the site in question does not lie within
  10 miles of the boundary of the topography data in memory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When performing area prediction analysis, enough topography data is normally
  loaded by <b>SPLAT!</b> to per- form average terrain calculations. Under such
  conditions, <b>SPLAT!</b> will provide the antenna height above average
  terrain as well as the average terrain above mean sea level for azimuths of 0,
  45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315 degrees, and include such information in
  the generated site report. If one or more of the eight radials surveyed fall
  over water, or over regions for which no SDF data is available, <b>SPLAT!</b>
  reports No Terrain for the radial paths affected.
