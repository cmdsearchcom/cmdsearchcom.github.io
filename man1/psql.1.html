psql - PostgreSQL interactive terminal
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<div class="Pp" style="margin-left: 5.00ex; text-indent: -5.00ex;"><b>psql</b>
  [<i>option</i>...] [<i>dbname</i>&#x00A0;[<i>username</i>]]</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
psql is a terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL. It enables you to type in
  queries interactively, issue them to PostgreSQL, and see the query results.
  Alternatively, input can be from a file. In addition, it provides a number of
  meta-commands and various shell-like features to facilitate writing scripts
  and automating a wide variety of tasks.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<b>-a</b>, <b>--echo-all</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Print all nonempty input lines to standard
  output as they are read. (This does not apply to lines read interactively.)
  This is equivalent to setting the variable <i>ECHO</i> to all.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-A</b>, <b>--no-align</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Switches to unaligned output mode. (The
  default output mode is otherwise aligned.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-c </b><b></b><i>command</i>, <b>--command=</b><b></b><i>command</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies that psql is to execute one command
  string, <i>command</i>, and then exit. This is useful in shell scripts.
  Start-up files (psqlrc and ~/.psqlrc) are ignored with this option.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<i>command</i> must be either a command string that is completely parsable by
  the server (i.e., it contains no psql-specific features), or a single
  backslash command. Thus you cannot mix SQL and psql meta-commands with this
  option. To achieve that, you could pipe the string into psql, for example:
  echo '\x \\ SELECT * FROM foo;' | psql. (\\ is the separator meta-command.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the command string contains multiple SQL commands, they are processed in a
  single transaction, unless there are explicit <b>BEGIN</b>/<b>COMMIT</b>
  commands included in the string to divide it into multiple transactions. This
  is different from the behavior when the same string is fed to psql's standard
  input. Also, only the result of the last SQL command is returned.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Because of these legacy behaviors, putting more than one command in the
  <b>-c</b> string often has unexpected results. It's better to feed multiple
  commands to psql's standard input, either using echo as illustrated above, or
  via a shell here-document, for example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
psql &lt;&lt;EOF
\x
SELECT * FROM foo;
EOF
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-d </b><b></b><i>dbname</i>, <b>--dbname=</b><b></b><i>dbname</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies the name of the database to connect
  to. This is equivalent to specifying <i>dbname</i> as the first non-option
  argument on the command line.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If this parameter contains an = sign or starts with a valid URI prefix
  (postgresql:// or postgres://), it is treated as a <i>conninfo</i> string. See
  Section 31.1, &#x201C;Database Connection Control Functions&#x201D;, in the
  documentation for more information.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-e</b>, <b>--echo-queries</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Copy all SQL commands sent to the server to
  standard output as well. This is equivalent to setting the variable
  <i>ECHO</i> to queries.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-E</b>, <b>--echo-hidden</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Echo the actual queries generated by <b>\d</b>
  and other backslash commands. You can use this to study psql's internal
  operations. This is equivalent to setting the variable <i>ECHO_HIDDEN</i> to
  on.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-f </b><b></b><i>filename</i>, <b>--file=</b><b></b><i>filename</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Use the file <i>filename</i> as the source of
  commands instead of reading commands interactively. After the file is
  processed, psql terminates. This is in many ways equivalent to the
  meta-command <b>\i</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If <i>filename</i> is - (hyphen), then standard input is read until an EOF
  indication or <b>\q</b> meta-command. Note however that Readline is not used
  in this case (much as if <b>-n</b> had been specified).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Using this option is subtly different from writing psql &lt; <i>filename</i>. In
  general, both will do what you expect, but using -f enables some nice features
  such as error messages with line numbers. There is also a slight chance that
  using this option will reduce the start-up overhead. On the other hand, the
  variant using the shell's input redirection is (in theory) guaranteed to yield
  exactly the same output you would have received had you entered everything by
  hand.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-F </b><b></b><i>separator</i>,
  <b>--field-separator=</b><b></b><i>separator</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Use <i>separator</i> as the field separator
  for unaligned output. This is equivalent to <b>\pset fieldsep</b> or
  <b>\f</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-h </b><b></b><i>hostname</i>, <b>--host=</b><b></b><i>hostname</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies the host name of the machine on
  which the server is running. If the value begins with a slash, it is used as
  the directory for the Unix-domain socket.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-H</b>, <b>--html</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Turn on HTML tabular output. This is
  equivalent to \pset format html or the <b>\H</b> command.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">List all available databases, then exit. Other
  non-connection options are ignored. This is similar to the meta-command
  <b>\list</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-L </b><b></b><i>filename</i>, <b>--log-file=</b><b></b><i>filename</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Write all query output into file
  <i>filename</i>, in addition to the normal output destination.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-n</b>, <b>--no-readline</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Do not use Readline for line editing and do
  not use the command history. This can be useful to turn off tab expansion when
  cutting and pasting.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-o </b><b></b><i>filename</i>, <b>--output=</b><b></b><i>filename</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Put all query output into file
  <i>filename</i>. This is equivalent to the command <b>\o</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-p </b><b></b><i>port</i>, <b>--port=</b><b></b><i>port</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies the TCP port or the local
  Unix-domain socket file extension on which the server is listening for
  connections. Defaults to the value of the <b>PGPORT</b> environment variable
  or, if not set, to the port specified at compile time, usually 5432.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-P </b><b></b><i>assignment</i>, <b>--pset=</b><b></b><i>assignment</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies printing options, in the style of
  <b>\pset</b>. Note that here you have to separate name and value with an equal
  sign instead of a space. For example, to set the output format to LaTeX, you
  could write -P format=latex.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies that psql should do its work
  quietly. By default, it prints welcome messages and various informational
  output. If this option is used, none of this happens. This is useful with the
  <b>-c</b> option. This is equivalent to setting the variable <i>QUIET</i> to
  on.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-R </b><b></b><i>separator</i>,
  <b>--record-separator=</b><b></b><i>separator</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Use <i>separator</i> as the record separator
  for unaligned output. This is equivalent to the <b>\pset recordsep</b>
  command.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-s</b>, <b>--single-step</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Run in single-step mode. That means the user
  is prompted before each command is sent to the server, with the option to
  cancel execution as well. Use this to debug scripts.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-S</b>, <b>--single-line</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Runs in single-line mode where a newline
  terminates an SQL command, as a semicolon does.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Note</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
This mode is provided for those who insist on it, but you are not necessarily
  encouraged to use it. In particular, if you mix SQL and meta-commands on a
  line the order of execution might not always be clear to the inexperienced
  user.
<div style="height: 0.50em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-t</b>, <b>--tuples-only</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Turn off printing of column names and result
  row count footers, etc. This is equivalent to the <b>\t</b> command.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-T </b><b></b><i>table_options</i>,
  <b>--table-attr=</b><b></b><i>table_options</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies options to be placed within the
  HTMLtable tag. See <b>\pset</b> for details.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-U </b><b></b><i>username</i>, <b>--username=</b><b></b><i>username</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Connect to the database as the user
  <i>username</i> instead of the default. (You must have permission to do so, of
  course.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-v </b><b></b><i>assignment</i>, <b>--set=</b><b></b><i>assignment</i>,
  <b>--variable=</b> <b></b><i>assignment</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Perform a variable assignment, like the
  <b>\set</b> meta-command. Note that you must separate name and value, if any,
  by an equal sign on the command line. To unset a variable, leave off the equal
  sign. To set a variable with an empty value, use the equal sign but leave off
  the value. These assignments are done during a very early stage of start-up,
  so variables reserved for internal purposes might get overwritten later.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Print the psql version and exit.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-w</b>, <b>--no-password</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Never issue a password prompt. If the server
  requires password authentication and a password is not available by other
  means such as a .pgpass file, the connection attempt will fail. This option
  can be useful in batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a
  password.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that this option will remain set for the entire session, and so it affects
  uses of the meta-command <b>\connect</b> as well as the initial connection
  attempt.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-W</b>, <b>--password</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Force psql to prompt for a password before
  connecting to a database.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This option is never essential, since psql will automatically prompt for a
  password if the server demands password authentication. However, psql will
  waste a connection attempt finding out that the server wants a password. In
  some cases it is worth typing <b>-W</b> to avoid the extra connection attempt.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that this option will remain set for the entire session, and so it affects
  uses of the meta-command <b>\connect</b> as well as the initial connection
  attempt.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-x</b>, <b>--expanded</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Turn on the expanded table formatting mode.
  This is equivalent to the <b>\x</b> command.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-X,</b>, <b>--no-psqlrc</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Do not read the start-up file (neither the
  system-wide psqlrc file nor the user's ~/.psqlrc file).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-z</b>, <b>--field-separator-zero</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Set the field separator for unaligned output
  to a zero byte.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-0</b>, <b>--record-separator-zero</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Set the record separator for unaligned output
  to a zero byte. This is useful for interfacing, for example, with xargs
  -0.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-1</b>, <b>--single-transaction</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">When psql executes a script with the <b>-f</b>
  option, adding this option wraps <b>BEGIN</b>/<b>COMMIT</b> around the script
  to execute it as a single transaction. This ensures that either all the
  commands complete successfully, or no changes are applied.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the script itself uses <b>BEGIN</b>, <b>COMMIT</b>, or <b>ROLLBACK</b>, this
  option will not have the desired effects. Also, if the script contains any
  command that cannot be executed inside a transaction block, specifying this
  option will cause that command (and hence the whole transaction) to
  fail.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Show help about psql command line arguments,
  and exit.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT
  STATUS</a></h1>
psql returns 0 to the shell if it finished normally, 1 if a fatal error of its
  own occurs (e.g. out of memory, file not found), 2 if the connection to the
  server went bad and the session was not interactive, and 3 if an error
  occurred in a script and the variable <i>ON_ERROR_STOP</i> was set.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#USAGE">USAGE</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Connecting_to_a_Database"><a class="selflink" href="#Connecting_to_a_Database">Connecting
  to a Database</a></h2>
psql is a regular PostgreSQL client application. In order to connect to a
  database you need to know the name of your target database, the host name and
  port number of the server, and what user name you want to connect as. psql can
  be told about those parameters via command line options, namely <b>-d</b>,
  <b>-h</b>, <b>-p</b>, and <b>-U</b> respectively. If an argument is found that
  does not belong to any option it will be interpreted as the database name (or
  the user name, if the database name is already given). Not all of these
  options are required; there are useful defaults. If you omit the host name,
  psql will connect via a Unix-domain socket to a server on the local host, or
  via TCP/IP to localhost on machines that don't have Unix-domain sockets. The
  default port number is determined at compile time. Since the database server
  uses the same default, you will not have to specify the port in most cases.
  The default user name is your operating-system user name, as is the default
  database name. Note that you cannot just connect to any database under any
  user name. Your database administrator should have informed you about your
  access rights.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the defaults aren't quite right, you can save yourself some typing by
  setting the environment variables <b>PGDATABASE</b>, <b>PGHOST</b>,
  <b>PGPORT</b> and/or <b>PGUSER</b> to appropriate values. (For additional
  environment variables, see Section 31.14, &#x201C;Environment
  Variables&#x201D;, in the documentation.) It is also convenient to have a
  ~/.pgpass file to avoid regularly having to type in passwords. See Section
  31.15, &#x201C;The Password File&#x201D;, in the documentation for more
  information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An alternative way to specify connection parameters is in a <i>conninfo</i>
  string or a URI, which is used instead of a database name. This mechanism give
  you very wide control over the connection. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
$  <b>psql &quot;service=myservice sslmode=require&quot;</b>
$  <b>psql postgresql://dbmaster:5433/mydb?sslmode=require</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This way you can also use LDAP for connection parameter lookup as described in
  Section 31.17, &#x201C;LDAP Lookup of Connection Parameters&#x201D;, in the
  documentation. See Section 31.1, &#x201C;Database Connection Control
  Functions&#x201D;, in the documentation for more information on all the
  available connection options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the connection could not be made for any reason (e.g., insufficient
  privileges, server is not running on the targeted host, etc.), psql will
  return an error and terminate.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If at least one of standard input or standard output are a terminal, then psql
  sets the client encoding to &#x201C;auto&#x201D;, which will detect the
  appropriate client encoding from the locale settings ( <b>LC_CTYPE</b>
  environment variable on Unix systems). If this doesn't work out as expected,
  the client encoding can be overridden using the environment variable
  <b>PGCLIENTENCODING</b>.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Entering_SQL_Commands"><a class="selflink" href="#Entering_SQL_Commands">Entering
  SQL Commands</a></h2>
In normal operation, psql provides a prompt with the name of the database to
  which psql is currently connected, followed by the string =&gt;. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
$  <b>psql testdb</b>
psql (9.2.18)
Type &quot;help&quot; for help.
<div class="Pp"></div>
testdb=&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
At the prompt, the user can type in SQL commands. Ordinarily, input lines are
  sent to the server when a command-terminating semicolon is reached. An end of
  line does not terminate a command. Thus commands can be spread over several
  lines for clarity. If the command was sent and executed without error, the
  results of the command are displayed on the screen.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Whenever a command is executed, psql also polls for asynchronous notification
  events generated by <b>LISTEN</b>(7) and <b>NOTIFY</b>(7).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Meta-Commands"><a class="selflink" href="#Meta-Commands">Meta-Commands</a></h2>
Anything you enter in psql that begins with an unquoted backslash is a psql
  meta-command that is processed by psql itself. These commands make psql more
  useful for administration or scripting. Meta-commands are often called slash
  or backslash commands.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The format of a psql command is the backslash, followed immediately by a command
  verb, then any arguments. The arguments are separated from the command verb
  and each other by any number of whitespace characters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To include whitespace in an argument you can quote it with single quotes. To
  include a single quote in an argument, write two single quotes within
  single-quoted text. Anything contained in single quotes is furthermore subject
  to C-like substitutions for \n (new line), \t (tab), \b (backspace), \r
  (carriage return), \f (form feed), \ <i>digits</i> (octal), and \x
  <i>digits</i> (hexadecimal). A backslash preceding any other character within
  single-quoted text quotes that single character, whatever it is.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Within an argument, text that is enclosed in backquotes (`) is taken as a
  command line that is passed to the shell. The output of the command (with any
  trailing newline removed) replaces the backquoted text.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If an unquoted colon (:) followed by a psql variable name appears within an
  argument, it is replaced by the variable's value, as described in SQL
  Interpolation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some commands take an SQL identifier (such as a table name) as argument. These
  arguments follow the syntax rules of SQL: Unquoted letters are forced to
  lowercase, while double quotes (&quot;) protect letters from case conversion
  and allow incorporation of whitespace into the identifier. Within double
  quotes, paired double quotes reduce to a single double quote in the resulting
  name. For example, FOO&quot;BAR&quot;BAZ is interpreted as fooBARbaz, and
  &quot;A weird&quot;&quot; name&quot; becomes A weird&quot; name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Parsing for arguments stops at the end of the line, or when another unquoted
  backslash is found. An unquoted backslash is taken as the beginning of a new
  meta-command. The special sequence \\ (two backslashes) marks the end of
  arguments and continues parsing SQL commands, if any. That way SQL and psql
  commands can be freely mixed on a line. But in any case, the arguments of a
  meta-command cannot continue beyond the end of the line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following meta-commands are defined:
<div class="Pp"></div>
\a
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If the current table output format is
  unaligned, it is switched to aligned. If it is not unaligned, it is set to
  unaligned. This command is kept for backwards compatibility. See <b>\pset</b>
  for a more general solution.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\c or \connect [ -reuse-previous= <i>on|off</i> ] [ <i>dbname</i> [
  <i>username</i> ] [ <i>host</i> ] [ <i>port</i> ] | <i>conninfo</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Establishes a new connection to a PostgreSQL
  server. The connection parameters to use can be specified either using a
  positional syntax, or using conninfo connection strings as detailed in Section
  31.1.1, &#x201C;Connection Strings&#x201D;, in the documentation.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Where the command omits database name, user, host, or port, the new connection
  can reuse values from the previous connection. By default, values from the
  previous connection are reused except when processing a conninfo string.
  Passing a first argument of -reuse-previous=on or -reuse-previous=off
  overrides that default. When the command neither specifies nor reuses a
  particular parameter, the libpq default is used. Specifying any of
  <i>dbname</i>, <i>username</i>, <i>host</i> or <i>port</i> as - is equivalent
  to omitting that parameter.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the new connection is successfully made, the previous connection is closed.
  If the connection attempt failed (wrong user name, access denied, etc.), the
  previous connection will only be kept if psql is in interactive mode. When
  executing a non-interactive script, processing will immediately stop with an
  error. This distinction was chosen as a user convenience against typos on the
  one hand, and a safety mechanism that scripts are not accidentally acting on
  the wrong database on the other hand.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Examples:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
=&gt; \c mydb myuser host.dom 6432
=&gt; \c service=foo
=&gt; \c &quot;host=localhost port=5432 dbname=mydb connect_timeout=10 sslmode=disable&quot;
=&gt; \c postgresql://tom@localhost/mydb?application_name=myapp
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\C [ <i>title</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Sets the title of any tables being printed as
  the result of a query or unset any such title. This command is equivalent to
  \pset title <i>title</i>. (The name of this command derives from
  &#x201C;caption&#x201D;, as it was previously only used to set the caption in
  an HTML table.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\cd [ <i>directory</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Changes the current working directory to
  <i>directory</i>. Without argument, changes to the current user's home
  directory.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Tip</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
To print your current working directory, use \! pwd.
<div style="height: 0.50em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\conninfo
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Outputs information about the current database
  connection.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\copy { <i>table</i> [ ( <i>column_list</i> ) ] | ( <i>query</i> ) } { from | to
  } { <i>filename</i> | stdin | stdout | pstdin | pstdout } [ with ] [ binary ]
  [ oids ] [ delimiter [ as ] ' <i>character</i>' ] [ null [ as ]
  '<i>string</i>' ] [ csv [ header ] [ quote [ as ] ' <i>character</i>' ] [
  escape [ as ] ' <i>character</i>' ] [ force quote <i>column_list</i> | * ] [
  force not null <i>column_list</i> ] ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Performs a frontend (client) copy. This is an
  operation that runs an SQL <b>COPY</b>(7) command, but instead of the server
  reading or writing the specified file, psql reads or writes the file and
  routes the data between the server and the local file system. This means that
  file accessibility and privileges are those of the local user, not the server,
  and no SQL superuser privileges are required.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The syntax of the command is similar to that of the SQL <b>COPY</b>(7) command.
  Note that, because of this, special parsing rules apply to the <b>\copy</b>
  command. In particular, the variable substitution rules and backslash escapes
  do not apply.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
\copy ... from stdin | to stdout reads/writes based on the command input and
  output respectively. All rows are read from the same source that issued the
  command, continuing until \. is read or the stream reaches EOF. Output is sent
  to the same place as command output. To read/write from psql's standard input
  or output, use pstdin or pstdout. This option is useful for populating tables
  in-line within a SQL script file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Tip</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
This operation is not as efficient as the SQL <b>COPY</b> command because all
  data must pass through the client/server connection. For large amounts of data
  the SQL command might be preferable.

\d[S+] [ <i>pattern</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">For each relation (table, view, index,
  sequence, or foreign table) or composite type matching the <i>pattern</i>,
  show all columns, their types, the tablespace (if not the default) and any
  special attributes such as NOT NULL or defaults. Associated indexes,
  constraints, rules, and triggers are also shown. For foreign tables, the
  associated foreign server is shown as well. (&#x201C;Matching the
  pattern&#x201D; is defined in Patterns below.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For some types of relation, \d shows additional information for each column:
  column values for sequences, indexed expression for indexes and foreign data
  wrapper options for foreign tables.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The command form \d+ is identical, except that more information is displayed:
  any comments associated with the columns of the table are shown, as is the
  presence of OIDs in the table, the view definition if the relation is a view.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
By default, only user-created objects are shown; supply a pattern or the S
  modifier to include system objects.

<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Note</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
If <b>\d</b> is used without a <i>pattern</i> argument, it is equivalent to
  <b>\dtvsE</b> which will show a list of all visible tables, views, sequences
  and foreign tables. This is purely a convenience measure.

<div class="Pp"></div>
\dd[S] [ <i>pattern</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Shows the descriptions of objects of type
  constraint, operator class, operator family, rule, and trigger. All other
  comments may be viewed by the respective backslash commands for those object
  types.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
\dd displays descriptions for objects matching the <i>pattern</i>, or of visible
  objects of the appropriate type if no argument is given. But in either case,
  only objects that have a description are listed. By default, only user-created
  objects are shown; supply a pattern or the S modifier to include system
  objects.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Descriptions for objects can be created with the <b>COMMENT</b>(7)SQL
  command.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\ddp [ <i>pattern</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Lists default access privilege settings. An
  entry is shown for each role (and schema, if applicable) for which the default
  privilege settings have been changed from the built-in defaults. If
  <i>pattern</i> is specified, only entries whose role name or schema name
  matches the pattern are listed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES ( <b>ALTER_DEFAULT_PRIVILEGES</b>(7)) command is

  ], \dt[S+] [ <i>pattern</i> ], \dv[S+] [ <i>pattern</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">In this group of commands, the letters E, i,
  s, t, and v stand for foreign table, index, sequence, table, and view,
  respectively. You can specify any or all of these letters, in any order, to
  obtain a listing of objects of these types. For example, \dit lists indexes
  and tables. If + is appended to the command name, each object is listed with
  its physical size on disk and its associated description, if any. If
  <i>pattern</i> is specified, only objects whose names match the pattern are
  listed. By default, only user-created objects are shown; supply a pattern or
  the S modifier to include system objects.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\des[+] [ <i>pattern</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Lists foreign servers (mnemonic:

<div class="Pp"></div>
\dF[+] [ <i>pattern</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Lists text search configurations. If
  <i>pattern</i> is specified, only configurations whose names match the pattern
  are shown. If the form \dF+ is used, a full description of each configuration
  is shown, including the underlying text search parser and the dictionary list
  for each parser token type.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\dFd[+] [ <i>pattern</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Lists text search dictionaries. If
  <i>pattern</i> is specified, only dictionaries whose names match the pattern

  including the underlying function names.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\dg[+] [ <i>pattern</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Lists database roles. (Since the concepts of
  &#x201C;users&#x201D; and &#x201C;groups&#x201D; have been unified into
  &#x201C;roles&#x201D;, this command is now equivalent to \du.) If
  <i>pattern</i> is specified, only those roles whose names match the pattern
  are listed. If the form \dg+ is used, additional information is shown about
  each role; currently this adds the comment for each role.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\dl
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This is an alias for <b>\lo_list</b>, which
  shows a list of large objects.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\dL[S+] [ <i>pattern</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Lists procedural languages. If <i>pattern</i>
  is specified, only languages whose names match the pattern are listed. By
  default, only user-created languages are shown; supply the S modifier to
  include system objects. If + is appended to the command name, each language is

  a system object.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\dn[S+] [ <i>pattern</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Lists schemas (namespaces). If <i>pattern</i>
  is specified, only schemas whose names match the pattern are listed. By

  any.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\do[S] [ <i>pattern</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Lists operators with their operand and return

  pattern or the S modifier to include system objects.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\dO[S+] [ <i>pattern</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Lists collations. If <i>pattern</i> is
  specified, only collations whose names match the pattern are listed. By
  default, only user-created objects are shown; supply a pattern or the S
  modifier to include system objects. If + is appended to the command name, each
  collation is listed with its associated description, if any. Note that only
  collations usable with the current database's encoding are shown, so the
  results may vary in different databases of the same installation.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\dp [ <i>pattern</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Lists tables, views and sequences with their
  associated access privileges. If <i>pattern</i> is specified, only tables,
  views and sequences whose names match the pattern are listed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>GRANT</b>(7) and <b>REVOKE</b>(7) commands are used to set access
  privileges. The meaning of the privilege display is explained under
  <b>GRANT</b>(7).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\drds [ <i>role-pattern</i> [ <i>database-pattern</i> ] ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Lists defined configuration settings. These
  settings can be role-specific, database-specific, or both. <i>role-pattern</i>
  and <i>database-pattern</i> are used to select specific roles and databases to
  list, respectively. If omitted, or if * is specified, all settings are listed,
  including those not role-specific or database-specific, respectively.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The ALTER ROLE ( <b>ALTER_ROLE</b>(7)) and ALTER DATABASE (
  <b>ALTER_DATABASE</b>(7)) commands are used to define per-role and
  per-database configuration settings.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\dT[S+] [ <i>pattern</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Lists data types. If <i>pattern</i> is
  specified, only types whose names match the pattern are listed. If + is
  appended to the command name, each type is listed with its internal name and
  size, its allowed values if it is an enum type, and its associated
  permissions. By default, only user-created objects are shown; supply a pattern
  or the S modifier to include system objects.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\du[+] [ <i>pattern</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Lists database roles. (Since the concepts of
  &#x201C;users&#x201D; and &#x201C;groups&#x201D; have been unified into
  &#x201C;roles&#x201D;, this command is now equivalent to \dg.) If
  <i>pattern</i> is specified, only those roles whose names match the pattern
  are listed. If the form \du+ is used, additional information is shown about
  each role; currently this adds the comment for each role.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\dx[+] [ <i>pattern</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Lists installed extensions. If <i>pattern</i>
  is specified, only those extensions whose names match the pattern are listed.
  If the form \dx+ is used, all the objects belonging to each matching extension
  are listed.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\e or \edit [ <i>filename</i> ] [ <i>line_number</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If <i>filename</i> is specified, the file is
  edited; after the editor exits, its content is copied back to the query
  buffer. If no <i>filename</i> is given, the current query buffer is copied to
  a temporary file which is then edited in the same fashion.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The new query buffer is then re-parsed according to the normal rules of psql,
  where the whole buffer is treated as a single line. (Thus you cannot make
  scripts this way. Use <b>\i</b> for that.) This means that if the query ends
  with (or contains) a semicolon, it is immediately executed. Otherwise it will
  merely wait in the query buffer; type semicolon or \g to send it, or \r to
  cancel.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If a line number is specified, psql will position the cursor on the specified
  line of the file or query buffer. Note that if a single all-digits argument is
  given, psql assumes it is a line number, not a file name.

<div class="Pp"></div>
\echo <i>text</i> [ ... ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Prints the arguments to the standard output,
  separated by one space and followed by a newline. This can be useful to
  intersperse information in the output of scripts. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
=&gt;  <b>\echo `date`</b>
Tue Oct 26 21:40:57 CEST 1999
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the first argument is an unquoted -n the trailing newline is not written.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Tip</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
If you use the <b>\o</b> command to redirect your query output you might wish to
  use <b>\qecho</b> instead of this command.
<div style="height: 0.50em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\ef [ <i>function_description</i> [ <i>line_number</i> ] ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This command fetches and edits the definition
  of the named function, in the form of a <b>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION</b>
  command. Editing is done in the same way as for \edit. After the editor exits,
  the updated command waits in the query buffer; type semicolon or \g to send
  it, or \r to cancel.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The target function can be specified by name alone, or by name and arguments,
  for example foo(integer, text). The argument types must be given if there is
  more than one function of the same name.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If no function is specified, a blank <b>CREATE FUNCTION</b> template is
  presented for editing.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If a line number is specified, psql will position the cursor on the specified
  line of the function body. (Note that the function body typically does not
  begin on the first line of the file.)

\encoding [ <i>encoding</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Sets the client character set encoding.
  Without an argument, this command shows the current encoding.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\f [ <i>string</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Sets the field separator for unaligned query
  output. The default is the vertical bar (|). See also <b>\pset</b> for a
  generic way of setting output options.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\g [ <i>filename</i> ], \g [ |<i>command</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Sends the current query input buffer to the
  server, and optionally stores the query's output in <i>filename</i> or pipes
  the output to the shell command <i>command</i>. A bare \g is virtually
  equivalent to a semicolon. A \g with argument is a &#x201C;one-shot&#x201D;
  alternative to the <b>\o</b> command.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\h or \help [ <i>command</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Gives syntax help on the specified SQL
  command. If <i>command</i> is not specified, then psql will list all the
  commands for which syntax help is available. If <i>command</i> is an asterisk
  (*), then syntax help on all SQL commands is shown.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Note</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
To simplify typing, commands that consists of several words do not have to be
  quoted. Thus it is fine to type <b>\help alter table</b>.
<div style="height: 0.50em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\H or \html
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Turns on HTML query output format. If the HTML
  format is already on, it is switched back to the default aligned text format.
  This command is for compatibility and convenience, but see <b>\pset</b> about
  setting other output options.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\i or \include <i>filename</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Reads input from the file <i>filename</i> and
  executes it as though it had been typed on the keyboard.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If <i>filename</i> is - (hyphen), then standard input is read until an EOF
  indication or <b>\q</b> meta-command. This can be used to intersperse
  interactive input with input from files. Note that Readline behavior will be
  used only if it is active at the outermost level.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div>&#x00A0;</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\ir or \include_relative <i>filename</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The \ir command is similar to \i, but resolves
  relative file names differently. When executing in interactive mode, the two
  commands behave identically. However, when invoked from a script, \ir
  interprets file names relative to the directory in which the script is
  located, rather than the current working directory.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\l (or \list), \l+ (or \list+)
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">List the names, owners, character set
  encodings, and access privileges of all the databases in the server. If + is
  appended to the command name, database sizes, default tablespaces, and
  descriptions are also displayed. (Size information is only available for
  databases that the current user can connect to.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\lo_export <i>loid</i> <i>filename</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Reads the large object with OID <i>loid</i>
  from the database and writes it to <i>filename</i>. Note that this is subtly
  different from the server function <b>lo_export</b>, which acts with the
  permissions of the user that the database server runs as and on the server's
  file system.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

<div class="Pp"></div>
\lo_import <i>filename</i> [ <i>comment</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Stores the file into a PostgreSQL large
  object. Optionally, it associates the given comment with the object. Example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">

The response indicates that the large object received object ID 152801, which
  can be used to access the newly-created large object in the future. For the
  sake of readability, it is recommended to always associate a human-readable
  comment with every object. Both OIDs and comments can be viewed with the
  <b>\lo_list</b> command.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that this command is subtly different from the server-side <b>lo_import</b>
  because it acts as the local user on the local file system, rather than the
  server's user and file system.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\lo_list
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Shows a list of all PostgreSQL large objects
  currently stored in the database, along with any comments provided for
  them.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\lo_unlink <i>loid</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Deletes the large object with OID <i>loid</i>
  from the database.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Tip</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Use <b>\lo_list</b> to find out the large object's OID.
<div style="height: 0.50em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\o or \out [ <i>filename</i> ], \o or \out [ |<i>command</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Arranges to save future query results to the
  file <i>filename</i> or pipe future results to the shell command
  <i>command</i>. If no argument is specified, the query output is reset to the
  standard output.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
&#x201C;Query results&#x201D; includes all tables, command responses, and
  notices obtained from the database server, as well as output of various
  backslash commands that query the database (such as <b>\d</b>), but not error
  messages.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Tip</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
To intersperse text output in between query results, use <b>\qecho</b>.
<div style="height: 0.50em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\p or \print
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Print the current query buffer to the standard
  output.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\password [ <i>username</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Changes the password of the specified user (by
  default, the current user). This command prompts for the new password,
  encrypts it, and sends it to the server as an <b>ALTER ROLE</b> command. This
  makes sure that the new password does not appear in cleartext in the command
  history, the server log, or elsewhere.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\prompt [ <i>text</i> ] <i>name</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Prompts the user to supply text, which is
  assigned to the variable <i>name</i>. An optional prompt string, <i>text</i>,
  can be specified. (For multiword prompts, surround the text with single
  quotes.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
By default, \prompt uses the terminal for input and output. However, if the
  <b>-f</b> command line switch was used, \prompt uses standard input and
  standard output.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\pset <i>option</i> [ <i>value</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This command sets options affecting the output
  of query result tables. <i>option</i> indicates which option is to be set. The
  semantics of <i>value</i> vary depending on the selected option. For some
  options, omitting <i>value</i> causes the option to be toggled or unset, as
  described under the particular option. If no such behavior is mentioned, then
  omitting <i>value</i> just results in the current setting being displayed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Adjustable printing options are:
<div class="Pp"></div>
border
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The <i>value</i> must be a number. In general,
  the higher the number the more borders and lines the tables will have, but
  this depends on the particular format. In HTML format, this will translate
  directly into the border=... attribute; in the other formats only values 0 (no
  border), 1 (internal dividing lines), and 2 (table frame) make sense.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
columns
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Sets the target width for the wrapped format,
  and also the width limit for determining whether output is wide enough to
  require the pager or switch to the vertical display in expanded auto mode.
  Zero (the default) causes the target width to be controlled by the environment
  variable <b>COLUMNS</b>, or the detected screen width if <b>COLUMNS</b> is not
  set. In addition, if columns is zero then the wrapped format only affects
  screen output. If columns is nonzero then file and pipe output is wrapped to
  that width as well.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
expanded (or x)
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If <i>value</i> is specified it must be either
  on or off, which will enable or disable expanded mode, or auto. If
  <i>value</i> is omitted the command toggles between the on and off settings.
  When expanded mode is enabled, query results are displayed in two columns,
  with the column name on the left and the data on the right. This mode is
  useful if the data wouldn't fit on the screen in the normal
  &#x201C;horizontal&#x201D; mode. In the auto setting, the expanded mode is
  used whenever the query output is wider than the screen, otherwise the regular
  mode is used. The auto setting is only effective in the aligned and wrapped
  formats. In other formats, it always behaves as if the expanded mode is
  off.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
fieldsep
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies the field separator to be used in
  unaligned output format. That way one can create, for example, tab- or
  comma-separated output, which other programs might prefer. To set a tab as
  field separator, type \pset fieldsep '\t'. The default field separator is '|'
  (a vertical bar).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
fieldsep_zero
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Sets the field separator to use in unaligned
  output format to a zero byte.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
footer
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If <i>value</i> is specified it must be either
  on or off which will enable or disable display of the table footer (the (
  <i>n</i> rows) count). If <i>value</i> is omitted the command toggles footer
  display on or off.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
format
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Sets the output format to one of unaligned,
  aligned, wrapped, html, latex, or troff-ms. Unique abbreviations are allowed.
  (That would mean one letter is enough.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
unaligned format writes all columns of a row on one line, separated by the
  currently active field separator. This is useful for creating output that
  might be intended to be read in by other programs (for example, tab-separated
  or comma-separated format).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
aligned format is the standard, human-readable, nicely formatted text output;
  this is the default.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
wrapped format is like aligned but wraps wide data values across lines to make
  the output fit in the target column width. The target width is determined as
  described under the columns option. Note that psql will not attempt to wrap
  column header titles; therefore, wrapped format behaves the same as aligned if
  the total width needed for column headers exceeds the target.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The html, latex, and troff-ms formats put out tables that are intended to be
  included in documents using the respective mark-up language. They are not
  complete documents! (This might not be so dramatic in HTML, but in LaTeX you
  must have a complete document wrapper.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
linestyle
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Sets the border line drawing style to one of
  ascii, old-ascii or unicode. Unique abbreviations are allowed. (That would
  mean one letter is enough.) The default setting is ascii. This option only
  affects the aligned and wrapped output formats.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
ascii style uses plain ASCII characters. Newlines in data are shown using a +
  symbol in the right-hand margin. When the wrapped format wraps data from one
  line to the next without a newline character, a dot (.) is shown in the
  right-hand margin of the first line, and again in the left-hand margin of the
  following line.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
old-ascii style uses plain ASCII characters, using the formatting style used in
  PostgreSQL 8.4 and earlier. Newlines in data are shown using a : symbol in
  place of the left-hand column separator. When the data is wrapped from one
  line to the next without a newline character, a ; symbol is used in place of
  the left-hand column separator.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
unicode style uses Unicode box-drawing characters. Newlines in data are shown
  using a carriage return symbol in the right-hand margin. When the data is
  wrapped from one line to the next without a newline character, an ellipsis
  symbol is shown in the right-hand margin of the first line, and again in the
  left-hand margin of the following line.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When the border setting is greater than zero, this option also determines the
  characters with which the border lines are drawn. Plain ASCII characters work
  everywhere, but Unicode characters look nicer on displays that recognize
  them.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
null
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Sets the string to be printed in place of a
  null value. The default is to print nothing, which can easily be mistaken for
  an empty string. For example, one might prefer \pset null '(null)'.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
numericlocale
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If <i>value</i> is specified it must be either
  on or off which will enable or disable display of a locale-specific character
  to separate groups of digits to the left of the decimal marker. If
  <i>value</i> is omitted the command toggles between regular and
  locale-specific numeric output.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
pager
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Controls use of a pager program for query and
  psql help output. If the environment variable <b>PAGER</b> is set, the output
  is piped to the specified program. Otherwise a platform-dependent default
  (such as more) is used.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When the pager option is off, the pager program is not used. When the pager
  option is on, the pager is used when appropriate, i.e., when the output is to
  a terminal and will not fit on the screen. The pager option can also be set to
  always, which causes the pager to be used for all terminal output regardless
  of whether it fits on the screen. \pset pager without a <i>value</i> toggles
  pager use on and off.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
recordsep
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies the record (line) separator to use
  in unaligned output format. The default is a newline character.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
recordsep_zero
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Sets the record separator to use in unaligned
  output format to a zero byte.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
tableattr (or T)
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies attributes to be placed inside the
  HTMLtable tag in html output format. This could for example be cellpadding or
  bgcolor. Note that you probably don't want to specify border here, as that is
  already taken care of by \pset border. If no <i>value</i> is given, the table
  attributes are unset.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
title
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Sets the table title for any subsequently
  printed tables. This can be used to give your output descriptive tags. If no
  <i>value</i> is given, the title is unset.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
tuples_only (or t)
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If <i>value</i> is specified it must be either
  on or off which will enable or disable tuples-only mode. If <i>value</i> is
  omitted the command toggles between regular and tuples-only output. Regular
  output includes extra information such as column headers, titles, and various
  footers. In tuples-only mode, only actual table data is shown.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Illustrations of how these different formats look can be seen in the EXAMPLES
  section.

<b>Tip</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
There are various shortcut commands for <b>\pset</b>. See <b>\a</b>, <b>\C</b>,
  <b>\H</b>, <b>\t</b>, <b>\T</b>, and <b>\x</b>.

<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Note</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
It is an error to call <b>\pset</b> without any arguments. In the future this
  case might show the current status of all printing options.
<div style="height: 0.50em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\q or \quit
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Quits the psql program. In a script file, only
  execution of that script is terminated.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\qecho <i>text</i> [ ... ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This command is identical to <b>\echo</b>
  except that the output will be written to the query output channel, as set by
  <b>\o</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\r or \reset
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Resets (clears) the query buffer.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\s [ <i>filename</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Print psql's command line history to
  <i>filename</i>. If <i>filename</i> is omitted, the history is written to the
  standard output (using the pager if appropriate). This command is not
  available if psql was built without Readline support.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\set [ <i>name</i> [ <i>value</i> [ ... ] ] ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Sets the psql variable <i>name</i> to
  <i>value</i>, or if more than one value is given, to the concatenation of all
  of them. If only one argument is given, the variable is set with an empty
  value. To unset a variable, use the <b>\unset</b> command.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>\set</b> without any arguments displays the names and values of all
  currently-set psql variables.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Valid variable names can contain letters, digits, and underscores. See the
  section Variables below for details. Variable names are case-sensitive.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Although you are welcome to set any variable to anything you want, psql treats
  several variables as special. They are documented in the section about
  variables.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Note</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
This command is unrelated to the SQL command <b>SET</b>(7).
<div style="height: 0.50em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\setenv <i>name</i> [ <i>value</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Sets the environment variable <i>name</i> to
  <i>value</i>, or if the <i>value</i> is not supplied, unsets the environment
  variable. Example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
testdb=&gt;  <b>\setenv PAGER less</b>
testdb=&gt;  <b>\setenv LESS -imx4F</b>
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\sf[+] <i>function_description</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This command fetches and shows the definition
  of the named function, in the form of a <b>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION</b>
  command. The definition is printed to the current query output channel, as set
  by <b>\o</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The target function can be specified by name alone, or by name and arguments,
  for example foo(integer, text). The argument types must be given if there is
  more than one function of the same name.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If + is appended to the command name, then the output lines are numbered, with
  the first line of the function body being line 1.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\t
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Toggles the display of output column name
  headings and row count footer. This command is equivalent to \pset tuples_only
  and is provided for convenience.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\T <i>table_options</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies attributes to be placed within the
  table tag in HTML output format. This command is equivalent to \pset tableattr
  <i>table_options</i>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\timing [ <i>on</i> | <i>off</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Without parameter, toggles a display of how
  long each SQL statement takes, in milliseconds. With parameter, sets
  same.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\unset <i>name</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Unsets (deletes) the psql variable
  <i>name</i>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\w or \write <i>filename</i>, \w or \write |<i>command</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Outputs the current query buffer to the file
  <i>filename</i> or pipes it to the shell command <i>command</i>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\x [ <i>on</i> | <i>off</i> | <i>auto</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Sets or toggles expanded table formatting
  mode. As such it is equivalent to \pset expanded.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\z [ <i>pattern</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Lists tables, views and sequences with their
  associated access privileges. If a <i>pattern</i> is specified, only tables,
  views and sequences whose names match the pattern are listed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This is an alias for <b>\dp</b> (&#x201C;display privileges&#x201D;).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\! [ <i>command</i> ]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Escapes to a separate shell or executes the
  shell command <i>command</i>. The arguments are not further interpreted; the
  shell will see them as-is.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
\?
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Shows help information about the backslash
  commands.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Patterns</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
The various \d commands accept a <i>pattern</i> parameter to specify the object
  name(s) to be displayed. In the simplest case, a pattern is just the exact
  name of the object. The characters within a pattern are normally folded to
  lower case, just as in SQL names; for example, \dt FOO will display the table
  named foo. As in SQL names, placing double quotes around a pattern stops
  folding to lower case. Should you need to include an actual double quote
  character in a pattern, write it as a pair of double quotes within a
  double-quote sequence; again this is in accord with the rules for SQL quoted
  identifiers. For example, \dt &quot;FOO&quot;&quot;BAR&quot; will display the
  table named FOO&quot;BAR (not foo&quot;bar). Unlike the normal rules for SQL
  names, you can put double quotes around just part of a pattern, for instance
  \dt FOO&quot;FOO&quot;BAR will display the table named fooFOObar.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Whenever the <i>pattern</i> parameter is omitted completely, the \d commands
  display all objects that are visible in the current schema search path
  &#x2014; this is equivalent to using * as the pattern. (An object is said to
  be visible if its containing schema is in the search path and no object of the
  same kind and name appears earlier in the search path. This is equivalent to
  the statement that the object can be referenced by name without explicit
  schema qualification.) To see all objects in the database regardless of
  visibility, use *.* as the pattern.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Within a pattern, * matches any sequence of characters (including no characters)
  and ? matches any single character. (This notation is comparable to Unix shell
  file name patterns.) For example, \dt int* displays tables whose names begin
  with int. But within double quotes, * and ? lose these special meanings and
  are just matched literally.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A pattern that contains a dot (.) is interpreted as a schema name pattern
  followed by an object name pattern. For example, \dt foo*.*bar* displays all
  tables whose table name includes bar that are in schemas whose schema name
  starts with foo. When no dot appears, then the pattern matches only objects
  that are visible in the current schema search path. Again, a dot within double
  quotes loses its special meaning and is matched literally.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Advanced users can use regular-expression notations such as character classes,
  for example [0-9] to match any digit. All regular expression special
  characters work as specified in Section 9.7.3, &#x201C;POSIX Regular
  Expressions&#x201D;, in the documentation, except for . which is taken as a
  separator as mentioned above, * which is translated to the regular-expression
  notation .*, ? which is translated to ., and $ which is matched literally. You
  can emulate these pattern characters at need by writing ? for ., ( <i>R</i>+|)
  for <i>R</i>*, or ( <i>R</i>|) for <i>R</i>?. $ is not needed as a
  regular-expression character since the pattern must match the whole name,
  unlike the usual interpretation of regular expressions (in other words, $ is
  automatically appended to your pattern). Write * at the beginning and/or end
  if you don't wish the pattern to be anchored. Note that within double quotes,
  all regular expression special characters lose their special meanings and are
  matched literally. Also, the regular expression special characters are matched
  literally in operator name patterns (i.e., the argument of \do).</div>

  Features</a></h2>
<b>Variables</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
psql provides variable substitution features similar to common Unix command
  shells. Variables are simply name/value pairs, where the value can be any
  string of any length. The name must consist of letters (including non-Latin
  letters), digits, and underscores.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To set a variable, use the psql meta-command <b>\set</b>. For example,
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
testdb=&gt;  <b>\set foo bar</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
sets the variable foo to the value bar. To retrieve the content of the variable,
  precede the name with a colon, for example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
testdb=&gt;  <b>\echo :foo</b>
bar
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This works in both regular SQL commands and meta-commands; there is more detail
  in SQL Interpolation, below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you call <b>\set</b> without a second argument, the variable is set, with an
  empty string as value. To unset (i.e., delete) a variable, use the command
  <b>\unset</b>. To show the values of all variables, call <b>\set</b> without
  any argument.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Note</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The arguments of <b>\set</b> are subject to the same substitution rules as with
  other commands. Thus you can construct interesting references such as \set
  :foo 'something' and get &#x201C;soft links&#x201D; or &#x201C;variable
  variables&#x201D; of Perl or PHP fame, respectively. Unfortunately (or
  fortunately?), there is no way to do anything useful with these constructs. On
  the other hand, \set bar :foo is a perfectly valid way to copy a variable.
<div style="height: 0.50em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A number of these variables are treated specially by psql. They represent
  certain option settings that can be changed at run time by altering the value
  of the variable, or in some cases represent changeable state of psql. Although
  you can use these variables for other purposes, this is not recommended, as
  the program behavior might grow really strange really quickly. By convention,
  all specially treated variables' names consist of all upper-case ASCII letters
  (and possibly digits and underscores). To ensure maximum compatibility in the
  future, avoid using such variable names for your own purposes. A list of all
  specially treated variables follows.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>AUTOCOMMIT</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">When on (the default), each SQL command is
  automatically committed upon successful completion. To postpone commit in this
  mode, you must enter a <b>BEGIN</b> or <b>START TRANSACTION</b> SQL command.
  When off or unset, SQL commands are not committed until you explicitly issue
  <b>COMMIT</b> or <b>END</b>. The autocommit-off mode works by issuing an
  implicit <b>BEGIN</b> for you, just before any command that is not already in
  a transaction block and is not itself a <b>BEGIN</b> or other
  transaction-control command, nor a command that cannot be executed inside a
  transaction block (such as <b>VACUUM</b>).

In autocommit-off mode, you must explicitly abandon any failed transaction by
  entering <b>ABORT</b> or <b>ROLLBACK</b>. Also keep in mind that if you exit
  the session without committing, your work will be lost.

<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The autocommit-on mode is PostgreSQL's traditional behavior, but autocommit-off
  is closer to the SQL spec. If you prefer autocommit-off, you might wish to set
  it in the system-wide psqlrc file or your ~/.psqlrc file.

<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>COMP_KEYWORD_CASE</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Determines which letter case to use when
  completing an SQL key word. If set to lower or upper, the completed word will
  be in lower or upper case, respectively. If set to preserve-lower or
  preserve-upper (the default), the completed word will be in the case of the
  word already entered, but words being completed without anything entered will
  be in lower or upper case, respectively.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>DBNAME</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The name of the database you are currently
  connected to. This is set every time you connect to a database (including
  program start-up), but can be unset.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>ECHO</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If set to all, all nonempty input lines are
  printed to standard output as they are read. (This does not apply to lines
  read interactively.) To select this behavior on program start-up, use the
  switch <b>-a</b>. If set to queries, psql prints each query to standard output
  as it is sent to the server. The switch for this is <b>-e</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>ECHO_HIDDEN</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">When this variable is set to on and a
  backslash command queries the database, the query is first shown. This feature
  helps you to study PostgreSQL internals and provide similar functionality in
  your own programs. (To select this behavior on program start-up, use the
  switch <b>-E</b>.) If you set the variable to the value noexec, the queries
  are just shown but are not actually sent to the server and executed.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>ENCODING</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The current client character set
  encoding.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>FETCH_COUNT</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If this variable is set to an integer value
  &gt; 0, the results of <b>SELECT</b> queries are fetched and displayed in
  groups of that many rows, rather than the default behavior of collecting the
  entire result set before display. Therefore only a limited amount of memory is
  used, regardless of the size of the result set. Settings of 100 to 1000 are
  commonly used when enabling this feature. Keep in mind that when using this
  feature, a query might fail after having already displayed some rows.

<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Tip</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Although you can use any output format with this feature, the default aligned
  format tends to look bad because each group of <i>FETCH_COUNT</i> rows will be
  formatted separately, leading to varying column widths across the row groups.
  The other output formats work better.

<i>HISTCONTROL</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If this variable is set to ignorespace, lines
  which begin with a space are not entered into the history list. If set to a
  value of ignoredups, lines matching the previous history line are not entered.
  A value of ignoreboth combines the two options. If unset, or if set to any
  other value than those above, all lines read in interactive mode are saved on
  the history list.

<i>IGNOREEOF</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If unset, sending an EOF character (usually

  If set to a numeric value, that many EOF characters are ignored before the
  application terminates. If the variable is set but has no numeric value, the
  default is 10.

<i>LASTOID</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The value of the last affected OID, as
  returned from an <b>INSERT</b> or <b>\lo_import</b> command. This variable is
  only guaranteed to be valid until after the result of the next SQL command has
  been displayed.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>ON_ERROR_ROLLBACK</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">When set to on, if a statement in a
  transaction block generates an error, the error is ignored and the transaction
  continues. When set to interactive, such errors are only ignored in
  interactive sessions, and not when reading script files. When unset or set to
  off, a statement in a transaction block that generates an error aborts the
  entire transaction. The error rollback mode works by issuing an implicit
  <b>SAVEPOINT</b> for you, just before each command that is in a transaction
  block, and then rolling back to the savepoint if the command fails.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>ON_ERROR_STOP</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">By default, command processing continues after
  an error. When this variable is set to on, processing will instead stop
  immediately. In interactive mode, psql will return to the command prompt;
  otherwise, psql will exit, returning error code 3 to distinguish this case
  from fatal error conditions, which are reported using error code 1. In either
  case, any currently running scripts (the top-level script, if any, and any
  other scripts which it may have in invoked) will be terminated immediately. If
  the top-level command string contained multiple SQL commands, processing will
  stop with the current command.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>PORT</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The database server port to which you are
  currently connected. This is set every time you connect to a database
  (including program start-up), but can be unset.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>PROMPT1</i>, <i>PROMPT2</i>, <i>PROMPT3</i>

<i>QUIET</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Setting this variable to on is equivalent to
  the command line option <b>-q</b>. It is probably not too useful in
  interactive mode.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>SINGLELINE</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Setting this variable to on is equivalent to
  the command line option <b>-S</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>SINGLESTEP</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Setting this variable to on is equivalent to
  the command line option <b>-s</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>USER</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The database user you are currently connected

<b>SQL Interpolation</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
A key feature of psql variables is that you can substitute
  (&#x201C;interpolate&#x201D;) them into regular SQL statements, as well as the
  arguments of meta-commands. Furthermore, psql provides facilities for ensuring
  that variable values used as SQL literals and identifiers are properly quoted.
  The syntax for interpolating a value without any quoting is to prepend the
  variable name with a colon (:). For example,
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
testdb=&gt;  <b>\set foo 'my_table'</b>
testdb=&gt;  <b>SELECT * FROM :foo;</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
would query the table my_table. Note that this may be unsafe: the value of the
  variable is copied literally, so it can contain unbalanced quotes, or even
  backslash commands. You must make sure that it makes sense where you put it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a value is to be used as an SQL literal or identifier, it is safest to
  arrange for it to be quoted. To quote the value of a variable as an SQL
  literal, write a colon followed by the variable name in single quotes. To
  quote the value as an SQL identifier, write a colon followed by the variable
  name in double quotes. These constructs deal correctly with quotes and other
  special characters embedded within the variable value. The previous example
  would be more safely written this way:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
testdb=&gt;  <b>\set foo 'my_table'</b>
testdb=&gt;  <b>SELECT * FROM :&quot;foo&quot;;</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Variable interpolation will not be performed within quoted SQL literals and
  identifiers. Therefore, a construction such as ':foo' doesn't work to produce
  a quoted literal from a variable's value (and it would be unsafe if it did
  work, since it wouldn't correctly handle quotes embedded in the value).
<div class="Pp"></div>
One example use of this mechanism is to copy the contents of a file into a table
  column. First load the file into a variable and then interpolate the
  variable's value as a quoted string:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
testdb=&gt;  <b>\set content `cat my_file.txt`</b>
testdb=&gt;  <b>INSERT INTO my_table VALUES (:'content');</b>
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
(Note that this still won't work if my_file.txt contains NUL bytes. psql does
  not support embedded NUL bytes in variable values.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since colons can legally appear in SQL commands, an apparent attempt at
  interpolation (that is, :name, :'name', or :&quot;name&quot;) is not replaced
  unless the named variable is currently set. In any case, you can escape a
  colon with a backslash to protect it from substitution.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The colon syntax for variables is standard SQL for embedded query languages,
  such as ECPG. The colon syntaxes for array slices and type casts are
  PostgreSQL extensions, which can sometimes conflict with the standard usage.
  The colon-quote syntax for escaping a variable's value as an SQL literal or
  identifier is a psql extension.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Prompting</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
The prompts psql issues can be customized to your preference. The three
  variables <i>PROMPT1</i>, <i>PROMPT2</i>, and <i>PROMPT3</i> contain strings
  and special escape sequences that describe the appearance of the prompt.
  Prompt 1 is the normal prompt that is issued when psql requests a new command.
  Prompt 2 is issued when more input is expected during command entry, for
  example because the command was not terminated with a semicolon or a quote was
  not closed. Prompt 3 is issued when you are running an SQL <b>COPY FROM
  STDIN</b> command and you need to type in a row value on the terminal.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The value of the selected prompt variable is printed literally, except where a
  percent sign (%) is encountered. Depending on the next character, certain
  other text is substituted instead. Defined substitutions are:
<div class="Pp"></div>
%M
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The full host name (with domain name) of the
  database server, or [local] if the connection is over a Unix domain socket, or
  [local: <i>/dir/name</i>], if the Unix domain socket is not at the compiled in
  default location.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%m
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The host name of the database server,
  truncated at the first dot, or [local] if the connection is over a Unix domain
  socket.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%&gt;
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The port number at which the database server
  is listening.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%n
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The database session user name. (The expansion
  of this value might change during a database session as the result of the
  command <b>SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION</b>.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%/
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The name of the current database.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%~
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Like %/, but the output is ~ (tilde) if the
  database is your default database.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%#
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If the session user is a database superuser,
  then a #, otherwise a &gt;. (The expansion of this value might change during a
  database session as the result of the command <b>SET SESSION
  AUTHORIZATION</b>.)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%R
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">In prompt 1 normally =, but ^ if in
  single-line mode, or ! if the session is disconnected from the database (which
  can happen if <b>\connect</b> fails). In prompt 2 %R is replaced by a
  character that depends on why psql expects more input: - if the command simply
  wasn't terminated yet, but * if there is an unfinished /* ... */ comment, a
  single quote if there is an unfinished quoted string, a double quote if there
  is an unfinished quoted identifier, a dollar sign if there is an unfinished
  dollar-quoted string, or ( if there is an unmatched left parenthesis. In
  prompt 3 %R doesn't produce anything.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%x
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Transaction status: an empty string when not
  in a transaction block, or * when in a transaction block, or ! when in a
  failed transaction block, or ? when the transaction state is indeterminate
  (for example, because there is no connection).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
% <i>digits</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The character with the indicated octal code is
  substituted.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%: <i>name</i>:
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The value of the psql variable <i>name</i>.
  See the section Variables for details.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%` <i>command</i>`
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The output of <i>command</i>, similar to
  ordinary &#x201C;back-tick&#x201D; substitution.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%[ ... %]
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Prompts can contain terminal control
  characters which, for example, change the color, background, or style of the
  prompt text, or change the title of the terminal window. In order for the line
  editing features of Readline to work properly, these non-printing control
  characters must be designated as invisible by surrounding them with %[ and %].
  Multiple pairs of these can occur within the prompt. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
testdb=&gt; \set PROMPT1 '%[%033[1;33;40m%]%n@%/%R%[%033[0m%]%# '
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
results in a boldfaced (1;) yellow-on-black (33;40) prompt on VT100-compatible,
  color-capable terminals.</div>
To insert a percent sign into your prompt, write %%. The default prompts are
  '%/%R%# ' for prompts 1 and 2, and '&gt;&gt; ' for prompt 3.

<b>Command-Line Editing</b>

<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
psql supports the Readline library for convenient line editing and retrieval.
  The command history is automatically saved when psql exits and is reloaded
  when psql starts up. Tab-completion is also supported, although the completion
  logic makes no claim to be an SQL parser. If for some reason you do not like
  the tab completion, you can turn it off by putting this in a file named
  .inputrc in your home directory:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
$if psql
set disable-completion on
$endif

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The built-in default editors are vi on Unix systems and notepad.exe on Windows
  systems.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>PSQL_EDITOR_LINENUMBER_ARG</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">When <b>\e</b> or <b>\ef</b> is used with a
  line number argument, this variable specifies the command-line argument used
  to pass the starting line number to the user's editor. For editors such as
  Emacs or vi, this is a plus sign. Include a trailing space in the value of the
  variable if there needs to be space between the option name and the line
  number. Examples:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
PSQL_EDITOR_LINENUMBER_ARG='+'
PSQL_EDITOR_LINENUMBER_ARG='--line '
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities, also uses the environment
  variables supported by libpq (see Section 31.14, &#x201C;Environment
  Variables&#x201D;, in the documentation).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></h1>
psqlrc and ~/.psqlrc
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Unless it is passed an <b>-X</b> or <b>-c</b>
  option, psql attempts to read and execute commands from the system-wide
  startup file (psqlrc) and then the user's personal startup file (~/.psqlrc),
  after connecting to the database but before accepting normal commands. These
  files can be used to set up the client and/or the server to taste, typically
  with <b>\set</b> and <b>SET</b> commands.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The system-wide startup file is named psqlrc and is sought in the installation's
  &#x201C;system configuration&#x201D; directory, which is most reliably
  identified by running pg_config --sysconfdir. By default this directory will
  be ../etc/ relative to the directory containing the PostgreSQL executables.
  The name of this directory can be set explicitly via the <b>PGSYSCONFDIR</b>
  environment variable.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The user's personal startup file is named .psqlrc and is sought in the invoking
  user's home directory. On Windows, which lacks such a concept, the personal
  startup file is named %APPDATA%\postgresql\psqlrc.conf. The location of the
  user's startup file can be set explicitly via the <b>PSQLRC</b> environment
  variable.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Both the system-wide startup file and the user's personal startup file can be
  made psql-version-specific by appending a dash and the PostgreSQL major or
  minor release number to the file name, for example ~/.psqlrc-9.2 or
  ~/.psqlrc-9.2.5. The most specific version-matching file will be read in
  preference to a non-version-specific file.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
.psql_history
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The command-line history is stored in the file
  ~/.psql_history, or %APPDATA%\postgresql\psql_history on Windows.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The location of the history file can be set explicitly via the
  <b>PSQL_HISTORY</b> environment variable.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;In an earlier life psql allowed the
  first argument of a single-letter backslash command to start directly after
  the command, without intervening whitespace. As of PostgreSQL 8.4 this is no
  longer allowed.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;psql is only guaranteed to work
  smoothly with servers of the same version. That does not mean other
  combinations will fail outright, but subtle and not-so-subtle problems might
  come up. Backslash commands are particularly likely to fail if the server is
  of a newer version than psql itself. However, backslash commands of the \d
  family should work with servers of versions back to 7.4, though not
  necessarily with servers newer than psql itself.</div>

psql is built as a &#x201C;console application&#x201D;. Since the Windows
  console windows use a different encoding than the rest of the system, you must
  take special care when using 8-bit characters within psql. If psql detects a
  problematic console code page, it will warn you at startup. To change the
  console code page, two things are necessary:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;Set the code page by entering
  <b>cmd.exe /c chcp 1252</b>. (1252 is a code page that is appropriate for
  German; replace it with your value.) If you are using Cygwin, you can put this
  command in /etc/profile.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">&#x2022;Set the console font to Lucida
  Console, because the raster font does not work with the ANSI code page.</div>

The first example shows how to spread a command over several lines of input.
  Notice the changing prompt:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
testdb=&gt;  <b>CREATE TABLE my_table (</b>
testdb(&gt;  <b> first integer not null default 0,</b>
testdb(&gt;  <b> second text)</b>
testdb-&gt;  <b>;</b>
CREATE TABLE
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Now look at the table definition again:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
testdb=&gt;  <b>\d my_table</b>
             Table &quot;my_table&quot;
 Attribute |  Type   |      Modifier
-----------+---------+--------------------
 first     | integer | not null default 0
 second    | text    |
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Now we change the prompt to something more interesting:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
testdb=&gt;  <b>\set PROMPT1 '%n@%m %~%R%# '</b>
peter@localhost testdb=&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Let's assume you have filled the table with data and want to take a look at it:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
peter@localhost testdb=&gt; SELECT * FROM my_table;
 first | second
-------+--------
     1 | one
     2 | two
     3 | three
     4 | four
(4 rows)
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can display tables in different ways by using the <b>\pset</b> command:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
peter@localhost testdb=&gt;  <b>\pset border 2</b>
Border style is 2.
peter@localhost testdb=&gt;  <b>SELECT * FROM my_table;</b>
+-------+--------+
| first | second |
+-------+--------+
|     1 | one    |
|     2 | two    |
|     3 | three  |
|     4 | four   |
+-------+--------+
(4 rows)
<div class="Pp"></div>
peter@localhost testdb=&gt;  <b>\pset border 0</b>
Border style is 0.
peter@localhost testdb=&gt;  <b>SELECT * FROM my_table;</b>
first second
----- ------
    1 one
    2 two
    3 three
    4 four
(4 rows)
<div class="Pp"></div>
peter@localhost testdb=&gt;  <b>\pset border 1</b>
Border style is 1.
peter@localhost testdb=&gt;  <b>\pset format unaligned</b>
Output format is unaligned.
peter@localhost testdb=&gt;  <b>\pset fieldsep &quot;,&quot;</b>
Field separator is &quot;,&quot;.
peter@localhost testdb=&gt;  <b>\pset tuples_only</b>
Showing only tuples.
peter@localhost testdb=&gt;  <b>SELECT second, first FROM my_table;</b>
one,1
two,2
three,3
four,4
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Alternatively, use the short commands:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
peter@localhost testdb=&gt;  <b>\a \t \x</b>
Output format is aligned.
Tuples only is off.
Expanded display is on.
peter@localhost testdb=&gt;  <b>SELECT * FROM my_table;</b>
-[ RECORD 1 ]-
first  | 1
second | one
-[ RECORD 2 ]-
first  | 2
second | two
-[ RECORD 3 ]-
first  | 3
second | three
-[ RECORD 4 ]-
first  | 4
second | four
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<table class="foot">
  <tr>
    <td class="foot-date">2016-08-08</td>
    <td class="foot-os">PostgreSQL 9.2.18</td>
