<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rollerd - DNSSEC-Tools daemon to manage DNSSEC key
rollover</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rollerd [-options] -rrfile &lt;rollrec_file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The rollerd daemon manages key rollover for zones. rollerd
is just a scheduler for zone rollover; it uses zonesigner to
perform the actual key generation, zone signing, and key
<br>
manipulation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rollerd manages both KSK and ZSK
rollover, though only one rollover type per zone may take
place at a time. Initiation of KSK rollovers takes
precedence over the initiation of <br>
ZSK rollovers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rollerd uses two methods of key
rollover. The Pre-Publish Method of key rollover is used for
ZSK key rollovers. The Double Signature Method of key
rollover is used for KSK <br>
rollovers. These methods are described more fully below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rollerd maintains zone rollover
state in files called rollrec files; zone/key mappings are
stored in keyrec files. rollerd only modifies rollrec files.
For the most part, <br>
rollerd does not modify keyrec directly, but relies on
zonesigner to update those files as needed. (The exceptions
where rollerd modifies keyrec files. At start-up, it will
<br>
mark each managed zone&rsquo;s keyrec file to indicate the
zone is under rollerd&rsquo;s control. During the course of
rollover, rollerd will also update a zone&rsquo;s rollover
times in its <br>
keyrec file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The administrator may control
rollerd with the rollctl command. A large number of commands
are available to control and modify rollerd&rsquo;s
operation, as well as to retrieve <br>
information about rollover and daemon status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The zone administrator will need
to update their zone files periodically. If rollerd is
managing zones, then problems could arise if modified zones
were signed without rollerd&rsquo;s <br>
knowledge. To prevent such problems, rollerd can be
configured to automatically re-sign a zone when its zonefile
is found to be newer than its corresponding signed zonefile.
<br>
(The files&rsquo; &quot;last modification&quot; timestamps
are compared.) The zone will be re-signed without any other
rollover actions taking place, so no new keys will be
generated, no key <br>
rollovers will occur, and the various rollover timers will
be unaffected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rollerd will perform these
re-signs by default, but this can be further controlled by
the autosign configuration parameter and rollerd&rsquo;s
-autosign/-noautosign command line <br>
options. If rollerd is configured to not perform automatic
re-signing, the administrator can still get this controlled
behavior by use of the zonesigner or rollctl commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the rollrec file does not
exist or is of zero length, rollerd will give an error
message and continue running. It will periodically wake up
and check for a usable rollrec <br>
file. Once it finds the specified rollrec file exists and
isn&rsquo;t empty, then it will proceed with normal rollover
management.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZSK Rollover Using the
Pre-Publish Method <br>
The Pre-Publish Method has four phases that are entered when
it is time to perform ZSK rollover:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. wait for old zone data to
expire from caches <br>
2. sign the zone with the KSK and Published ZSK <br>
3. wait for old zone data to expire from caches <br>
4. adjust keys in keyrec and sign the zone with new Current
ZSK</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rollerd uses the zonesigner
command during ZSK rollover phases 2 and 4. zonesigner will
generate keys as required and sign the zone during these two
phases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Pre-Publish Method of key
rollover is defined in the Step-by-Step DNS Security
Operator Guidance Document. See that document for more
detailed information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KSK Rollover Using the Double
Signature Method <br>
The Double Signature Method has seven phases that are
entered when it is time to perform KSK rollover:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 - wait for cache data to
expire <br>
2 - generate a new (published) KSK and load zone <br>
3 - wait for the old DNSKEY RRset to expire from caches <br>
4 - transfer new keyset to the parent <br>
5 - wait for parent to publish DS record <br>
6 - wait for cache data to expire <br>
7 - roll the KSKs and load the zone</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a modification of the
original Double Signature Method. In the original method,
the KSK keys were rolled before the new keyset was
transferred to the parent. The new <br>
method rolls the KSK keys after the parent has published the
new DS records and old data has expired for caches. This
addresses a potential problem with signing zones during key
<br>
rollovers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rollerd uses the zonesigner
command during KSK rollover phases 2 and 7. zonesigner will
generate keys as required and sign the zone during these two
phases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, leaving the waiting
period in step 5 is handled manually. In step 4, rollerd
informs the administrator via email that the zone&rsquo;s
keyset must be transferred to its <br>
parent in order for rollover to continue. In step 5, after
the keyset has been transferred to the parent and the parent
has published a new DS record, the administrator uses <br>
rollctl to inform rollerd that the DS record has been
published and rollover may continue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Double Signature Method of
key rollover is defined in the Step-by-Step DNS Security
Operator Guidance Document. See that document for more
detailed information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KSK Rollover Using the Double
Signature Method and RFC5011 <br>
RFC5011 describes how remote-validating resolvers must track
KSK changes within a zone. If configured for RFC5011
behavior, rollerd and zonesigner add an extra-long period of
<br>
time between the point a new KSK is created and published
and the point where the actual switch to using it takes
place. RFC5011 specifies that remote validators should add a
<br>
&quot;hold-down timer&quot; to the rollover process, such
that the new key is not added as a trust-anchor until 30
days have past. Thus, rollerd will wait for 60 days (by
default) during <br>
phase 3 of the KSK rollover process if the
&quot;istrustanchor&quot; field of the rollrec definition
has been set to either 1 or &quot;yes&quot;. To wait for a
different length of time other than <br>
60 days, use the holddowntime field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At this time, the other
conventions of RFC5011 are not being followed. Specifically,
it&rsquo;s not waiting for a while before removing the old
key and it&rsquo;s not adding the revoke bit <br>
to the old key after switching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Site-Specific Rollover Actions
<br>
An administrator can specify site-specific commands to be
run during the various rollover phases. The commands can be
run in place of the default rollerd rollover actions, or in
<br>
addition to them. This subsection describes how to make use
of site-specific rollover actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This capability is provided to
allow different installations to handle rollover according
to their specific needs. For example, it is anticipated that
this might be helpful to <br>
sites using HSM hardware, or to allow for enhanced reporting
to administrators. This has been used with simple test
programs to ensure that it actually works. However, it has
<br>
not yet been used in actual HSM environment or with other
production-level software replacements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the ZSK Rollover Using the
Pre-Publish Method and KSK Rollover Using the Double
Signature Method sections for descriptions of the default
rollover actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: This has the potential
of being a dangerous capability. Be very careful when
setting up and using it. Take care with the site-specific
commands to be executed and the <br>
permissions and ownership of rollerd and its data files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DNSSEC-Tools Configuration File
Changes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DNSSEC-Tools configuration
file must be modified to tell rollerd what must be run for
the non-default rollover phase actions. Key/value pairs may
be set for each rollover <br>
phase to control how that phase differs from the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value portion of the
configuration entry contains the path to the site-specific
phase command, along with any arguments it might need.
Multiple commands are separated by <br>
bangs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reserved default command
tells rollerd to use its normal rollover action for a
particular phase. This may be combined with other commands
to provide things such as <br>
specialized logging or notifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rollerd will only alter the
behavior of a rollover phase if the configuration file
contains an entry for that phase. If not, the default action
will be taken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, this configuration
line tells rollerd that for ZSK rollover phase 2, instead of
using its normal zonesigner executions it should run the
hsm-signer command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prog-zsk2 hsm-signer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, this
configuration line informs rollerd that when entering KSK
rollover phase 1 and ZSK rollover phase 1, it should execute
the log-and-mail command, then use <br>
the normal rollover action for those phases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prog-ksk1
/usr/local/sbin/log-and-mail mary ! default <br>
prog-zsk1 /usr/local/sbin/log-and-mail bob!default</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following configuration keys
are used for controlling KSK rollover phases: prog-ksk1,
prog-ksk2, prog-ksk3, prog-ksk4, prog-ksk5, prog-ksk6, and
prog-ksk7,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following configuration keys
are used for controlling ZSK rollover phases: prog-zsk1,
prog-zsk2, prog-zsk3, and prog-zsk4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The prog-normal configuration
key controls the normal, non-rollover state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Site-Specific Commands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To be generally useful, the
site-specific commands executed by rollerd will be given a
standard set of arguments, and a standard set of exit values
will be recognized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standard arguments from
rollerd are: <br>
1. zonename - Zone to be handled. <br>
2. phase - Zone&rsquo;s current rollover phase (e.g., zsk1,
ksk6, normal.) <br>
3. rollrec name - Zone&rsquo;s entry key in the rollrec
file. <br>
4. rollrec file - The path to the rollrec file. <br>
5. keyrec file - The path to the zone&rsquo;s keyrec
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The prog-phase entry in the
configuration file may specify additional options and
arguments for a command. These will be included on the
execution command line prior to the <br>
standard arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standard exit values
expected by rollerd are: <br>
0. The zone can move to the next rollover phase. <br>
This is only applicable to the current command; other <br>
commands in this phase&rsquo;s command list must still be
run. <br>
1. The zone should stay in the current rollover phase. <br>
This is not necessarily the result of an error. <br>
2. An error was found in the arguments given to the command.
<br>
3. An error was encountered during execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a rollover phase&rsquo;s
configuration entry lists multiple commands, they will be
executed in the order listed. If any command in that command
list fails, processing stops there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rp-wrapper command shows how
a site-specific command may be written. rp-wrapper may be
used as a skeleton on which to build a more useful
rollover-phase command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Considerations for Site-Specific
Commands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following should be taken
into consideration when writing a site-specific command for
a rollover phase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">execution length <br>
A phase command should not execute very long. As currently
written, rollerd serializes zone rollover. So the longer a
phase command takes to execute, the longer it will <br>
take to get to the next zone. If a phase command sleeps or
actively waits, so to speak, for the next phase timeout,
then every zone rollerd manages will be left waiting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">follow interface guidelines <br>
Follow the standards for arguments and exit values. Not
following the standards is likely to negatively affect zone
rollover.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">frequency of command execution
<br>
If rollerd is operating in its traditional &quot;full
list&quot; processing mode, a phase command list will be
executed every time rollerd cycles through its zone list and
a zone is in <br>
that particular command&rsquo;s phase. For example, if
&lt;i&gt;prog_zsk1&lt;/i&gt; is defined for example.com,
that command list will be executed for example.com every
time rollerd runs its <br>
zone list and finds example.com is in the ZSK phase 1
rollover state. A phase command must take this into account
so it doesn&rsquo;t perform its actions more frequently than
<br>
necessary. This is most likely an issue for the various
rollover wait states, and possibly the normal state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If rollerd is operating in the
experimental &quot;soon queue&quot; processing mode, a phase
command list will be executed for a zone only when a phase
change occurs. Since phase <br>
changes are time queued, this should not happen more than
once per phase. A phase command should take this into
account, in case the soon queue is reordered before the zone
<br>
leaves the queue, or queue timing is relatively swift. This
is most likely an issue for the various rollover wait
states.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: &quot;soon queue&quot;
processing is experimental. Care should be taken when using
this processing method, as it may still have some lingering
bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zone Reloading <br>
rollerd has the opportunity to inform the DNS daemon to
reload a zone in KSK phase 2, KSK phase 7, ZSK phase 2, and
ZSK phase 4. This is the rollerd&rsquo;s default behavior.
<br>
However, there are situations where this shouldn&rsquo;t be
done, such as for off-line signing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The roll_loadzone field of the
DNSSEC-Tools configuration file is a boolean field that
overrides the default to force the zone-reload behavior
either on or off. This field takes <br>
precedence over the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, the -noreload option
prevents rollerd from requesting a zone reload, and it takes
precedence over the roll_loadzone configuration field and
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rollrec Files <br>
The zones to be managed by rollerd are described in a
rollrec file. Generally speaking most people will want to
use the rollinit command to create an initial rollrec file
<br>
instead of typing their own from scratch. See the
INITIALIZATION AND USAGE section below and the rollinit
manual page for details. Each zone&rsquo;s entry contains
data needed by <br>
rollerd and some data useful to a user. Below is a sample
rollrec entry:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">roll &quot;example.com&quot;
<br>
zonename &quot;example.com&quot; <br>
zonefile &quot;example.com.signed&quot; <br>

# optional records for RFC5011 rolling: <br>
istrustanchor &quot;no&quot; <br>
holddowntime &quot;60D&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first line gives the rollrec
entry&rsquo;s name. The name distinguishes it from other
rollrec entries and must be unique. This may be the
zone&rsquo;s name, but this is not a <br>
requirement. The following lines give the zone&rsquo;s name,
the zone&rsquo;s signed zone file, keyrec file, the current
rollover phases, the rollover timestamps, and other
information. <br>
The zone group is optional and allows a set of related zones
to be controlled with a single rollctl execution, rather
than one execution per zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If either of the zonefile or
keyrec files do not exist, then a &quot;roll&quot; rollrec
will be changed into a &quot;skip&quot; rollrec. That record
will not be processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A more detailed explanation may
be found in rollrec(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Directories <br>
rollerd&rsquo;s execution directory is either the directory
in which it is executed or the directory passed in the
-directory command-line option. Any files used by rollerd
that were <br>
not specified with absolute paths use this directory as
their base.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A rollrec file&rsquo;s directory
field informs rollerd where the zone&rsquo;s files may be
found. For that zone, rollerd will move into that directory,
then return to its execution <br>
directory when it finishes rollover operations for that
zone. If the directory value is a relative path, it will be
appended to rollerd&rsquo;s execution directory. If the
directory <br>
value is an absolute path, it will be used as is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controlling rollerd with rollctl
<br>
The rollctl command is used to control the behavior of
rollerd. A number of commands are available, such as
starting or stopping rollover for a selected zone or all
zones, <br>
turning on or off a GUI rollover display, and halting
rollerd execution. The communications path between rollerd
and rollctl is operating system-dependent. On Unix-like <br>
systems, it is a Unix pipe that should only be writable by
the user which runs rollerd. A more detailed explanation of
rollctl may be found in rollctl(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Note About Files and Filenames
<br>
There are a number of files and filenames used by rollerd
and zonesigner. The user must be aware of the files used by
these programs, where the files are located, and where the
<br>
programs are executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, rollerd will change
directory to the DNSSEC-Tools directory, though this may be
changed by the -directory option. Any programs started by
rollerd, most importantly <br>
zonesigner, will run in this same directory. If files and
directories referenced by these programs are named with
relative paths, those paths must be relative to this
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rollrec entry name is used
as a key to the rollrec file and to the zone&rsquo;s keyrec
file. This entry does not have to be the name of the
entry&rsquo;s domain, but it is a very good <br>
idea to make it so. Whatever is used for this entry name,
the same name must be used for the zone keyrec in that
zone&rsquo;s keyrec file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is probably easiest to store
rollrec files, keyrec files, zone files, and key files in a
single directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INITIALIZATION AND USAGE <br>
The following steps must be taken to initialize and use
rollerd. This assumes that zone files have been created, and
that BIND and DNSSEC-Tools have been installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0. sign zones <br>
The zones to be managed by rollerd must be signed. Use
zonesigner to create the signed zone files and the keyrec
files needed by rollerd. The rollrec file created in the
<br>
next step must use the keyrec file names and the signed zone
file names created here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This step is optional. If it is
bypassed, then (in step 4 and later) rollerd will perform
the initial key creation and zone signing of your zones
using the defaults found in <br>
the DNSSEC-Tools configuration file. rollerd determines if
it must perform these initial operations by whether it can
find the keyrec file for a zone (as specified in the <br>
rollrec file. If it can&rsquo;t, it performs the initial
operations; if it can, it assumes the zone&rsquo;s initial
operations have been performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. create rollrec file <br>
Before rollerd may be used, a rollrec file must first be
created. While this file may be built by hand, the rollinit
command was written specifically to build the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. select operational parameters
<br>
A number of rollerd&rsquo;s operational parameters are taken
from the DNSSEC-Tools configuration file. However, these may
be overridden by command-line options. See the OPTIONS <br>
section below for more details. If non-standard parameters
are desired to always be used, the appropriate fields in the
DNSSEC-Tools configuration file may be modified to <br>
use these values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. install the rollover
configuration <br>
The complete rollover configuration -- rollerd, rollrec
file, DNSSEC-Tools configuration file values, zone files --
should be installed. The appropriate places for these <br>
locations are both installation-dependent and operating
system-dependent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. test the rollover
configuration <br>
The complete rollover configuration should be tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Edit the zone files so that
their zones have short TTL values. A minute TTL should be
sufficient. Test rollovers of this speed should only be done
in a test environment <br>
without the real signed zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run the following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rollerd -rrfile test.rollrec
-logfile - -loglevel info -sleep 60</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command assumes the test
rollrec file is test.rollrec. It writes a fair amount of log
messages to the terminal, and checks its queue every 60
seconds. Follow the <br>
messages to ensure that the appropriate actions, as required
by the Pre-Publish Method, are taking place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. set rollerd to start at boot
<br>
Once the configuration is found to work, rollerd should be
set to start at system boot. The actual operations required
for this step are operating system-dependent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. reboot and verify <br>
The system should be rebooted and the rollerd logfile
checked to ensure that rollerd is operating properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
There are a number of operational parameters that define how
rollerd works. These parameters define things such as the
rollrec file, the logging level, and the log file. These
<br>
parameters can be set in the DNSSEC-Tools configuration file
or given as options on the rollerd command line. The command
line options override values in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-alwayssign <br>
Tells rollerd to sign the zones that aren&rsquo;t in the
middle of being rolled. This allows rollerd to refresh
signed zone signatures and allows complete management of
zone <br>
signing to be taken over by rollerd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The downside to using this
option is that all the non-rolling zones will be signed
after every sleep, which may be expensive
computationally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The zone files are not
updated or installed at this time. Manual copying and
installation are still needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-autosign | -noautosign <br>
Automatic zone-signing flag. If this is set, then a
zone&rsquo;s zonefile will be re-signed (and only re-signed)
if it is found to be newer than the corresponding signed
zonefile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-directory dir <br>
Sets the rollerd execution directory. This must be a valid
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display <br>
Starts the blinkenlights graphical display program to show
the status of zones managed by rollerd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dtconfig config_file <br>
Name of an alternate DNSSEC-Tools configuration file to be
processed. If specified, this configuration file is used in
place of the normal DNSSEC-Tools configuration file <br>
not in addition to it. Also, it will be handled prior to
keyrec files, rollrec files, and command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-foreground <br>
Run in the foreground and do not fork into a daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-logfile log_file <br>
Sets the rollerd log file to log_file. This must be a valid
logging file, meaning that if log_file already exists, it
must be a regular file. The only exceptions to this <br>
are if logfile is /dev/stdout, /dev/tty, -. Of these three,
using a log_file of - is preferable since Perl will properly
convert the - to the process&rsquo; standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-loglevel level <br>
Sets rollerd&rsquo;s logging level to level. rollmgr.pm(3)
contains a list of the valid logging levels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noreload <br>
Prevents rollerd from telling the DNS daemon to reload
zones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-parameters <br>
Prints a set of rollerd parameters and then exits. This
shows the parameters with which rollerd will execute, but
very little parameter validation is performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pidfile pid_file <br>
Stores the running process PID into pid_file. This defaults
to /var/run/rollerd.pid on most systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rrfile rollrec_file <br>
Name of the rollrec file to be processed. This is the only
required &quot;option&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-realm realm_name <br>
Name of the realm in which rollerd is running. This is for
use with the DNSSEC-Tools realms facility as a means of
easily identifying different instantiations of rollerd. <br>
It is informational only (e.g., ps output and log files) and
is not used for anything else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-singlerun <br>
Processes all needed steps once and exits. This is not the
ideal way to run rollerd, but it is potentially useful for
environments where keying material is only available <br>
when specific hardware tokens have been made available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The timing between the steps
will be potentially longer since the time between rollerd
runs is dependent on when rollerd is executed.
&quot;cmd&quot; lines must be added to the <br>
rollrec file to do particular actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following lines should serve
as examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cmd &quot;rollzsk
example.com&quot; <br>
cmd &quot;rollksk example.com&quot; <br>
cmd &quot;dspub example.com&quot; # (for when the parent
publishes <br>
# the new ksk)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -singlerun option implicitly
implies -foreground as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sleep sleeptime <br>
Sets rollerd&rsquo;s sleep time to sleeptime. The sleep time
is the amount of time (in seconds) rollerd waits between
processing its rollrec-based queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-username username <br>
username is the user for which the rollerd daemon will be
executed. The rollerd process&rsquo; effective uid will be
set to the uid corresponding to username.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If username is a username, it
must correspond to a valid uid; if it is a uid, it must
correspond to a valid username.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If rollerd does not have the
appropriate O/S magic (e.g., for Unix, installed as setuid
program and owned by root) then it will only be able to
switch to those users to which <br>
the executing user has privilege to switch. This restriction
is dependent on the operating system and the manner by which
rollerd is installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using this option, the
target user must have access to the various directories,
logs, and data files that rollerd requires to execute.
Without this access, proper <br>
execution cannot occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-zsargs arglist <br>
Additional zonesigner arguments that will be passed to all
zonesigner executions. These arguments will override the
corresponding arguments in the DNSSEC-Tools configuration
<br>
file, and the zones&rsquo; keyrec files. If a zone&rsquo;s
rollrec entry contains a zsargs field, then it will be used
instead of those specified by this argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Given the rollerd argument
processing, the new arguments for zonesigner cannot be
specified as expected. Instead, the arguments should be
given in the following manner. The <br>
leading dash should be replaced with an equals sign. If the
option takes an argument, the space that would separate the
option from the option&rsquo;s argument should also be <br>
replaced by an equals sign. If multiple arguments will be
passed via -zsargs, quotes must be used to group them into a
single argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rollerd translates these
arguments to the appropriate format for zonesigner. These
examples should clarify the modifications:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">normal zonesigner option rollerd
-zsargs option <br>
------------------------ ---------------------- <br>
-nokrfile -zsargs =nokrfile <br>
-zskcount 5 -kskcount 3 -zsargs &quot;=zskcount=5
=kskcount=3&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Version <br>
Displays the version information for rollerd and the
DNSSEC-Tools package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help <br>
Display a usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Verbose output will be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASSUMPTIONS <br>
rollerd uses the rndc command to communicate with the BIND
named daemon. Therefore, it assumes that appropriate
measures have been taken so that this communication is
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN PROBLEMS <br>
The following problems (or potential problems) are
known:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Any process that can write to
the rollover socket can send commands to rollerd. This is
probably not a Good Thing.</p>
