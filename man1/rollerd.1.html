rollerd - DNSSEC-Tools daemon to manage DNSSEC key rollover

The <b>rollerd</b> daemon manages key rollover for zones. <b>rollerd</b> is just
  a scheduler for zone rollover; it uses <b>zonesigner</b> to perform the actual
  key generation, zone signing, and key manipulation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>rollerd</b> manages both KSK and ZSK rollover, though only one rollover type
  per zone may take place at a time. Initiation of KSK rollovers takes
  precedence over the initiation of ZSK rollovers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>rollerd</b> uses two methods of key rollover. The Pre-Publish Method of key
  rollover is used for ZSK key rollovers. The Double Signature Method of key
  rollover is used for KSK rollovers. These methods are described more fully
  below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>rollerd</b> maintains zone rollover state in files called <i>rollrec</i>
  files; zone/key mappings are stored in <i>keyrec</i> files. <b>rollerd</b>
  only modifies <i>rollrec</i> files. For the most part, <b>rollerd</b> does not
  modify <i>keyrec</i> directly, but relies on <b>zonesigner</b> to update those
  files as needed. (The exceptions where <b>rollerd</b> modifies <i>keyrec</i>
  files. At start-up, it will mark each managed zone's <i>keyrec</i> file to
  indicate the zone is under <b>rollerd</b>'s control. During the course of
  rollover, <b>rollerd</b> will also update a zone's rollover times in its
  <i>keyrec</i> file.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The administrator may control <b>rollerd</b> with the <b>rollctl</b> command. A
  large number of commands are available to control and modify <b>rollerd</b>'s
  operation, as well as to retrieve information about rollover and daemon
  status.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The zone administrator will need to update their zone files periodically. If
  <b>rollerd</b> is managing zones, then problems could arise if modified zones
  were signed without <b>rollerd</b>'s knowledge. To prevent such problems,
  <b>rollerd</b> can be configured to automatically re-sign a zone when its
  zonefile is found to be newer than its corresponding signed zonefile. (The
  files' &quot;last modification&quot; timestamps are compared.) The zone will
  be re-signed without any other rollover actions taking place, so no new keys
  will be generated, no key rollovers will occur, and the various rollover
  timers will be unaffected.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>rollerd</b> will perform these re-signs by default, but this can be further
  controlled by the <i>autosign</i> configuration parameter and <b>rollerd</b>'s
  <b>-autosign</b>/<b>-noautosign</b> command line options. If <b>rollerd</b> is
  configured to not perform automatic re-signing, the administrator can still
  get this controlled behavior by use of the <b>zonesigner</b> or <b>rollctl</b>
  commands.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>rollrec</b> file does not exist or is of zero length, <b>rollerd</b>
  will give an error message and continue running. It will periodically wake up
  and check for a usable <b>rollrec</b> file. Once it finds the specified
  <b>rollrec</b> file exists and isn't empty, then it will proceed with normal
  rollover management.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="ZSK_Rollover_Using_the_Pre-Publish_Method"><a class="selflink" href="#ZSK_Rollover_Using_the_Pre-Publish_Method">ZSK
  Rollover Using the Pre-Publish Method</a></h2>
The Pre-Publish Method has four phases that are entered when it is time to
  perform ZSK rollover:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    1. wait for old zone data to expire from caches
    2. sign the zone with the KSK and Published ZSK
    3. wait for old zone data to expire from caches
    4. adjust keys in keyrec and sign the zone with new Current ZSK
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>rollerd</b> uses the <b>zonesigner</b> command during ZSK rollover phases 2
  and 4. <b>zonesigner</b> will generate keys as required and sign the zone
  during these two phases.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Pre-Publish Method of key rollover is defined in the Step-by-Step DNS
  Security Operator Guidance Document. See that document for more detailed
  information.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="KSK_Rollover_Using_the_Double_Signature_Method"><a class="selflink" href="#KSK_Rollover_Using_the_Double_Signature_Method">KSK
  Rollover Using the Double Signature Method</a></h2>
The Double Signature Method has seven phases that are entered when it is time to
  perform KSK rollover:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    1 - wait for cache data to expire
    2 - generate a new (published) KSK and load zone
    3 - wait for the old DNSKEY RRset to expire from caches
    4 - transfer new keyset to the parent
    5 - wait for parent to publish DS record
    6 - wait for cache data to expire
    7 - roll the KSKs and load the zone
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is a modification of the original Double Signature Method. In the original
  method, the KSK keys were rolled before the new keyset was transferred to the
  parent. The new method rolls the KSK keys after the parent has published the
  new DS records and old data has expired for caches. This addresses a potential
  problem with signing zones during key rollovers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>rollerd</b> uses the <b>zonesigner</b> command during KSK rollover phases 2
  and 7. <b>zonesigner</b> will generate keys as required and sign the zone
  during these two phases.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Currently, leaving the waiting period in step 5 is handled manually. In step 4,
  <b>rollerd</b> informs the administrator via email that the zone's keyset must
  be transferred to its parent in order for rollover to continue. In step 5,
  after the keyset has been transferred to the parent and the parent has
  published a new DS record, the administrator uses <b>rollctl</b> to inform
  <b>rollerd</b> that the DS record has been published and rollover may
  continue.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Double Signature Method of key rollover is defined in the Step-by-Step DNS
  Security Operator Guidance Document. See that document for more detailed
  information.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="KSK_Rollover_Using_the_Double_Signature_Method_and_RFC5011"><a class="selflink" href="#KSK_Rollover_Using_the_Double_Signature_Method_and_RFC5011">KSK
  Rollover Using the Double Signature Method and RFC5011</a></h2>
RFC5011 describes how remote-validating resolvers must track KSK changes within
  a zone. If configured for RFC5011 behavior, <b>rollerd</b> and
  <b>zonesigner</b> add an extra-long period of time between the point a new KSK
  is created and published and the point where the actual switch to using it
  takes place. RFC5011 specifies that remote validators should add a
  &quot;hold-down timer&quot; to the rollover process, such that the new key is
  not added as a trust-anchor until 30 days have past. Thus, <b>rollerd</b> will
  wait for 60 days (by default) during phase 3 of the KSK rollover process if
  the &quot;istrustanchor&quot; field of the <i>rollrec</i> definition has been
  set to either 1 or &quot;yes&quot;. To wait for a different length of time
  other than 60 days, use the <b>holddowntime</b> field.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At this time, the other conventions of RFC5011 are not being followed.
  Specifically, it's not waiting for a while before removing the old key and
  it's not adding the revoke bit to the old key after switching.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Site-Specific_Rollover_Actions"><a class="selflink" href="#Site-Specific_Rollover_Actions">Site-Specific
  Rollover Actions</a></h2>
An administrator can specify site-specific commands to be run during the various
  rollover phases. The commands can be run in place of the default
  <b>rollerd</b> rollover actions, or in addition to them. This subsection
  describes how to make use of site-specific rollover actions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This capability is provided to allow different installations to handle rollover
  according to their specific needs. For example, it is anticipated that this
  might be helpful to sites using HSM hardware, or to allow for enhanced
  reporting to administrators. This has been used with simple test programs to
  ensure that it actually works. However, it has not yet been used in actual HSM
  environment or with other production-level software replacements.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See the <i>ZSK Rollover Using the Pre-Publish Method</i> and <i>KSK Rollover</i>
  <i>Using the Double Signature Method</i> sections for descriptions of the
  default rollover actions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>WARNING:</b> This has the potential of being a dangerous capability. Be
  <i>very</i> careful when setting up and using it. Take care with the
  site-specific commands to be executed and the permissions and ownership of
  <b>rollerd</b> and its data files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>DNSSEC-Tools Configuration File Changes</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The DNSSEC-Tools configuration file must be modified to tell <b>rollerd</b> what
  must be run for the non-default rollover phase actions. Key/value pairs may be
  set for each rollover phase to control how that phase differs from the
  default.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The value portion of the configuration entry contains the path to the
  site-specific phase command, along with any arguments it might need. Multiple
  commands are separated by bangs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The reserved <i>default</i> command tells <b>rollerd</b> to use its normal
  rollover action for a particular phase. This may be combined with other
  commands to provide things such as specialized logging or notifications.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>rollerd</b> will only alter the behavior of a rollover phase if the
  configuration file contains an entry for that phase. If not, the default
  action will be taken.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, this configuration line tells <b>rollerd</b> that for ZSK rollover
  phase 2, instead of using its normal <b>zonesigner</b> executions it should
  run the <b>hsm-signer</b> command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    prog-zsk2        hsm-signer
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In this example, this configuration line informs <b>rollerd</b> that when
  entering KSK rollover phase 1 and ZSK rollover phase 1, it should execute the
  <b>log-and-mail</b> command, then use the normal rollover action for those
  phases.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    prog-ksk1        /usr/local/sbin/log-and-mail mary ! default
    prog-zsk1        /usr/local/sbin/log-and-mail bob!default
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following configuration keys are used for controlling KSK rollover phases:
  <i>prog-ksk1</i>, <i>prog-ksk2</i>, <i>prog-ksk3</i>, <i>prog-ksk4</i>,
  <i>prog-ksk5</i>, <i>prog-ksk6</i>, and <i>prog-ksk7</i>,
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following configuration keys are used for controlling ZSK rollover phases:
  <i>prog-zsk1</i>, <i>prog-zsk2</i>, <i>prog-zsk3</i>, and <i>prog-zsk4</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>prog-normal</i> configuration key controls the normal, non-rollover
  state.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Site-Specific Commands</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To be generally useful, the site-specific commands executed by <b>rollerd</b>
  will be given a standard set of arguments, and a standard set of exit values
  will be recognized.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The standard arguments from <b>rollerd</b> are:
<br/>
 1. zonename - Zone to be handled.
<br/>
 2. phase - Zone's current rollover phase (e.g., zsk1, ksk6, normal.)
<br/>
 3. rollrec name - Zone's entry key in the rollrec file.
<br/>
 4. rollrec file - The path to the rollrec file.
<br/>
 5. keyrec file - The path to the zone's keyrec file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>prog-phase</i> entry in the configuration file may specify additional
  options and arguments for a command. These will be included on the execution
  command line <i>prior</i> to the standard arguments.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The standard exit values expected by <b>rollerd</b> are:
<br/>
 0. The zone can move to the next rollover phase.
<br/>
 This is only applicable to the current command; other
<br/>
 commands in this phase's command list must still be run.
<br/>
 1. The zone should stay in the current rollover phase.
<br/>
 This is not necessarily the result of an error.
<br/>
 2. An error was found in the arguments given to the command.
<br/>
 3. An error was encountered during execution.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a rollover phase's configuration entry lists multiple commands, they will be
  executed in the order listed. If any command in that command list fails,
  processing stops there.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>rp-wrapper</b> command shows how a site-specific command may be written.
  <b>rp-wrapper</b> may be used as a skeleton on which to build a more useful
  rollover-phase command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Considerations for Site-Specific Commands</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following should be taken into consideration when writing a site-specific
  command for a rollover phase.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">execution length</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A phase command should not execute very long. As currently
      written, <b>rollerd</b> serializes zone rollover. So the longer a phase
      command takes to execute, the longer it will take to get to the next zone.
      If a phase command sleeps or actively waits, so to speak, for the next
      phase timeout, then every zone <b>rollerd</b> manages will be left
      waiting.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">follow interface guidelines</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Follow the standards for arguments and exit values. Not
      following the standards is likely to negatively affect zone rollover.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">frequency of command execution</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If <b>rollerd</b> is operating in its traditional
      &quot;full list&quot; processing mode, a phase command list will be
      executed every time <b>rollerd</b> cycles through its zone list and a zone
      is in that particular command's phase. For example, if
      &lt;i&gt;prog_zsk1&lt;/i&gt; is defined for example.com, that command list
      will be executed for example.com every time <b>rollerd</b> runs its zone
      list and finds example.com is in the ZSK phase 1 rollover state. A phase
      command <b>must</b> take this into account so it doesn't perform its
      actions more frequently than necessary. This is most likely an issue for
      the various rollover wait states, and possibly the normal state.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If <b>rollerd</b> is operating in the experimental &quot;soon queue&quot;
      processing mode, a phase command list will be executed for a zone only
      when a phase change occurs. Since phase changes are time queued, this
      should not happen more than once per phase. A phase command <b>should</b>
      take this into account, in case the soon queue is reordered before the
      zone leaves the queue, or queue timing is relatively swift. This is most
      likely an issue for the various rollover wait states.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>WARNING:</b> &quot;soon queue&quot; processing is <i>experimental</i>.
      Care should be taken when using this processing method, as it may still
      have some lingering bugs.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Zone_Reloading"><a class="selflink" href="#Zone_Reloading">Zone
  Reloading</a></h2>
<b>rollerd</b> has the opportunity to inform the DNS daemon to reload a zone in
  KSK phase 2, KSK phase 7, ZSK phase 2, and ZSK phase 4. This is the
  <b>rollerd</b>'s default behavior. However, there are situations where this
  shouldn't be done, such as for off-line signing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>roll_loadzone</b> field of the DNSSEC-Tools configuration file is a
  boolean field that overrides the default to force the zone-reload behavior
  either on or off. This field takes precedence over the default.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Similarly, the <b>-noreload</b> option prevents <b>rollerd</b> from requesting a
  zone reload, and it takes precedence over the <b>roll_loadzone</b>
  configuration field and the default.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="rollrec_Files"><a class="selflink" href="#rollrec_Files"><i>rollrec</i>
  Files</a></h2>
The zones to be managed by <b>rollerd</b> are described in a <i>rollrec</i>
  file. Generally speaking most people will want to use the <b>rollinit</b>
  command to create an initial <i>rollrec</i> file instead of typing their own
  from scratch. See the INITIALIZATION AND USAGE section below and the
  <b>rollinit</b> manual page for details. Each zone's entry contains data
  needed by <b>rollerd</b> and some data useful to a user. Below is a sample
  <i>rollrec</i> entry:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        roll &quot;example.com&quot;
                zonename        &quot;example.com&quot;
                zonefile        &quot;example.com.signed&quot;
                keyrec          &quot;example.com.krf&quot;

</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first line gives the <i>rollrec</i> entry's name. The name distinguishes it
  from other <i>rollrec</i> entries and must be unique. This may be the zone's
  name, but this is not a requirement. The following lines give the zone's name,
  the zone's signed zone file, <i>keyrec</i> file, the current rollover phases,
  the rollover timestamps, and other information. The zone group is optional and
  allows a set of related zones to be controlled with a single <b>rollctl</b>
  execution, rather than one execution per zone.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If either of the <i>zonefile</i> or <i>keyrec</i> files do not exist, then a
  &quot;roll&quot; <i>rollrec</i> will be changed into a &quot;skip&quot;
  <i>rollrec</i>. That record will not be processed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A more detailed explanation may be found in <i></i><i>rollrec</i><i>(5)</i>.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Directories"><a class="selflink" href="#Directories">Directories</a></h2>
<b>rollerd</b>'s execution directory is either the directory in which it is
  executed or the directory passed in the <b>-directory</b> command-line option.
  Any files used by <b>rollerd</b> that were not specified with absolute paths
  use this directory as their base.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A <i>rollrec</i> file's <i>directory</i> field informs <b>rollerd</b> where the
  zone's files may be found. For that zone, <b>rollerd</b> will move into that
  directory, then return to its execution directory when it finishes rollover
  operations for that zone. If the <i>directory</i> value is a relative path, it
  will be appended to <b>rollerd</b>'s execution directory. If the
  <i>directory</i> value is an absolute path, it will be used as is.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Controlling_rollerd_with_rollctl"><a class="selflink" href="#Controlling_rollerd_with_rollctl">Controlling
  <b>rollerd</b> with <b>rollctl</b></a></h2>
The <b>rollctl</b> command is used to control the behavior of <b>rollerd</b>. A
  number of commands are available, such as starting or stopping rollover for a
  selected zone or all zones, turning on or off a GUI rollover display, and
  halting <b>rollerd</b> execution. The communications path between
  <b>rollerd</b> and <b>rollctl</b> is operating system-dependent. On Unix-like
  systems, it is a Unix pipe that should <b>only</b> be writable by the user
  which runs <i>rollerd</i>. A more detailed explanation of <b>rollctl</b> may
  be found in <i></i><i>rollctl</i><i>(8)</i>.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="A_Note_About_Files_and_Filenames"><a class="selflink" href="#A_Note_About_Files_and_Filenames">A
  Note About Files and Filenames</a></h2>
There are a number of files and filenames used by <b>rollerd</b> and
  <b>zonesigner</b>. The user must be aware of the files used by these programs,
  where the files are located, and where the programs are executed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, <b>rollerd</b> will change directory to the DNSSEC-Tools directory,
  though this may be changed by the <b>-directory</b> option. Any programs
  started by <b>rollerd</b>, most importantly <b>zonesigner</b>, will run in
  this same directory. If files and directories referenced by these programs are
  named with relative paths, those paths must be relative to this directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>rollrec</i> entry name is used as a key to the <i>rollrec</i> file and to
  the zone's <i>keyrec</i> file. This entry does not have to be the name of the
  entry's domain, but it is a very good idea to make it so. Whatever is used for
  this entry name, the same name <b>must</b> be used for the zone <i>keyrec</i>
  in that zone's <i>keyrec</i> file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is probably easiest to store <i>rollrec</i> files, <i>keyrec</i> files, zone
  files, and key files in a single directory.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INITIALIZATION_AND_USAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#INITIALIZATION_AND_USAGE">INITIALIZATION
  AND USAGE</a></h1>
The following steps must be taken to initialize and use <b>rollerd</b>. This
  assumes that zone files have been created, and that BIND and DNSSEC-Tools have
  been installed.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">0. sign zones</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The zones to be managed by <b>rollerd</b> must be signed.
      Use <b>zonesigner</b> to create the signed zone files and the

      the signed zone file names created here.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This step is optional. If it is bypassed, then (in step 4 and later)
      <b>rollerd</b> will perform the initial key creation and zone signing of
      your zones using the defaults found in the DNSSEC-Tools configuration
      file. <b>rollerd</b> determines if it must perform these initial
      operations by whether it can find the <i>keyrec</i> file for a zone (as
      specified in the <i>rollrec</i> file. If it can't, it performs the initial
      operations; if it can, it assumes the zone's initial operations have been

    This command assumes the test <i>rollrec</i> file is <b>test.rollrec</b>. It
      writes a fair amount of log messages to the terminal, and checks its queue
      every 60 seconds. Follow the messages to ensure that the appropriate
      actions, as required by the Pre-Publish Method, are taking place.</dd>

There are a number of operational parameters that define how <b>rollerd</b>
  works. These parameters define things such as the <i>rollrec</i> file, the
  logging level, and the log file. These parameters can be set in the
  DNSSEC-Tools configuration file or given as options on the <b>rollerd</b>
  command line. The command line options override values in the configuration
  file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following options are recognized:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-alwayssign</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Tells <b>rollerd</b> to sign the zones that aren't in the
      middle of being rolled. This allows <b>rollerd</b> to refresh signed zone
      signatures and allows complete management of zone signing to be taken over
      by <b>rollerd</b>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The downside to using this option is that all the non-rolling zones will be
      signed after every sleep, which may be expensive computationally.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note: The zone files are not updated or installed at this time. Manual
      copying and installation are still needed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-autosign</b> | <b>-noautosign</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Automatic zone-signing flag. If this is set, then a zone's
      zonefile will be re-signed (and only re-signed) if it is found to be newer
      than the corresponding signed zonefile.</dd>

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-dtconfig config_file</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Name of an alternate DNSSEC-Tools configuration file to be
      processed. If specified, this configuration file is used <i>in place</i>
      of the normal DNSSEC-Tools configuration file <b>not</b> in addition to

      files, and command-line options.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-logfile log_file</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Sets the <b>rollerd</b> log file to <i>log_file</i>. This
      must be a valid logging file, meaning that if <i>log_file</i> already
      exists, it must be a regular file. The only exceptions to this are if
      <i>logfile</i> is <b>/dev/stdout</b>, <b>/dev/tty</b>, <b>-</b>. Of these
      three, using a <i>log_file</i> of <b>-</b> is preferable since Perl will
      properly convert the <b>-</b> to the process' standard output.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-rrfile rollrec_file</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Name of the <i>rollrec</i> file to be processed. This is
      the only required &quot;option&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-realm realm_name</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Name of the realm in which <b>rollerd</b> is running. This
      is for use with the DNSSEC-Tools realms facility as a means of easily
      identifying different instantiations of <b>rollerd</b>. It is
      informational only (e.g., <b>ps</b> output and log files) and is not used
      for anything else.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-singlerun</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Processes all needed steps once and exits. This is not the
      ideal way to run <b>rollerd</b>, but it is potentially useful for
      environments where keying material is only available when specific
      hardware tokens have been made available.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The timing between the steps will be potentially longer since the time
      between <b>rollerd</b> runs is dependent on when <b>rollerd</b> is
      executed. &quot;cmd&quot; lines must be added to the <i>rollrec</i> file
      to do particular actions.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The following lines should serve as examples:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  cmd &quot;rollzsk example.com&quot;
  cmd &quot;rollksk example.com&quot;
  cmd &quot;dspub example.com&quot;   # (for when the parent publishes
                            # the new ksk)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The <i>-singlerun</i> option implicitly implies <i>-foreground</i> as
    well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-sleep sleeptime</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Sets <b>rollerd</b>'s sleep time to <i>sleeptime</i>. The
      sleep time is the amount of time (in seconds) <b>rollerd</b> waits between
      processing its <i>rollrec</i>-based queue.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-username username</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>username</b> is the user for which the <b>rollerd</b>
      daemon will be executed. The <b>rollerd</b> process' effective uid will be
      set to the uid corresponding to <b>username</b>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If <b>username</b> is a username, it must correspond to a valid uid; if it
      is a uid, it must correspond to a valid username.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If <b>rollerd</b> does not have the appropriate O/S magic (e.g., for Unix,
      installed as <i>setuid</i> program and owned by root) then it will only be
      able to switch to those users to which the executing user has privilege to
      switch. This restriction is dependent on the operating system and the
      manner by which <b>rollerd</b> is installed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When using this option, the target user must have access to the various
      directories, logs, and data files that <b>rollerd</b> requires to execute.
      Without this access, proper execution cannot occur.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-zsargs arglist</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Additional <b>zonesigner</b> arguments that will be passed
      to all <b>zonesigner</b> executions. These arguments will override the
      corresponding arguments in the DNSSEC-Tools configuration file, and the
      zones' <i>keyrec</i> files. If a zone's <b>rollrec</b> entry contains a
      <i>zsargs</i> field, then it will be used instead of those specified by
      this argument.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Given the <b>rollerd</b> argument processing, the new arguments for
      <b>zonesigner</b> cannot be specified as expected. Instead, the arguments
      should be given in the following manner. The leading dash should be
      replaced with an equals sign. If the option takes an argument, the space
      that would separate the option from the option's argument should also be
      replaced by an equals sign. If multiple arguments will be passed via
      <b>-zsargs</b>, quotes must be used to group them into a single argument.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>rollerd</b> translates these arguments to the appropriate format for
      <b>zonesigner</b>. These examples should clarify the modifications:
