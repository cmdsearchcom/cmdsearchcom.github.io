<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ren - rename multiple files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ren [ -d | -k | -a ] [ -v ] [path/]search replacement</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ren renames each file in the current directory (or in the
path directory, if specified) that matches the search
pattern; each matching file&rsquo;s new name is given by the
replacement <br>
pattern. The multiple rename is performed safely, i.e.
without any unexpected deletion of files due to collisions
of replacement names with existing names, or with other <br>
replacement names. Also, all error checking is done prior to
doing any renames, so either all renames are done, or
none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The search pattern is a filename
with embedded wildcards, i.e. * and ?, which have their
usual meanings of, respectively, matching any string of
characters, and matching any sin&acirc; <br>
gle character. The replacement pattern is another filename
with embedded wildcard indexes, each of which consists of
the character # followed by a digit from 1 to 9. In the new
<br>
name of a matching file, the wildcard indexes are replaced
by the actual characters that matched the referenced
wildcards in the original filename. Thus, if the search
pattern <br>
is &quot;abc*.*.*&quot; and the replacement pattern is
&quot;xyz#1.#3&quot;, then &quot;abc.txt.doc&quot; is
renamed to &quot;xyz.doc&quot; (since the first * matched
&quot;&quot;, the second matched &quot;txt&quot;, and the
third <br>
matched &quot;doc&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the shell normally
expands the wildcards * and ?, which in the case of ren is
undesirable. Thus, in most cases it is necessary to enclose
the search pattern in quotes, <br>
e.g. ren &quot;*.a&quot; #1.b. To strip any of the
characters *, ?, and # of their special meaning to ren, as
when the actual replacement name must contain the character
#, precede the <br>
special character with &nbsp;(and enclose the argument in
qoutes because of the shell).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that a path is not allowed
in the replacement pattern. Ren does not allow moving files
between directories, which facilitates the safety checks
next described.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When any two matching files
would have to be renamed to the same new filename, ren
detects the condition prior to doing any renames and aborts
with an error message. Ren also <br>
checks if any file deletes would result from the rename,
i.e. if some file1 would have to be renamed to file2, and
file2 already exists and is not itself being renamed. (Here
<br>
and below, &quot;delete&quot; really means
&quot;unlink&quot;.) In such a case, ren asks you (by
reading a line from standard input) if you really wish file2
to be deleted. If your answer is nega&acirc; <br>
tive, file1 is not renamed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ren safely performs chain
renames, i.e. when file1 is renamed to file2, file2 to
file3, file3 to file4, etc, by doing the renames in the
proper order. In the case that the chain <br>
is a cycle, i.e. filen is renamed back to file1, ren breaks
the cycle by using a temporary name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files beginning with . are not
matched against the search pattern (and thus not renamed)
unless the search pattern explicitly begins with
&rsquo;.&rsquo;. In any case, &quot;.&quot; and
&quot;..&quot; are <br>
never matched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v (verbose): after each rename,
the message &quot;file1 -&gt; file2 [(*)]&quot; appears on
the standard output. The (*) appears in the case of a
deleting rename, i.e. when the old file2 <br>
is deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, -k, -a: suppress
interrogation with regard to deleting renames, and:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d (delete): perform all
deleting renames silently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k (keep): perform no deleting
renames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a (abort): if any deleting
renames are detected, abort prior to doing any renames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If the search pattern is not quoted, the shell expands the
wildcards. Ren then complains that there are too many
arguments (if indeed there are), but can not determine that
the <br>
lack of quotes is the cause.</p>
