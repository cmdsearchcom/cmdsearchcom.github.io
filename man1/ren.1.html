<i>Ren</i> renames each file in the current directory (or in the <i>path</i>
  directory, if specified) that matches the <i>search</i> pattern; each matching
  file's new name is given by the <i>replacement</i> pattern. The multiple
  rename is performed safely, i.e. without any unexpected deletion of files due
  to collisions of replacement names with existing names, or with other
  replacement names. Also, all error checking is done prior to doing any
  renames, so either all renames are done, or none.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The search pattern is a filename with embedded wildcards, i.e. * and ?, which
  have their usual meanings of, respectively, matching any string of characters,
  and matching any single character. The replacement pattern is another filename
  with embedded <i>wildcard</i> <i>indexes</i>, each of which consists of the
  character # followed by a digit from 1 to 9. In the new name of a matching
  file, the wildcard indexes are replaced by the actual characters that matched
  the referenced wildcards in the original filename. Thus, if the search pattern
  is &quot;abc*.*.*&quot; and the replacement pattern is &quot;xyz#1.#3&quot;,
  then &quot;abc.txt.doc&quot; is renamed to &quot;xyz.doc&quot; (since the
  first * matched &quot;&quot;, the second matched &quot;txt&quot;, and the
  third matched &quot;doc&quot;).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the shell normally expands the wildcards * and ?, which in the case of
  <i>ren</i> is undesirable. Thus, in most cases it is necessary to enclose the
  search pattern in quotes, e.g. ren &quot;*.a&quot; #1.b. To strip any of the
  characters *, ?, and # of their special meaning to <i>ren,</i> as when the
  actual replacement name must contain the character #, precede the special
  character with \ (and enclose the argument in qoutes because of the shell).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that a path is not allowed in the replacement pattern. <i>Ren</i> does not
  allow moving files between directories, which facilitates the safety checks
  next described.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When any two matching files would have to be renamed to the same new filename,
  <i>ren</i> detects the condition prior to doing any renames and aborts with an
  error message. <i>Ren</i> also checks if any file deletes would result from
  the rename, i.e. if some file1 would have to be renamed to file2, and file2
  already exists and is not itself being renamed. (Here and below,
  &quot;delete&quot; really means &quot;unlink&quot;.) In such a case,
  <i>ren</i> asks you (by reading a line from standard input) if you really wish
  file2 to be deleted. If your answer is negative, file1 is not renamed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Ren</i> safely performs chain renames, i.e. when file1 is renamed to file2,
  file2 to file3, file3 to file4, etc, by doing the renames in the proper order.
  In the case that the chain is a cycle, i.e. filen is renamed back to file1,
  <i>ren</i> breaks the cycle by using a temporary name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Files beginning with . are not matched against the search pattern (and thus not
  renamed) unless the search pattern explicitly begins with '.'. In any case,
  &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot; are never matched.

      file2 [(*)]&quot; appears on the standard output. The (*) appears in the
      case of a deleting rename, i.e. when the old file2 is deleted.</dd>

If the search pattern is not quoted, the shell expands the wildcards. <i>Ren</i>
  then complains that there are too many arguments (if indeed there are), but
  can not determine that the lack of quotes is the cause.</div>
