<p>UNBUFFER(1) General Commands Manual UNBUFFER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
unbuffer - unbuffer output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
unbuffer program [ args ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION <br>
unbuffer disables the output buffering that occurs when
program output is redirected from non-interactive programs.
For example, suppose you are watching the output from a fifo
<br>
by running it through od and then more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">od -c /tmp/fifo | more</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You will not see anything until
a full page of output has been produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can disable this automatic
buffering as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unbuffer od -c /tmp/fifo |
more</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, unbuffer does not read
from stdin. This simplifies use of unbuffer in some
situations. To use unbuffer in a pipeline, use the -p flag.
Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">process1 | unbuffer -p process2
| process3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
unbuffer -p may appear to work incorrectly if a process
feeding input to unbuffer exits. Consider: <br>
process1 | unbuffer -p process2 | process3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If process1 exits, process2 may
not yet have finished. It is impossible for unbuffer to know
long to wait for process2 and process2 may not ever finish,
for example, if it is a <br>
filter. For expediency, unbuffer simply exits when it
encounters an EOF from either its input or process2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to have a version of
unbuffer that worked in all situations, an oracle would be
necessary. If you want an application-specific solution,
workarounds or hand-coded <br>
Expect may be more suitable. For example, the following
example shows how to allow grep to finish processing when
the cat before it finishes first. Using cat to feed grep
would <br>
never require unbuffer in real life. It is merely a
placeholder for some imaginary process that may or may not
finish. Similarly, the final cat at the end of the pipeline
is <br>
also a placeholder for another process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ cat /tmp/abcdef.log | grep abc
| cat <br>
abcdef <br>
xxxabc defxxx <br>
$ cat /tmp/abcdef.log | unbuffer grep abc | cat <br>
$ (cat /tmp/abcdef.log ; sleep 1) | unbuffer grep abc | cat
<br>
abcdef <br>
xxxabc defxxx <br>
$</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The man page is longer than the program.</p>
