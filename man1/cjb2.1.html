<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cjb2 - Simple DjVuBitonal encoder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cjb2 [options] inputfile outputdjvufile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This is a simple encoder for bitonal files. Argument
inputfile is the name of a PBM or bitonal TIFF file
containing a single document image. This program produces a
DjVuBitonal <br>
file named outputdjvufile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default compression process
is lossless: decoding the DjVuBitonal file at full
resolution will produce an image exactly identical to the
input file. Lossy compression is <br>
enabled by options -losslevel, -lossy, or -clean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-dpi n Specify the resolution information encoded into the
output file expressed in dots per inch. The resolution
information encoded in DjVu files determine how the decoder
<br>
scales the image on a particular display. Meaningful
resolutions range from 25 to 1200. The default resolution
for TIFF files is the resolution is the resolution
speci&acirc; <br>
fied by the input file. The default resolution for PBM files
is 300 dpi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lossless <br>
Ensure that the encoded image is pixel-per-pixel equal to
the initial image. This option is is equivalent to
-losslevel 0 and is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-clean Only remove flyspecks
from the input image. This option enables a heuristic
algorithm that removes very small marks. Such marks are
often causes by noise and dust during <br>
the scanning process. The threshold mark size is chosen
according to the resolution specified with option This
option is is equivalent to -losslevel 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lossy Substitute patterns with
small variations. In addition to the flyspeck removal
heuristic, this option enables an algorithm that encodes
certain characters by simply <br>
replicating the shape of a previously encoded character with
a similar shape. This option is is equivalent to -losslevel
100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-losslevel x <br>
Specify the aggressiveness of the lossy compression. Its
argument ranges from 0 to 200. Higher values generate
smaller files with more potential distortions. Loss level
<br>
0 corresponds to lossless encoding. Loss level 1 performs
image cleaning but does not perform character substitution
at all. Loss level 100 is intended to provide a good <br>
compromise. Higher loss levels provide marginally better
compression at the risk of unacceptable character
substitutions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Display informational messages while running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMARKS <br>
Lossless encoding is competitive with that of the Lizardtech
commercial encoders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lossy encoding has made much
progress thanks to Ilya Mezhirov from the minidjvu project.
This also means that the lossy encoding performance can
change from version to version. <br>
When lossy compression yields inadequate results, simply
revert to only using option -clean or reduce the parameter
of option -losslevel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two features are still
missing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Half-tone detection.
Collecting small marks belonging to half-tone patterns would
improve compression speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Multi-page compression.
Matching characters on several pages would improve the
compression ratios for multi-page documents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CREDITS <br>
This program was initially written by L&Atilde;&copy;on
Bottou &lt;leonb@users.sourceforge.net&gt; and was improved
by Bill Riemers &lt;docbill@sourceforge.net&gt; and many
others. The pattern matching <br>
algorithm for lossy compression was contributed by Ilya
Mezhirov &lt;ilya@mezhirov.mccme.ru&gt;. TIFF input routines
are inspired by the ones contributed by R. Keith Dennis
&lt;den&acirc; <br>
nis@rkd.math.cornell.edu&gt; and Paul Young.</p>
