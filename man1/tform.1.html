<p>FORM(1) General Commands Manual FORM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
form - Symbolic manipulation system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
form [options] file...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c Error checking only. Notice that this will not work
properly if there are conditionals in the preprocessor phase
that depend on results obtained at earlier stages of the
<br>
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Next argument/option is the
name of a preprocessor variable that will be defined before
the run starts. A specific value can be assigned with the
syntax -d VARIABLE&acirc; <br>
NAME=VALUE. The default value is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Same as -d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Output goes only to log
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Output only to log file.
Further like -L or -ll.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Wait for some key to be
touched before finishing the run. Basically only for some
old window based systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Next argument/option is the
path of a directory for include, procedure and subroutine
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Make a regular log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ll Make a log file without
intermediate statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Same as -ll.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Put the PID (process
identifier) in the name of the temporary files. This makes
for longer names, but gives a better guarantee of
uniqueness. If a file with the created <br>
name exists already it will be overwritten. This option is
for when several instances of FORM are started at nearly the
same time as can happen from minos or make (with <br>
the make -j option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Next argument/option is the
path of a directory for input, include, procedure and
subroutine files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pipe Indicates that FORM is
started up as the receiving end of a pipe. Action will be
taken to set up the proper communication channels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet option. Only output
expressions are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Recover from a crash. See the
checkpoint mechanism in 4.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Next argument/option is the
path of a directory for a setup file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-si Same as -q.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Next argument/option is the
name of a setup file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Next argument/option is the
path of a directory for temporary files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Puts FORM in a mode in which
the maximum totalsize is measured and printed at the end of
the program. For more information see the ?..On
TotalSize;?.. statement7.97.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Only the version will be
printed. The program terminates immediately after it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w This should be followed
immediately by a number. The number indicates the number of
worker threads for TFORM. All other versions of FORM ignore
this parameter. It should <br>
be noted that TFORM is a different program. For more
information, please consult chapter 16.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Run only the preprocessor and
dump its output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents briefly the form and tform and
parform commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">form is a symbolic manipulation
system. It reads text files containing definitions of
mathematical expressions as well as statements that tell it
how to manipulate these expres&acirc; <br>
sions. It is widely used in the theoretical particle physics
community, but it is not restricted to applications in this
specific field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tform is the threaded
version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">parform is the parallel version
(MPI).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a complete description,
consult the manual online at
http://www.nikhef.nl/~form/maindir/documentation/reference/online/online.html
or the included PDF.</p>
