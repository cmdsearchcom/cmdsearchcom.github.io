<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
voro++ - a 3D Voronoi cell library</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
voro++ [options] &lt;x_min&gt; &lt;x_max&gt; &lt;y_min&gt;
&lt;y_max&gt; &lt;z_min&gt; &lt;z_max&gt;
&lt;filename&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Voro++ is a software library for carrying out
three-dimensional computations of the Voronoi tessellation.
A distinguishing feature of the Voro++ library is that it
carries out <br>
cell-based calculations, computing the Voronoi cell for each
particle individually, rather than computing the Voronoi
tessellation as a global network of vertices and edges. It
<br>
is particularly well-suited for applications that rely on
cell-based statistics, where features of Voronoi cells ( eg.
volume, centroid, number of faces) can be used to analyze
<br>
a system of particles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Voro++ is written in C++ and can
be built as a static library that can be linked to. This man
page describes a command-line utility that is provided with
the library, which can <br>
be used to access most of the library&rsquo;s functionality.
The utility imports text files of particle positions,
computes the Voronoi cells for them, and then saves text
files con&acirc; <br>
taining various types of information about the Voronoi
cells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE INPUT AND OUTPUT <br>
The input file should have entries on separate lines with
the following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;Numerical ID label&gt; &lt;x
coordinate&gt; &lt;y coordinate&gt; &lt;z coordinate&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the command imports the
particles, any that lie outside the container geometry are
ignored. The program then computes Voronoi cells for all the
particles, and generates an <br>
output file using the same filename but with a
&quot;.vol&quot; suffix, that has the following entries:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;Numerical ID label&gt; &lt;x
coordinate&gt; &lt;y coordinate&gt; &lt;z coordinate&gt;
&lt;Voronoi cell volume&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To compute different statistics
about the Voronoi cells, the -c option can be used to
specify a custom output string. By default, the command
assumes non-periodic boundary condi&acirc; <br>
tions, although this can be modified with the -p option
described below. If periodicity is enabled, then particles
will be re-mapped into the primary domain when the file is
<br>
imported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under normal operation, the
output file should have exactly the same number of lines in
as the input file. However, if particles lie outside the
container geometry, they will be <br>
omitted by the program, and will not appear in the output
file. In certain cases, a Voronoi cell for a valid particle
may be completely deleted ( eg. by a wall cut) and it will
<br>
also not appear in the output file. By default, the
particles in the output file may be ordered differently to
those in the input file, although the original ordering can
be pre&acirc; <br>
served with the -o option described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERNAL COMPUTATIONAL GRID <br>
To carry out the computation, the code divides the
computational box into a grid of equally-sized rectangular
blocks. Particles are internally sorted into this grid for
computa&acirc; <br>
tional efficiency, with maximum performance usually being
achieved when there is an average of 3 to 8 particles per
block. Performance is also improved if the blocks are close
to <br>
cubes, with similar side lengths in three directions. In
general the code is not very sensitive to the block size,
and reasonable performance is achieved over a large range of
<br>
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the code estimates
the grid size to use by counting the number of particles in
the input file and choosing the number of blocks to aim for
a 3 to 8 particles per <br>
block. However, is also possible to manually configure the
grid size using the -l and -n options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The utility accepts the following basic options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c &lt;string&gt; <br>
This option allows the format of the output file to be
customized to hold a variety of statistics about the
computed Voronoi cells. The specified string can contain
regu&acirc; <br>
lar characters, plus control sequences beginning with
percentage signs that are expanded to contain different
Voronoi cell statistics. See below for a full custom output
<br>
reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g If this option is specified,
then an additional output file is generated with the
&quot;.gnu&quot; extension, which contains a description of
all the cells in a format that can be <br>
viewed using gnuplot using the splot command. Caution: For
large input files, the gnuplot output file will be extremely
large, so this option is best used on smaller sys&acirc;
<br>
tems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h or --help <br>
This option prints out a summary of the command syntax and
the available options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hc This option prints out all
the available control sequences for the customized
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l &lt;len&gt; <br>
Manually specify a typical length scale between particles,
with which to configure the internal grid size. For example,
if the particles represent densely-packed hard <br>
spheres of diameter d, then d would be an appropriate value
to use. The length scale can be used to estimate the optimal
grid size. Using this option will result in a <br>
small performance boost, since the internal grid can be set
up immediately, and it is not necessary to temporarily store
the input file contents while estimating the grid <br>
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m &lt;mem&gt; <br>
Manually specify the initial number of particles that can be
stored in each block. By default a value of 8 is used. For
any block where this limit is reached, the code <br>
will dynamically allocate more memory as neccessary, so
usually it is not necessary to alter this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n &lt;nx&gt; &lt;ny&gt;
&lt;nz&gt; <br>
Manually specify the internal computational grid to have nx,
ny, and nz blocks in the x, y, and z directions
respectively, giving nx*ny*nz blocks in total. Manually
spec&acirc; <br>
ifying the size will result in a small performance boost,
since the internal grid can be set up immediately, and it is
not necessary to temporarily store the input file <br>
contents while estimating the size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Ensure that particles in the
output file are in the same order as those in the input
file. This may result in a very small increase in memory
usage and execution time, and <br>
is turned off by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Make the container periodic
in all three coordinate directions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-px Make container periodic in
the x direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-py Make container periodic in
the y direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pz Make container periodic in
the z direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Carry out a Voronoi
tessellation for a polydisperse particle arrangement using
the radical Voronoi tessellation. For this case, an extra
column is required in the input <br>
file, that contains the particle radii. The radii are also
included in the output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose output. After the
computation is completed, some statistics are printed about
the container geometry, the internal computational grid, the
number of particles <br>
imported, the number Voronoi cells computed, and the volume
of the computed Voronoi cells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Save the particles in POV-Ray
format to &quot;filename_p.pov&quot; and the Voronoi cells
in POV-Ray format to &quot;filename_v.pov&quot;. Caution:
For large input files, the POV-Ray Voronoi <br>
cell file will be extremely large, so this option is best
used on smaller systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-yp Save the particles in
POV-Ray format to &quot;filename_p.pov&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-yv Save the Voronoi cells in
POV-Ray format to &quot;filename_v.pov&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS FOR WALLS <br>
In addition, a number of options can be used to specify wall
objects. Walls are implemented by applying extra plane cuts
during the cell construction process. At present, four <br>
wall types are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wb &lt;x1&gt; &lt;x2&gt;
&lt;x3&gt; &lt;x4&gt; &lt;x5&gt; &lt;x6&gt; <br>
Add six plane wall objects to make a box containing the
space x1&lt;x&lt;x2, x3&lt;y&lt;x4, and x5&lt;z&lt;z6. This
can be useful for embedding a smaller box within a larger
container, in <br>
cases when the influence of particles outside the smaller
box still need to be considered. This option is shorthand to
avoid using the -wp option six times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wc &lt;x1&gt; &lt;x2&gt;
&lt;x3&gt; &lt;x4&gt; &lt;x5&gt; &lt;x6&gt; &lt;x7&gt; <br>
Add a cylindrical wall object, where (x1,x2,x3) is a point
on the cylinder axis, (x4,x5,x6) is a vector along the
cylinder axis, and x7 is the cylinder radius.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wo &lt;x1&gt; &lt;x2&gt;
&lt;x3&gt; &lt;x4&gt; &lt;x5&gt; &lt;x6&gt; &lt;x7&gt; <br>
Add a conical wall object, with apex at (x1,x2,x3), axis
along (x4,x5,x6), and half angle x7 (specified in
radians).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ws &lt;x1&gt; &lt;x2&gt;
&lt;x3&gt; &lt;x4&gt; <br>
Add a spherical wall object, centered on (x1,x2,x3), with
radius x4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wp &lt;x1&gt; &lt;x2&gt;
&lt;x3&gt; &lt;x4&gt; <br>
Add a plane wall object, with normal (x1,x2,x3), and
displacement x4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each wall is accounted for using
a single approximating plane; several of the examples on the
library website discuss this in more detail. If neighbor
information is <br>
requested via the custom output string, then the walls are
numbered sequentially, starting at -7 and decreasing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CUSTOM OUTPUT COMMANDS <br>
The output files created by Voro++ can be fully customized
to contain a variety of different statistics about the
computed Voronoi cells. This is done by specifying a format
<br>
string that contains text plus additional control sequences
that begin with percentage signs. The output file contains a
line for each particle, where the control sequences are <br>
expanded to different statistics. Several examples on the
library website describe the customized output in more
detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Particle-related entries:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%i The particle ID number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%x The x coordinate of the
particle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%y The y coordinate of the
particle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%z The z coordinate of the
particle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%q The position vector of the
particle, short for &quot;%x %y %z&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%r The radius of the particle
(only printed if the polydisperse information is
available).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vertex-related entries:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%w The number of vertices in the
Voronoi cell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%p A list of the vertices of the
Voronoi cell in the format (x,y,z), relative to the particle
center.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%P A list of the vertices of the
Voronoi cell in the format (x,y,z), relative to the global
coordinate system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%o A list of the orders of each
vertex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%m The maximum radius squared of
a vertex position, relative to the particle center.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Edge-related entries:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%g The number of edges of the
Voronoi cell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%E The total edge distance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%e A list of perimeters of each
face.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Face-related entries:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s The number of faces of the
Voronoi cell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%F The total surface area of the
Voronoi cell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%A A frequency table of the
orders of the faces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%a A list of the orders of the
faces, showing how many edges make up each face.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%f A list of areas of each
face.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%t A list of bracketed sequences
of vertices that make up each face.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%l A list of normal vectors for
each face.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%n A list of the neighboring
particle or wall IDs corresponding to each face. The list
can contain negative numbers. For the non-periodic case
these correspond to when the <br>
particles have faces created by the edges of the
computational region. The numbers -1 to -6 correspond to the
minimum x, maximum x, minimum y, maximum y, minimum z, and
<br>
maximum z walls respectively. For periodic boundary
conditions, negative numbers correspond to the cases when a
face of the Voronoi cell is created by the periodic image
<br>
of the current particle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, the neighbor
information will be symmetric, so that if particle A reports
particle B as a neighbor, then particle B will report
particle A as a neighbor. How&acirc; <br>
ever, due to the fact that Voro++ computes each Voronoi cell
individually, it does not provide an explicit guarantee that
the neighbor information will always be symmet&acirc; <br>
ric. Suppose there is a very small Voronoi face connecting A
to B - it may be the case that due to roundoff error, the
Voronoi cell computed for particle A has a face con&acirc;
<br>
necting it to B, but the cell computed for particle B does
not have a face connecting it to A. If the user requires
perfectly symmetric neighbor information, this can be <br>
achieved by scanning the output for any one-sided
connections, and either deleting them or adding in the
reverse connections. The face areas output from
&quot;%f&quot; can also be <br>
used to remove connections between particles that only have
a very small face between them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Volume-related entries:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%v The volume of the Voronoi
cell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%c The centroid of the Voronoi
cell, relative to the particle center.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%C The centroid of the Voronoi
cell, in the global coordinate system.</p>
