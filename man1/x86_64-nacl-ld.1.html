<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ld - The GNU linker</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ld [options] objfile ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ld combines a number of object and archive files, relocates
their data and ties up symbol references. Usually the last
step in compiling a program is to run ld.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ld accepts Linker Command
Language files written in a superset of AT&amp;T&rsquo;s
Link Editor Command Language syntax, to provide explicit and
total control over the linking process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This man page does not describe
the command language; see the ld entry in &quot;info&quot;
for full details on the command language and on other
aspects of the GNU linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This version of ld uses the
general purpose BFD libraries to operate on object files.
This allows ld to read, combine, and write object files in
many different formats---for <br>
example, COFF or &quot;a.out&quot;. Different formats may be
linked together to produce any available kind of object
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Aside from its flexibility, the
GNU linker is more helpful than other linkers in providing
diagnostic information. Many linkers abandon execution
immediately upon encountering <br>
an error; whenever possible, ld continues executing,
allowing you to identify other errors (or, in some cases, to
get an output file in spite of the error).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GNU linker ld is meant to
cover a broad range of situations, and to be as compatible
as possible with other linkers. As a result, you have many
choices to control its <br>
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The linker supports a plethora of command-line options, but
in actual practice few of them are used in any particular
context. For instance, a frequent use of ld is to link <br>
standard Unix object files on a standard, supported Unix
system. On such a system, to link a file
&quot;hello.o&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ld -o &lt;output&gt; /lib/crt0.o
hello.o -lc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tells ld to produce a file
called output as the result of linking the file
&quot;/lib/crt0.o&quot; with &quot;hello.o&quot; and the
library &quot;libc.a&quot;, which will come from the
standard search <br>
directories. (See the discussion of the -l option
below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of the command-line options
to ld may be specified at any point in the command line.
However, options which refer to files, such as -l or -T,
cause the file to be read at <br>
the point at which the option appears in the command line,
relative to the object files and other file options.
Repeating non-file options with a different argument will
either <br>
have no further effect, or override prior occurrences (those
further to the left on the command line) of that option.
Options which may be meaningfully specified more than once
<br>
are noted in the descriptions below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-option arguments are object
files or archives which are to be linked together. They may
follow, precede, or be mixed in with command-line options,
except that an object file <br>
argument may not be placed between an option and its
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usually the linker is invoked
with at least one object file, but you can specify other
forms of binary input files using -l, -R, and the script
command language. If no binary <br>
input files at all are specified, the linker does not
produce any output, and issues the message No input
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the linker cannot recognize
the format of an object file, it will assume that it is a
linker script. A script specified in this way augments the
main linker script used for <br>
the link (either the default linker script or the one
specified by using -T). This feature permits the linker to
link against a file which appears to be an object or an
archive, <br>
but actually merely defines some symbol values, or uses
&quot;INPUT&quot; or &quot;GROUP&quot; to load other
objects. Specifying a script in this way merely augments the
main linker script, with <br>
the extra commands placed after the main script; use the -T
option to replace the default linker script entirely, but
note the effect of the &quot;INSERT&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For options whose names are a
single letter, option arguments must either follow the
option letter without intervening whitespace, or be given as
separate arguments immediately <br>
following the option that requires them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For options whose names are
multiple letters, either one dash or two can precede the
option name; for example, -trace-symbol and --trace-symbol
are equivalent. Note---there is <br>
one exception to this rule. Multiple letter options that
start with a lower case &rsquo;o&rsquo; can only be preceded
by two dashes. This is to reduce confusion with the -o
option. So for <br>
example -omagic sets the output file name to magic whereas
--omagic sets the NMAGIC flag on the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments to multiple-letter
options must either be separated from the option name by an
equals sign, or be given as separate arguments immediately
following the option that <br>
requires them. For example, --trace-symbol foo and
--trace-symbol=foo are equivalent. Unique abbreviations of
the names of multiple-letter options are accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note---if the linker is being
invoked indirectly, via a compiler driver (e.g. gcc) then
all the linker command line options should be prefixed by
-Wl, (or whatever is appropriate <br>
for the particular compiler driver) like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -Wl,--start-group foo.o
bar.o -Wl,--end-group</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is important, because
otherwise the compiler driver program may silently drop the
linker options, resulting in a bad link. Confusion may also
arise when passing options <br>
that require values through a driver, as the use of a space
between option and argument acts as a separator, and causes
the driver to pass only the option to the linker and the
<br>
argument to the compiler. In this case, it is simplest to
use the joined forms of both single- and multiple-letter
options, such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc foo.o bar.o -Wl,-eENTRY
-Wl,-Map=a.map</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a table of the generic
command line switches accepted by the GNU linker:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@file <br>
Read command-line options from file. The options read are
inserted in place of the original @file option. If file does
not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be <br>
treated literally, and not removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options in file are separated by
whitespace. A whitespace character may be included in an
option by surrounding the entire option in either single or
double quotes. Any <br>
character (including a backslash) may be included by
prefixing the character to be included with a backslash. The
file may itself contain additional @file options; any such
<br>
options will be processed recursively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a keyword <br>
This option is supported for HP/UX compatibility. The
keyword argument must be one of the strings archive, shared,
or default. -aarchive is functionally equivalent to <br>
-Bstatic, and the other two keywords are functionally
equivalent to -Bdynamic. This option may be used any number
of times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--audit AUDITLIB <br>
Adds AUDITLIB to the &quot;DT_AUDIT&quot; entry of the
dynamic section. AUDITLIB is not checked for existence, nor
will it use the DT_SONAME specified in the library. If
specified <br>
multiple times &quot;DT_AUDIT&quot; will contain a colon
separated list of audit interfaces to use. If the linker
finds an object with an audit entry while searching for
shared <br>
libraries, it will add a corresponding
&quot;DT_DEPAUDIT&quot; entry in the output file. This
option is only meaningful on ELF platforms supporting the
rtld-audit interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A architecture <br>
--architecture=architecture <br>
In the current release of ld, this option is useful only for
the Intel 960 family of architectures. In that ld
configuration, the architecture argument identifies the <br>
particular architecture in the 960 family, enabling some
safeguards and modifying the archive-library search
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Future releases of ld may
support similar functionality for other architecture
families.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b input-format <br>
--format=input-format <br>
ld may be configured to support more than one kind of object
file. If your ld is configured this way, you can use the -b
option to specify the binary format for input object <br>
files that follow this option on the command line. Even when
ld is configured to support alternative object formats, you
don&rsquo;t usually need to specify this, as ld should be
<br>
configured to expect as a default input format the most
usual format on each machine. input-format is a text string,
the name of a particular format supported by the BFD <br>
libraries. (You can list the available binary formats with
objdump -i.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may want to use this option
if you are linking files with an unusual binary format. You
can also use -b to switch formats explicitly (when linking
object files of <br>
different formats), by including -b input-format before each
group of object files in a particular format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default format is taken from
the environment variable &quot;GNUTARGET&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also define the input
format from a script, using the command
&quot;TARGET&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c MRI-commandfile <br>
--mri-script=MRI-commandfile <br>
For compatibility with linkers produced by MRI, ld accepts
script files written in an alternate, restricted command
language, described in the MRI Compatible Script Files <br>
section of GNU ld documentation. Introduce MRI script files
with the option -c; use the -T option to run linker scripts
written in the general-purpose ld scripting language. <br>
If MRI-cmdfile does not exist, ld looks for it in the
directories specified by any -L options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d <br>
-dc <br>
-dp These three options are equivalent; multiple forms are
supported for compatibility with other linkers. They assign
space to common symbols even if a relocatable output file
<br>
is specified (with -r). The script command
&quot;FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION&quot; has the same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--depaudit AUDITLIB <br>
-P AUDITLIB <br>
Adds AUDITLIB to the &quot;DT_DEPAUDIT&quot; entry of the
dynamic section. AUDITLIB is not checked for existence, nor
will it use the DT_SONAME specified in the library. If
specified <br>
multiple times &quot;DT_DEPAUDIT&quot; will contain a colon
separated list of audit interfaces to use. This option is
only meaningful on ELF platforms supporting the rtld-audit
<br>
interface. The -P option is provided for Solaris
compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e entry <br>
--entry=entry <br>
Use entry as the explicit symbol for beginning execution of
your program, rather than the default entry point. If there
is no symbol named entry, the linker will try to <br>
parse entry as a number, and use that as the entry address
(the number will be interpreted in base 10; you may use a
leading 0x for base 16, or a leading 0 for base 8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-libs lib,lib,... <br>
Specifies a list of archive libraries from which symbols
should not be automatically exported. The library names may
be delimited by commas or colons. Specifying <br>
&quot;--exclude-libs ALL&quot; excludes symbols in all
archive libraries from automatic export. This option is
available only for the i386 PE targeted port of the linker
and for ELF <br>
targeted ports. For i386 PE, symbols explicitly listed in a
.def file are still exported, regardless of this option. For
ELF targeted ports, symbols affected by this option <br>
will be treated as hidden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-modules-for-implib
module,module,... <br>
Specifies a list of object files or archive members, from
which symbols should not be automatically exported, but
which should be copied wholesale into the import library
<br>
being generated during the link. The module names may be
delimited by commas or colons, and must match exactly the
filenames used by ld to open the files; for archive <br>
members, this is simply the member name, but for object
files the name listed must include and match precisely any
path used to specify the input file on the linker&rsquo;s
<br>
command-line. This option is available only for the i386 PE
targeted port of the linker. Symbols explicitly listed in a
.def file are still exported, regardless of this <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E <br>
--export-dynamic <br>
--no-export-dynamic <br>
When creating a dynamically linked executable, using the -E
option or the --export-dynamic option causes the linker to
add all symbols to the dynamic symbol table. The <br>
dynamic symbol table is the set of symbols which are visible
from dynamic objects at run time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not use either of
these options (or use the --no-export-dynamic option to
restore the default behavior), the dynamic symbol table will
normally contain only those <br>
symbols which are referenced by some dynamic object
mentioned in the link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use &quot;dlopen&quot; to
load a dynamic object which needs to refer back to the
symbols defined by the program, rather than some other
dynamic object, then you will probably <br>
need to use this option when linking the program itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also use the dynamic
list to control what symbols should be added to the dynamic
symbol table if the output format supports it. See the
description of <br>
--dynamic-list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this option is
specific to ELF targeted ports. PE targets support a similar
function to export all symbols from a DLL or EXE; see the
description of <br>
--export-all-symbols below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-EB Link big-endian objects.
This affects the default output format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-EL Link little-endian objects.
This affects the default output format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f name <br>
--auxiliary=name <br>
When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal
DT_AUXILIARY field to the specified name. This tells the
dynamic linker that the symbol table of the shared object
<br>
should be used as an auxiliary filter on the symbol table of
the shared object name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you later link a program
against this filter object, then, when you run the program,
the dynamic linker will see the DT_AUXILIARY field. If the
dynamic linker resolves <br>
any symbols from the filter object, it will first check
whether there is a definition in the shared object name. If
there is one, it will be used instead of the definition <br>
in the filter object. The shared object name need not exist.
Thus the shared object name may be used to provide an
alternative implementation of certain functions, perhaps
<br>
for debugging or for machine specific performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option may be specified
more than once. The DT_AUXILIARY entries will be created in
the order in which they appear on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F name <br>
--filter=name <br>
When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal
DT_FILTER field to the specified name. This tells the
dynamic linker that the symbol table of the shared object
which is <br>
being created should be used as a filter on the symbol table
of the shared object name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you later link a program
against this filter object, then, when you run the program,
the dynamic linker will see the DT_FILTER field. The dynamic
linker will resolve <br>
symbols according to the symbol table of the filter object
as usual, but it will actually link to the definitions found
in the shared object name. Thus the filter object can <br>
be used to select a subset of the symbols provided by the
object name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some older linkers used the -F
option throughout a compilation toolchain for specifying
object-file format for both input and output object files.
The GNU linker uses other <br>
mechanisms for this purpose: the -b, --format, --oformat
options, the &quot;TARGET&quot; command in linker scripts,
and the &quot;GNUTARGET&quot; environment variable. The GNU
linker will <br>
ignore the -F option when not creating an ELF shared
object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fini=name <br>
When creating an ELF executable or shared object, call NAME
when the executable or shared object is unloaded, by setting
DT_FINI to the address of the function. By default, <br>
the linker uses &quot;_fini&quot; as the function to
call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Ignored. Provided for
compatibility with other tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G value <br>
--gpsize=value <br>
Set the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the GP
register to size. This is only meaningful for object file
formats such as MIPS ELF that support putting large <br>
and small objects into different sections. This is ignored
for other object file formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h name <br>
-soname=name <br>
When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal
DT_SONAME field to the specified name. When an executable is
linked with a shared object which has a DT_SONAME field,
<br>
then when the executable is run the dynamic linker will
attempt to load the shared object specified by the DT_SONAME
field rather than the using the file name given to the <br>
linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Perform an incremental link
(same as option -r).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-init=name <br>
When creating an ELF executable or shared object, call NAME
when the executable or shared object is loaded, by setting
DT_INIT to the address of the function. By default, <br>
the linker uses &quot;_init&quot; as the function to
call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l namespec <br>
--library=namespec <br>
Add the archive or object file specified by namespec to the
list of files to link. This option may be used any number of
times. If namespec is of the form :filename, ld <br>
will search the library path for a file called filename,
otherwise it will search the library path for a file called
libnamespec.a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems which support shared
libraries, ld may also search for files other than
libnamespec.a. Specifically, on ELF and SunOS systems, ld
will search a directory for a <br>
library called libnamespec.so before searching for one
called libnamespec.a. (By convention, a &quot;.so&quot;
extension indicates a shared library.) Note that this
behavior does not <br>
apply to :filename, which always specifies a file called
filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The linker will search an
archive only once, at the location where it is specified on
the command line. If the archive defines a symbol which was
undefined in some object <br>
which appeared before the archive on the command line, the
linker will include the appropriate file(s) from the
archive. However, an undefined symbol in an object appearing
<br>
later on the command line will not cause the linker to
search the archive again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the -( option for a way to
force the linker to search archives multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may list the same archive
multiple times on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This type of archive searching
is standard for Unix linkers. However, if you are using ld
on AIX, note that it is different from the behaviour of the
AIX linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L searchdir <br>
--library-path=searchdir <br>
Add path searchdir to the list of paths that ld will search
for archive libraries and ld control scripts. You may use
this option any number of times. The directories are <br>
searched in the order in which they are specified on the
command line. Directories specified on the command line are
searched before the default directories. All -L options <br>
apply to all -l options, regardless of the order in which
the options appear. -L options do not affect how ld searches
for a linker script unless -T option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If searchdir begins with
&quot;=&quot;, then the &quot;=&quot; will be replaced by
the sysroot prefix, a path specified when the linker is
configured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default set of paths
searched (without being specified with -L) depends on which
emulation mode ld is using, and in some cases also on how it
was configured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The paths can also be specified
in a link script with the &quot;SEARCH_DIR&quot; command.
Directories specified this way are searched at the point in
which the linker script appears <br>
in the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m emulation <br>
Emulate the emulation linker. You can list the available
emulations with the --verbose or -V options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -m option is not used,
the emulation is taken from the &quot;LDEMULATION&quot;
environment variable, if that is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, the default emulation
depends upon how the linker was configured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M <br>
--print-map <br>
Print a link map to the standard output. A link map provides
information about the link, including the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Where object
files are mapped into memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; How common
symbols are allocated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; All archive
members included in the link, with a mention of the symbol
which caused the archive member to be brought in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The values
assigned to symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note - symbols whose values are
computed by an expression which involves a reference to a
previous value of the same symbol may not have correct
result displayed in the <br>
link map. This is because the linker discards intermediate
results and only retains the final value of an expression.
Under such circumstances the linker will display <br>
the final value enclosed by square brackets. Thus for
example a linker script containing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foo = 1 <br>
foo = foo * 4 <br>
foo = foo + 8</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will produce the following
output in the link map if the -M option is used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0x00000001 foo = 0x1 <br>
[0x0000000c] foo = (foo * 0x4) <br>
[0x0000000c] foo = (foo + 0x8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See Expressions for more
information about expressions in linker scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n <br>
--nmagic <br>
Turn off page alignment of sections, and disable linking
against shared libraries. If the output format supports Unix
style magic numbers, mark the output as
&quot;NMAGIC&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N <br>
--omagic <br>
Set the text and data sections to be readable and writable.
Also, do not page-align the data segment, and disable
linking against shared libraries. If the output format <br>
supports Unix style magic numbers, mark the output as
&quot;OMAGIC&quot;. Note: Although a writable text section
is allowed for PE-COFF targets, it does not conform to the
format <br>
specification published by Microsoft.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-omagic <br>
This option negates most of the effects of the -N option. It
sets the text section to be read-only, and forces the data
segment to be page-aligned. Note - this option does <br>
not enable linking against shared libraries. Use -Bdynamic
for this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o output <br>
--output=output <br>
Use output as the name for the program produced by ld; if
this option is not specified, the name a.out is used by
default. The script command &quot;OUTPUT&quot; can also
specify the <br>
output file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O level <br>
If level is a numeric values greater than zero ld optimizes
the output. This might take significantly longer and
therefore probably should only be enabled for the final <br>
binary. At the moment this option only affects ELF shared
library generation. Future releases of the linker may make
more use of this option. Also currently there is no <br>
difference in the linker&rsquo;s behaviour for different
non-zero values of this option. Again this may change with
future releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q <br>
--emit-relocs <br>
Leave relocation sections and contents in fully linked
executables. Post link analysis and optimization tools may
need this information in order to perform correct <br>
modifications of executables. This results in larger
executables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is currently only
supported on ELF platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force-dynamic <br>
Force the output file to have dynamic sections. This option
is specific to VxWorks targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r <br>
--relocatable <br>
Generate relocatable output---i.e., generate an output file
that can in turn serve as input to ld. This is often called
partial linking. As a side effect, in environments <br>
that support standard Unix magic numbers, this option also
sets the output file&rsquo;s magic number to
&quot;OMAGIC&quot;. If this option is not specified, an
absolute file is produced. <br>
When linking C++ programs, this option will not resolve
references to constructors; to do that, use -Ur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an input file does not have
the same format as the output file, partial linking is only
supported if that input file does not contain any
relocations. Different output <br>
formats can have further restrictions; for example some
&quot;a.out&quot;-based formats do not support partial
linking with input files in other formats at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option does the same thing
as -i.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R filename <br>
--just-symbols=filename <br>
Read symbol names and their addresses from filename, but do
not relocate it or include it in the output. This allows
your output file to refer symbolically to absolute <br>
locations of memory defined in other programs. You may use
this option more than once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For compatibility with other ELF
linkers, if the -R option is followed by a directory name,
rather than a file name, it is treated as the -rpath
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s <br>
--strip-all <br>
Omit all symbol information from the output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S <br>
--strip-debug <br>
Omit debugger symbol information (but not all symbols) from
the output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t <br>
--trace <br>
Print the names of the input files as ld processes them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T scriptfile <br>
--script=scriptfile <br>
Use scriptfile as the linker script. This script replaces
ld&rsquo;s default linker script (rather than adding to it),
so commandfile must specify everything necessary to describe
<br>
the output file. If scriptfile does not exist in the current
directory, &quot;ld&quot; looks for it in the directories
specified by any preceding -L options. Multiple -T options
<br>
accumulate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dT scriptfile <br>
--default-script=scriptfile <br>
Use scriptfile as the default linker script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is similar to the
--script option except that processing of the script is
delayed until after the rest of the command line has been
processed. This allows <br>
options placed after the --default-script option on the
command line to affect the behaviour of the linker script,
which can be important when the linker command line cannot
<br>
be directly controlled by the user. (eg because the command
line is being constructed by another tool, such as gcc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u symbol <br>
--undefined=symbol <br>
Force symbol to be entered in the output file as an
undefined symbol. Doing this may, for example, trigger
linking of additional modules from standard libraries. -u
may be <br>
repeated with different option arguments to enter additional
undefined symbols. This option is equivalent to the
&quot;EXTERN&quot; linker script command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ur For anything other than C++
programs, this option is equivalent to -r: it generates
relocatable output---i.e., an output file that can in turn
serve as input to ld. When <br>
linking C++ programs, -Ur does resolve references to
constructors, unlike -r. It does not work to use -Ur on
files that were themselves linked with -Ur; once the
constructor <br>
table has been built, it cannot be added to. Use -Ur only
for the last partial link, and -r for the others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unique[=SECTION] <br>
Creates a separate output section for every input section
matching SECTION, or if the optional wildcard SECTION
argument is missing, for every orphan input section. An <br>
orphan section is one not specifically mentioned in a linker
script. You may use this option multiple times on the
command line; It prevents the normal merging of input <br>
sections with the same name, overriding output section
assignments in a linker script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
--version <br>
-V Display the version number for ld. The -V option also
lists the supported emulations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x <br>
--discard-all <br>
Delete all local symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X <br>
--discard-locals <br>
Delete all temporary local symbols. (These symbols start
with system-specific local label prefixes, typically .L for
ELF systems or L for traditional a.out systems.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y symbol <br>
--trace-symbol=symbol <br>
Print the name of each linked file in which symbol appears.
This option may be given any number of times. On many
systems it is necessary to prepend an underscore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is useful when you
have an undefined symbol in your link but don&rsquo;t know
where the reference is coming from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y path <br>
Add path to the default library search path. This option
exists for Solaris compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z keyword <br>
The recognized keywords are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">combreloc <br>
Combines multiple reloc sections and sorts them to make
dynamic symbol lookup caching possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defs <br>
Disallows undefined symbols in object files. Undefined
symbols in shared libraries are still allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">execstack <br>
Marks the object as requiring executable stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">global <br>
This option is only meaningful when building a shared
object. It makes the symbols defined by this shared object
available for symbol resolution of subsequently loaded <br>
libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">initfirst <br>
This option is only meaningful when building a shared
object. It marks the object so that its runtime
initialization will occur before the runtime initialization
of any <br>
other objects brought into the process at the same time.
Similarly the runtime finalization of the object will occur
after the runtime finalization of any other objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interpose <br>
Marks the object that its symbol table interposes before all
symbols but the primary executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lazy <br>
When generating an executable or shared library, mark it to
tell the dynamic linker to defer function call resolution to
the point when the function is called (lazy <br>
binding), rather than at load time. Lazy binding is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loadfltr <br>
Marks the object that its filters be processed immediately
at runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">muldefs <br>
Allows multiple definitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nocombreloc <br>
Disables multiple reloc sections combining.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nocopyreloc <br>
Disables production of copy relocs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodefaultlib <br>
Marks the object that the search for dependencies of this
object will ignore any default library search paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodelete <br>
Marks the object shouldn&rsquo;t be unloaded at runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodlopen <br>
Marks the object not available to &quot;dlopen&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodump <br>
Marks the object can not be dumped by
&quot;dldump&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noexecstack <br>
Marks the object as not requiring executable stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">norelro <br>
Don&rsquo;t create an ELF &quot;PT_GNU_RELRO&quot; segment
header in the object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">now When generating an
executable or shared library, mark it to tell the dynamic
linker to resolve all symbols when the program is started,
or when the shared library is <br>
linked to using dlopen, instead of deferring function call
resolution to the point when the function is first
called.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">origin <br>
Marks the object may contain $ORIGIN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">relro <br>
Create an ELF &quot;PT_GNU_RELRO&quot; segment header in the
object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-page-size=value <br>
Set the emulation maximum page size to value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">common-page-size=value <br>
Set the emulation common page size to value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stack-size=value <br>
Specify a stack size for in an ELF &quot;PT_GNU_STACK&quot;
segment. Specifying zero will override any default non-zero
sized &quot;PT_GNU_STACK&quot; segment creation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other keywords are ignored for
Solaris compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-( archives -) <br>
--start-group archives --end-group <br>
The archives should be a list of archive files. They may be
either explicit file names, or -l options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specified archives are
searched repeatedly until no new undefined references are
created. Normally, an archive is searched only once in the
order that it is specified on <br>
the command line. If a symbol in that archive is needed to
resolve an undefined symbol referred to by an object in an
archive that appears later on the command line, the <br>
linker would not be able to resolve that reference. By
grouping the archives, they all be searched repeatedly until
all possible references are resolved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using this option has a
significant performance cost. It is best to use it only when
there are unavoidable circular references between two or
more archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--accept-unknown-input-arch <br>
--no-accept-unknown-input-arch <br>
Tells the linker to accept input files whose architecture
cannot be recognised. The assumption is that the user knows
what they are doing and deliberately wants to link in <br>
these unknown input files. This was the default behaviour of
the linker, before release 2.14. The default behaviour from
release 2.14 onwards is to reject such input files, <br>
and so the --accept-unknown-input-arch option has been added
to restore the old behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--as-needed <br>
--no-as-needed <br>
This option affects ELF DT_NEEDED tags for dynamic libraries
mentioned on the command line after the --as-needed option.
Normally the linker will add a DT_NEEDED tag for <br>
each dynamic library mentioned on the command line,
regardless of whether the library is actually needed or not.
--as-needed causes a DT_NEEDED tag to only be emitted for a
<br>
library that at that point in the link satisfies a non-weak
undefined symbol reference from a regular object file or, if
the library is not found in the DT_NEEDED lists of <br>
other libraries, a non-weak undefined symbol reference from
another dynamic library. Object files or libraries appearing
on the command line after the library in question do <br>
not affect whether the library is seen as needed. This is
similar to the rules for extraction of object files from
archives. --no-as-needed restores the default behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--add-needed <br>
--no-add-needed <br>
These two options have been deprecated because of the
similarity of their names to the --as-needed and
--no-as-needed options. They have been replaced by <br>
--copy-dt-needed-entries and
--no-copy-dt-needed-entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-assert keyword <br>
This option is ignored for SunOS compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Bdynamic <br>
-dy <br>
-call_shared <br>
Link against dynamic libraries. This is only meaningful on
platforms for which shared libraries are supported. This
option is normally the default on such platforms. The <br>
different variants of this option are for compatibility with
various systems. You may use this option multiple times on
the command line: it affects library searching for -l <br>
options which follow it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Bgroup <br>
Set the &quot;DF_1_GROUP&quot; flag in the
&quot;DT_FLAGS_1&quot; entry in the dynamic section. This
causes the runtime linker to handle lookups in this object
and its dependencies to be <br>
performed only inside the group.
--unresolved-symbols=report-all is implied. This option is
only meaningful on ELF platforms which support shared
libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Bstatic <br>
-dn <br>
-non_shared <br>
-static <br>
Do not link against shared libraries. This is only
meaningful on platforms for which shared libraries are
supported. The different variants of this option are for
<br>
compatibility with various systems. You may use this option
multiple times on the command line: it affects library
searching for -l options which follow it. This option <br>
also implies --unresolved-symbols=report-all. This option
can be used with -shared. Doing so means that a shared
library is being created but that all of the library&rsquo;s
<br>
external references must be resolved by pulling in entries
from static libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Bsymbolic <br>
When creating a shared library, bind references to global
symbols to the definition within the shared library, if any.
Normally, it is possible for a program linked against <br>
a shared library to override the definition within the
shared library. This option is only meaningful on ELF
platforms which support shared libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Bsymbolic-functions <br>
When creating a shared library, bind references to global
function symbols to the definition within the shared
library, if any. This option is only meaningful on ELF <br>
platforms which support shared libraries.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dynamic-list=dynamic-list-file
<br>
Specify the name of a dynamic list file to the linker. This
is typically used when creating shared libraries to specify
a list of global symbols whose references shouldn&rsquo;t
<br>
be bound to the definition within the shared library, or
creating dynamically linked executables to specify a list of
symbols which should be added to the symbol table in the
<br>
executable. This option is only meaningful on ELF platforms
which support shared libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the dynamic list
is the same as the version node without scope and node name.
See VERSION for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dynamic-list-data <br>
Include all global data symbols to the dynamic list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dynamic-list-cpp-new <br>
Provide the builtin dynamic list for C++ operator new and
delete. It is mainly useful for building shared
libstdc++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dynamic-list-cpp-typeinfo <br>
Provide the builtin dynamic list for C++ runtime type
identification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check-sections <br>
--no-check-sections <br>
Asks the linker not to check section addresses after they
have been assigned to see if there are any overlaps.
Normally the linker will perform this check, and if it finds
<br>
any overlaps it will produce suitable error messages. The
linker does know about, and does make allowances for
sections in overlays. The default behaviour can be restored
<br>
by using the command line switch --check-sections. Section
overlap is not usually checked for relocatable links. You
can force checking in that case by using the <br>
--check-sections option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--copy-dt-needed-entries <br>
--no-copy-dt-needed-entries <br>
This option affects the treatment of dynamic libraries
referred to by DT_NEEDED tags inside ELF dynamic libraries
mentioned on the command line. Normally the linker
won&rsquo;t <br>
add a DT_NEEDED tag to the output binary for each library
mentioned in a DT_NEEDED tag in an input dynamic library.
With --copy-dt-needed-entries specified on the command <br>
line however any dynamic libraries that follow it will have
their DT_NEEDED entries added. The default behaviour can be
restored with --no-copy-dt-needed-entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option also has an effect
on the resolution of symbols in dynamic libraries. With
--copy-dt-needed-entries dynamic libraries mentioned on the
command line will be <br>
recursively searched, following their DT_NEEDED tags to
other libraries, in order to resolve symbols required by the
output binary. With the default setting however the <br>
searching of dynamic libraries that follow it will stop with
the dynamic library itself. No DT_NEEDED links will be
traversed to resolve symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cref <br>
Output a cross reference table. If a linker map file is
being generated, the cross reference table is printed to the
map file. Otherwise, it is printed on the standard <br>
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the table is
intentionally simple, so that it may be easily processed by
a script if necessary. The symbols are printed out, sorted
by name. For each symbol, <br>
a list of file names is given. If the symbol is defined, the
first file listed is the location of the definition. If the
symbol is defined as a common value then any files <br>
where this happens appear next. Finally any files that
reference the symbol are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-define-common <br>
This option inhibits the assignment of addresses to common
symbols. The script command
&quot;INHIBIT_COMMON_ALLOCATION&quot; has the same
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --no-define-common option
allows decoupling the decision to assign addresses to Common
symbols from the choice of the output file type; otherwise a
non-Relocatable output <br>
type forces assigning addresses to Common symbols. Using
--no-define-common allows Common symbols that are referenced
from a shared library to be assigned addresses only in <br>
the main program. This eliminates the unused duplicate space
in the shared library, and also prevents any possible
confusion over resolving to the wrong duplicate when there
<br>
are many dynamic modules with specialized search paths for
runtime symbol resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--defsym=symbol=expression <br>
Create a global symbol in the output file, containing the
absolute address given by expression. You may use this
option as many times as necessary to define multiple symbols
<br>
in the command line. A limited form of arithmetic is
supported for the expression in this context: you may give a
hexadecimal constant or the name of an existing symbol, or
<br>
use &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; to add or subtract
hexadecimal constants or symbols. If you need more elaborate
expressions, consider using the linker command language from
a script. Note: <br>
there should be no white space between symbol, the equals
sign (&quot;=&quot;), and expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--demangle[=style] <br>
--no-demangle <br>
These options control whether to demangle symbol names in
error messages and other output. When the linker is told to
demangle, it tries to present symbol names in a <br>
readable fashion: it strips leading underscores if they are
used by the object file format, and converts C++ mangled
symbol names into user readable names. Different <br>
compilers have different mangling styles. The optional
demangling style argument can be used to choose an
appropriate demangling style for your compiler. The linker
will <br>
demangle by default unless the environment variable
COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE is set. These options may be used to
override the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ifile <br>
--dynamic-linker=file <br>
Set the name of the dynamic linker. This is only meaningful
when generating dynamically linked ELF executables. The
default dynamic linker is normally correct; don&rsquo;t use
<br>
this unless you know what you are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fatal-warnings <br>
--no-fatal-warnings <br>
Treat all warnings as errors. The default behaviour can be
restored with the option --no-fatal-warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force-exe-suffix <br>
Make sure that an output file has a .exe suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a successfully built fully
linked output file does not have a &quot;.exe&quot; or
&quot;.dll&quot; suffix, this option forces the linker to
copy the output file to one of the same name with a <br>
&quot;.exe&quot; suffix. This option is useful when using
unmodified Unix makefiles on a Microsoft Windows host, since
some versions of Windows won&rsquo;t run an image unless it
ends in a <br>
&quot;.exe&quot; suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gc-sections <br>
--no-gc-sections <br>
Enable garbage collection of unused input sections. It is
ignored on targets that do not support this option. The
default behaviour (of not performing this garbage <br>
collection) can be restored by specifying --no-gc-sections
on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gc-sections decides which
input sections are used by examining symbols and
relocations. The section containing the entry symbol and all
sections containing symbols <br>
undefined on the command-line will be kept, as will sections
containing symbols referenced by dynamic objects. Note that
when building shared libraries, the linker must <br>
assume that any visible symbol is referenced. Once this
initial set of sections has been determined, the linker
recursively marks as used any section referenced by their
<br>
relocations. See --entry and --undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be set when
doing a partial link (enabled with option -r). In this case
the root of symbols kept must be explicitly specified either
by an --entry or <br>
--undefined option or by a &quot;ENTRY&quot; command in the
linker script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--print-gc-sections <br>
--no-print-gc-sections <br>
List all sections removed by garbage collection. The listing
is printed on stderr. This option is only effective if
garbage collection has been enabled via the <br>
--gc-sections) option. The default behaviour (of not listing
the sections that are removed) can be restored by specifying
--no-print-gc-sections on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--print-output-format <br>
Print the name of the default output format (perhaps
influenced by other command-line options). This is the
string that would appear in an &quot;OUTPUT_FORMAT&quot;
linker script <br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
Print a summary of the command-line options on the standard
output and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--target-help <br>
Print a summary of all target specific options on the
standard output and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Map=mapfile <br>
Print a link map to the file mapfile. See the description of
the -M option, above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-keep-memory <br>
ld normally optimizes for speed over memory usage by caching
the symbol tables of input files in memory. This option
tells ld to instead optimize for memory usage, by <br>
rereading the symbol tables as necessary. This may be
required if ld runs out of memory space while linking a
large executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-undefined <br>
-z defs <br>
Report unresolved symbol references from regular object
files. This is done even if the linker is creating a
non-symbolic shared library. The switch <br>
--[no-]allow-shlib-undefined controls the behaviour for
reporting unresolved references found in shared libraries
being linked in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-multiple-definition <br>
-z muldefs <br>
Normally when a symbol is defined multiple times, the linker
will report a fatal error. These options allow multiple
definitions and the first definition will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-shlib-undefined <br>
--no-allow-shlib-undefined <br>
Allows or disallows undefined symbols in shared libraries.
This switch is similar to --no-undefined except that it
determines the behaviour when the undefined symbols are in
<br>
a shared library rather than a regular object file. It does
not affect how undefined symbols in regular object files are
handled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default behaviour is to
report errors for any undefined symbols referenced in shared
libraries if the linker is being used to create an
executable, but to allow them if <br>
the linker is being used to create a shared library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reasons for allowing
undefined symbol references in shared libraries specified at
link time are that:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A shared library
specified at link time may not be the same as the one that
is available at load time, so the symbol might actually be
resolvable at load time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; There are some
operating systems, eg BeOS and HPPA, where undefined symbols
in shared libraries are normal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The BeOS kernel for example
patches shared libraries at load time to select whichever
function is most appropriate for the current architecture.
This is used, for <br>
example, to dynamically select an appropriate memset
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-undefined-version <br>
Normally when a symbol has an undefined version, the linker
will ignore it. This option disallows symbols with undefined
version and a fatal error will be issued instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default-symver <br>
Create and use a default symbol version (the soname) for
unversioned exported symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default-imported-symver <br>
Create and use a default symbol version (the soname) for
unversioned imported symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-warn-mismatch <br>
Normally ld will give an error if you try to link together
input files that are mismatched for some reason, perhaps
because they have been compiled for different processors
<br>
or for different endiannesses. This option tells ld that it
should silently permit such possible errors. This option
should only be used with care, in cases when you have <br>
taken some special action that ensures that the linker
errors are inappropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-warn-search-mismatch <br>
Normally ld will give a warning if it finds an incompatible
library during a library search. This option silences the
warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-whole-archive <br>
Turn off the effect of the --whole-archive option for
subsequent archive files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noinhibit-exec <br>
Retain the executable output file whenever it is still
usable. Normally, the linker will not produce an output file
if it encounters errors during the link process; it exits
<br>
without writing an output file when it issues any error
whatsoever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nostdlib <br>
Only search library directories explicitly specified on the
command line. Library directories specified in linker
scripts (including linker scripts specified on the command
<br>
line) are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--oformat=output-format <br>
ld may be configured to support more than one kind of object
file. If your ld is configured this way, you can use the
--oformat option to specify the binary format for the <br>
output object file. Even when ld is configured to support
alternative object formats, you don&rsquo;t usually need to
specify this, as ld should be configured to produce as a
<br>
default output format the most usual format on each machine.
output-format is a text string, the name of a particular
format supported by the BFD libraries. (You can list <br>
the available binary formats with objdump -i.) The script
command &quot;OUTPUT_FORMAT&quot; can also specify the
output format, but this option overrides it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pie <br>
--pic-executable <br>
Create a position independent executable. This is currently
only supported on ELF platforms. Position independent
executables are similar to shared libraries in that they
<br>
are relocated by the dynamic linker to the virtual address
the OS chooses for them (which can vary between
invocations). Like normal dynamically linked executables
they can <br>
be executed and symbols defined in the executable cannot be
overridden by shared libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-qmagic <br>
This option is ignored for Linux compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Qy This option is ignored for
SVR4 compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--relax <br>
--no-relax <br>
An option with machine dependent effects. This option is
only supported on a few targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some platforms the --relax
option performs target specific, global optimizations that
become possible when the linker resolves addressing in the
program, such as relaxing <br>
address modes, synthesizing new instructions, selecting
shorter version of current instructions, and combining
constant values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some platforms these link
time global optimizations may make symbolic debugging of the
resulting executable impossible. This is known to be the
case for the Matsushita <br>
MN10200 and MN10300 family of processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On platforms where this is not
supported, --relax is accepted, but ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On platforms where --relax is
accepted the option --no-relax can be used to disable the
feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--retain-symbols-file=filename
<br>
Retain only the symbols listed in the file filename,
discarding all others. filename is simply a flat file, with
one symbol name per line. This option is especially useful
<br>
in environments (such as VxWorks) where a large global
symbol table is accumulated gradually, to conserve run-time
memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--retain-symbols-file does not
discard undefined symbols, or symbols needed for
relocations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may only specify
--retain-symbols-file once in the command line. It overrides
-s and -S.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rpath=dir <br>
Add a directory to the runtime library search path. This is
used when linking an ELF executable with shared objects. All
-rpath arguments are concatenated and passed to the <br>
runtime linker, which uses them to locate shared objects at
runtime. The -rpath option is also used when locating shared
objects which are needed by shared objects <br>
explicitly included in the link; see the description of the
-rpath-link option. If -rpath is not used when linking an
ELF executable, the contents of the environment <br>
variable &quot;LD_RUN_PATH&quot; will be used if it is
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -rpath option may also be
used on SunOS. By default, on SunOS, the linker will form a
runtime search patch out of all the -L options it is given.
If a -rpath option is <br>
used, the runtime search path will be formed exclusively
using the -rpath options, ignoring the -L options. This can
be useful when using gcc, which adds many -L options <br>
which may be on NFS mounted file systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For compatibility with other ELF
linkers, if the -R option is followed by a directory name,
rather than a file name, it is treated as the -rpath
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rpath-link=dir <br>
When using ELF or SunOS, one shared library may require
another. This happens when an &quot;ld -shared&quot; link
includes a shared library as one of the input files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the linker encounters such
a dependency when doing a non-shared, non-relocatable link,
it will automatically try to locate the required shared
library and include it in <br>
the link, if it is not included explicitly. In such a case,
the -rpath-link option specifies the first set of
directories to search. The -rpath-link option may specify a
<br>
sequence of directory names either by specifying a list of
names separated by colons, or by appearing multiple
times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option should be used with
caution as it overrides the search path that may have been
hard compiled into a shared library. In such a case it is
possible to use <br>
unintentionally a different search path than the runtime
linker would do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The linker uses the following
search paths to locate required shared libraries:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Any directories specified by
-rpath-link options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Any directories specified by
-rpath options. The difference between -rpath and
-rpath-link is that directories specified by -rpath options
are included in the executable <br>
and used at runtime, whereas the -rpath-link option is only
effective at link time. Searching -rpath in this way is only
supported by native linkers and cross linkers <br>
which have been configured with the --with-sysroot
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. On an ELF system, for native
linkers, if the -rpath and -rpath-link options were not
used, search the contents of the environment variable
&quot;LD_RUN_PATH&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. On SunOS, if the -rpath
option was not used, search any directories specified using
-L options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. For a native linker, search
the contents of the environment variable
&quot;LD_LIBRARY_PATH&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. For a native ELF linker, the
directories in &quot;DT_RUNPATH&quot; or
&quot;DT_RPATH&quot; of a shared library are searched for
shared libraries needed by it. The &quot;DT_RPATH&quot;
entries are <br>
ignored if &quot;DT_RUNPATH&quot; entries exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. The default directories,
normally /lib and /usr/lib.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. For a native linker on an ELF
system, if the file /etc/ld.so.conf exists, the list of
directories found in that file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the required shared library
is not found, the linker will issue a warning and continue
with the link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-shared <br>
-Bshareable <br>
Create a shared library. This is currently only supported on
ELF, XCOFF and SunOS platforms. On SunOS, the linker will
automatically create a shared library if the -e <br>
option is not used and there are undefined symbols in the
link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sort-common <br>
--sort-common=ascending <br>
--sort-common=descending <br>
This option tells ld to sort the common symbols by alignment
in ascending or descending order when it places them in the
appropriate output sections. The symbol alignments <br>
considered are sixteen-byte or larger, eight-byte,
four-byte, two-byte, and one-byte. This is to prevent gaps
between symbols due to alignment constraints. If no sorting
<br>
order is specified, then descending order is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sort-section=name <br>
This option will apply &quot;SORT_BY_NAME&quot; to all
wildcard section patterns in the linker script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sort-section=alignment <br>
This option will apply &quot;SORT_BY_ALIGNMENT&quot; to all
wildcard section patterns in the linker script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--split-by-file[=size] <br>
Similar to --split-by-reloc but creates a new output section
for each input file when size is reached. size defaults to a
size of 1 if not given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--split-by-reloc[=count] <br>
Tries to creates extra sections in the output file so that
no single output section in the file contains more than
count relocations. This is useful when generating huge <br>
relocatable files for downloading into certain real time
kernels with the COFF object file format; since COFF cannot
represent more than 65535 relocations in a single <br>
section. Note that this will fail to work with object file
formats which do not support arbitrary sections. The linker
will not split up individual input sections for <br>
redistribution, so if a single input section contains more
than count relocations one output section will contain that
many relocations. count defaults to a value of 32768.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stats <br>
Compute and display statistics about the operation of the
linker, such as execution time and memory usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sysroot=directory <br>
Use directory as the location of the sysroot, overriding the
configure-time default. This option is only supported by
linkers that were configured using --with-sysroot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--traditional-format <br>
For some targets, the output of ld is different in some ways
from the output of some existing linker. This switch
requests ld to use the traditional format instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, on SunOS, ld
combines duplicate entries in the symbol string table. This
can reduce the size of an output file with full debugging
information by over 30 <br>
percent. Unfortunately, the SunOS &quot;dbx&quot; program
can not read the resulting program (&quot;gdb&quot; has no
trouble). The --traditional-format switch tells ld to not
combine duplicate <br>
entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--section-start=sectionname=org
<br>
Locate a section in the output file at the absolute address
given by org. You may use this option as many times as
necessary to locate multiple sections in the command line.
<br>
org must be a single hexadecimal integer; for compatibility
with other linkers, you may omit the leading 0x usually
associated with hexadecimal values. Note: there should be
<br>
no white space between sectionname, the equals sign
(&quot;=&quot;), and org.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Tbss=org <br>
-Tdata=org <br>
-Ttext=org <br>
Same as --section-start, with &quot;.bss&quot;,
&quot;.data&quot; or &quot;.text&quot; as the
sectionname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ttext-segment=org <br>
When creating an ELF executable or shared object, it will
set the address of the first byte of the text segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Trodata-segment=org <br>
When creating an ELF executable or shared object for a
target where the read-only data is in its own segment
separate from the executable text, it will set the address
of the <br>
first byte of the read-only data segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Tldata-segment=org <br>
When creating an ELF executable or shared object for x86-64
medium memory model, it will set the address of the first
byte of the ldata segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unresolved-symbols=method <br>
Determine how to handle unresolved symbols. There are four
possible values for method:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignore-all <br>
Do not report any unresolved symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">report-all <br>
Report all unresolved symbols. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignore-in-object-files <br>
Report unresolved symbols that are contained in shared
libraries, but ignore them if they come from regular object
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignore-in-shared-libs <br>
Report unresolved symbols that come from regular object
files, but ignore them if they come from shared libraries.
This can be useful when creating a dynamic binary and <br>
it is known that all the shared libraries that it should be
referencing are included on the linker&rsquo;s command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The behaviour for shared
libraries on their own can also be controlled by the
--[no-]allow-shlib-undefined option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally the linker will
generate an error message for each reported unresolved
symbol but the option --warn-unresolved-symbols can change
this to a warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dll-verbose <br>
--verbose[=NUMBER] <br>
Display the version number for ld and list the linker
emulations supported. Display which input files can and
cannot be opened. Display the linker script being used by
the <br>
linker. If the optional NUMBER argument &gt; 1, plugin
symbol status will also be displayed.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version-script=version-scriptfile
<br>
Specify the name of a version script to the linker. This is
typically used when creating shared libraries to specify
additional information about the version hierarchy for <br>
the library being created. This option is only fully
supported on ELF platforms which support shared libraries;
see VERSION. It is partially supported on PE platforms, <br>
which can use version scripts to filter symbol visibility in
auto-export mode: any symbols marked local in the version
script will not be exported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--warn-common <br>
Warn when a common symbol is combined with another common
symbol or with a symbol definition. Unix linkers allow this
somewhat sloppy practice, but linkers on some other <br>
operating systems do not. This option allows you to find
potential problems from combining global symbols.
Unfortunately, some C libraries use this practice, so you
may get <br>
some warnings about symbols in the libraries as well as in
your programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are three kinds of global
symbols, illustrated here by C examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int i = 1; <br>
A definition, which goes in the initialized data section of
the output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extern int i; <br>
An undefined reference, which does not allocate space. There
must be either a definition or a common symbol for the
variable somewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int i; <br>
A common symbol. If there are only (one or more) common
symbols for a variable, it goes in the uninitialized data
area of the output file. The linker merges multiple <br>
common symbols for the same variable into a single symbol.
If they are of different sizes, it picks the largest size.
The linker turns a common symbol into a <br>
declaration, if there is a definition of the same
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --warn-common option can
produce five kinds of warnings. Each warning consists of a
pair of lines: the first describes the symbol just
encountered, and the second <br>
describes the previous symbol encountered with the same
name. One or both of the two symbols will be a common
symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Turning a common symbol into
a reference, because there is already a definition for the
symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;):
warning: common of &lsquo;&lt;symbol&gt;&rsquo; <br>
overridden by definition <br>
&lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: defined here</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Turning a common symbol into
a reference, because a later definition for the symbol is
encountered. This is the same as the previous case, except
that the symbols are <br>
encountered in a different order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;):
warning: definition of &lsquo;&lt;symbol&gt;&rsquo; <br>
overriding common <br>
&lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: common is here</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Merging a common symbol with
a previous same-sized common symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;):
warning: multiple common <br>
of &lsquo;&lt;symbol&gt;&rsquo; <br>
&lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: previous common is
here</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Merging a common symbol with
a previous larger common symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;):
warning: common of &lsquo;&lt;symbol&gt;&rsquo; <br>
overridden by larger common <br>
&lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: larger common is
here</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Merging a common symbol with
a previous smaller common symbol. This is the same as the
previous case, except that the symbols are encountered in a
different order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;):
warning: common of &lsquo;&lt;symbol&gt;&rsquo; <br>
overriding smaller common <br>
&lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: smaller common is
here</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--warn-constructors <br>
Warn if any global constructors are used. This is only
useful for a few object file formats. For formats like COFF
or ELF, the linker can not detect the use of global <br>
constructors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--warn-multiple-gp <br>
Warn if multiple global pointer values are required in the
output file. This is only meaningful for certain processors,
such as the Alpha. Specifically, some processors put <br>
large-valued constants in a special section. A special
register (the global pointer) points into the middle of this
section, so that constants can be loaded efficiently via
<br>
a base-register relative addressing mode. Since the offset
in base-register relative mode is fixed and relatively small
(e.g., 16 bits), this limits the maximum size of the <br>
constant pool. Thus, in large programs, it is often
necessary to use multiple global pointer values in order to
be able to address all possible constants. This option <br>
causes a warning to be issued whenever this case occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--warn-once <br>
Only warn once for each undefined symbol, rather than once
per module which refers to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--warn-section-align <br>
Warn if the address of an output section is changed because
of alignment. Typically, the alignment will be set by an
input section. The address will only be changed if it <br>
not explicitly specified; that is, if the
&quot;SECTIONS&quot; command does not specify a start
address for the section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--warn-shared-textrel <br>
Warn if the linker adds a DT_TEXTREL to a shared object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--warn-alternate-em <br>
Warn if an object has alternate ELF machine code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--warn-unresolved-symbols <br>
If the linker is going to report an unresolved symbol (see
the option --unresolved-symbols) it will normally generate
an error. This option makes it generate a warning <br>
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--error-unresolved-symbols <br>
This restores the linker&rsquo;s default behaviour of
generating errors when it is reporting unresolved
symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--whole-archive <br>
For each archive mentioned on the command line after the
--whole-archive option, include every object file in the
archive in the link, rather than searching the archive for
<br>
the required object files. This is normally used to turn an
archive file into a shared library, forcing every object to
be included in the resulting shared library. This <br>
option may be used more than once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two notes when using this option
from gcc: First, gcc doesn&rsquo;t know about this option,
so you have to use -Wl,-whole-archive. Second, don&rsquo;t
forget to use <br>
-Wl,-no-whole-archive after your list of archives, because
gcc will add its own list of archives to your link and you
may not want this flag to affect those as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--wrap=symbol <br>
Use a wrapper function for symbol. Any undefined reference
to symbol will be resolved to &quot;__wrap_symbol&quot;. Any
undefined reference to &quot;__real_symbol&quot; will be
resolved to <br>
symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be used to provide a
wrapper for a system function. The wrapper function should
be called &quot;__wrap_symbol&quot;. If it wishes to call
the system function, it should call <br>
&quot;__real_symbol&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a trivial example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void * <br>
__wrap_malloc (size_t c) <br>
{ <br>
printf (&quot;malloc called with %zu0, c); <br>
return __real_malloc (c); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you link other code with this
file using --wrap malloc, then all calls to
&quot;malloc&quot; will call the function
&quot;__wrap_malloc&quot; instead. The call to
&quot;__real_malloc&quot; in <br>
&quot;__wrap_malloc&quot; will call the real
&quot;malloc&quot; function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may wish to provide a
&quot;__real_malloc&quot; function as well, so that links
without the --wrap option will succeed. If you do this, you
should not put the definition of <br>
&quot;__real_malloc&quot; in the same file as
&quot;__wrap_malloc&quot;; if you do, the assembler may
resolve the call before the linker has a chance to wrap it
to &quot;malloc&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--eh-frame-hdr <br>
Request creation of &quot;.eh_frame_hdr&quot; section and
ELF &quot;PT_GNU_EH_FRAME&quot; segment header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-ld-generated-unwind-info
<br>
Request creation of &quot;.eh_frame&quot; unwind info for
linker generated code sections like PLT. This option is on
by default if linker generated unwind info is supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable-new-dtags <br>
--disable-new-dtags <br>
This linker can create the new dynamic tags in ELF. But the
older ELF systems may not understand them. If you specify
--enable-new-dtags, the new dynamic tags will be created
<br>
as needed and older dynamic tags will be omitted. If you
specify --disable-new-dtags, no new dynamic tags will be
created. By default, the new dynamic tags are not created.
<br>
Note that those options are only available for ELF
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hash-size=number <br>
Set the default size of the linker&rsquo;s hash tables to a
prime number close to number. Increasing this value can
reduce the length of time it takes the linker to perform its
<br>
tasks, at the expense of increasing the linker&rsquo;s
memory requirements. Similarly reducing this value can
reduce the memory requirements at the expense of speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hash-style=style <br>
Set the type of linker&rsquo;s hash table(s). style can be
either &quot;sysv&quot; for classic ELF &quot;.hash&quot;
section, &quot;gnu&quot; for new style GNU
&quot;.gnu.hash&quot; section or &quot;both&quot; for both
the <br>
classic ELF &quot;.hash&quot; and new style GNU
&quot;.gnu.hash&quot; hash tables. The default is
&quot;sysv&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reduce-memory-overheads <br>
This option reduces memory requirements at ld runtime, at
the expense of linking speed. This was introduced to select
the old O(n^2) algorithm for link map file generation, <br>
rather than the new O(n) algorithm which uses about 40% more
memory for symbol storage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another effect of the switch is
to set the default hash table size to 1021, which again
saves memory at the cost of lengthening the linker&rsquo;s
run time. This is not done <br>
however if the --hash-size switch has been used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --reduce-memory-overheads
switch may be also be used to enable other tradeoffs in
future versions of the linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--build-id <br>
--build-id=style <br>
Request creation of &quot;.note.gnu.build-id&quot; ELF note
section. The contents of the note are unique bits
identifying this linked file. style can be &quot;uuid&quot;
to use 128 random <br>
bits, &quot;sha1&quot; to use a 160-bit SHA1 hash on the
normative parts of the output contents, &quot;md5&quot; to
use a 128-bit MD5 hash on the normative parts of the output
contents, or <br>
&quot;0xhexstring&quot; to use a chosen bit string specified
as an even number of hexadecimal digits (&quot;-&quot; and
&quot;:&quot; characters between digit pairs are ignored).
If style is omitted, <br>
&quot;sha1&quot; is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;md5&quot; and
&quot;sha1&quot; styles produces an identifier that is
always the same in an identical output file, but will be
unique among all nonidentical output files. It is not <br>
intended to be compared as a checksum for the file&rsquo;s
contents. A linked file may be changed later by other tools,
but the build ID bit string identifying the original linked
<br>
file does not change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Passing &quot;none&quot; for
style disables the setting from any &quot;--build-id&quot;
options earlier on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The i386 PE linker supports the
-shared option, which causes the output to be a dynamically
linked library (DLL) instead of a normal executable. You
should name the output <br>
&quot;*.dll&quot; when you use this option. In addition, the
linker fully supports the standard &quot;*.def&quot; files,
which may be specified on the linker command line like an
object file (in <br>
fact, it should precede archives it exports symbols from, to
ensure that they get linked in, just like a normal object
file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the options
common to all targets, the i386 PE linker support additional
command line options that are specific to the i386 PE
target. Options that take values <br>
may be separated from their values by either a space or an
equals sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--add-stdcall-alias <br>
If given, symbols with a stdcall suffix (@nn) will be
exported as-is and also with the suffix stripped. [This
option is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the
linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--base-file file <br>
Use file as the name of a file in which to save the base
addresses of all the relocations needed for generating DLLs
with dlltool. [This is an i386 PE specific option]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dll <br>
Create a DLL instead of a regular executable. You may also
use -shared or specify a &quot;LIBRARY&quot; in a given
&quot;.def&quot; file. [This option is specific to the i386
PE targeted port <br>
of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable-long-section-names <br>
--disable-long-section-names <br>
The PE variants of the Coff object format add an extension
that permits the use of section names longer than eight
characters, the normal limit for Coff. By default, these
<br>
names are only allowed in object files, as fully-linked
executable images do not carry the Coff string table
required to support the longer names. As a GNU extension, it
is <br>
possible to allow their use in executable images as well, or
to (probably pointlessly!) disallow it in object files, by
using these two options. Executable images generated <br>
with these long section names are slightly non-standard,
carrying as they do a string table, and may generate
confusing output when examined with non-GNU PE-aware tools,
such <br>
as file viewers and dumpers. However, GDB relies on the use
of PE long section names to find Dwarf-2 debug information
sections in an executable image at runtime, and so if <br>
neither option is specified on the command-line, ld will
enable long section names, overriding the default and
technically correct behaviour, when it finds the presence of
<br>
debug information while linking an executable image and not
stripping symbols. [This option is valid for all PE targeted
ports of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable-stdcall-fixup <br>
--disable-stdcall-fixup <br>
If the link finds a symbol that it cannot resolve, it will
attempt to do &quot;fuzzy linking&quot; by looking for
another defined symbol that differs only in the format of
the symbol <br>
name (cdecl vs stdcall) and will resolve that symbol by
linking to the match. For example, the undefined symbol
&quot;_foo&quot; might be linked to the function
&quot;_foo@12&quot;, or the <br>
undefined symbol &quot;_bar@16&quot; might be linked to the
function &quot;_bar&quot;. When the linker does this, it
prints a warning, since it normally should have failed to
link, but <br>
sometimes import libraries generated from third-party dlls
may need this feature to be usable. If you specify
--enable-stdcall-fixup, this feature is fully enabled and
<br>
warnings are not printed. If you specify
--disable-stdcall-fixup, this feature is disabled and such
mismatches are considered to be errors. [This option is
specific to the <br>
i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--leading-underscore <br>
--no-leading-underscore <br>
For most targets default symbol-prefix is an underscore and
is defined in target&rsquo;s description. By this option it
is possible to disable/enable the default underscore symbol-
<br>
prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--export-all-symbols <br>
If given, all global symbols in the objects used to build a
DLL will be exported by the DLL. Note that this is the
default if there otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t be any exported
<br>
symbols. When symbols are explicitly exported via DEF files
or implicitly exported via function attributes, the default
is to not export anything else unless this option is <br>
given. Note that the symbols &quot;DllMain@12&quot;,
&quot;DllEntryPoint@0&quot;,
&quot;DllMainCRTStartup@12&quot;, and &quot;impure_ptr&quot;
will not be automatically exported. Also, symbols imported
from other <br>
DLLs will not be re-exported, nor will symbols specifying
the DLL&rsquo;s internal layout such as those beginning with
&quot;_head_&quot; or ending with &quot;_iname&quot;. In
addition, no symbols <br>
from &quot;libgcc&quot;, &quot;libstd++&quot;,
&quot;libmingw32&quot;, or &quot;crtX.o&quot; will be
exported. Symbols whose names begin with &quot;__rtti_&quot;
or &quot;__builtin_&quot; will not be exported, to help with
C++ DLLs. <br>
Finally, there is an extensive list of cygwin-private
symbols that are not exported (obviously, this applies on
when building DLLs for cygwin targets). These
cygwin-excludes <br>
are: &quot;_cygwin_dll_entry@12&quot;,
&quot;_cygwin_crt0_common@8&quot;,
&quot;_cygwin_noncygwin_dll_entry@12&quot;,
&quot;_fmode&quot;, &quot;_impure_ptr&quot;,
&quot;cygwin_attach_dll&quot;, &quot;cygwin_premain0&quot;,
&quot;cygwin_premain1&quot;, <br>
&quot;cygwin_premain2&quot;, &quot;cygwin_premain3&quot;,
and &quot;environ&quot;. [This option is specific to the
i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-symbols
symbol,symbol,... <br>
Specifies a list of symbols which should not be
automatically exported. The symbol names may be delimited by
commas or colons. [This option is specific to the i386 PE
<br>
targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-all-symbols <br>
Specifies no symbols should be automatically exported. [This
option is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the
linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--file-alignment <br>
Specify the file alignment. Sections in the file will always
begin at file offsets which are multiples of this number.
This defaults to 512. [This option is specific to <br>
the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--heap reserve <br>
--heap reserve,commit <br>
Specify the number of bytes of memory to reserve (and
optionally commit) to be used as heap for this program. The
default is 1MB reserved, 4K committed. [This option is <br>
specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--image-base value <br>
Use value as the base address of your program or dll. This
is the lowest memory location that will be used when your
program or dll is loaded. To reduce the need to <br>
relocate and improve performance of your dlls, each should
have a unique base address and not overlap any other dlls.
The default is 0x400000 for executables, and 0x10000000 <br>
for dlls. [This option is specific to the i386 PE targeted
port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--kill-at <br>
If given, the stdcall suffixes (@nn) will be stripped from
symbols before they are exported. [This option is specific
to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--large-address-aware <br>
If given, the appropriate bit in the
&quot;Characteristics&quot; field of the COFF header is set
to indicate that this executable supports virtual addresses
greater than 2 gigabytes. <br>
This should be used in conjunction with the /3GB or
/USERVA=value megabytes switch in the &quot;[operating
systems]&quot; section of the BOOT.INI. Otherwise, this bit
has no effect. <br>
[This option is specific to PE targeted ports of the
linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-large-address-aware
<br>
Reverts the effect of a previous --large-address-aware
option. This is useful if --large-address-aware is always
set by the compiler driver (e.g. Cygwin gcc) and the <br>
executable does not support virtual addresses greater than 2
gigabytes. [This option is specific to PE targeted ports of
the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--major-image-version value <br>
Sets the major number of the &quot;image version&quot;.
Defaults to 1. [This option is specific to the i386 PE
targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--major-os-version value <br>
Sets the major number of the &quot;os version&quot;.
Defaults to 4. [This option is specific to the i386 PE
targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--major-subsystem-version value
<br>
Sets the major number of the &quot;subsystem version&quot;.
Defaults to 4. [This option is specific to the i386 PE
targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--minor-image-version value <br>
Sets the minor number of the &quot;image version&quot;.
Defaults to 0. [This option is specific to the i386 PE
targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--minor-os-version value <br>
Sets the minor number of the &quot;os version&quot;.
Defaults to 0. [This option is specific to the i386 PE
targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--minor-subsystem-version value
<br>
Sets the minor number of the &quot;subsystem version&quot;.
Defaults to 0. [This option is specific to the i386 PE
targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--output-def file <br>
The linker will create the file file which will contain a
DEF file corresponding to the DLL the linker is generating.
This DEF file (which should be called &quot;*.def&quot;) may
be <br>
used to create an import library with &quot;dlltool&quot; or
may be used as a reference to automatically or implicitly
exported symbols. [This option is specific to the i386 PE
<br>
targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--out-implib file <br>
The linker will create the file file which will contain an
import lib corresponding to the DLL the linker is
generating. This import lib (which should be called
&quot;*.dll.a&quot; or <br>
&quot;*.a&quot; may be used to link clients against the
generated DLL; this behaviour makes it possible to skip a
separate &quot;dlltool&quot; import library creation step.
[This option is <br>
specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable-auto-image-base <br>
Automatically choose the image base for DLLs, unless one is
specified using the &quot;--image-base&quot; argument. By
using a hash generated from the dllname to create unique
image <br>
bases for each DLL, in-memory collisions and relocations
which can delay program execution are avoided. [This option
is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-auto-image-base <br>
Do not automatically generate a unique image base. If there
is no user-specified image base (&quot;--image-base&quot;)
then use the platform default. [This option is specific to
the <br>
i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dll-search-prefix string <br>
When linking dynamically to a dll without an import library,
search for &quot;&lt;string&gt;&lt;basename&gt;.dll&quot; in
preference to &quot;lib&lt;basename&gt;.dll&quot;. This
behaviour allows easy distinction <br>
between DLLs built for the various &quot;subplatforms&quot;:
native, cygwin, uwin, pw, etc. For instance, cygwin DLLs
typically use &quot;--dll-search-prefix=cyg&quot;. [This
option is <br>
specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable-auto-import <br>
Do sophisticated linking of &quot;_symbol&quot; to
&quot;__imp__symbol&quot; for DATA imports from DLLs, and
create the necessary thunking symbols when building the
import libraries with those <br>
DATA exports. Note: Use of the &rsquo;auto-import&rsquo;
extension will cause the text section of the image file to
be made writable. This does not conform to the PE-COFF
format <br>
specification published by Microsoft.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note - use of the
&rsquo;auto-import&rsquo; extension will also cause read
only data which would normally be placed into the .rdata
section to be placed into the .data section instead. <br>
This is in order to work around a problem with consts that
is described here:
http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2004-09/msg01101.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using &rsquo;auto-import&rsquo;
generally will &rsquo;just work&rsquo; -- but sometimes you
may see this message:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;variable
&rsquo;&lt;var&gt;&rsquo; can&rsquo;t be auto-imported.
Please read the documentation for ld&rsquo;s
&quot;--enable-auto-import&quot; for details.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This message occurs when some
(sub)expression accesses an address ultimately given by the
sum of two constants (Win32 import tables only allow one).
Instances where this may <br>
occur include accesses to member fields of struct variables
imported from a DLL, as well as using a constant index into
an array variable imported from a DLL. Any multiword <br>
variable (arrays, structs, long long, etc) may trigger this
error condition. However, regardless of the exact data type
of the offending exported variable, ld will always <br>
detect it, issue the warning, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several ways to
address this difficulty, regardless of the data type of the
exported variable:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One way is to use
--enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc switch. This leaves the task
of adjusting references in your client code for runtime
environment, so this method works only <br>
when runtime environment supports this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A second solution is to force
one of the &rsquo;constants&rsquo; to be a variable -- that
is, unknown and un-optimizable at compile time. For arrays,
there are two possibilities: a) <br>
make the indexee (the array&rsquo;s address) a variable, or
b) make the &rsquo;constant&rsquo; index a variable.
Thus:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extern type extern_array[]; <br>
extern_array[1] --&gt; <br>
{ volatile type *t=extern_array; t[1] }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extern type extern_array[]; <br>
extern_array[1] --&gt; <br>
{ volatile int t=1; extern_array[t] }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For structs (and most other
multiword data types) the only option is to make the struct
itself (or the long long, or the ...) variable:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extern struct s extern_struct;
<br>
extern_struct.field --&gt; <br>
{ volatile struct s *t=&amp;extern_struct; t-&gt;field }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extern long long extern_ll; <br>
extern_ll --&gt; <br>
{ volatile long long * local_ll=&amp;extern_ll; *local_ll
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A third method of dealing with
this difficulty is to abandon &rsquo;auto-import&rsquo; for
the offending symbol and mark it with
&quot;__declspec(dllimport)&quot;. However, in practice that
<br>
requires using compile-time #defines to indicate whether you
are building a DLL, building client code that will link to
the DLL, or merely building/linking to a static <br>
library. In making the choice between the various methods of
resolving the &rsquo;direct address with constant
offset&rsquo; problem, you should consider typical
real-world usage:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Original:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--foo.h <br>
extern int arr[]; <br>
--foo.c <br>
#include &quot;foo.h&quot; <br>
void main(int argc, char **argv){ <br>
printf(&quot;%d0,arr[1]); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solution 1:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--foo.h <br>
extern int arr[]; <br>
--foo.c <br>
#include &quot;foo.h&quot; <br>
void main(int argc, char **argv){ <br>
/* This workaround is for win32 and cygwin; do not
&quot;optimize&quot; */ <br>
volatile int *parr = arr; <br>
printf(&quot;%d0,parr[1]); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solution 2:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--foo.h <br>
/* Note: auto-export is assumed (no __declspec(dllexport))
*/ <br>
#if (defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)) &amp;&amp;
!(defined(FOO_BUILD_DLL) || defined(FOO_STATIC)) <br>
#define FOO_IMPORT __declspec(dllimport) <br>
#else <br>
#define FOO_IMPORT <br>
#endif <br>
extern FOO_IMPORT int arr[]; <br>
--foo.c <br>
#include &quot;foo.h&quot; <br>
void main(int argc, char **argv){ <br>
printf(&quot;%d0,arr[1]); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A fourth way to avoid this
problem is to re-code your library to use a functional
interface rather than a data interface for the offending
variables (e.g. set_foo() and <br>
get_foo() accessor functions). [This option is specific to
the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-auto-import <br>
Do not attempt to do sophisticated linking of
&quot;_symbol&quot; to &quot;__imp__symbol&quot; for DATA
imports from DLLs. [This option is specific to the i386 PE
targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc
<br>
If your code contains expressions described in
--enable-auto-import section, that is, DATA imports from DLL
with non-zero offset, this switch will create a vector of
&rsquo;runtime <br>
pseudo relocations&rsquo; which can be used by runtime
environment to adjust references to such data in your client
code. [This option is specific to the i386 PE targeted port
of <br>
the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-runtime-pseudo-reloc
<br>
Do not create pseudo relocations for non-zero offset DATA
imports from DLLs. [This option is specific to the i386 PE
targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable-extra-pe-debug <br>
Show additional debug info related to auto-import symbol
thunking. [This option is specific to the i386 PE targeted
port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--section-alignment <br>
Sets the section alignment. Sections in memory will always
begin at addresses which are a multiple of this number.
Defaults to 0x1000. [This option is specific to the i386
<br>
PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stack reserve <br>
--stack reserve,commit <br>
Specify the number of bytes of memory to reserve (and
optionally commit) to be used as stack for this program. The
default is 2MB reserved, 4K committed. [This option is <br>
specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--subsystem which <br>
--subsystem which:major <br>
--subsystem which:major.minor <br>
Specifies the subsystem under which your program will
execute. The legal values for which are &quot;native&quot;,
&quot;windows&quot;, &quot;console&quot;, &quot;posix&quot;,
and &quot;xbox&quot;. You may optionally set <br>
the subsystem version also. Numeric values are also accepted
for which. [This option is specific to the i386 PE targeted
port of the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options set flags
in the &quot;DllCharacteristics&quot; field of the PE file
header: [These options are specific to PE targeted ports of
the linker]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dynamicbase <br>
The image base address may be relocated using address space
layout randomization (ASLR). This feature was introduced
with MS Windows Vista for i386 PE targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--forceinteg <br>
Code integrity checks are enforced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nxcompat <br>
The image is compatible with the Data Execution Prevention.
This feature was introduced with MS Windows XP SP2 for i386
PE targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-isolation <br>
Although the image understands isolation, do not isolate the
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-seh <br>
The image does not use SEH. No SE handler may be called from
this image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-bind <br>
Do not bind this image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--wdmdriver <br>
The driver uses the MS Windows Driver Model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tsaware <br>
The image is Terminal Server aware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--insert-timestamp <br>
Insert a real timestamp into the image, rather than the
default value of zero. This will result in a slightly
different results with each invocation, which could be
helpful <br>
for distributing unique images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The C6X uClinux target uses a
binary format called DSBT to support shared libraries. Each
shared library in the system needs to have a unique index;
all executables use an index <br>
of 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dsbt-size size <br>
This option sets the number of entires in the DSBT of the
current executable or shared library to size. The default is
to create a table with 64 entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dsbt-index index <br>
This option sets the DSBT index of the current executable or
shared library to index. The default is 0, which is
appropriate for generating executables. If a shared library
<br>
is generated with a DSBT index of 0, the
&quot;R_C6000_DSBT_INDEX&quot; relocs are copied into the
output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --no-merge-exidx-entries
switch disables the merging of adjacent exidx entries in
frame unwind info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The 68HC11 and 68HC12 linkers
support specific options to control the memory bank
switching mapping and trampoline code generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-trampoline <br>
This option disables the generation of trampoline. By
default a trampoline is generated for each far function
which is called using a &quot;jsr&quot; instruction (this
happens when a <br>
pointer to a far function is taken).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bank-window name <br>
This option indicates to the linker the name of the memory
region in the MEMORY specification that describes the memory
bank window. The definition of such region is then <br>
used by the linker to compute paging and addresses within
the memory window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
supported to control handling of GOT generation when linking
for 68K targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--got=type <br>
This option tells the linker which GOT generation scheme to
use. type should be one of single, negative, multigot or
target. For more information refer to the Info entry <br>
for ld.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
supported to control microMIPS instruction generation when
linking for MIPS targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--insn32 <br>
--no-insn32 <br>
These options control the choice of microMIPS instructions
used in code generated by the linker, such as that in the
PLT or lazy binding stubs, or in relaxation. If --insn32
<br>
is used, then the linker only uses 32-bit instruction
encodings. By default or if --no-insn32 is used, all
instruction encodings are used, including 16-bit ones where
<br>
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
You can change the behaviour of ld with the environment
variables &quot;GNUTARGET&quot;, &quot;LDEMULATION&quot; and
&quot;COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;GNUTARGET&quot; determines
the input-file object format if you don&rsquo;t use -b (or
its synonym --format). Its value should be one of the BFD
names for an input format. If there is no <br>
&quot;GNUTARGET&quot; in the environment, ld uses the
natural format of the target. If &quot;GNUTARGET&quot; is
set to &quot;default&quot; then BFD attempts to discover the
input format by examining binary <br>
input files; this method often succeeds, but there are
potential ambiguities, since there is no method of ensuring
that the magic number used to specify object-file formats is
<br>
unique. However, the configuration procedure for BFD on each
system places the conventional format for that system first
in the search-list, so ambiguities are resolved in favor
<br>
of convention.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;LDEMULATION&quot;
determines the default emulation if you don&rsquo;t use the
-m option. The emulation can affect various aspects of
linker behaviour, particularly the default linker <br>
script. You can list the available emulations with the
--verbose or -V options. If the -m option is not used, and
the &quot;LDEMULATION&quot; environment variable is not
defined, the <br>
default emulation depends upon how the linker was
configured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, the linker will
default to demangling symbols. However, if
&quot;COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE&quot; is set in the environment,
then it will default to not demangling symbols. This <br>
environment variable is used in a similar fashion by the
&quot;gcc&quot; linker wrapper program. The default may be
overridden by the --demangle and --no-demangle options.</p>
