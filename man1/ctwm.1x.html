<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ctwm - Claude&rsquo;s Tab Window Manager for the X Window
System</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX <br>
ctwm [-display dpy] [-s] [-cfgchk] [-f initfile] [-v] [-n]
[-k] [-K m4file] [-w [win-id]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ctwm is a window manager for the X Window System. It
provides titlebars, shaped windows, virtual screens
(workspaces), several forms of icon management, user-defined
macro func&acirc; <br>
tions, click-to-type and pointer-driven keyboard focus, and
user-specified key and pointer button bindings. It is
actually twm(1) (Tab Window Manager) from the MIT X11
distribu&acirc; <br>
tion slightly modified to accommodate the use of several
virtual screens (workspaces). It is heavily inspired from
the Hewlett-Packard vuewm window manager. In addition, ctwm
can <br>
use coloured, shaped icons and background root pixmaps in
XPM format [from Arnaud Le Hors], any format understood by
the imconv package [from the San Diego Supercomputer
Center], <br>
and xwd files. ctwm can be compiled to use both, either or
none of the above icon/pixmap formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program is usually started
by the user&rsquo;s session manager or startup script. When
used from xdm(1) or xinit(1) without a session manager, ctwm
is frequently executed in the <br>
foreground as the last client. When run this way, exiting
ctwm causes the session to be terminated (i.e. logged
out).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, application windows
are surrounded by a &acirc;frame&acirc; with a titlebar at
the top and a special border around the window. The titlebar
contains the window&rsquo;s name, a rectan&acirc; <br>
gle that is lit when the window is receiving keyboard input,
and function boxes known as &acirc;titlebuttons&acirc; at
the left and right edges of the titlebar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pressing pointer Button1
(usually the left-most button unless it has been changed
with xmodmap) on a titlebutton will invoke the function
associated with the button. In the <br>
default interface, windows are iconified by clicking
(pressing and then immediately releasing) the left
titlebutton (which looks like a Dot). Conversely, windows
are deiconified <br>
by clicking in the associated icon or entry in the icon
manager (see description of the variable ShowIconManager and
of the function f.showiconmgr).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windows are resized by pressing
the right titlebutton (which resembles a group of nested
squares), dragging the pointer over edge that is to be
moved, and releasing the pointer <br>
when the outline of the window is the desired size.
Similarly, windows are moved by pressing in the title or
highlight region, dragging a window outline to the new
location, and <br>
then releasing when the outline is in the desired position.
Just clicking in the title or highlight region raises the
window without moving it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When new windows are created,
ctwm will honor any size and location information requested
by the user (usually through -geometry command line argument
or resources for the indi&acirc; <br>
vidual applications). Otherwise, an outline of the
window&rsquo;s default size, its titlebar, and lines
dividing the window into a 3x3 grid that track the pointer
are displayed. <br>
Clicking pointer Button1 will position the window at the
current position and give it the default size. Pressing
pointer Button2 (usually the middle pointer button) and
dragging <br>
the outline will give the window its current position but
allow the sides to be resized as described above. Clicking
pointer Button3 (usually the right pointer button) will give
<br>
the window its current position but attempt to make it long
enough to touch the bottom the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
ctwm accepts the following command line options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display dpy <br>
This option specifies the X server to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s This option indicates that
only the default screen (as specified by -display or by the
DISPLAY environment variable) should be managed. By default,
ctwm will attempt to <br>
manage all screens on the display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cfgchk This option causes ctwm
to only try to parse the config file, and indicate whether
errors are found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filename <br>
This option specifies the name of the startup file to use.
ctwm will first try to load filename.num, where num is the
screen number. If it fails, it will try to load <br>
filename. By default, ctwm will look in the user&rsquo;s
home directory for files named .ctwmrc.num, .ctwmrc,
.twmrc.num, or .twmrc (where num is a screen number).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v This option indicates that
ctwm should print error messages whenever an unexpected X
Error event is received. This can be useful when debugging
applications but can be <br>
distracting in regular use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n This option indicates that
ctwm should not filter the startup file through m4.
Available only if ctwm is compiled with the USEM4 flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k This option indicates that
ctwm should keep the definitions it prepends to your startup
file when filtering through m4 in /tmp. Available only if
ctwm is compiled with <br>
the USEM4 flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K m4file <br>
This option indicates that ctwm should keep the result of
filtering your startup file through m4 in the named file.
Available only if ctwm is compiled with the USEM4 <br>
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
ctwm just prints its version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-info ctwm prints its detailed
version and compile time options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w [win-id] <br>
If -w is specified without a win-id value, ctwm does not
take over the whole screen(s), instead it creates a new
window that becomes its root window. if the win-id value
<br>
is given, it is considered to be the id of an existing
window, in which case, ctwm will try to use this window as
root window. You can run any number of instantiation of <br>
ctwm at the same time. You can even have embedded ctwm
instantiations. This is totally useless, but I like it. The
f.adoptwindow function can be used to capture an
exist&acirc; <br>
ing window belonging to another ctwm. A possible use of such
mode can be to test new configuration file without
restarting ctwm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W This option tells ctwm not to
display any welcome when starting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CUSTOMIZATION <br>
Much of ctwm&rsquo;s appearance and behavior can be
controlled by providing a startup file in one of the
following locations (searched in order for each screen being
managed when ctwm <br>
begins):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.ctwmrc.screennumber <br>
The screennumber is a small positive number (e.g. 0, 1,
etc.) representing the screen number (e.g. the last number
in the DISPLAY environment variable host:dis&acirc; <br>
playnum.screennum) that would be used to contact that screen
of the display. This is intended for displays with multiple
screens of differing visual types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.ctwmrc <br>
This is the usual name for an individual user&rsquo;s
startup file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.twmrc.screennumber</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.twmrc <br>
The users twm startup file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/lib/X11/twm/system.ctwmrc
<br>
If none of the preceding files are found, ctwm will look in
this file for a default configuration. This is often
tailored by the site administrator to provide convenient
<br>
menus or familiar bindings for novice users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no startup files are found,
ctwm will use the built-in defaults described above. The
only resource used by ctwm is bitmapFilePath for a
colon-separated list of directories to <br>
search when looking for bitmap files (for more information,
see the Athena Widgets manual and xrdb(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ctwm startup files are logically
broken up into three types of specifications: Variables,
Bindings, Menus. The Variables section must come first and
is used to describe the <br>
fonts, colors, cursors, border widths, icon and window
placement, highlighting, autoraising, layout of titles,
warping, use of the icon manager. The Bindings section
usually <br>
comes second and is used to specify the functions that
should be to be invoked when keyboard and pointer buttons
are pressed in windows, icons, titles, and frames. The Menus
<br>
section gives any user-defined menus (containing functions
to be invoked or commands to be executed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable names and keywords are
case-insensitive. Strings must be surrounded by double quote
characters (e.g. &acirc;blue&acirc;) and are case-sensitive.
A pound sign (#) outside of a <br>
string causes the remainder of the line in which the
character appears to be treated as a comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M4 PREPROCESSING <br>
ctwm uses m4(1) to pre-process its setup files. When ctwm
starts up, it opens a file for input as described above.
But, it processes that file through m4 before parsing it.
So, <br>
you can use m4 macros to perform operations at runtime. This
makes it very easy to work when you use many different
displays, with different characteristics. For example, If
<br>
you want to set the lower right section of the screen to be
your IconRegion, (see below for details on the IconRegion
variable) you can use m4 directives and pre-defined symbols
<br>
to calculate the region you want. For example: <br>
define(IRegion,
translit(eval(WIDTH/3)*eval(HEIGHT/2)+eval(WIDTH-WIDTH/3)-0,
*, x)) <br>
IconRegion &quot;IRegion&quot; SOUTH EAST 75 25 <br>
will define the lower half, and right-hand third of the
screen. The above makes use of symbols that are predefined
in m4 by ctwm. The symbols WIDTH and HEIGHT are calculated
by <br>
ctwm and written into a temporary file for m4 to use. The
following symbols are predefined by ctwm:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SERVERHOST This variable is set
to the name of the machine that is running the X server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLIENTHOST The machine that is
running the clients. (ie, ctwm)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTNAME The canonical hostname
running the clients. (ie. a fully-qualified version of
CLIENTHOST)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER The name of the user
running the program. Gotten from the environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME The user&rsquo;s home
directory. Gotten from the environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PIXMAP_DIRECTORY <br>
The directory where the ctwm pictures are installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION The X major protocol
version. As seen by ProtocolVersion(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REVISION The X minor protocol
revision. As seen by ProtocolRevision(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VENDOR The vendor of your X
server. For example: MIT X Consortium.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RELEASE The release number of
your X server. For MIT X11R5, this is 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WIDTH The width of your display
in pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HEIGHT The height of your
display in pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X_RESOLUTION The X resolution of
your display in pixels per meter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Y_RESOLUTION The Y resolution of
your display in pixels per meter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLANES The number of bit planes
your display supports in the default root window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BITS_PER_RGB The number of
significant bits in an RGB color. (log base 2 of the number
of distinct colors that can be created. This is often
different from the number of <br>
colors that can be displayed at once.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TWM_TYPE Tells which twm
offshoot is running. It will always be set to the string
&acirc;ctwm&acirc; in this program. This is useful for
protecting parts of your .twmrc file that <br>
ctwm proper won&rsquo;t understand (like WorkSpaces) so that
it is still usable with other twm programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TWM_VERSION Tells which ctwm
version is running in the form of a floating point
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLASS Your visual class. Will
return one of StaticGray, GrayScale, StaticColor,
PseudoColor, TrueColor, DirectColor, or, if it cannot
determine what you have, NonStan&acirc; <br>
dard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLOR This will be either
&acirc;Yes&acirc; or &acirc;No&acirc;. This is just a
wrapper around the above definition. Returns
&acirc;Yes&acirc; on *Color, and &acirc;No&acirc; on
StaticGray and GrayScale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XPM Is defined only if ctwm was
compiled with XPM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JPEG Is defined only if ctwm was
compiled with JPEG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMCONV Is defined only if ctwm
was compiled with IMCONV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GNOME Is defined only if ctwm
was compiled with GNOME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOUNDS Is defined only if ctwm
was compiled with USE_SOUND.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SESSION Is defined only if ctwm
was compiled with USE_SESSION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I18N Is defined only if ctwm was
compiled with I18N.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TWM_CAPTIVE This will be either
&acirc;Yes&acirc; or &acirc;No&acirc;. &acirc;Yes&acirc; if
the current ctwm is captive (flag -w), &acirc;No&acirc; in
the other case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TWM_CAPTIVE_NAME <br>
Defined only if TWM_CAPTIVE is also defined. Contains the
name of the captive ctwm (-name flag);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may well find that if you
research the m4(1) manual well, and understand the power of
m4, this will be a very useful and powerful tool. But, if
you use any of the symbols <br>
which are predefined by m4, you are in severe danger! For
example, the Sun m4 predefines shift, so if you use that
name in your .ctwmrc, you are out of luck.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The availability of the m4
preprocessing is subject to the compilation define
USEM4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VARIABLES <br>
Many of the aspects of ctwm&rsquo;s user interface are
controlled by variables that may be set in the user&rsquo;s
startup file. Some of the options are enabled or disabled
simply by the <br>
presence of a particular keyword. Other options require
keywords, numbers, strings, or lists of all of these.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lists are surrounded by braces
and are usually separated by whitespace or a newline. For
example: <br>
AutoRaise { &quot;emacs&quot; &quot;XTerm&quot;
&quot;Xmh&quot; } <br>
or <br>
AutoRaise <br>
{ <br>
&quot;emacs&quot; <br>
&quot;XTerm&quot; <br>
&quot;Xmh&quot; <br>
} <br>
When a variable containing a list of strings representing
windows is searched (e.g. to determine whether or not to
enable autoraise as shown above), a string must be an exact,
<br>
case-sensitive match to the window&rsquo;s name (given by
the WM_NAME window property), resource name or class name
(both given by the WM_CLASS window property). The preceding
example <br>
would enable autoraise on windows named &acirc;emacs&acirc;
as well as any xterm (since they are of class
&acirc;XTerm&acirc;) or xmh windows (which are of class
&acirc;Xmh&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">String arguments that are
interpreted as filenames (see the Pixmaps, Cursors, and
IconDirectory below) will prepend the user&rsquo;s directory
(specified by the HOME environment vari&acirc; <br>
able) if the first character is a tilde (~). If, instead,
the first character is a colon (:), the name is assumed to
refer to one of the internal bitmaps that are used to create
<br>
the default titlebars symbols: :xlogo or :iconify (both
refer to the X used for the iconify button), :resize (the
nested squares used by the resize button), and :question
(the <br>
question mark used for non-existent bitmap files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following variables may be
specified at the top of a ctwm startup file. Lists of window
name prefix strings are indicated by win-list. Optional
arguments are shown in <br>
square brackets:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AlwaysOnTop { win-list } <br>
This variable specifies a list of windows (all windows if
the list is defaulted) that ctwm will try its best to
maintain on top of others. This doesn&rsquo;t work in all
case.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">AlwaysShowWindowWhenMovingFromWorkspaceManager
<br>
When ReallyMoveInWorkspaceManager is present and the user is
moving a window from the WorkSpaceMap, ctwm display the
actual window only if it crosses the current active <br>
workspace. If AlwaysShowWindowWhenMovingFromWorkspaceManager
is present, the actual window is always visible during the
move, regardless of whether it crosses the current <br>
workspace or not. The Shift key toggles this behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AlwaysSqueezeToGravity [{
win-list }] <br>
This variable indicates that ctwm should obey window gravity
when squeezing a window even when the window has a titlebar.
Normally, ctwm will always squeeze a window <br>
that has a titlebar toward the north. The optional win-list
may be used to control which windows this applies on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AnimationSpeed speed <br>
The speed argument is a non-negative integer. It determines
the number of times a second animations (if any) are
updated. If speed is 0, animations are freezed. The <br>
default value is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AutoFocusToTransients <br>
Transient windows get focus automatically when created.
Useful with programs that have keyboard shortcuts that pop
up windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AutoLower { win-list } <br>
This variable specifies a list of windows (all windows if
the list is defaulted) to be automatically lowered whenever
the point leaves a window. This action can be <br>
interactively enabled or disabled on individual windows
using the function f.autolower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AutoOccupy <br>
This variable specifies that clients will automatically
change their occupation when their name or icon name
changes. The new occupation will be recalculated from the
<br>
Occupy and OccupyAll fields in the .ctwmrc file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AutoRaise { win-list } <br>
This variable specifies a list of windows (all windows if
the list is defaulted) to be automatically raised whenever
the pointer has come to rest in a window for the <br>
amount of time specified by the RaiseDelay variable. This
action can be interactively enabled or disabled on
individual windows using the function f.autoraise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AutoRaiseIcons <br>
Icons are raised when the cursor enters it. Useful with
ShrinkIconTitles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AutoRelativeResize <br>
This variable indicates that dragging out a window size
(either when initially sizing the window with pointer
Button2 or when resizing it) should not wait until the <br>
pointer has crossed the window edges. Instead, moving the
pointer automatically causes the nearest edge or edges to
move by the same amount. This allows the resizing of <br>
windows that extend off the edge of the screen. If the
pointer is in the center of the window, or if the resize is
begun by pressing a titlebutton, ctwm will still wait <br>
for the pointer to cross a window edge (to prevent
accidents). This option is particularly useful for people
who like the press-drag-release method of sweeping out
win&acirc; <br>
dow sizes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AutoSqueeze { win-list } <br>
These windows will be auto-squeezed (see f.squeeze). i.e.
automatically unsqueezed when they get focus, and squeezed
when they loose it. Useful for the workspace manager. <br>
Not authorized for icon managers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BeNiceToColormap <br>
By defaults new colors are allocated for shadows when a 3D
look is used, but when you specify BeNiceToColormap ctwm
uses stipling instead of new colors, the effect is <br>
less beautiful, but acceptable. In this case
ClearShadowContrast and DarkShadowContrast have no
effects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BorderBottom pixels <br>
This variable specifies the width in pixels of a forbidden
zone at the bottom of the screen. All constrained window
functions (f.movepack, f.move with DontMoveOff, <br>
etc...) will consider this zone as offscreen. Default is
0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BorderColor string [{
wincolorlist }] <br>
This variable specifies the default color of the border to
be placed around all non-iconified windows, and may only be
given within a Color or Monochrome list. The <br>
optional wincolorlist specifies a list of window and color
name pairs for specifying particular border colors for
different types of windows. For example: <br>
BorderColor &quot;gray50&quot; <br>
{ <br>
&quot;XTerm&quot; &quot;red&quot; <br>
&quot;xmh&quot; &quot;green&quot; <br>
} <br>
The default is &acirc;black&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BorderLeft pixels <br>
This variable specifies the width in pixels of a forbidden
zone at the left of the screen. All constrained window
functions (f.movepack, f.move with DontMoveOff, etc...) <br>
will consider this zone as offscreen. Default is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BorderResizeCursors <br>
This variable specifies that ctwm should use resizing
cursors when the pointer is on the window border. To be used
preferably when you have bound a button to f.resize in <br>
the frame context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BorderRight pixels <br>
This variable specifies the width in pixels of a forbidden
zone at the right of the screen. All constrained window
functions (f.movepack, f.move with DontMoveOff, etc...) <br>
will consider this zone as offscreen. Default is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BorderShadowDepth pixels <br>
This variable specifies the depth of the shadow ctwm uses
for 3D window borders, when UseThreeDBorders is
selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BorderTileBackground string [{
wincolorlist }] <br>
This variable specifies the default background color in the
gray pattern used in unhighlighted borders (only if
NoHighlight hasn&rsquo;t been set), and may only be given
within <br>
a Color or Monochrome list. The optional wincolorlist allows
per-window colors to be specified. The default is
&acirc;white&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BorderTileForeground string [{
wincolorlist }] <br>
This variable specifies the default foreground color in the
gray pattern used in unhighlighted borders (only if
NoHighlight hasn&rsquo;t been set), and may only be given
within <br>
a Color or Monochrome list. The optional wincolorlist allows
per-window colors to be specified. The default is
&acirc;black&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BorderTop pixels <br>
This variable specifies the width in pixels of a forbidden
zone at the top of the screen. All constrained window
functions (f.movepack, f.move with DontMoveOff, etc...) <br>
will consider this zone as offscreen. Default is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BorderWidth pixels <br>
This variable specifies the width in pixels of the border
surrounding all client window frames if ClientBorderWidth
has not been specified. This value is also used to <br>
set the border size of windows created by ctwm (such as the
icon manager). The default is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ButtonIndent pixels <br>
This variable specifies the amount by which titlebuttons
should be indented on all sides. Positive values cause the
buttons to be smaller than the window text and high&acirc;
<br>
light area so that they stand out. Setting this and the
TitleButtonBorderWidth variables to 0 makes titlebuttons be
as tall and wide as possible. The default is 1 if <br>
UseThreeDTitles is not set, 0 if it is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CenterFeedbackWindow <br>
The moving and resizing information window is centered in
the middle of the screen instead of the top left corner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClearShadowContrast contrast
<br>
Indicates to ctwm how to calculate the clear shadow color
for 3D items. The value is a comprised between 0 and 100.
The formula used is : <br>
clear.{RGB} = (65535 - color.{RGB}) * (contrast / 100). <br>
Has no effect if BeNiceToColormap is active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClientBorderWidth <br>
This variable indicates that border width of a
window&rsquo;s frame should be set to the initial border
width of the window, rather than to the value of
BorderWidth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Color { colors-list } <br>
This variable specifies a list of color assignments to be
made if the default display is capable of displaying more
than simple black and white. The colors-list is made <br>
up of the following color variables and their values:
DefaultBackground, DefaultForeground, MenuBackground,
MenuForeground, MenuTitleBackground, MenuTitleForeground,
and <br>
MenuShadowColor. The following color variables may also be
given a list of window and color name pairs to allow
per-window colors to be specified (see BorderColor for <br>
details): BorderColor, IconManagerHighlight,
BorderTileBackground, BorderTileForeground, TitleBackground,
TitleForeground, IconBackground, IconForeground,
IconBorder&acirc; <br>
Color, IconManagerBackground, and IconManagerForeground. For
example: <br>
Color <br>
{ <br>
MenuBackground &quot;gray50&quot; <br>
MenuForeground &quot;blue&quot; <br>
BorderColor &quot;red&quot; { &quot;XTerm&quot;
&quot;yellow&quot; } <br>
TitleForeground &quot;yellow&quot; <br>
TitleBackground &quot;blue&quot; <br>
} <br>
All of these color variables may also be specified for the

to be used on both color and monochrome displays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ConstrainedMoveTime milliseconds
<br>
This variable specifies the length of time between button
clicks needed to begin a constrained move operation. Double
clicking within this amount of time when invoking <br>
f.move will cause the window only be moved in a horizontal
or vertical direction. Setting this value to 0 will disable
constrained moves. The default is 400 millisec&acirc; <br>
onds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cursors { cursor-list } <br>
This variable specifies the glyphs that ctwm should use for
various pointer cursors. Each cursor may be defined either
from the cursor font or from two bitmap files. <br>
Shapes from the cursor font may be specified directly as:
<br>
cursorname &quot;string&quot; <br>
where cursorname is one of the cursor names listed below,
and string is the name of a glyph as found in the file
/usr/include/X11/cursorfont.h (without the &acirc;XC_&acirc;
prefix). <br>
If the cursor is to be defined from bitmap files, the
following syntax is used instead: <br>
cursorname &quot;image&quot; &quot;mask&quot; <br>
The image and mask strings specify the names of files
containing the glyph image and mask in bitmap(1) form. The
bitmap files are located in the same manner as icon
bit&acirc; <br>
map files. The following example shows the default cursor
definitions: <br>

for the session manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DontSetInactive { win-list }
<br>
These windows won&rsquo;t be set to InactiveState when they
become invisible due to a change workspace. This has been
added because some ill-behaved clients (Frame5) don&rsquo;t
like <br>
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DontSqueezeTitle [{ win-list }]
<br>
This variable indicates that titlebars should not be
squeezed to their minimum size as described under

&acirc;black&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconifyByUnmapping [{ win-list
}] <br>
This variable indicates that windows should be iconified by
being unmapped without trying to map any icons. This assumes
that the user is will remap the window through <br>
the icon manager, the f.warpto function, or the TwmWindows
menu. If the optional win-list is provided, only those
windows will be iconified by simply unmapping. Windows <br>
that have both this and the IconManagerDontShow options set

&acirc;white&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconManagerDontShow [{ win-list
}] <br>
This variable indicates that the icon manager should not
display any windows. If the optional win-list is given, only
those windows will not be displayed. This variable <br>

&quot;myhost&quot; &quot;=400x5+100+5&quot; 2 <br>
} <br>
Clients whose name or class is &acirc;XTerm&acirc; will have
an entry created in the &acirc;XTerm&acirc; icon manager.
Clients whose name was &acirc;myhost&acirc; would be put
into the &acirc;myhost&acirc; icon man&acirc; <br>
ager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconManagerShadowDepth pixels
<br>
This variable specifies the depth of the shadow ctwm uses
for 3D IconManager entries, when UseThreeDIconManagers is
selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconManagerShow { win-list }
<br>
This variable specifies a list of windows that should appear
in the icon manager. When used in conjunction with the
IconManagerDontShow variable, only the windows in <br>
this list will be shown in the icon manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconMenuDontShow { win-list }
<br>
Don&rsquo;t show the name of these windows in the TwmIcons

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This variable specifies an area
on the root window in which icons are placed if no specific
icon location is provided by the client. The geomstring is a
quoted string <br>
containing a standard geometry specification. If more than
one IconRegion lines are given, icons will be put into the
succeeding icon regions when the first is full. The <br>
vgrav argument should be either North or South and is used
to control whether icons are first filled in from the top or
bottom of the icon region. Similarly, the hgrav <br>
argument should be either East or West and is used to
control whether icons should be filled in from left or from
the right. Icons are laid out within the region in a <br>
grid with cells gridwidth pixels wide and gridheight pixels
high. The optional win-list argument tells ctwm that if such
a window is iconified, and there is enough room <br>
in this icon region for its icon, then place it here. The
optional iconjust, iconregjust and iconregalign can be used
to give specific values of IconJustification, Icon&acirc;
<br>
RegionJustification and IconRegionAlignement for this
IconRegion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconRegionAlignement string <br>
Where string is either &quot;top&quot;, &quot;center&quot;
&quot;bottom&quot; or &quot;border&quot;. Tells ctwm how to
align icons inside their place in the IconRegion. If
&acirc;border&acirc; is given, the justification <br>
will be &acirc;top&acirc; if the icon region gravity is
&acirc;north&acirc; and &acirc;bottom&acirc; if the icon
region gravity is &acirc;south&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconRegionJustification string
<br>
Where string is either &quot;left&quot;, &quot;center&quot;
&quot;right&quot; or &quot;border&quot;. Tells ctwm how to
justify icons inside their place in the IconRegion. If
&acirc;border&acirc; is given, the justifica&acirc; <br>
tion will be &acirc;left&acirc; if the icon region gravity
is &acirc;west&acirc; and &acirc;right&acirc; if the icon
region gravity is &acirc;east&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Icons { win-list } <br>

Icons <br>
{ <br>
&quot;XTerm&quot; &quot;xterm.icon&quot; <br>
&quot;xfd&quot; &quot;xfd_icon&quot; <br>
} <br>
Windows that match &acirc;XTerm&acirc; and would not be
iconified by unmapping, would try to use the icon bitmap in
the file &acirc;xterm.icon&acirc;.If ForceIcons is
specified, this bitmap <br>
will be used even if the client has requested its own icon
pixmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IgnoreCaseInMenuSelection <br>
Used when moving the pointer inside a menu with the
keyboard. When you type a letter, the pointer goes to the
next entry beginning with this letter. If
IgnoreCaseInMenuS&acirc; <br>
election is present, this selection ignores the case of this
first letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IgnoreLockModifier <br>
If present, all bindings (buttons and keys) will ignore the
LockMask. Useful if you often use caps lock, and don&rsquo;t
want to define twice all your bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IgnoreModifier <br>
All bindings (buttons and keys) will ignore the modifiers
you specified. It is useful when you use caps locks or num
locks. You don&rsquo;t need IgnoreLockModifier any more <br>
with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IgnoreModifier { lock m2 }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IgnoreTransient <br>
List of windows for which to ignore transients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IgnoreTransient {
&quot;Wine&quot; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">InterpolateMenuColors <br>

interpolated between entry specified colors. In the example
below: <br>
Menu &quot;mymenu&quot; <br>
{ <br>
&quot;Title&quot; (&quot;black&quot;:&quot;red&quot;)
f.title <br>
&quot;entry1&quot; f.nop <br>
&quot;entry2&quot; f.nop <br>
&quot;entry3&quot; (&quot;white&quot;:&quot;green&quot;)
f.nop <br>
&quot;entry4&quot; f.nop <br>
&quot;entry5&quot; (&quot;red&quot;:&quot;white&quot;) f.nop
<br>
} <br>
the foreground colors for &acirc;entry1&acirc; and
&acirc;entry2&acirc; will be interpolated between black and
white, and the background colors between red and green.
Similarly, the foreground <br>
for &acirc;entry4&acirc; will be half-way between white and
red, and the background will be half-way between green and
white.</p>

MapWindowBackground, nor MapWindowForeground the <br>
window title colors are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MapWindowCurrentWorkSpace {
border_color [background] [foreground] [bitmap] } <br>

Specify the appearence of the map window corresponding to
the workspaces other than the current workspace when no root
background information has been provided to ctwm in <br>
the WorkSpace command. Not used in others cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MapWindowForeground color [{
win-list }] <br>
This variable specifies the foreground colors to use for
small windows in the workspace map window and may only be
specified inside of a Color or Monochrome list. The <br>

an icon title. If an icon title is larger than width, it is
truncated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MaxWindowSize string <br>
This variable specifies a geometry in which the width and
height give the maximum size for a given window. This is
typically used to restrict windows to the size of the <br>

and can only be specified inside of a Color or Monochrome
list. The default is &acirc;black&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuShadowColor string <br>
This variable specifies the color of the shadow behind
pull-down menus and can only be specified inside of a Color
or Monochrome list. The default is &acirc;black&acirc;.</p>

and movepush resistance. See f.movepack and f.movepush.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MoveOffResistance pixels <br>
This variable specifies the number of pixels of the moveoff
resistance. If pixels is positive, DontMoveOff will only
prevent you from going off the edge if you&rsquo;re within
<br>
n pixels off the edge. If you go further, DontMoveOff gives
up and lets you go as far as you wish. f.forcemove still
allows you to totally ignore DontMoveOff. A nega&acirc; <br>
tive value puts you back into &acirc;never moveoff&acirc;
mode (it&rsquo;s the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoBackingStore <br>
This variable indicates that ctwm&rsquo;s menus should not
request backing store to minimize repainting of menus. This
is typically used with servers that can repaint faster <br>
than they can handle backing store.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoBorder { win-list } <br>
These windows won&rsquo;t have borders. If you want no
borders on all windows, use the BorderWidth keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoCaseSensitive <br>
This variable indicates that case should be ignored when
sorting icon names in an icon manager. This option is
typically used with applications that capitalize the first
<br>
letter of their icon name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoDefaults <br>
This variable indicates that ctwm should not supply the
default titlebuttons and bindings. This option should only
be used if the startup file contains a completely new <br>
set of bindings and definitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoGrabServer <br>
This variable indicates that ctwm should not grab the server
when popping up menus and moving opaque windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoHighlight [{ win-list }] <br>
This variable indicates that borders should not be
highlighted to track the location of the pointer. If the
optional win-list is given, highlighting will only be
dis&acirc; <br>
abled for those windows. When the border is highlighted, it
will be drawn in the current BorderColor. When the border is
not highlighted, it will be stippled with an <br>
gray pattern using the current BorderTileForeground and
BorderTileBackground colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoIconTitle [{ win-list }] <br>
This variable indicates that icons should not display the
icon name of the client. If the optional win-list is given,
only those clients will not have icon titles.</p>

the corresponding window when the pointer is in an
IconManager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoIconManagers <br>
This variable indicates that no icon manager should be
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoImagesInWorkSpaceManager <br>
This variable turns off displaying of background images in
the WorkSpaceMap. Instead only the colors defined in
WorkSpaces will be used as background in the <br>
WorkSpaceMap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoMenuShadows <br>
This variable indicates that menus should not have drop
shadows drawn behind them. This is typically used with
slower servers since it speeds up menu drawing at the <br>
expense of making the menu slightly harder to read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoOpaqueMove { window-list }
<br>
The counterpart of OpaqueMove. See OpaqueMove.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoOpaqueResize { window-list }
<br>
The counterpart of OpaqueResize. See OpaqueResize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoRaiseOnDeiconify <br>
This variable indicates that windows that are deiconified
should not be raised.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoRaiseOnMove <br>
This variable indicates that windows should not be raised
when moved. This is typically used to allow windows to slide
underneath each other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoRaiseOnResize <br>
This variable indicates that windows should not be raised
when resized. This is typically used to allow windows to be
resized underneath each other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoRaiseOnWarp <br>
This variable indicates that windows should not be raised
when the pointer is warped into them with the f.warpto
function. If this option is set, warping to an occluded <br>
window may result in the pointer ending up in the occluding
window instead the desired window (which causes unexpected
behavior with f.warpring).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoSaveUnders <br>
This variable indicates that menus should not request
save-unders to minimize window repainting following menu
selection. It is typically used with displays that can <br>
repaint faster than they can handle save-unders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoShowOccupyAll <br>
This variable specifies that OccupyAll windows won&rsquo;t
be displayed in the WorkSpaceMap window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoStackMode [{ win-list }] <br>
This variable indicates that client window requests to
change stacking order should be ignored. If the optional
win-list is given, only requests on those windows will be
<br>
ignored. This is typically used to prevent applications from
relentlessly popping themselves to the front of the window
stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoTitle [{ win-list }] <br>
This variable indicates that windows should not have
titlebars. If the optional win-list is given, only those
windows will not have titlebars. MakeTitle may be used <br>
with this option to force titlebars to be put on specific
windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoTitleFocus <br>
This variable indicates that ctwm should not set keyboard
input focus to each window as it is entered. Normally, ctwm
sets the focus so that focus and key events from <br>
the titlebar and icon managers are delivered to the
application. If the pointer is moved quickly and ctwm is
slow to respond, input can be directed to the old window
<br>
instead of the new. This option is typically used to prevent
this &acirc;input lag&acirc; and to work around bugs in
older applications that have problems with focus events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoTitleHighlight [{ win-list }]
<br>
This variable indicates that the highlight area of the
titlebar, which is used to indicate the window that
currently has the input focus, should not be displayed. If
the <br>
optional win-list is given, only those windows will not have
highlight areas. This and the SqueezeTitle options can be
set to substantially reduce the amount of screen <br>
space required by titlebars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoWarpToMenuTitle <br>
This variable indicates that the cursor should not be warped
to the title of a menu which does not have room to drop down
below the current cursor position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Occupy { occupy-list } <br>
This variable specifies which windows occupy which
workspaces at startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">occupy-list consists of entries
of the form : <br>
[Window] win-name { wpsc1 wspc2 ... } <br>
or Workspace wspc-name {win1 win2 ... } <br>
Example : <br>
Occupy { <br>
&quot;xload&quot; {&quot;all&quot;} <br>
Window &quot;xterm&quot; {&quot;here&quot; &quot;there&quot;
&quot;elsewhere&quot;} <br>
&quot;xv&quot; {&quot;images&quot;} <br>
WorkSpace &quot;images&quot; {&quot;xloadimage&quot;} <br>
} <br>
Note : The Occupy declaration should come after the
WorkSpaces declaration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OccupyAll { window-list }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This variable specifies a list
of windows that will occupy all workspaces at startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">window-list is a list of window
names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example : <br>
OccupyAll <br>
{ <br>
&quot;xload&quot; <br>
&quot;xbiff&quot; <br>
&quot;xconsole&quot; <br>
} <br>
Note : The OccupyAll declaration should come after the
WorkSpaces declaration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpaqueMove { window-list } <br>
This variable indicates that the f.move function should
actually move the window instead of just an outline so that
the user can immediately see what the window will look <br>
like in the new position. This option is typically used on
fast displays (particularly if NoGrabServer is set). The
optional window list parameter indicates that only <br>
windows in this list should actually be moved in opaque
mode. The NoOpaqueMove counterpart is also available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpaqueMoveThreshold { threshold
} <br>
The integer parameter is a percentage and indicates that
only windows (elligible for opaque moving) with a surface
smaller than this percentage of the surface of the <br>
screen should actually be moved in opaque mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpaqueResize { window-list }
<br>
The opaque version of resize. Extremely resource intensive,
but beautiful with fast server/client/network. See
OpaqueMove. The NoOpaqueResize counterpart is also
avail&acirc; <br>
able.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpaqueResizeThreshold {
threshold } <br>
The resize version of OpaqueMoveThreshold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpenWindowTimeout seconds <br>
seconds is an integer representing a number of second. When
a window tries to open on an unattended display, it will be
automatically mapped after this number of seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PackNewWindows <br>
Use f.movepack algorithm instead of f.move when opening a
new window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pixmaps { pixmaps } <br>
This variable specifies a list of pixmaps that define the
appearance of various images. Each entry is a keyword
indicating the pixmap to set, followed by a string giving
<br>
the name of the bitmap file. The following pixmaps may be
specified: <br>
Pixmaps <br>
{ <br>
TitleHighlight &quot;gray1&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">} <br>
The default for TitleHighlight is to use an even stipple
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PixmapDirectory path <br>
This variable specifies the path where ctwm looks to find
non-X11 bitmap files. Whenever you want to use a image file
that is not an X11 bitmap, specify : xpm:filename, <br>
for xpm files, xwd:filename for xwd files, im:filename, for
other files supported by the imconv package, jpeg:file for
jpeg file, or &acirc;|command&acirc; for an on the fly
gener&acirc; <br>
ated xwd file. Use the % character to specify an animation.
path can be a colon separated list of directories. Example :
<br>
PixmapDirectory &quot;/usr/lib/X11/twm&quot; <br>
Icons <br>
{ <br>
&quot;Axe&quot; &quot;xpm:edit.xpm&quot; <br>
&quot;xterm&quot; &quot;xpm:ball%.xpm&quot; <br>
} <br>
N.B This is only valid if your version of ctwm has been
compiled with the right extension (XPM, JPEG or IMCONV
options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RaiseDelay milliseconds <br>
For windows that are to be automatically raised when the
pointer enters (see the AutoRaise variable and the
f.autoraise function) this variable specifies the length of
<br>
time the pointer should rest in the window before it is
raised. The default is 0 milliseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RaiseOnClick <br>
If present a window will be raised on top of others when
clicked on, and the ButtonPress event will be correctly
forwarded to the client that owns this window (if it <br>
asked to). See RaiseOnClickButton.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RaiseOnClickButton button_number
<br>
Where button_number is a valid button number (generally 1 to
3). Specify the button to use for RaiseOnClick.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RaiseWhenAutoUnSqueeze <br>
Windows are raised when auto-unsqueezed (See
AutoSqueeze).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RandomPlacement [ string ] <br>
Where string is either &acirc;on&acirc;, &acirc;off&acirc;,
&acirc;all&acirc; or &acirc;unmapped&acirc;. This variable
indicates that windows with no specified geometry should be
placed in a pseudo-random location <br>
instead of having the user drag out an outline. The argument
&acirc;on&acirc; or &acirc;all&acirc; tells ctwm do do this
for all such windows, &acirc;off&acirc;, not to do this, and
&acirc;unmapped&acirc;, only for <br>
unmapped windows, e.g. iconified or not visible in the
current workspace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ReallyMoveInWorkspaceManager
<br>
This keyword tells ctwm to move the actual window when the
user is moving the small windows in the WorkSpaceMap window.
If not present the WorkSpaceMap can be used only <br>
to modify the occupation of a window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ResizeFont string <br>
This variable specifies the font to be used for in the
dimensions window when resizing windows. The default is
&acirc;fixed&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RestartPreviousState <br>
This variable indicates that ctwm should attempt to use the
WM_STATE property on client windows to tell which windows
should be iconified and which should be left visi&acirc;
<br>
ble. This is typically used to try to regenerate the state
that the screen was in before the previous window manager
was shutdown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ReverseCurrentWorkspace string
<br>
This variable tells ctwm to reverse the background and
foreground colors in the small windows in the workspace map
for the current workspace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SaveColor { colors-list } <br>
This variable indicates a list of color assignments to be
stored as pixel values in the root window property
_MIT_PRIORITY_COLORS. Clients may elect to preserve these
<br>
values when installing their own colormap. Note that use of
this mechanism is a way for an application to avoid the
&acirc;technicolor&acirc; problem, whereby useful screen
objects <br>
such as window borders and titlebars disappear when a
program&rsquo;s custom colors are installed by the window
manager. For example: <br>
SaveColor <br>
{ <br>
BorderColor <br>
TitleBackground <br>
TitleForeground <br>
&quot;red&quot; <br>
&quot;green&quot; <br>
&quot;blue&quot; <br>
} <br>
This would place on the root window 3 pixel values for
borders and titlebars, as well as the three color strings,
all taken from the default colormap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ShrinkIconTitles <br>
A la Motif shrinking of icon titles, and expansion when
mouse is inside icon. The old incorrect spelling
SchrinkIconTitles is also still accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ShortAllWindowsMenus <br>
Don&rsquo;t show WorkSpaceManager and IconManagers in the
TwmWindows and TwmAllWindows menus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ShowIconManager <br>
This variable indicates that the icon manager window should
be displayed when ctwm is started. It can always be brought
up using the f.showiconmgr function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ShowWorkSpaceManager <br>
This variable specifies that the WorkSpaceManager should be
visible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SloppyFocus <br>
Use sloppy focus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SortIconManager <br>
This variable indicates that entries in the icon manager
should be sorted alphabetically rather than by simply
appending new windows to the end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SoundHost <br>
The host on which sounds should be played. See the SOUNDS
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SqueezeTitle [{ squeeze-list }]
<br>
This variable indicates that ctwm should attempt to use the
SHAPE extension to make titlebars occupy only as much screen
space as they need, rather than extending all the <br>
way across the top of the window. The optional squeeze-list
may be used to control the location of the squeezed titlebar
along the top of the window. It contains <br>
entries of the form: <br>
&quot;name&quot; justification num denom <br>
where name is a window name, justification is either left,
center, or right, and num and denom are numbers specifying a
ratio giving the relative position about which the <br>
titlebar is justified. The ratio is measured from left to
right if the numerator is positive, and right to left if
negative. A denominator of 0 indicates that the <br>
numerator should be measured in pixels. For convenience, the
ratio 0/0 is the same as 1/2 for center and -1/1 for right.
For example: <br>
SqueezeTitle <br>
{ <br>
&quot;XTerm&quot; left 0 0 <br>
&quot;xterm1&quot; left 1 3 <br>
&quot;xterm2&quot; left 2 3 <br>
&quot;oclock&quot; center 0 0 <br>
&quot;emacs&quot; right 0 0 <br>
} <br>
The DontSqueezeTitle list can be used to turn off squeezing
on certain titles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StartIconified [{ win-list }]
<br>
This variable indicates that client windows should initially
be left as icons until explicitly deiconified by the user.
If the optional win-list is given, only those <br>
windows will be started iconic. This is useful for programs
that do not support an -iconic command line option or
resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StartInMapState <br>
This variable specifies that the WorkSpaceManager should be
started in its map form when created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StartSqueezed { win-list } <br>
These windows will first show up squeezed (see
f.squeeze).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StayUpMenus <br>
Tells ctwm to use stayup menus. These menus will stay on the
screen when ButtonUp, if either the menu has not yet been
entered by the pointer, or the current item is a <br>
f.title.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SunkFocusWindowTitle <br>
This variable specifies that the title of the focus window
(if exists) should be sunken instead of raised. Only valid
if UseThreeDTitles is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ThreeDBorderWidth pixels <br>
The width of the 3D border in pixels, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleBackground string [{
win-list }] <br>
This variable specifies the background color used in
titlebars, and may only be specified inside of a Color or
Monochrome list. The optional win-list is a list of window
<br>
names and colors so that per-window colors may be specified.
The default is &acirc;white&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleButtonBorderWidth pixels
<br>
This variable specifies the width in pixels of the border
surrounding titlebuttons. This is typically set to 0 to
allow titlebuttons to take up as much space as possible <br>
and to not have a border. The default is 1 if
UseThreeDTitles is not set, 0 if it is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleButtonShadowDepth pixels
<br>
This variable specifies the depth of the shadow ctwm uses
for 3D title buttons, when UseThreeDTitles is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleFont string <br>
This variable specifies the font used for displaying window
names in titlebars. The default is
&acirc;variable&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleForeground string [{
win-list }] <br>
This variable specifies the foreground color used in
titlebars, and may only be specified inside of a Color or
Monochrome list. The optional win-list is a list of window
<br>
names and colors so that per-window colors may be specified.
The default is &acirc;black&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleJustification string <br>
This keyword needs a string value. The acceptable values are
: &acirc;left&acirc;, &acirc;center&acirc; and
&acirc;right&acirc;. The window titles will be justified
according to this in the title window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitlePadding pixels <br>
This variable specifies the distance between the various
buttons, text, and highlight areas in the titlebar. The
default is 8 pixels if UseThreeDTitles is not set, 0 if <br>
it is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TitleShadowDepth pixels <br>
This variable specifies the depth of the shadow ctwm uses
for 3D titles, when UseThreeDTitles is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TransientHasOccupation <br>
This variable specifies that transient-for and non-group
leader windows can have their own occupation potentially
different from their leader window. The default case is <br>
that these windows follow their leader, use this keyword if
the default action doesn&rsquo;t please you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TransientOnTop percentage <br>
The parameter (required) is a percentage and tells ctwm to
put transient (and non-group leader) windows always on top
of their leader if and only if their surface is <br>
smaller than this fraction of the surface of their leader.
The surface of a window is its width times its weight.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UnknownIcon string <br>
This variable specifies the filename of a bitmap file to be
used as the default icon. This bitmap will be used as the
icon of all clients which do not provide an icon <br>
bitmap and are not listed in the Icons list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UnmapByMovingFarAway [{ win-list
}] <br>
These windows will be moved out of the screen instead of
being unmapped when they become invisible due to a change
workspace. This has been added because some ill-behaved <br>
clients (Frame5) don&rsquo;t like to be unmapped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UsePPosition string <br>
This variable specifies whether or not ctwm should honor
program-requested locations (given by the PPosition flag in
the WM_NORMAL_HINTS property) in the absence of a <br>
user-specified position. The argument string may have one of
three values: &quot;off&quot; (the default) indicating that
ctwm should ignore the program-supplied position,
&quot;on&quot; <br>
indicating that the position should be used, and
&quot;non-zero&quot; indicating that the position should
used if it is other than (0,0). The latter option is for
working around a <br>
bug in older toolkits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseSunkTitlePixmap <br>
This makes it so the shadows are inversed for title pixmaps
when focus is lost. This is similar to having the
SunkFocusWindowTitle, but it makes your xbm or 3d XPM (if
<br>
any) sink instead of just the whole bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseThreeDBorders <br>
Tells ctwm to use 3D-looking window borders. The width ot
the 3D borders is ThreeDBorderWidth. The color of the 3D
border is BorderTileBackground, and if NoHighlight is <br>
not selected, the border of the Focus window is
BorderColor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseThreeDIconManagers <br>
Tells ctwm to use 3D-looking IconManagers if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseThreeDMenus <br>
Tells ctwm to use 3D-looking menus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseThreeDTitles <br>
Tells ctwm to use 3D-looking windows titles. In which case
the default values of TitleButtonBorderWidth, FramePadding,
TitlePadding and ButtonIndent are set to 0. There <br>
are plenty of built-in scalable pixmaps for buttons,
:xpm:menu, :xpm:dot, :xpm:cross, :xpm:bar, :xpm:vbar,
:xpm:iconify, :xpm:resize, :xmp:sunkresize and :xpm:box.
There <br>
are several built-in scalable animations for buttons :
%xpm:resize, %xpm:menu-up, %xpm:menu-down,
%xpm:resize-out-top, %xpm:resize-in-top,
%xpm:resize-out-bot, <br>
%xpm:resize-in-bot, %xpm:maze-out, %xpm:maze-in,
%xpm:zoom-out, %xpm:zoom-in and %xpm:zoom-inout. Try them to
see what they look like.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UseThreeDWMap <br>
Tells ctwm to use 3D for the small windows in the workspace
map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VirtualScreens { geometries-list
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This variable specifies a list
of geometries for virtual screens. Virtual screens are
designed to be used when you have several physical screens
bound together with the <br>
Xinerama X extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">geometries-list is a list of
valid geometry strings, that correspond to your actual
physical screens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example : <br>
VirtualScreens <br>

&quot;1600x1200+1280+0&quot; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WarpCursor [{ win-list }] <br>
This variable indicates that the pointer should be warped
into windows when they are deiconified. If the optional
win-list is given, the pointer will only be warped when <br>
those windows are deiconified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowBox [{ win-list }] <br>
creates a new window called a box, where all the client
windows that match the windows list are opened in, instead
of the root window. This is useful to group small win&acirc;
<br>
dows in the same box (xload for instance) <br>
WindowBox &quot;xloadbox&quot; &quot;320x100+0-0&quot; {
<br>
&quot;xload&quot; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowGeometries [{ win-list }]
<br>
Used to give a default geometry to some clients : <br>
WindowGeometries { <br>
&quot;Mozilla*&quot; &quot;1000x800+10+10&quot; <br>

}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowRing [{ win-list }] <br>
This variable specifies a list of windows along which the
f.warpring function cycles. If no argument is given, all the
windows are in the ring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WarpRingOnScreen <br>
Tells ctwm that f.warpring warps pointer only to windows
visible in the current workspace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WarpToDefaultMenuEntry <br>
(Useful only with StayUpMenus) When using StayUpMenus, and a
menu does stays up, the pointer is warped to the default
entry of the menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WarpUnmapped <br>
This variable indicates that that the f.warpto function
should deiconify any iconified windows it encounters. This
is typically used to make a key binding that will pop <br>
a particular window (such as xmh), no matter where it is.
The default is for f.warpto to ignore iconified windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowRingExclude [{ win-list }]
<br>
All listed windows will be excluded from the WarpRing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WMgrButtonShadowDepth depth <br>

should come before the Occupy or OccupyAll declarations. The
maximum number of workspaces is 32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XMoveGrid number <br>
This variable specifies the value to use to constrain window
movement. When moving windows around, the x coordinate will
always be a multiple of this variable. Default <br>
is 1. f.forcemove ignores this variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XorValue number <br>
This variable specifies the value to use when drawing window
outlines for moving and resizing. This should be set to a
value that will result in a variety of distin&acirc; <br>
guishable colors when exclusive-or&rsquo;ed with the
contents of the user&rsquo;s typical screen. Setting this
variable to 1 often gives nice results if adjacent colors in
the <br>
default colormap are distinct. By default, ctwm will attempt
to cause temporary lines to appear at the opposite end of
the colormap from the graphics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YMoveGrid number <br>
This variable specifies the value to use to constrain window
movement. When moving windows around, the y coordinate will
always be a multiple of this variable. Default <br>
is 1. f.forcemove ignores this variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zoom [ count ] <br>
This variable indicates that outlines suggesting movement of
a window to and from its iconified state should be displayed
whenever a window is iconified or deiconified. <br>
The optional count argument specifies the number of outlines
to be drawn. The default count is 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following variables must be

This variable specifies the function to be executed when a
window is iconified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowFunction function <br>
This variable specifies the function to execute when a
window is selected from the TwmWindows menu. If this
variable is not set, the window will be deiconified and <br>
raised.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BINDINGS <br>
After the desired variables have been set, functions may be
attached to titlebuttons and key and pointer buttons.
Titlebuttons may be added from the left or right side and
<br>
appear in the titlebar from left-to-right according to the
order in which they are specified. Key and pointer button
bindings may be given in any order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Titlebuttons specifications must
include the name of the pixmap to use in the button box and
the function to be invoked when a pointer button is pressed
within them: <br>
LeftTitleButton &quot;bitmapname&quot; = function <br>
or <br>
LeftTitleButton &quot;bitmapname&quot; { <br>
Buttoni : function <br>
... <br>
Buttonj : function <br>
} <br>
or <br>
RightTitleButton &quot;bitmapname&quot; = function <br>
or <br>
RightTitleButton &quot;bitmapname&quot; { <br>
Buttoni : function <br>
... <br>
Buttonj : function <br>
} <br>
The bitmapname may refer to one of the built-in bitmaps
(which are scaled to match TitleFont) by using the
appropriate colon-prefixed name described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key and pointer button
specifications must give the modifiers that must be pressed,
over which parts of the screen the pointer must be, and what
function is to be invoked. Keys <br>
are given as strings containing the appropriate keysym name;
buttons are given as the keywords Button1-Button5: <br>
&quot;FP1&quot; = modlist : context : function <br>
Button1 = modlist : context : function <br>
The modlist is any combination of the modifier names shift,
control, lock, meta, mod1, mod2, mod3, mod4, or mod5 (which
may be abbreviated as s, c, l, m, m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, <br>
respectively) separated by a vertical bar (|). Similarly,
the context is any combination of window, title, icon, root,
frame, workspace, iconmgr, their first letters (iconmgr <br>
abbreviation is m), or all, separated by a vertical bar. The
function is any of the f. keywords described below. For
example, the default startup file contains the following
<br>
bindings: <br>
Button1 = : root : f.menu &quot;TwmWindows&quot; <br>
Button1 = m : window | icon : f.function
&quot;move-or-lower&quot; <br>
Button2 = m : window | icon : f.iconify <br>
Button3 = m : window | icon : f.function
&quot;move-or-raise&quot; <br>
Button1 = : title : f.function &quot;move-or-raise&quot;
<br>
Button2 = : title : f.raiselower <br>
Button1 = : icon : f.function &quot;move-or-iconify&quot;
<br>
Button2 = : icon : f.iconify <br>
Button1 = : iconmgr : f.iconify <br>
Button2 = : iconmgr : f.iconify <br>
A user who wanted to be able to manipulate windows from the
keyboard could use the following bindings: <br>
&quot;F1&quot; = : all : f.iconify <br>
&quot;F2&quot; = : all : f.raiselower <br>
&quot;F3&quot; = : all : f.warpring &quot;next&quot; <br>
&quot;F4&quot; = : all : f.warpto &quot;xmh&quot; <br>
&quot;F5&quot; = : all : f.warpto &quot;emacs&quot; <br>
&quot;F6&quot; = : all : f.colormap &quot;next&quot; <br>
&quot;F7&quot; = : all : f.colormap &quot;default&quot; <br>
&quot;F20&quot; = : all : f.warptoscreen &quot;next&quot;
<br>
&quot;Left&quot; = m : all : f.backiconmgr <br>
&quot;Right&quot; = m | s : all : f.forwiconmgr <br>
&quot;Up&quot; = m : all : f.upiconmgr <br>
&quot;Down&quot; = m | s : all : f.downiconmgr <br>
ctwm provides many more window manipulation primitives than
can be conveniently stored in a titlebar, menu, or set of
key bindings. Although a small set of defaults are supplied
<br>
(unless the NoDefaults is specified), most users will want
to have their most common operations bound to key and button
strokes. To do this, ctwm associates names with each of <br>
the primitives and provides user-defined functions for
building higher level primitives and menus for interactively
selecting among groups of functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User-defined functions contain
the name by which they are referenced in calls to f.function
and a list of other functions to execute. For example: <br>
Function &quot;move-or-lower&quot; { f.move f.deltastop
f.lower } <br>
Function &quot;move-or-raise&quot; { f.move f.deltastop
f.raise } <br>
Function &quot;move-or-iconify&quot; { f.move f.deltastop
f.iconify } <br>
Function &quot;restore-colormap&quot; { f.colormap
&quot;default&quot; f.lower } <br>
The function name must be used in f.function exactly as it
appears in the function specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the descriptions below, if
the function is said to operate on the selected window, but
is invoked from a root menu, the cursor will be changed to
the Select cursor and the <br>
next window to receive a button press will be chosen:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! string <br>
This is an abbreviation for f.exec string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.addtoworkspace string <br>
This function adds the selected window to the workspace
whose name is string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.adoptwindow <br>
This function asks for the user to select a window with the
mouse, and then adopt this window if it doesn&rsquo;t belong
to the current ctwm. Useful only with the -w flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.altcontext <br>
Set the alternate context. The next key or button event ctwm
reveives will be interpreted using the alternate context. To
define bindings in the alternate context, use <br>
the keyword alter in the context field of the binding
command. For example: <br>
&quot;Return&quot;= m : all : f.altcontext <br>
&quot;n&quot; = : alter : f.nextworkspace <br>
&quot;p&quot; = : alter : f.prevworkspace</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.altkeymap number <br>
Set the alternate keymap number, where number is an integer
between 1 and 5 included. The next key or button event ctwm
reveives will be interpreted using this alternate <br>
keymap. To define bindings in an alternate keymap, use the
keyword a followed by number in the modifier field of the
binding command. For example: <br>
&quot;Return&quot;= c : all : f.altkeymap &quot;1&quot; <br>
&quot;i&quot; = a1 : window|icon|iconmgr : f.iconify <br>
&quot;z&quot; = a1 : window : f.zoom <br>
&quot;d&quot; = a1 : window|icon : f.delete <br>
&quot;o&quot; = a1 : window|icon : f.occupy <br>
&quot;r&quot; = a1 : window|icon : f.refresh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using an alternate keymaps,
only the root, window, icon and iconmgr contexts are
allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.autolower <br>
This function toggles whether or not the selected window is
lowered whenever the pointer leaves it. See the description
of the variable AutoLower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.autoraise <br>
This function toggles whether or not the selected window is
raised whenever entered by the pointer. See the description
of the variable AutoRaise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.backmapiconmgr <br>
This function warps the pointer in the same manner as
f.backiconmgr but only stops at windows that are mapped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.backiconmgr <br>
This function warps the pointer to the previous column in
the current icon manager, wrapping back to the previous row
if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.beep This function sounds the
keyboard bell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.bottomzoom <br>
This function is similar to the f.fullzoom function, but
resizes the window to fill only the bottom half of the
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.changesize string <br>
This function allows you to change the size of the focused
window. The format of the string must be either
&quot;&lt;border&gt; &lt;+|-&gt;&lt;sizechange&gt;&quot;
(where border must be one of Top, <br>
Bottom, Left or Right) or &quot;&lt;x size&gt;x&lt;y
size&gt;&quot; (where the size is the requested new window
size). The height of the window can never be set/changed to
less than the title <br>
height + 1 (or 1 if the window has no title) and the width
can never be set/changed to less than 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Right&quot; = c|s: all :
f.changesize &quot;right +10&quot; <br>
&quot;Left&quot; = c|s: all : f.changesize &quot;right
-10&quot; <br>
&quot;Down&quot; = c|s: all : f.changesize &quot;bottom
+10&quot; <br>
&quot;Up&quot; = c|s: all : f.changesize &quot;bottom
-10&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;F1&quot; = c|s: all :
f.changesize &quot;640x480&quot; <br>
&quot;F2&quot; = c|s: all : f.changesize &quot;800x600&quot;
<br>
&quot;F3&quot; = c|s: all : f.changesize
&quot;1024x768&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.circledown <br>
This function lowers the top-most window that occludes
another window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.circleup <br>
This function raises the bottom-most window that is occluded
by another window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.colormap string <br>
This function rotates the colormaps (obtained from the
WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property on the window) that ctwm will
display when the pointer is in this window. The argu&acirc;
<br>
ment string may have one of the following values:
&quot;next&quot;, &quot;prev&quot;, and &quot;default&quot;.
It should be noted here that in general, the installed
colormap is determined by key&acirc; <br>
board focus. A pointer driven keyboard focus will install a
private colormap upon entry of the window owning the
colormap. Using the click to type model, private col&acirc;
<br>
ormaps will not be installed until the user presses a mouse
button on the target window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.deiconify <br>
This function deiconifies the selected window. If the window
is not an icon, this function does nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.delete <br>
This function sends the WM_DELETE_WINDOW message to the
selected window if the client application has requested it
through the WM_PROTOCOLS window property. The applica&acirc;
<br>
tion is supposed to respond to the message by removing the
indicated window. If the window has not requested
WM_DELETE_WINDOW messages, the keyboard bell will be rung
<br>
indicating that the user should choose an alternative
method. Note this is very different from f.destroy. The
intent here is to delete a single window, not necessarily
<br>
the entire application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.deleteordestroy <br>
First tries to delete the window (send it WM_DELETE_WINDOW
message), or kills it, if the client doesn&rsquo;t accept
such message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.deltastop <br>
This function allows a user-defined function to be aborted
if the pointer has been moved more than MoveDelta pixels.
See the example definition given for Function <br>
&quot;move-or-raise&quot; at the beginning of the
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.destroy <br>
This function instructs the X server to close the display
connection of the client that created the selected window.
This should only be used as a last resort for shut&acirc;
<br>
ting down runaway clients. See also f.delete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.downiconmgr <br>
This function warps the pointer to the next row in the
current icon manger, wrapping to the beginning of the next
column if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.downworkspace <br>
Goto the workspace immediately underneath the current
workspace in the workspace manager. If the current workspace
is the bottom one, goto the top one in the same column. <br>
The result depends on the layout of the workspace
manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.exec string <br>
This function passes the argument string to /bin/sh for
execution. In multiscreen mode, if string starts a new X
client without giving a display argument, the client <br>
will appear on the screen from which this function was
invoked. If the string &acirc;$currentworkspace&acirc; is
present inside the string argument, it will be substituted
with the <br>
current workspace name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.fill string <br>
Where string is either : &acirc;right&acirc;,
&acirc;left&acirc;, &acirc;top&acirc;, &acirc;bottom&acirc;
or &acirc;vertical&acirc;. The current window is resized in
the specified direction until it reaches an obstacle (either
<br>
another window, or the screen border). f.fill
&acirc;vertical&acirc; sets the window status to
&acirc;zoomed&acirc; and toggles, ie calling it again will
reset the previous window size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.fittocontent <br>
Can be used only with window boxes. The result is to have
the box have the minimal size that contains all its children
windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.focus This function toggles
the keyboard focus of the server to the selected window,
changing the focus rule from pointer-driven if necessary. If
the selected window already <br>
was focused, this function executes an f.unfocus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.forcemove <br>
This function is like f.move except that it ignores the
DontMoveOff variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.forwiconmgr <br>

current icon manager, wrapping to the beginning of the next
row if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.forwmapiconmgr <br>
This function warps the pointer in the same manner as
f.forwiconmgr but only stops at windows that are mapped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.fullzoom <br>
This function resizes the selected window to the full size
of the display or else restores the original size if the
window was already zoomed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.function string <br>
This function executes the user-defined function whose name
is specified by the argument string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.gotoworkspace workspace_name
<br>
This function warps you to the workspace whose name is
workspace_name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.hbzoom <br>
This function is a synonym for f.bottomzoom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.hideiconmgr <br>

the selected window is resized to the full width of the
display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.htzoom <br>
This function is a synonym for f.topzoom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.hypermove <br>
Use this function to &acirc;move&acirc; a window between 2
captives ctwm (or between a captive and the root ctwm). Of
course 2 ctwms are completely different universes. You have
to <br>
go in hyperspace to achieve this, hence the name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.hzoom This function is a
synonym for f.horizoom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.iconify <br>
This function iconifies or deiconifies the selected window
or icon, respectively.</p>

current window (step * {X,Y}MoveGrid) pixels downward.
stopping if the window encounters another window or <br>
the screen border (ala f.pack).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.jumpleft step <br>
Leftward equivalent of f.jumpdown.</p>

Upward equivalent of f.jumpdown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.lefticonmgr <br>
This function similar to f.backiconmgr except that wrapping
does not change rows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.leftworkspace <br>
Goto the workspace immediately on the left of the current
workspace in the workspace manager. If the current workspace
is the leftest one, goto the rightest one in the <br>
same row. The result depends on the layout of the workspace
manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.leftzoom <br>
This variable is similar to the f.bottomzoom function but
causes the selected window is only resized to the left half
of the display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.lower This function lowers the
selected window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.menu string <br>
This function invokes the menu specified by the argument
string. Cascaded menus may be built by nesting calls to
f.menu. When a menu is popped up, you can use the arrow <br>
keys to move the cursor around it. &acirc;Down&acirc; or
space goes down, &acirc;Up&acirc; goes up,
&acirc;Left&acirc; pops down the menu, and
&acirc;Right&acirc; activates the current entry. The first
letter of an <br>
entry name activates this entry (the first one if several
entries match). If the first letter is ~ then
Meta-the-second-letter activates it, if this first letter is
^ <br>
then Control-the-second-letter activates it, and if this
first letter is space, then the second letter activates
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.move This function drags an
outline of the selected window (or the window itself if the
OpaqueMove variable is set) until the invoking pointer
button is released. Double <br>
clicking within the number of milliseconds given by
ConstrainedMoveTime warps the pointer to the center of the
window and constrains the move to be either horizontal or
<br>
vertical depending on which grid line is crossed. To abort a
move, press another button before releasing the first
button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.movepack <br>
This function is like f.move except that it tries to avoid
overlapping of windows. When the moving window begin to
overlap with another window, the move is stopped. If <br>
you go too far over the other window (more that
MovePackResistance pixels), the move is resumed and the
moving window can overlap with the other window. Useful to
pack <br>
windows closely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.movepush <br>
This function is like f.move except that it tries to avoid
overlapping of windows. When the moving window begins to
overlap with another window, the other window is <br>
pushed. If you go too far over the other window (more that
MovePackResistance pixels), there is no push and the moving
window can overlap with the other window. Only <br>
available if OpaqueMove is active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.moveresize geometry <br>
Takes one string argument which is a geometry with the
standard X geometry syntax (e.g. 200x300+150-0). Sets the
current window to the specified geometry. The width and <br>
height are to be given in pixel, no base size or resize
increment are used.</p>

screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.nextworkspace <br>
Goto the next workspace in the list, using the order given
in the .ctwmrc file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.nop This function does nothing

specified direction until it reaches an obstacle (either
another window, or <br>
the screen border). The pointer follows the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.previconmgr <br>
This function warps the pointer to the previous icon manager
containing any windows on the current or preceding
screens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.prevworkspace <br>
Goto the previous workspace in the list, using the order
given in the .ctwmrc file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.pin Valid only in a root menu.
Make a menu permanent on the screen. This is a toggle
function, if you select it while the menu is already
permanent, it becomes non-permanent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.quit This function causes ctwm
to restore the window&rsquo;s borders and exit. If ctwm is
the first client invoked from xdm, this will result in a
server reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.raiseicons <br>
This function raises all the icons in the current
workspace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.raise This function raises the
selected window.</p>

This function is similar to f.nexticonmgr except that
wrapping does not change rows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.rightworkspace <br>
Goto the workspace immediately on the right of the current
workspace in the workspace manager. If the current workspace
is the rightest one, goto the leftest one in the <br>
same row. The result depends on the layout of the workspace
manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.rightzoom <br>
This variable is similar to the f.bottomzoom function except
that the selected window is only resized to the right half
of the display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.ring Selects a window and adds
it to the WarpRing, or removes it if it was already in the
ring. This command makes f.warpring much more useful, by
making its configuration <br>
dynamic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.savegeometry <br>
The geometry of the current window is saved. The next call
to f.restoregeometry will restore this window to this
geometry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.saveyourself <br>
This function sends a WM_SAVEYOURSELF message to the
selected window if it has requested the message in its
WM_PROTOCOLS window property. Clients that accept this
mes&acirc; <br>
sage are supposed to checkpoint all state associated with
the window and update the WM_COMMAND property as specified
in the ICCCM. If the selected window has not <br>
selected for this message, the keyboard bell will be
rung.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.separator <br>
Valid only in menus. The effect is to add a line separator
between the previous and the following entry. The name
selector part in the menu is not used (but must be <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.title This function provides a
centered, unselectable item in a menu definition. It should
not be used in any other context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.toggleoccupation string <br>
This function adds the selected window to the workspace
whose name is string if it doesn&rsquo;t already belongs to
it, and removes it from this workspace if not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.togglesound <br>
Toggle sound on/off. See the SOUNDS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.togglestate <br>
Toggle the state of the WorkSpace manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.toggleworkspacemgr <br>
Toggle the presence of the WorkSpaceManager. If it is
mapped, it will be unmapped and vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.topzoom <br>
This variable is similar to the f.bottomzoom function except
that the selected window is only resized to the top half of
the display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.unfocus <br>
This function resets the focus back to pointer-driven. This
should be used when a focused window is no longer
desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.upiconmgr <br>
This function warps the pointer to the previous row in the
current icon manager, wrapping to the last row in the same
column if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.upworkspace <br>
Goto the workspace immediately above the current workspace
in the workspace manager. If the current workspace is the
top one, goto the bottom one in the same column. The <br>
result depends on the layout of the workspace manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.vanish <br>
The specified window vanishes from the current workspace if
it occupies at least one other WorkSpace. Do nothing in the
others cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.vlzoom <br>
This function is a synonym for f.leftzoom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.vrzoom <br>
This function is a synonym for f.rightzoom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.warphere win_name <br>
This function adds the window which has a name or class that
matches string to the current workspace and warps the
pointer to it. If the window is iconified, it will be <br>
deiconified if the variable WarpUnmapped is set or else
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.warpring string <br>
This function warps the pointer to the next or previous
window (as indicated by the argument string, which may be
&quot;next&quot; or &quot;prev&quot;) specified in the
WindowRing variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.warpto string <br>
This function warps the pointer to the window which has a
name or class that matches string. If the window is
iconified, it will be deiconified if the variable
WarpUn&acirc; <br>
mapped is set or else ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.warptoiconmgr string <br>
This function warps the pointer to the icon manager entry
associated with the window containing the pointer in the
icon manager specified by the argument string. If <br>
string is empty (i.e. &quot;&quot;), the current icon
manager is chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.warptoscreen string <br>
This function warps the pointer to the screen specified by
the argument string. String may be a number (e.g.
&quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot;), the word &quot;next&quot;
(indicating the current screen <br>
plus 1, skipping over any unmanaged screens), the word
&quot;back&quot; (indicating the current screen minus 1,
skipping over any unmanaged screens), or the word
&quot;prev&quot; (indicating <br>
the last screen visited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.winrefresh <br>
This function is similar to the f.refresh function except
that only the selected window is refreshed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f.zoom This function is similar
to the f.fullzoom function, except that the only the height
of the selected window is changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MENUS <br>
Functions may be grouped and interactively selected using
pop-up (when bound to a pointer button) or pull-down (when
associated with a titlebutton) menus. Each menu
specifica&acirc; <br>
tion contains the name of the menu as it will be referred to
by f.menu, optional default foreground and background
colors, the list of item names and the functions they should
<br>
invoke, and optional foreground and background colors for
individual items: <br>
Menu &quot;menuname&quot; [
(&quot;deffore&quot;:&quot;defback&quot;) ] <br>
{ <br>
string1 [ (&quot;fore1&quot;:&quot;backn&quot;)] function1
<br>
string2 [ (&quot;fore2&quot;:&quot;backn&quot;)] function2
<br>
. <br>
. <br>
. <br>
stringN [ (&quot;foreN&quot;:&quot;backN&quot;)] functionN
<br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The menuname is case-sensitive.
The optional deffore and defback arguments specify the
foreground and background colors used on a color display to
highlight menu entries. The <br>
string portion of each menu entry will be the text which
will appear in the menu. The optional fore and back
arguments specify the foreground and background colors of
the menu <br>
entry when the pointer is not in the entry. These colors
will only be used on a color display. The default is to use
the colors specified by the MenuForeground and
MenuBack&acirc; <br>
ground variables. The function portion of the menu entry is
one of the functions, including any user-defined functions,
or additional menus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are 3 special menus.
TwmWindows contains the names of all of the client and
ctwm-supplied windows in the current workspace. Selecting an
entry will cause the WindowFunc&acirc; <br>
tion to be executed on that window. If WindowFunction
hasn&rsquo;t been set, the window will be deiconified and
raised. TwmWorkspaces contains the names of your workspaces,
selecting <br>
an entry goto this workspace. In addition, these entries
have submenus containing the names of all windows occupying
this workspace, selecting such an entry executes f.warpto on
<br>
this window. And finally, TwmAllWindows contains the names
of all the windows ctwm manages. Selecting an entry executes
f.warpto on this window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an entry name begins with a
&acirc;*&acirc; (star), this star won&rsquo;t be displayed
and the corresponding entry will be the default entry for
this menu. When a menu has a default entry and <br>
is used as a submenu of another menu, this default entry
action will be executed automatically when this submenu is
selected without being displayed. It&rsquo;s hard to
explain, but <br>
easy to understand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ICONS <br>
ctwm supports several different ways of manipulating
iconified windows. The common pixmap-and-text style may be
laid out by hand or automatically arranged as described by
the <br>
IconRegion variable. In addition, a terse grid of icon
names, called an icon manager, provides a more efficient use
of screen space as well as the ability to navigate among
win&acirc; <br>
dows from the keyboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An icon manager is a window that
contains names of selected or all windows currently on the
display. In addition to the window name, a small button
using the default iconify <br>
symbol will be displayed to the left of the name when the
window is iconified. By default, clicking on an entry in the
icon manager performs f.iconify. To change the actions <br>
taken in the icon manager, use the the iconmgr context when
specifying button and keyboard bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Moving the pointer into the icon
manager also directs keyboard focus to the indicated window
(setting the focus explicitly or else sending synthetic
events NoTitleFocus is set). <br>
Using the f.upiconmgr, f.downiconmgr f.lefticonmgr, and
f.righticonmgr functions, the input focus can be changed
between windows directly from the keyboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOUNDS <br>
If compiled with the USE_SOUND flag, ctwm is able to play
sounds for any X event. ctwm will look for the file
.ctwm-sounds in the user&rsquo;s home directory to map every
X event to a <br>
sound file to be played.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each line in .ctwm-sounds has
the following syntax: <br>
{X event}: {sound file} <br>
The currently known X events that can be given are: <br>
KeyPress <br>
KeyRelease <br>
ButtonPress <br>
ButtonRelease <br>
MotionNotify <br>
EnterNotify <br>
LeaveNotify <br>
FocusIn <br>
FocusOut <br>

Additionally, the following two are recognised, and
represent the time when ctwm is started or shut down: <br>
Startup <br>
Shutdown</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The resource manager should have been used instead of all of
the window lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The IconRegion variable should
take a list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Double clicking very fast to get
the constrained move function will sometimes cause the
window to move, even though the pointer is not moved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If IconifyByUnmapping is on and
windows are listed in IconManagerDontShow but not in
DontIconifyByUnmapping, they may be lost if they are
iconified and no bindings to f.menu <br>
&quot;TwmWindows&quot; or f.warpto are setup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$HOME/.ctwmrc.&lt;screen number&gt; <br>
$HOME/.ctwmrc <br>
/usr/lib/X11/twm/system.ctwmrc <br>
$HOME/.twmrc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
DISPLAY This variable is used to determine which X server to
use. It is also set during f.exec so that programs come up
on the proper screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME This variable is used as
the prefix for files that begin with a tilde and for
locating the ctwm startup file.</p>
