heimdal-strength - Heimdal password quality check embedding CrackLib

<b>heimdal-strength</b> [<i>principal</i>]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>heimdal-strength</b> is an external password quality check program for
  Heimdal that verifies the strength of a password. Passwords can be tested with
  CrackLib, checked against a CDB database of known weak passwords, checked for
  length, checked for non-printable or non-ASCII characters that may be
  difficult to enter reproducibly, required to contain particular character
  classes, or any combination of these tests. It is normally run via
  <i>kpasswdd</i>(8) using the Heimdal password quality check interface rather
  than directly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To use this program, it must be configured in <i>krb5.conf</i> via settings in
  &quot;[appdefaults]&quot; for the application name &quot;krb5-strength&quot;.
  A typical setting would be:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    krb5-strength = {
        password_dictionary = /usr/local/lib/kadmind/dictionary
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
which says to check passwords with CrackLib using the given path as the base
  path of the CrackLib dictionary. See &quot;CONFIGURATION&quot; below for
  details on the supported configuration options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>heimdal-strength</b> then expects the Heimdal password quality check
  information on standard input, specifically:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    principal: &lt;principal&gt;
    new-password: &lt;password&gt;
    end
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where &lt;principal&gt; is the principal whose password would be changed and
  &lt;password&gt; is the new password. If the password appears to be strong, it
  prints &quot;APPROVED&quot; on standard output and exits with a status of 0.
  If the password is rejected as being too weak, it will print the reason for
  rejecting the password on standard error and exit with a status of 0. If some
  fatal error occurs, it will print that error to standard error and exit with a
  non-zero status.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
The following <i>krb5.conf</i> configuration options are supported:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">cracklib_maxlen</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Normally, all passwords are checked with CrackLib if a
      CrackLib dictionary is defined. However, CrackLib's rules were designed
      for a world in which most passwords were four to eight characters long,
      and tends to spuriously reject a lot of passphrases. If this option is set
      to something other than its default of 0, passwords longer than that
      length bypass CrackLib checks. (Using a SQLite dictionary for longer
      passwords is strongly recommended.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">minimum_different</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If set to a numeric value, passwords with fewer than this
      number of unique characters will be rejected. This can be used to reject,
      for example, passwords that are long strings of the same character or
      repetitions of small numbers of characters, which may be too easy to
      guess.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">minimum_length</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If set to a numeric value, passwords with fewer than that
      number of characters will be rejected, independent of any length
      restrictions in CrackLib. Note that this setting does not bypass the
      minimum length requirements in CrackLib itself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">password_dictionary</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies the base path to a CrackLib dictionary and
      enables password strength testing using CrackLib. The provided path should
      be the full path to the dictionary files, omitting the trailing
      <i>*.hwm</i>, <i>*.pwd</i>, and <i>*.pwi</i> extensions for the CrackLib
      dictionary.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">password_dictionary_cdb</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies the base path to a CDB dictionary and enables CDB
      password dictionary lookups. The path must point to a CDB-format database
      whose keys are the known passwords or dictionary words. The values are
      ignored. You can use the <b>krb5-strength-wordlist</b> utility to generate
      the CDB database from a word list.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The CDB dictionary lookups do not do the complex password mangling that
      CrackLib does. Instead, the password itself will be checked against the
      dictionary, and then variations of the password formed by removing the
      first character, the last character, the first and last characters, the
      first two characters, and the last two characters. If any of these strings
      are found in the CDB database, the password will be rejected; otherwise,
      it will be accepted, at least by this check.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A CrackLib dictionary, a CDB dictionary, and a SQLite dictionary may all be
      configured at the same time or in any combination, in which case CrackLib
      will be run first, followed by CDB and then SQLite as appropriate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">password_dictionary_sqlite</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies the base path to a SQLite dictionary and enables
      SQLite password dictionary lookups. The path must point to a SQLite 3
      database with a table named &quot;passwords&quot;. This table should have
      two columns, &quot;password&quot; and &quot;drowssap&quot;, which, for
      each dictionary word, holds the word and the reversed form of the word.
      You can use the <b>krb5-strength-wordlist</b> utility to generate the
      SQLite database from a word list.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The SQLite dictionary lookups do not do the complex password mangling that
      CrackLib does, but they will detect and reject any password that is within
      edit distance one of a word in the dictionary, meaning that the dictionary
      word can be formed from the password by adding, deleting, or modifying a
      single character.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A CrackLib dictionary, a CDB dictionary, and a SQLite dictionary may all be
      configured at the same time or in any combination, in which case CrackLib
      will be run first, followed by CDB and then SQLite as appropriate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">require_ascii_printable</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If set to a true boolean value, rejects any password that
      contains non-ASCII characters or ASCII control characters. Spaces are
      allowed; tabs are not (at least assuming the POSIX C locale). No
      canonicalization or character set is defined for Kerberos passwords in
      general, so you may want to reject non-ASCII characters to avoid
      interoperability problems with computers with different default character
      sets or Unicode normalization forms.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">require_classes</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option allows specification of more complex character
      class requirements. The value of this parameter should be one or more
      whitespace-separated rule. Each rule has the syntax:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    [&lt;min&gt;-&lt;max&gt;:]&lt;class&gt;[,&lt;class&gt;...]
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    where &lt;class&gt; is one of &quot;upper&quot;, &quot;lower&quot;,
      &quot;digit&quot;, or &quot;symbol&quot;. The symbol class includes all
      characters other than alphanumeric characters, including space. The listed
      classes must appear in the password. Separate multiple required classes
      with a comma (and no space).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The character class checks will be done in whatever locale the plugin or
      password check program is run in, which will normally be the POSIX C
      locale but may be different depending on local configuration.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A simple example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    require_classes = upper,lower,digit
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This requires all passwords contain at least one uppercase letter, at least
      one lowercase letter, and at least one digit.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If present, &lt;min&gt; and &lt;max&gt; specify the minimum password length
      and maximum password length to which this rule applies. This allows one to
      specify character class requirements that change with password length. So,
      for example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    require_classes = 8-19:upper,lower 8-15:digit 8-11:symbol
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    requires all passwords from 8 to 11 characters long contain all four
      character classes, passwords from 12 to 15 characters long contain upper
      and lower case and a digit, and passwords from 16 to 19 characters long
      contain both upper and lower case. Passwords longer than 20 characters
      have no character class restrictions. (This example is probably used in
      conjunction with minimum_length = 8.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">require_non_letter</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If set to a true boolean value, the password must contain
      at least one character that is not a letter (uppercase or lowercase) or a
      space. This may be helpful in combination with passphrases; users may
      choose a stock English phrase, and this will force at least some
      additional complexity.</dd>
