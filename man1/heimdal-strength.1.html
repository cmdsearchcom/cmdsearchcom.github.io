<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
heimdal-strength - Heimdal password quality check embedding
CrackLib</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
heimdal-strength [principal]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
heimdal-strength is an external password quality check
program for Heimdal that verifies the strength of a
password. Passwords can be tested with CrackLib, checked
against a CDB <br>
database of known weak passwords, checked for length,
checked for non-printable or non-ASCII characters that may
be difficult to enter reproducibly, required to contain <br>
particular character classes, or any combination of these
tests. It is normally run via kpasswdd(8) using the Heimdal
password quality check interface rather than directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use this program, it must be
configured in krb5.conf via settings in
&quot;[appdefaults]&quot; for the application name
&quot;krb5-strength&quot;. A typical setting would be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">krb5-strength = { <br>
password_dictionary = /usr/local/lib/kadmind/dictionary <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which says to check passwords
with CrackLib using the given path as the base path of the
CrackLib dictionary. See &quot;CONFIGURATION&quot; below for
details on the supported <br>
configuration options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">heimdal-strength then expects
the Heimdal password quality check information on standard
input, specifically:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">principal: &lt;principal&gt;
<br>
new-password: &lt;password&gt; <br>
end</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &lt;principal&gt; is the
principal whose password would be changed and
&lt;password&gt; is the new password. If the password
appears to be strong, it prints &quot;APPROVED&quot; on
standard <br>
output and exits with a status of 0. If the password is
rejected as being too weak, it will print the reason for
rejecting the password on standard error and exit with a
status <br>
of 0. If some fatal error occurs, it will print that error
to standard error and exit with a non-zero status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
The following krb5.conf configuration options are
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cracklib_maxlen <br>
Normally, all passwords are checked with CrackLib if a
CrackLib dictionary is defined. However, CrackLib&rsquo;s
rules were designed for a world in which most passwords were
four <br>
to eight characters long, and tends to spuriously reject a
lot of passphrases. If this option is set to something other
than its default of 0, passwords longer than that <br>
length bypass CrackLib checks. (Using a SQLite dictionary
for longer passwords is strongly recommended.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minimum_different <br>
If set to a numeric value, passwords with fewer than this
number of unique characters will be rejected. This can be
used to reject, for example, passwords that are long <br>
strings of the same character or repetitions of small
numbers of characters, which may be too easy to guess.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minimum_length <br>
If set to a numeric value, passwords with fewer than that
number of characters will be rejected, independent of any
length restrictions in CrackLib. Note that this setting <br>
does not bypass the minimum length requirements in CrackLib
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password_dictionary <br>
Specifies the base path to a CrackLib dictionary and enables
password strength testing using CrackLib. The provided path
should be the full path to the dictionary files, <br>
omitting the trailing *.hwm, *.pwd, and *.pwi extensions for
the CrackLib dictionary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password_dictionary_cdb <br>
Specifies the base path to a CDB dictionary and enables CDB
password dictionary lookups. The path must point to a
CDB-format database whose keys are the known passwords or
<br>
dictionary words. The values are ignored. You can use the
krb5-strength-wordlist utility to generate the CDB database
from a word list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The CDB dictionary lookups do
not do the complex password mangling that CrackLib does.
Instead, the password itself will be checked against the
dictionary, and then <br>
variations of the password formed by removing the first
character, the last character, the first and last
characters, the first two characters, and the last two
characters. <br>
If any of these strings are found in the CDB database, the
password will be rejected; otherwise, it will be accepted,
at least by this check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A CrackLib dictionary, a CDB
dictionary, and a SQLite dictionary may all be configured at
the same time or in any combination, in which case CrackLib
will be run first, <br>
followed by CDB and then SQLite as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password_dictionary_sqlite <br>
Specifies the base path to a SQLite dictionary and enables
SQLite password dictionary lookups. The path must point to a
SQLite 3 database with a table named &quot;passwords&quot;.
<br>
This table should have two columns, &quot;password&quot; and
&quot;drowssap&quot;, which, for each dictionary word, holds
the word and the reversed form of the word. You can use the
<br>
krb5-strength-wordlist utility to generate the SQLite
database from a word list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SQLite dictionary lookups do
not do the complex password mangling that CrackLib does, but
they will detect and reject any password that is within edit
distance one of a <br>
word in the dictionary, meaning that the dictionary word can
be formed from the password by adding, deleting, or
modifying a single character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A CrackLib dictionary, a CDB
dictionary, and a SQLite dictionary may all be configured at
the same time or in any combination, in which case CrackLib
will be run first, <br>
followed by CDB and then SQLite as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require_ascii_printable <br>
If set to a true boolean value, rejects any password that
contains non-ASCII characters or ASCII control characters.
Spaces are allowed; tabs are not (at least assuming the <br>
POSIX C locale). No canonicalization or character set is
defined for Kerberos passwords in general, so you may want
to reject non-ASCII characters to avoid interoperability
<br>
problems with computers with different default character
sets or Unicode normalization forms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require_classes <br>
This option allows specification of more complex character
class requirements. The value of this parameter should be
one or more whitespace-separated rule. Each rule has <br>
the syntax:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">[&lt;min&gt;-&lt;max&gt;:]&lt;class&gt;[,&lt;class&gt;...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &lt;class&gt; is one of
&quot;upper&quot;, &quot;lower&quot;, &quot;digit&quot;, or
&quot;symbol&quot;. The symbol class includes all characters
other than alphanumeric characters, including space. The
listed <br>
classes must appear in the password. Separate multiple
required classes with a comma (and no space).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The character class checks will
be done in whatever locale the plugin or password check
program is run in, which will normally be the POSIX C locale
but may be different <br>
depending on local configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A simple example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require_classes =
upper,lower,digit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This requires all passwords
contain at least one uppercase letter, at least one
lowercase letter, and at least one digit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If present, &lt;min&gt; and
&lt;max&gt; specify the minimum password length and maximum
password length to which this rule applies. This allows one
to specify character class <br>
requirements that change with password length. So, for
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require_classes =
8-19:upper,lower 8-15:digit 8-11:symbol</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">requires all passwords from 8 to
11 characters long contain all four character classes,
passwords from 12 to 15 characters long contain upper and
lower case and a digit, and <br>
passwords from 16 to 19 characters long contain both upper
and lower case. Passwords longer than 20 characters have no
character class restrictions. (This example is <br>
probably used in conjunction with minimum_length = 8.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require_non_letter <br>
If set to a true boolean value, the password must contain at
least one character that is not a letter (uppercase or
lowercase) or a space. This may be helpful in combination
<br>
with passphrases; users may choose a stock English phrase,
and this will force at least some additional complexity.</p>
