perlhacktips - Tips for Perl core C code hacking
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document will help you learn the best way to go about hacking on the Perl
  core C code. It covers common problems, debugging, profiling, and more.

Perl source plays by ANSI C89 rules: no C99 (or C++) extensions. In some cases
  we have to take pre-ANSI requirements into consideration. You don't care about
  some particular platform having broken Perl? I hear there is still a strong
  demand for J2EE programmers.

  <dd class="It-tag">Not compiling with threading
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Compiling with threading (-Duseithreads) completely rewrites the function
      prototypes of Perl. You better try your changes with that. Related to this
      is the difference between &quot;Perl_-less&quot; and &quot;Perl_-ly&quot;
      APIs, for example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  Perl_sv_setiv(aTHX_ ...);
  sv_setiv(...);
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The first one explicitly passes in the context, which is needed for e.g.
      threaded builds. The second one does that implicitly; do not get them
      mixed. If you are not passing in a aTHX_, you will need to do a dTHX (or a
      dVAR) as the first thing in the function.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

      perlguts for further discussion about context.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">Introducing (non-read-only) globals
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Do not introduce any modifiable globals, truly global or file static. They
      are bad form and complicate multithreading and other forms of concurrency.
      The right way is to introduce them as new interpreter variables, see
      <i>intrpvar.h</i> (at the very end for binary compatibility).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Introducing read-only (const) globals is okay, as long as you verify with
      e.g. &quot;nm libperl.a|egrep -v ' [TURtr] '&quot; (if your &quot;nm&quot;
      has BSD-style output) that the data you added really is read-only. (If it
      is, it shouldn't show up in the output of that command.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you want to have static strings, make them constant:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  static const char etc[] = &quot;...&quot;;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you want to have arrays of constant strings, note carefully the right
      combination of &quot;const&quot;s:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    static const char * const yippee[] =
        {&quot;hi&quot;, &quot;ho&quot;, &quot;silver&quot;};
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    There is a way to completely hide any modifiable globals (they are all moved
      to heap), the compilation setting
      &quot;-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT_PRIVATE&quot;. It is not normally used, but can
      be used for testing, read more about it in &quot;Background and
      PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT&quot; in perlguts.</dd>

    Some platforms (Win32, AIX, VMS, OS/2, to name a few) require any function

      wrong?
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Maybe simply that your function did not need to be exported in the first
      place. Perl has a long and not so glorious history of exporting functions
      that it should not have.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

    If the function is used across several files, but intended only for Perl's

  problems</a></h2>
The following are common causes of compilation and/or execution failures, not
  common to Perl as such. The C FAQ is good bedtime reading. Please test your
  changes with as many C compilers and platforms as possible; we will, anyway,
  and it's nice to save oneself from public embarrassment.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If using gcc, you can add the &quot;-std=c89&quot; option which will hopefully
  catch most of these unportabilities. (However it might also catch
  incompatibilities in your system's header files.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Use the Configure &quot;-Dgccansipedantic&quot; flag to enable the gcc
  &quot;-ansi -pedantic&quot; flags which enforce stricter ANSI rules.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If using the &quot;gcc -Wall&quot; note that not all the possible warnings (like
  &quot;-Wunitialized&quot;) are given unless you also compile with
  &quot;-O&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that if using gcc, starting from Perl 5.9.5 the Perl core source code files
  (the ones at the top level of the source code distribution, but not e.g. the
  extensions under ext/) are automatically compiled with as many as possible of
  the &quot;-std=c89&quot;, &quot;-ansi&quot;, &quot;-pedantic&quot;, and a
  selection of &quot;-W&quot; flags (see cflags.SH).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Also study perlport carefully to avoid any bad assumptions about the operating
  system, filesystems, and so forth.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may once in a while try a &quot;make microperl&quot; to see whether we can
  still compile Perl with just the bare minimum of interfaces. (See
  README.micro.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Do not assume an operating system indicates a certain compiler.

  <dd class="It-tag">Assuming the character set is ASCIIish
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Perl can compile and run under EBCDIC platforms. See perlebcdic. This is
      transparent for the most part, but because the character sets differ, you
      shouldn't use numeric (decimal, octal, nor hex) constants to refer to
      characters. You can safely say 'A', but not 0x41. You can safely say '\n',
      but not \012. If a character doesn't have a trivial input form, you can
      create a #define for it in both &quot;utfebcdic.h&quot; and
      &quot;utf8.h&quot;, so that it resolves to different values depending on
      the character set being used. (There are three different EBCDIC character
      sets defined in &quot;utfebcdic.h&quot;, so it might be best to insert the
      #define three times in that file.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Also, the range 'A' - 'Z' in ASCII is an unbroken sequence of 26 upper case
      alphabetic characters. That is not true in EBCDIC. Nor for 'a' to 'z'. But
      '0' - '9' is an unbroken range in both systems. Don't assume anything
      about other ranges.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Many of the comments in the existing code ignore the possibility of EBCDIC,
      and may be wrong therefore, even if the code works. This is actually a
      tribute to the successful transparent insertion of being able to handle
      EBCDIC without having to change pre-existing code.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    UTF-8 and UTF-EBCDIC are two different encodings used to represent Unicode
      code points as sequences of bytes. Macros with the same names (but
      different definitions) in &quot;utf8.h&quot; and &quot;utfebcdic.h&quot;
      are used to allow the calling code to think that there is only one such
      encoding. This is almost always referred to as &quot;utf8&quot;, but it
      means the EBCDIC version as well. Again, comments in the code may well be
      wrong even if the code itself is right. For example, the concept of
      &quot;invariant characters&quot; differs between ASCII and EBCDIC. On
      ASCII platforms, only characters that do not have the high-order bit set
      (i.e. whose ordinals are strict ASCII, 0 - 127) are invariant, and the
      documentation and comments in the code may assume that, often referring to
      something like, say, &quot;hibit&quot;. The situation differs and is not
      so simple on EBCDIC machines, but as long as the code itself uses the
      &quot;NATIVE_IS_INVARIANT()&quot; macro appropriately, it works, even if
      the comments are wrong.</dd>

    ASCII is a 7 bit encoding, but bytes have 8 bits in them. The 128 extra
      characters have different meanings depending on the locale. Absent a
      locale, currently these extra characters are generally considered to be
      unassigned, and this has presented some problems. This is being changed
      starting in 5.12 so that these characters will be considered to be Latin-1

      One cause for people often making this mistake is that a &quot;naked
      char&quot; and therefore dereferencing a &quot;naked char pointer&quot;
      have an undefined signedness: it depends on the compiler and the flags of
      the compiler and the underlying platform whether the result is signed or

    which is probably not what you were expecting. Unfortunately at least one
      reasonably common and modern C compiler does &quot;real backward
      compatibility&quot; here, in AIX that is what still happens even though
      the rest of the AIX compiler is very happily C89.</dd>

   printf(&quot;i = %d\n&quot;, i);    /* BAD */
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    While this might by accident work in some platform (where IV happens to be
      an &quot;int&quot;), in general it cannot. IV might be something larger.
      Even worse the situation is with more specific types (defined by Perl's
      configuration step in <i>config.h</i>):
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
   Uid_t who = ...;
   printf(&quot;who = %d\n&quot;, who);    /* BAD */
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The problem here is that Uid_t might be not only not &quot;int&quot;-wide
      but it might also be unsigned, in which case large uids would be printed
      as negative values.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    There is no simple solution to this because of <i>printf()</i>'s limited
      intelligence, but for many types the right format is available as with
      either 'f' or '_f' suffix, for example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
   IVdf /* IV in decimal */
   UVxf /* UV is hexadecimal */
   printf(&quot;i = %&quot;IVdf&quot;\n&quot;, i); /* The IVdf is a string constant. */
   Uid_t_f /* Uid_t in decimal */
   printf(&quot;who = %&quot;Uid_t_f&quot;\n&quot;, who);
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Or you can try casting to a &quot;wide enough&quot; type:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
   printf(&quot;i = %&quot;IVdf&quot;\n&quot;, (IV)something_very_small_and_signed);
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Also remember that the %p format really does require a void pointer:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
   U8* p = ...;
   printf(&quot;p = %p\n&quot;, (void*)p);

    How does the HAS_QUUX become defined where it needs to be? Well, if Foonix
      happens to be Unixy enough to be able to run the Configure script, and
      Configure has been taught about detecting and testing <i>quux()</i>, the
      HAS_QUUX will be correctly defined. In other platforms, the corresponding
      configuration step will hopefully do the same.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In a pinch, if you cannot wait for Configure to be educated, or if you have
      a good hunch of where <i>quux()</i> might be available, you can
      temporarily try the following:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  #if (defined(__FOONIX__) || defined(__BARNIX__))

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DEBUGGING"><a class="selflink" href="#DEBUGGING">DEBUGGING</a></h1>
You can compile a special debugging version of Perl, which allows you to use the
  &quot;-D&quot; option of Perl to tell more about what Perl is doing. But
  sometimes there is no alternative than to dive in with a debugger, either to
  see the stack trace of a core dump (very useful in a bug report), or trying to
  figure out what went wrong before the core dump happened, or how did we end up
  having wrong or unexpected results.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Poking_at_Perl"><a class="selflink" href="#Poking_at_Perl">Poking
  at Perl</a></h2>
To really poke around with Perl, you'll probably want to build Perl for
  debugging, like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    ./Configure -d -D optimize=-g
    make
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;-g&quot; is a flag to the C compiler to have it produce debugging
  information which will allow us to step through a running program, and to see
  in which C function we are at (without the debugging information we might see
  only the numerical addresses of the functions, which is not very helpful).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Configure</i> will also turn on the &quot;DEBUGGING&quot; compilation symbol
  which enables all the internal debugging code in Perl. There are a whole bunch
  of things you can debug with this: perlrun lists them all, and the best way to
  find out about them is to play about with them. The most useful options are
  probably
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    l  Context (loop) stack processing
    t  Trace execution
    o  Method and overloading resolution
    c  String/numeric conversions
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some of the functionality of the debugging code can be achieved using XS
  modules.

      yourself, or to invoke cpp on the source code files (see &quot;The .i
      Targets&quot;) So, for instance, you can't say

    </pre>

You may find it helpful to have a &quot;macro dictionary&quot;, which you can

  won't recursively apply those macros for you.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="gdb_macro_support"><a class="selflink" href="#gdb_macro_support">gdb
  macro support</a></h2>
Recent versions of <i>gdb</i> have fairly good macro support, but in order to
  use it you'll need to compile perl with macro definitions included in the
  debugging information. Using <i>gcc</i> version 3.1, this means configuring
  with &quot;-Doptimize=-g3&quot;. Other compilers might use a different switch
  (if they support debugging macros at all).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Dumping_Perl_Data_Structures"><a class="selflink" href="#Dumping_Perl_Data_Structures">Dumping
  Perl Data Structures</a></h2>
One way to get around this macro hell is to use the dumping functions in
  <i>dump.c</i>; these work a little like an internal Devel::Peek, but they also
  cover OPs and other structures that you can't get at from Perl. Let's take an
  example. We'll use the &quot;$a = $b + $c&quot; we used before, but give it a
  bit of context: &quot;$b = &quot;6XXXX&quot;; $c = 2.3;&quot;. Where's a good
  place to stop and poke around?
<div class="Pp"></div>
What about &quot;pp_add&quot;, the function we examined earlier to implement the
  &quot;+&quot; operator:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    (gdb) break Perl_pp_add
    Breakpoint 1 at 0x46249f: file pp_hot.c, line 309.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Notice we use &quot;Perl_pp_add&quot; and not &quot;pp_add&quot; - see
  &quot;Internal Functions&quot; in perlguts. With the breakpoint in place, we
  can run our program:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    (gdb) run -e '$b = &quot;6XXXX&quot;; $c = 2.3; $a = $b + $c'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Lots of junk will go past as gdb reads in the relevant source files and
  libraries, and then:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    Breakpoint 1, Perl_pp_add () at pp_hot.c:309
    309         dSP; dATARGET; tryAMAGICbin(add,opASSIGN);
    (gdb) step
    311           dPOPTOPnnrl_ul;
    (gdb)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We looked at this bit of code before, and we said that
  &quot;dPOPTOPnnrl_ul&quot; arranges for two &quot;NV&quot;s to be placed into
  &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; - let's slightly expand it:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 #define dPOPTOPnnrl_ul  NV right = POPn; \
                         SV *leftsv = TOPs; \
                         NV left = USE_LEFT(leftsv) ? SvNV(leftsv) : 0.0
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;POPn&quot; takes the SV from the top of the stack and obtains its NV
  either directly (if &quot;SvNOK&quot; is set) or by calling the
  &quot;sv_2nv&quot; function. &quot;TOPs&quot; takes the next SV from the top
  of the stack - yes, &quot;POPn&quot; uses &quot;TOPs&quot; - but doesn't
  remove it. We then use &quot;SvNV&quot; to get the NV from &quot;leftsv&quot;
  in the same way as before - yes, &quot;POPn&quot; uses &quot;SvNV&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since we don't have an NV for $b, we'll have to use &quot;sv_2nv&quot; to
  convert it. If we step again, we'll find ourselves there:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    Perl_sv_2nv (sv=0xa0675d0) at sv.c:1669
    1669        if (!sv)
    (gdb)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We can now use &quot;Perl_sv_dump&quot; to investigate the SV:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    SV = PV(0xa057cc0) at 0xa0675d0
    REFCNT = 1
    FLAGS = (POK,pPOK)
    PV = 0xa06a510 &quot;6XXXX&quot;\0
    CUR = 5
    LEN = 6
    $1 = void
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We know we're going to get 6 from this, so let's finish the subroutine:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    (gdb) finish
    Run till exit from #0  Perl_sv_2nv (sv=0xa0675d0) at sv.c:1671
    0x462669 in Perl_pp_add () at pp_hot.c:311
    311           dPOPTOPnnrl_ul;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We can also dump out this op: the current op is always stored in
  &quot;PL_op&quot;, and we can dump it with &quot;Perl_op_dump&quot;. This'll
  give us similar output to B::Debug.
<div class="Pp"></div>

  CODE STATIC ANALYSIS</a></h1>
Various tools exist for analysing C source code <b>statically</b>, as opposed to
  <b>dynamically</b>, that is, without executing the code. It is possible to
  detect resource leaks, undefined behaviour, type mismatches, portability
  problems, code paths that would cause illegal memory accesses, and other
  similar problems by just parsing the C code and looking at the resulting
  graph, what does it tell about the execution and data flows. As a matter of
  fact, this is exactly how C compilers know to give warnings about dubious
  code.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="lint,_splint"><a class="selflink" href="#lint,_splint">lint,

The good old C code quality inspector, &quot;lint&quot;, is available in several

There is a lint variant called &quot;splint&quot; (Secure Programming Lint)
  available from http://www.splint.org/ that should compile on any Unix-like
  platform.

There are &quot;lint&quot; and &lt;splint&gt; targets in Makefile, but you may

Coverity (http://www.coverity.com/) is a product similar to lint and as a

The cpd tool detects cut-and-paste coding. If one instance of the cut-and-pasted

cpd (http://pmd.sourceforge.net/cpd.html) is part of the pmd project

  warnings</a></h2>
Though much can be written about the inconsistency and coverage problems of gcc
  warnings (like &quot;-Wall&quot; not meaning &quot;all the warnings&quot;, or
  some common portability problems not being covered by &quot;-Wall&quot;, or
  &quot;-ansi&quot; and &quot;-pedantic&quot; both being a poorly defined
  collection of warnings, and so forth), gcc is still a useful tool in keeping
  our coding nose clean.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;-Wall&quot; is by default on.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;-ansi&quot; (and its sidekick, &quot;-pedantic&quot;) would be nice to
  be on always, but unfortunately they are not safe on all platforms, they can
  for example cause fatal conflicts with the system headers (Solaris being a
  prime example). If Configure &quot;-Dgccansipedantic&quot; is used, the
  &quot;cflags&quot; frontend selects &quot;-ansi -pedantic&quot; for the
  platforms where they are known to be safe.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Starting from Perl 5.9.4 the following extra flags are added:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;-Wendif-labels&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;-Wextra&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;-Wdeclaration-after-statement&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following flags would be nice to have but they would first need their own
  Augean stablemaster:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;-Wpointer-arith&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;-Wstrict-prototypes&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;-Wtraditional&quot; is another example of the annoying tendency of gcc
  to bundle a lot of warnings under one switch (it would be impossible to deploy
  in practice because it would complain a lot) but it does contain some warnings
  that would be beneficial to have available on their own, such as the warning
  about string constants inside macros containing the macro arguments: this
  behaved differently pre-ANSI than it does in ANSI, and some C compilers are
  still in transition, AIX being an example.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Warnings_of_other_C_compilers"><a class="selflink" href="#Warnings_of_other_C_compilers">Warnings
  of other C compilers</a></h2>
Other C compilers (yes, there <b>are</b> other C compilers than gcc) often have
  their &quot;strict ANSI&quot; or &quot;strict ANSI with some portability
  extensions&quot; modes on, like for example the Sun Workshop has its
  &quot;-Xa&quot; mode on (though implicitly), or the DEC (these days, HP...)
  has its &quot;-std1&quot; mode on.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MEMORY_DEBUGGERS"><a class="selflink" href="#MEMORY_DEBUGGERS">MEMORY
  DEBUGGERS</a></h1>
<b>NOTE 1</b>: Running under memory debuggers such as Purify, valgrind, or Third
  Degree greatly slows down the execution: seconds become minutes, minutes
  become hours. For example as of Perl 5.8.1, the ext/Encode/t/Unicode.t takes
  extraordinarily long to complete under e.g. Purify, Third Degree, and
  valgrind. Under valgrind it takes more than six hours, even on a snappy
  computer. The said test must be doing something that is quite unfriendly for
  memory debuggers. If you don't feel like waiting, that you can simply kill
  away the perl process.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>NOTE 2</b>: To minimize the number of memory leak false alarms (see
  &quot;PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL&quot; for more information), you have to set the
  environment variable PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL to 2.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For csh-like shells:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    setenv PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL 2
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For Bourne-type shells:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2
    export PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In Unixy environments you can also use the &quot;env&quot; command:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    env PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2 valgrind ./perl -Ilib ...
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>NOTE 3</b>: There are known memory leaks when there are compile-time errors
  within eval or require, seeing &quot;S_doeval&quot; in the call stack is a
  good sign of these. Fixing these leaks is non-trivial, unfortunately, but they
  must be fixed eventually.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>NOTE 4</b>: DynaLoader will not clean up after itself completely unless Perl
  is built with the Configure option

  Software's Purify</a></h2>
Purify is a commercial tool that is helpful in identifying memory overruns, wild
  pointers, memory leaks and other such badness. Perl must be compiled in a
  specific way for optimal testing with Purify. Purify is available under
  Windows NT, Solaris, HP-UX, SGI, and Siemens Unix.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Purify on Unix</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
On Unix, Purify creates a new Perl binary. To get the most benefit out of
  Purify, you should create the perl to Purify using:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    sh Configure -Accflags=-DPURIFY -Doptimize='-g' \
     -Uusemymalloc -Dusemultiplicity
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where these arguments mean:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">-Accflags=-DPURIFY
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Disables Perl's arena memory allocation functions, as well as forcing use of
      memory allocation functions derived from the system malloc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">-Doptimize='-g'
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Adds debugging information so that you see the exact source statements where
      the problem occurs. Without this flag, all you will see is the source
      filename of where the error occurred.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">-Uusemymalloc
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Disable Perl's malloc so that Purify can more closely monitor allocations
      and leaks. Using Perl's malloc will make Purify report most leaks in the
      &quot;potential&quot; leaks category.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">-Dusemultiplicity
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Enabling the multiplicity option allows perl to clean up thoroughly when the
      interpreter shuts down, which reduces the number of bogus leak reports
      from Purify.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once you've compiled a perl suitable for Purify'ing, then you can just:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    make pureperl
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
which creates a binary named 'pureperl' that has been Purify'ed. This binary is
  used in place of the standard 'perl' binary when you want to debug Perl memory
  problems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As an example, to show any memory leaks produced during the standard Perl
  testset you would create and run the Purify'ed perl as:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    make pureperl
    cd t
    ../pureperl -I../lib harness
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
which would run Perl on test.pl and report any memory problems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Purify outputs messages in &quot;Viewer&quot; windows by default. If you don't
  have a windowing environment or if you simply want the Purify output to
  unobtrusively go to a log file instead of to the interactive window, use these
  following options to output to the log file &quot;perl.log&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    setenv PURIFYOPTIONS &quot;-chain-length=25 -windows=no \
     -log-file=perl.log -append-logfile=yes&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you plan to use the &quot;Viewer&quot; windows, then you only need this
  option:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    setenv PURIFYOPTIONS &quot;-chain-length=25&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In Bourne-type shells:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    PURIFYOPTIONS=&quot;...&quot;
    export PURIFYOPTIONS
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or if you have the &quot;env&quot; utility:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    env PURIFYOPTIONS=&quot;...&quot; ../pureperl ...
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Purify on NT</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Purify on Windows NT instruments the Perl binary 'perl.exe' on the fly.
<br/>
 There are several options in the makefile you should change to get the most use
  out of Purify:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">DEFINES
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You should add -DPURIFY to the DEFINES line so the DEFINES line looks
      something like:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
   DEFINES = -DWIN32 -D_CONSOLE -DNO_STRICT $(CRYPT_FLAG) -DPURIFY=1
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    to disable Perl's arena memory allocation functions, as well as to force use
      of memory allocation functions derived from the system malloc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">USE_MULTI = define
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Enabling the multiplicity option allows perl to clean up thoroughly when the
      interpreter shuts down, which reduces the number of bogus leak reports
      from Purify.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">#PERL_MALLOC = define
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Disable Perl's malloc so that Purify can more closely monitor allocations
      and leaks. Using Perl's malloc will make Purify report most leaks in the

As an example, to show any memory leaks produced during the standard Perl

<pre>
    cd win32
    make
    cd ../t
    purify ../perl -I../lib harness
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
which would instrument Perl in memory, run Perl on test.pl, then finally report
  any memory problems.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="valgrind"><a class="selflink" href="#valgrind">valgrind</a></h2>
The excellent valgrind tool can be used to find out both memory leaks and
  illegal memory accesses. As of version 3.3.0, Valgrind only supports Linux on
  x86, x86-64 and PowerPC and Darwin (OS X) on x86 and x86-64). The special
  &quot;test.valgrind&quot; target can be used to run the tests under valgrind.
  Found errors and memory leaks are logged in files named
  <i>testfile.valgrind</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Valgrind also provides a cachegrind tool, invoked on perl as:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    VG_OPTS=--tool=cachegrind make test.valgrind
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As system libraries (most notably glibc) are also triggering errors, valgrind
  allows to suppress such errors using suppression files. The default
  suppression file that comes with valgrind already catches a lot of them. Some
  additional suppressions are defined in <i>t/perl.supp</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PROFILING"><a class="selflink" href="#PROFILING">PROFILING</a></h1>
Depending on your platform there are various ways of profiling Perl.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are two commonly used techniques of profiling executables: <i>statistical
  time-sampling</i> and <i>basic-block counting</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first method takes periodically samples of the CPU program counter, and
  since the program counter can be correlated with the code generated for
  functions, we get a statistical view of in which functions the program is
  spending its time. The caveats are that very small/fast functions have lower
  probability of showing up in the profile, and that periodically interrupting
  the program (this is usually done rather frequently, in the scale of
  milliseconds) imposes an additional overhead that may skew the results. The
  first problem can be alleviated by running the code for longer (in general
  this is a good idea for profiling), the second problem is usually kept in
  guard by the profiling tools themselves.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second method divides up the generated code into <i>basic blocks</i>. Basic
  blocks are sections of code that are entered only in the beginning and exited
  only at the end. For example, a conditional jump starts a basic block. Basic
  block profiling usually works by <i>instrumenting</i> the code by adding
  <i>enter basic block #nnnn</i> book-keeping code to the generated code. During
  the execution of the code the basic block counters are then updated
  appropriately. The caveat is that the added extra code can skew the results:
  again, the profiling tools usually try to factor their own effects out of the
  results.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Gprof_Profiling"><a class="selflink" href="#Gprof_Profiling">Gprof
  Profiling</a></h2>
gprof is a profiling tool available in many Unix platforms, it uses
  <i>statistical time-sampling</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can build a profiled version of perl called &quot;perl.gprof&quot; by
  invoking the make target &quot;perl.gprof&quot; (What is required is that Perl
  must be compiled using the &quot;-pg&quot; flag, you may need to
  re-Configure). Running the profiled version of Perl will create an output file
  called <i>gmon.out</i> is created which contains the profiling data collected
  during the execution.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The gprof tool can then display the collected data in various ways. Usually
  gprof understands the following options:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">-a
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">-s
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Generate a summary file called <i>gmon.sum</i> which then may be given to
      subsequent gprof runs to accumulate data over several runs.</dd>

  gcov Profiling</a></h2>
Starting from GCC 3.0 <i>basic block profiling</i> is officially available for
  the GNU CC.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can build a profiled version of perl called <i>perl.gcov</i> by invoking the
  make target &quot;perl.gcov&quot; (what is required that Perl must be compiled
  using gcc with the flags &quot;-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage&quot;, you may
  need to re-Configure).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Running the profiled version of Perl will cause profile output to be generated.
  For each source file an accompanying &quot;.da&quot; file will be created.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To display the results you use the &quot;gcov&quot; utility (which should be
  installed if you have gcc 3.0 or newer installed). <i>gcov</i> is run on
  source code files, like this
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    gcov sv.c
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
which will cause <i>sv.c.gcov</i> to be created. The <i>.gcov</i> files contain
  the source code annotated with relative frequencies of execution indicated by
  &quot;#&quot; markers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Useful options of <i>gcov</i> include &quot;-b&quot; which will summarise the
  basic block, branch, and function call coverage, and &quot;-c&quot; which
  instead of relative frequencies will use the actual counts. For more
  information on the use of <i>gcov</i> and basic block profiling with gcc, see

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL"><a class="selflink" href="#PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL">PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL</a></h2>
If you want to run any of the tests yourself manually using e.g. valgrind, or
  the pureperl or perl.third executables, please note that by default perl
  <b>does not</b> explicitly cleanup all the memory it has allocated (such as
  global memory arenas) but instead lets the <i>exit()</i> of the whole program
  &quot;take care&quot; of such allocations, also known as &quot;global
  destruction of objects&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is a way to tell perl to do complete cleanup: set the environment variable
  PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL to a non-zero value. The t/TEST wrapper does set this to
  2, and this is what you need to do too, if you don't want to see the
  &quot;global leaks&quot;: For example, for &quot;third-degreed&quot; Perl:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        env PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2 ./perl.third -Ilib t/foo/bar.t
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(Note: the mod_perl apache module uses also this environment variable for its
  own purposes and extended its semantics. Refer to the mod_perl documentation
  for more information. Also, spawned threads do the equivalent of setting this
  variable to the value 1.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
If, at the end of a run you get the message <i>N scalars leaked</i>, you can
  recompile with &quot;-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS&quot;, which will cause the
  addresses of all those leaked SVs to be dumped along with details as to where
  each SV was originally allocated. This information is also displayed by
  Devel::Peek. Note that the extra details recorded with each SV increases
  memory usage, so it shouldn't be used in production environments. It also
  converts &quot;new_SV()&quot; from a macro into a real function, so you can
  use your favourite debugger to discover where those pesky SVs were allocated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you see that you're leaking memory at runtime, but neither valgrind nor
  &quot;-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS&quot; will find anything, you're probably
  leaking SVs that are still reachable and will be properly cleaned up during
  destruction of the interpreter. In such cases, using the &quot;-Dm&quot;
  switch can point you to the source of the leak. If the executable was built
  with &quot;-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS&quot;, &quot;-Dm&quot; will output SV
  allocations in addition to memory allocations. Each SV allocation has a
  distinct serial number that will be written on creation and destruction of the
  SV. So if you're executing the leaking code in a loop, you need to look for
  SVs that are created, but never destroyed between each cycle. If such an SV is
  found, set a conditional breakpoint within &quot;new_SV()&quot; and make it
  break only when &quot;PL_sv_serial&quot; is equal to the serial number of the
  leaking SV. Then you will catch the interpreter in exactly the state where the
  leaking SV is allocated, which is sufficient in many cases to find the source
  of the leak.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As &quot;-Dm&quot; is using the PerlIO layer for output, it will by itself
  allocate quite a bunch of SVs, which are hidden to avoid recursion. You can
  bypass the PerlIO layer if you use the SV logging provided by
  &quot;-DPERL_MEM_LOG&quot; instead.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="PERL_MEM_LOG"><a class="selflink" href="#PERL_MEM_LOG">PERL_MEM_LOG</a></h2>
If compiled with &quot;-DPERL_MEM_LOG&quot;, both memory and SV allocations go
  through logging functions, which is handy for breakpoint setting.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Unless &quot;-DPERL_MEM_LOG_NOIMPL&quot; is also compiled, the logging functions
  read $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} to determine whether to log the event, and if so how:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /m/           Log all memory ops
    $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /s/           Log all SV ops
    $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /t/           include timestamp in Log
    $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /^(\d+)/      write to FD given (default is 2)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Memory logging is somewhat similar to &quot;-Dm&quot; but is independent of
  &quot;-DDEBUGGING&quot;, and at a higher level; all uses of <i>Newx()</i>,
  <i>Renew()</i>, and <i>Safefree()</i> are logged with the caller's source code
  file and line number (and C function name, if supported by the C compiler). In
  contrast, &quot;-Dm&quot; is directly at the point of &quot;malloc()&quot;. SV
  logging is similar.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since the logging doesn't use PerlIO, all SV allocations are logged and no extra
  SV allocations are introduced by enabling the logging. If compiled with
  &quot;-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS&quot;, the serial number for each SV allocation
  is also logged.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="DDD_over_gdb"><a class="selflink" href="#DDD_over_gdb">DDD
  over gdb</a></h2>
Those debugging perl with the DDD frontend over gdb may find the following
  useful:
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can extend the data conversion shortcuts menu, so for example you can
  display an SV's IV value with one click, without doing any typing. To do that
  simply edit ~/.ddd/init file and add after:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  ! Display shortcuts.
  Ddd*gdbDisplayShortcuts: \
  /t ()   // Convert to Bin\n\
  /d ()   // Convert to Dec\n\
  /x ()   // Convert to Hex\n\
  /o ()   // Convert to Oct(\n\
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
the following two lines:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  ((XPV*) (())-&gt;sv_any )-&gt;xpv_pv  // 2pvx\n\
  ((XPVIV*) (())-&gt;sv_any )-&gt;xiv_iv // 2ivx
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
so now you can do ivx and pvx lookups or you can plug there the sv_peek
  &quot;conversion&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  Perl_sv_peek(my_perl, (SV*)()) // sv_peek
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(The my_perl is for threaded builds.) Just remember that every line, but the
  last one, should end with \n\
<div class="Pp"></div>
Alternatively edit the init file interactively via: 3rd mouse button -&gt; New
  Display -&gt; Edit Menu
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note: you can define up to 20 conversion shortcuts in the gdb section.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Poison"><a class="selflink" href="#Poison">Poison</a></h2>
If you see in a debugger a memory area mysteriously full of 0xABABABAB or
  0xEFEFEFEF, you may be seeing the effect of the <i>Poison()</i> macros, see
  perlclib.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Read-only_optrees"><a class="selflink" href="#Read-only_optrees">Read-only
  optrees</a></h2>
Under ithreads the optree is read only. If you want to enforce this, to check
  for write accesses from buggy code, compile with
  &quot;-DPL_OP_SLAB_ALLOC&quot; to enable the OP slab allocator and
  &quot;-DPERL_DEBUG_READONLY_OPS&quot; to enable code that allocates op memory
  via &quot;mmap&quot;, and sets it read-only at run time. Any write access to
  an op results in a &quot;SIGBUS&quot; and abort.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This code is intended for development only, and may not be portable even to all
  Unix variants. Also, it is an 80% solution, in that it isn't able to make all
  ops read only. Specifically it
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">1
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Only sets read-only on all slabs of ops at &quot;CHECK&quot; time, hence ops
      allocated later via &quot;require&quot; or &quot;eval&quot; will be
      re-write</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">2
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Turns an entire slab of ops read-write if the refcount of any op in the slab
      needs to be decreased.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">3
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Turns an entire slab of ops read-write if any op from the slab is
    freed.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It's not possible to turn the slabs to read-only after an action requiring
  read-write access, as either can happen during op tree building time, so there
  may still be legitimate write access.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, as an 80% solution it is still effective, as currently it catches a
  write access during the generation of <i>Config.pm</i>, which means that we
  can't yet build <i>perl</i> with this enabled.

You can expand the macros in a <i>foo.c</i> file by saying
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    make foo.i
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
which will expand the macros using cpp. Don't be scared by the results.
