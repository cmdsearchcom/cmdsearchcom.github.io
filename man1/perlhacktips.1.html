<p>PERLHACKTIPS(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLHACKTIPS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlhacktips - Tips for Perl core C code hacking</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document will help you learn the best way to go about
hacking on the Perl core C code. It covers common problems,
debugging, profiling, and more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you haven&rsquo;t read
perlhack and perlhacktut yet, you might want to do that
first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMON PROBLEMS <br>
Perl source plays by ANSI C89 rules: no C99 (or C++)
extensions. In some cases we have to take pre-ANSI
requirements into consideration. You don&rsquo;t care about
some particular <br>
platform having broken Perl? I hear there is still a strong
demand for J2EE programmers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl environment problems <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Not compiling with threading</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compiling with threading
(-Duseithreads) completely rewrites the function prototypes
of Perl. You better try your changes with that. Related to
this is the difference <br>
between &quot;Perl_-less&quot; and &quot;Perl_-ly&quot;
APIs, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl_sv_setiv(aTHX_ ...); <br>
sv_setiv(...);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first one explicitly passes
in the context, which is needed for e.g. threaded builds.
The second one does that implicitly; do not get them mixed.
If you are not passing <br>
in a aTHX_, you will need to do a dTHX (or a dVAR) as the
first thing in the function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;How multiple
interpreters and concurrency are supported&quot; in perlguts
for further discussion about context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Not compiling
with -DDEBUGGING</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DEBUGGING define exposes
more code to the compiler, therefore more ways for things to
go wrong. You should try it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Introducing
(non-read-only) globals</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not introduce any modifiable
globals, truly global or file static. They are bad form and
complicate multithreading and other forms of concurrency.
The right way is to <br>
introduce them as new interpreter variables, see intrpvar.h
(at the very end for binary compatibility).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Introducing read-only (const)
globals is okay, as long as you verify with e.g. &quot;nm
libperl.a|egrep -v &rsquo; [TURtr] &rsquo;&quot; (if your
&quot;nm&quot; has BSD-style output) that the data you added
<br>
really is read-only. (If it is, it shouldn&rsquo;t show up
in the output of that command.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to have static
strings, make them constant:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">static const char etc[] =
&quot;...&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to have arrays of
constant strings, note carefully the right combination of
&quot;const&quot;s:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">static const char * const
yippee[] = <br>
{&quot;hi&quot;, &quot;ho&quot;, &quot;silver&quot;};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a way to completely
hide any modifiable globals (they are all moved to heap),
the compilation setting
&quot;-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT_PRIVATE&quot;. It is not normally
used, but <br>
can be used for testing, read more about it in
&quot;Background and PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT&quot; in
perlguts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Not exporting
your new function</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some platforms (Win32, AIX, VMS,
OS/2, to name a few) require any function that is part of
the public API (the shared Perl library) to be explicitly
marked as exported. See <br>
the discussion about embed.pl in perlguts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Exporting your
new function</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The new shiny result of either
genuine new functionality or your arduous refactoring is now
ready and correctly exported. So what could possibly go
wrong?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Maybe simply that your function
did not need to be exported in the first place. Perl has a
long and not so glorious history of exporting functions that
it should not have.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the function is used only
inside one source code file, make it static. See the
discussion about embed.pl in perlguts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the function is used across
several files, but intended only for Perl&rsquo;s internal
use (and this should be the common case), do not export it
to the public API. See the <br>
discussion about embed.pl in perlguts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portability problems <br>
The following are common causes of compilation and/or
execution failures, not common to Perl as such. The C FAQ is
good bedtime reading. Please test your changes with as many
C <br>
compilers and platforms as possible; we will, anyway, and
it&rsquo;s nice to save oneself from public
embarrassment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If using gcc, you can add the
&quot;-std=c89&quot; option which will hopefully catch most
of these unportabilities. (However it might also catch
incompatibilities in your system&rsquo;s header <br>
files.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the Configure
&quot;-Dgccansipedantic&quot; flag to enable the gcc
&quot;-ansi -pedantic&quot; flags which enforce stricter
ANSI rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If using the &quot;gcc
-Wall&quot; note that not all the possible warnings (like
&quot;-Wunitialized&quot;) are given unless you also compile
with &quot;-O&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if using gcc, starting
from Perl 5.9.5 the Perl core source code files (the ones at
the top level of the source code distribution, but not e.g.
the extensions under <br>
ext/) are automatically compiled with as many as possible of
the &quot;-std=c89&quot;, &quot;-ansi&quot;,
&quot;-pedantic&quot;, and a selection of &quot;-W&quot;
flags (see cflags.SH).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also study perlport carefully to
avoid any bad assumptions about the operating system,
filesystems, and so forth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may once in a while try a
&quot;make microperl&quot; to see whether we can still
compile Perl with just the bare minimum of interfaces. (See
README.micro.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not assume an operating
system indicates a certain compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Casting pointers
to integers or casting integers to pointers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void castaway(U8* p) <br>
{ <br>
IV i = p;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void castaway(U8* p) <br>
{ <br>
IV i = (IV)p;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both are bad, and broken, and
unportable. Use the PTR2IV() macro that does it right.
(Likewise, there are PTR2UV(), PTR2NV(), INT2PTR(), and
NUM2PTR().)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Casting between
data function pointers and data pointers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Technically speaking casting
between function pointers and data pointers is unportable
and undefined, but practically speaking it seems to work,
but you should use the <br>
FPTR2DPTR() and DPTR2FPTR() macros. Sometimes you can also
play games with unions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Assuming
sizeof(int) == sizeof(long)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are platforms where longs
are 64 bits, and platforms where ints are 64 bits, and while
we are out to shock you, even platforms where shorts are 64
bits. This is all <br>
legal according to the C standard. (In other words,
&quot;long long&quot; is not a portable way to specify 64
bits, and &quot;long long&quot; is not even guaranteed to be
any wider than &quot;long&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead, use the definitions IV,
UV, IVSIZE, I32SIZE, and so forth. Avoid things like I32
because they are not guaranteed to be exactly 32 bits, they
are at least 32 bits, <br>
nor are they guaranteed to be int or long. If you really
explicitly need 64-bit variables, use I64 and U64, but only
if guarded by HAS_QUAD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Assuming one can
dereference any type of pointer for any type of data</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">char *p = ...; <br>
long pony = *p; /* BAD */</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many platforms, quite rightly
so, will give you a core dump instead of a pony if the p
happens not to be correctly aligned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Lvalue casts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(int)*p = ...; /* BAD */</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simply not portable. Get your
lvalue to be of the right type, or maybe use temporary
variables, or dirty tricks with unions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Assume anything
about structs (especially the ones you don&rsquo;t control,
like the ones coming from the system headers)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; That a certain
field exists in a struct</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; That no other
fields exist besides the ones you know of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; That a field is
of certain signedness, sizeof, or type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; That the fields
are in a certain order</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; While C
guarantees the ordering specified in the struct definition,
between different platforms the definitions might differ</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; That the
sizeof(struct) or the alignments are the same everywhere</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; There might be
padding bytes between the fields to align the fields - the
bytes can be anything</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Structs are
required to be aligned to the maximum alignment required by
the fields - which for native types is for usually
equivalent to sizeof() of the field</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Assuming the
character set is ASCIIish</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl can compile and run under
EBCDIC platforms. See perlebcdic. This is transparent for
the most part, but because the character sets differ, you
shouldn&rsquo;t use numeric <br>
(decimal, octal, nor hex) constants to refer to characters.
You can safely say &rsquo;A&rsquo;, but not 0x41. You can
safely say &rsquo;0, but not 12. If a character
doesn&rsquo;t have a trivial <br>
input form, you can create a #define for it in both
&quot;utfebcdic.h&quot; and &quot;utf8.h&quot;, so that it
resolves to different values depending on the character set
being used. (There are <br>
three different EBCDIC character sets defined in
&quot;utfebcdic.h&quot;, so it might be best to insert the
#define three times in that file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, the range &rsquo;A&rsquo;
- &rsquo;Z&rsquo; in ASCII is an unbroken sequence of 26
upper case alphabetic characters. That is not true in
EBCDIC. Nor for &rsquo;a&rsquo; to &rsquo;z&rsquo;. But
&rsquo;0&rsquo; - &rsquo;9&rsquo; is an <br>
unbroken range in both systems. Don&rsquo;t assume anything
about other ranges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the comments in the
existing code ignore the possibility of EBCDIC, and may be
wrong therefore, even if the code works. This is actually a
tribute to the successful <br>
transparent insertion of being able to handle EBCDIC without
having to change pre-existing code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UTF-8 and UTF-EBCDIC are two
different encodings used to represent Unicode code points as
sequences of bytes. Macros with the same names (but
different definitions) in <br>
&quot;utf8.h&quot; and &quot;utfebcdic.h&quot; are used to
allow the calling code to think that there is only one such
encoding. This is almost always referred to as
&quot;utf8&quot;, but it means the <br>
EBCDIC version as well. Again, comments in the code may well
be wrong even if the code itself is right. For example, the
concept of &quot;invariant characters&quot; differs between
<br>
ASCII and EBCDIC. On ASCII platforms, only characters that
do not have the high-order bit set (i.e. whose ordinals are
strict ASCII, 0 - 127) are invariant, and the <br>
documentation and comments in the code may assume that,
often referring to something like, say, &quot;hibit&quot;.
The situation differs and is not so simple on EBCDIC
machines, but as <br>
long as the code itself uses the
&quot;NATIVE_IS_INVARIANT()&quot; macro appropriately, it
works, even if the comments are wrong.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Assuming the
character set is just ASCII</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASCII is a 7 bit encoding, but
bytes have 8 bits in them. The 128 extra characters have
different meanings depending on the locale. Absent a locale,
currently these extra <br>
characters are generally considered to be unassigned, and
this has presented some problems. This is being changed
starting in 5.12 so that these characters will be considered
<br>
to be Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Mixing #define
and #ifdef</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define BURGLE(x) ... #ifdef
BURGLE_OLD_STYLE /* BAD */ <br>
... do it the old way ... #else <br>
... do it the new way ... #endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You cannot portably
&quot;stack&quot; cpp directives. For example in the above
you need two separate BURGLE() #defines, one for each #ifdef
branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Adding
non-comment stuff after #endif or #else</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#ifdef SNOSH <br>
... <br>
#else !SNOSH /* BAD */ <br>
... <br>
#endif SNOSH /* BAD */</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The #endif and #else cannot
portably have anything non-comment after them. If you want
to document what is going (which is a good idea especially
if the branches are long), <br>
use (C) comments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#ifdef SNOSH <br>
... <br>
#else /* !SNOSH */ <br>
... <br>
#endif /* SNOSH */</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The gcc option
&quot;-Wendif-labels&quot; warns about the bad variant (by
default on starting from Perl 5.9.4).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Having a comma
after the last element of an enum list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enum color { <br>
CERULEAN, <br>
CHARTREUSE, <br>
CINNABAR, /* BAD */ <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is not portable. Leave out the
last comma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also note that whether enums are
implicitly morphable to ints varies between compilers, you
might need to (int).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Using
//-comments</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">// This function bamfoodles the
zorklator. /* BAD */</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That is C99 or C++. Perl is C89.
Using the //-comments is silently allowed by many C
compilers but cranking up the ANSI C89 strictness (which we
like to do) causes the <br>
compilation to fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Mixing
declarations and code</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void zorklator() <br>
{ <br>
int n = 3; <br>
set_zorkmids(n); /* BAD */ <br>
int q = 4;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That is C99 or C++. Some C
compilers allow that, but you shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The gcc option
&quot;-Wdeclaration-after-statements&quot; scans for such
problems (by default on starting from Perl 5.9.4).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Introducing
variables inside for()</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for(int i = ...; ...; ...) { /*
BAD */</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That is C99 or C++. While it
would indeed be awfully nice to have that also in C89, to
limit the scope of the loop variable, alas, we cannot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Mixing signed
char pointers with unsigned char pointers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int foo(char *s) { ... } <br>
... <br>
unsigned char *t = ...; /* Or U8* t = ... */ <br>
foo(t); /* BAD */</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While this is legal practice, it
is certainly dubious, and downright fatal in at least one
platform: for example VMS cc considers this a fatal error.
One cause for people <br>
often making this mistake is that a &quot;naked char&quot;
and therefore dereferencing a &quot;naked char pointer&quot;
have an undefined signedness: it depends on the compiler and
the flags of <br>
the compiler and the underlying platform whether the result
is signed or unsigned. For this very same reason using a
&rsquo;char&rsquo; as an array index is bad.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Macros that have
string constants and their arguments as substrings of the
string constants</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define FOO(n)
printf(&quot;number = %d0, n) /* BAD */ <br>
FOO(10);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pre-ANSI semantics for that was
equivalent to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf(&quot;10umber =
%d10&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which is probably not what you
were expecting. Unfortunately at least one reasonably common
and modern C compiler does &quot;real backward
compatibility&quot; here, in AIX that is what <br>
still happens even though the rest of the AIX compiler is
very happily C89.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Using printf
formats for non-basic C types</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IV i = ...; <br>
printf(&quot;i = %d0, i); /* BAD */</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While this might by accident
work in some platform (where IV happens to be an
&quot;int&quot;), in general it cannot. IV might be
something larger. Even worse the situation is with <br>
more specific types (defined by Perl&rsquo;s configuration
step in config.h):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Uid_t who = ...; <br>
printf(&quot;who = %d0, who); /* BAD */</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The problem here is that Uid_t
might be not only not &quot;int&quot;-wide but it might also
be unsigned, in which case large uids would be printed as
negative values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no simple solution to
this because of printf()&rsquo;s limited intelligence, but
for many types the right format is available as with either
&rsquo;f&rsquo; or &rsquo;_f&rsquo; suffix, for <br>
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IVdf /* IV in decimal */ <br>
UVxf /* UV is hexadecimal */</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf(&quot;i =
%&quot;IVdf&quot;0, i); /* The IVdf is a string constant.
*/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Uid_t_f /* Uid_t in decimal
*/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf(&quot;who =
%&quot;Uid_t_f&quot;0, who);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or you can try casting to a
&quot;wide enough&quot; type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf(&quot;i =
%&quot;IVdf&quot;0,
(IV)something_very_small_and_signed);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also remember that the %p format
really does require a void pointer:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U8* p = ...; <br>
printf(&quot;p = %p0, (void*)p);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The gcc option
&quot;-Wformat&quot; scans for such problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Blindly using
variadic macros</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc has had them for a while
with its own syntax, and C99 brought them with a
standardized syntax. Don&rsquo;t use the former, and use the
latter only if the <br>
HAS_C99_VARIADIC_MACROS is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Blindly passing
va_list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not all platforms support
passing va_list to further varargs (stdarg) functions. The
right thing to do is to copy the va_list using the
Perl_va_copy() if the NEED_VA_COPY is <br>
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Using gcc
statement expressions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">val = ({...;...;...}); /* BAD
*/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While a nice extension,
it&rsquo;s not portable. The Perl code does admittedly use
them if available to gain some extra speed (essentially as a
funky form of inlining), but you <br>
shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Binding together
several statements in a macro</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the macros STMT_START and
STMT_END.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STMT_START { <br>
... <br>
} STMT_END</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Testing for
operating systems or versions when should be testing for
features</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#ifdef __FOONIX__ /* BAD */ <br>
foo = quux(); <br>
#endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless you know with 100%
certainty that quux() is only ever available for the
&quot;Foonix&quot; operating system and that is available
and correctly working for all past, present, <br>
and future versions of &quot;Foonix&quot;, the above is very
wrong. This is more correct (though still not perfect,
because the below is a compile-time check):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#ifdef HAS_QUUX <br>
foo = quux(); <br>
#endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How does the HAS_QUUX become
defined where it needs to be? Well, if Foonix happens to be
Unixy enough to be able to run the Configure script, and
Configure has been taught <br>
about detecting and testing quux(), the HAS_QUUX will be
correctly defined. In other platforms, the corresponding
configuration step will hopefully do the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a pinch, if you cannot wait
for Configure to be educated, or if you have a good hunch of
where quux() might be available, you can temporarily try the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#if (defined(__FOONIX__) ||
defined(__BARNIX__)) <br>
# define HAS_QUUX <br>
#endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#ifdef HAS_QUUX <br>
foo = quux(); <br>
#endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But in any case, try to keep the
features and operating systems separate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Problematic System Interfaces
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; malloc(0), realloc(0), calloc(0, 0) are
non-portable. To be portable allocate at least one byte. (In
general you should rarely need to work at this low level,
but instead use <br>
the various malloc wrappers.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; snprintf() - the
return type is unportable. Use my_snprintf() instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security problems <br>
Last but not least, here are various tips for safer
coding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Do not use
gets()</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or we will publicly ridicule
you. Seriously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Do not use
strcpy() or strcat() or strncpy() or strncat()</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use my_strlcpy() and
my_strlcat() instead: they either use the native
implementation, or Perl&rsquo;s own implementation (borrowed
from the public domain implementation of INN).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Do not use
sprintf() or vsprintf()</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you really want just plain
byte strings, use my_snprintf() and my_vsnprintf() instead,
which will try to use snprintf() and vsnprintf() if those
safer APIs are available. <br>
If you want something fancier than a plain byte string, use
SVs and Perl_sv_catpvf().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUGGING <br>
You can compile a special debugging version of Perl, which
allows you to use the &quot;-D&quot; option of Perl to tell
more about what Perl is doing. But sometimes there is no
alternative <br>
than to dive in with a debugger, either to see the stack
trace of a core dump (very useful in a bug report), or
trying to figure out what went wrong before the core dump
<br>
happened, or how did we end up having wrong or unexpected
results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Poking at Perl <br>
To really poke around with Perl, you&rsquo;ll probably want
to build Perl for debugging, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./Configure -d -D optimize=-g
<br>
make</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;-g&quot; is a flag to the
C compiler to have it produce debugging information which
will allow us to step through a running program, and to see
in which C function we are at (without <br>
the debugging information we might see only the numerical
addresses of the functions, which is not very helpful).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configure will also turn on the
&quot;DEBUGGING&quot; compilation symbol which enables all
the internal debugging code in Perl. There are a whole bunch
of things you can debug with this: <br>
perlrun lists them all, and the best way to find out about
them is to play about with them. The most useful options are
probably</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l Context (loop) stack
processing <br>
t Trace execution <br>
o Method and overloading resolution <br>
c String/numeric conversions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of the functionality of the
debugging code can be achieved using XS modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dr =&gt; use re
&rsquo;debug&rsquo; <br>
-Dx =&gt; use O &rsquo;Debug&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using a source-level debugger
<br>
If the debugging output of &quot;-D&quot; doesn&rsquo;t help
you, it&rsquo;s time to step through perl&rsquo;s execution
with a source-level debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; We&rsquo;ll use
&quot;gdb&quot; for our examples here; the principles will
apply to any debugger (many vendors call their debugger
&quot;dbx&quot;), but check the manual of the one
you&rsquo;re using.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To fire up the debugger,
type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gdb ./perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or if you have a core dump:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gdb ./perl core</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You&rsquo;ll want to do that in
your Perl source tree so the debugger can read the source
code. You should see the copyright message, followed by the
prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(gdb)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;help&quot; will get you
into the documentation, but here are the most useful
commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; run [args]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run the program with the given
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; break
function_name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; break
source.c:xxx</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tells the debugger that
we&rsquo;ll want to pause execution when we reach either the
named function (but see &quot;Internal Functions&quot; in
perlguts!) or the given line in the named source <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; step</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Steps through the program a line
at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; next</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Steps through the program a line
at a time, without descending into functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; continue</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run until the next

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; finish</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run until the end of the current
function, then stop again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&rsquo;enter&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Just pressing Enter will do the
most recent operation again - it&rsquo;s a blessing when
stepping through miles of source code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; print</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Execute the given C code and
print its results. WARNING: Perl makes heavy use of macros,
and gdb does not necessarily support macros (see later
&quot;gdb macro support&quot;). You&rsquo;ll <br>
have to substitute them yourself, or to invoke cpp on the
source code files (see &quot;The .i Targets&quot;) So, for
instance, you can&rsquo;t say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print SvPV_nolen(sv)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but you have to say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print Perl_sv_2pv_nolen(sv)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may find it helpful to have
a &quot;macro dictionary&quot;, which you can produce by
saying &quot;cpp -dM perl.c | sort&quot;. Even then, cpp
won&rsquo;t recursively apply those macros for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gdb macro support <br>
Recent versions of gdb have fairly good macro support, but
in order to use it you&rsquo;ll need to compile perl with
macro definitions included in the debugging information.
Using gcc <br>
version 3.1, this means configuring with
&quot;-Doptimize=-g3&quot;. Other compilers might use a
different switch (if they support debugging macros at
all).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dumping Perl Data Structures
<br>
One way to get around this macro hell is to use the dumping
functions in dump.c; these work a little like an internal
Devel::Peek, but they also cover OPs and other structures
<br>
that you can&rsquo;t get at from Perl. Let&rsquo;s take an
example. We&rsquo;ll use the &quot;$a = $b + $c&quot; we
used before, but give it a bit of context: &quot;$b =
&quot;6XXXX&quot;; $c = 2.3;&quot;. Where&rsquo;s a good
<br>
place to stop and poke around?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What about &quot;pp_add&quot;,
the function we examined earlier to implement the
&quot;+&quot; operator:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(gdb) break Perl_pp_add <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice we use
&quot;Perl_pp_add&quot; and not &quot;pp_add&quot; - see
&quot;Internal Functions&quot; in perlguts. With the
breakpoint in place, we can run our program:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(gdb) run -e &rsquo;$b =
&quot;6XXXX&quot;; $c = 2.3; $a = $b + $c&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lots of junk will go past as gdb
reads in the relevant source files and libraries, and
then:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We looked at this bit of code
before, and we said that &quot;dPOPTOPnnrl_ul&quot; arranges
for two &quot;NV&quot;s to be placed into &quot;left&quot;
and &quot;right&quot; - let&rsquo;s slightly expand it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define dPOPTOPnnrl_ul NV right
= POPn; SV *leftsv = TOPs; NV left = USE_LEFT(leftsv) ?
SvNV(leftsv) : 0.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;POPn&quot; takes the SV
from the top of the stack and obtains its NV either directly
(if &quot;SvNOK&quot; is set) or by calling the
&quot;sv_2nv&quot; function. &quot;TOPs&quot; takes the next
SV from the top of <br>
the stack - yes, &quot;POPn&quot; uses &quot;TOPs&quot; -
but doesn&rsquo;t remove it. We then use &quot;SvNV&quot; to
get the NV from &quot;leftsv&quot; in the same way as before
- yes, &quot;POPn&quot; uses &quot;SvNV&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since we don&rsquo;t have an NV
for $b, we&rsquo;ll have to use &quot;sv_2nv&quot; to
convert it. If we step again, we&rsquo;ll find ourselves
there:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl_sv_2nv (sv=0xa0675d0) at

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOURCE CODE STATIC ANALYSIS <br>
Various tools exist for analysing C source code statically,
as opposed to dynamically, that is, without executing the
code. It is possible to detect resource leaks, undefined
<br>
behaviour, type mismatches, portability problems, code paths
that would cause illegal memory accesses, and other similar
problems by just parsing the C code and looking at the <br>
resulting graph, what does it tell about the execution and
data flows. As a matter of fact, this is exactly how C
compilers know to give warnings about dubious code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lint, splint <br>
The good old C code quality inspector, &quot;lint&quot;, is
available in several platforms, but please be aware that
there are several different implementations of it by
different vendors, <br>
which means that the flags are not identical across
different platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a lint variant called
&quot;splint&quot; (Secure Programming Lint) available from
http://www.splint.org/ that should compile on any Unix-like
platform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are &quot;lint&quot; and
&lt;splint&gt; targets in Makefile, but you may have to
diddle with the flags (see above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Coverity <br>
Coverity (http://www.coverity.com/) is a product similar to
lint and as a testbed for their product they periodically
check several open source projects, and they give out <br>
accounts to open source developers to the defect
databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpd (cut-and-paste detector)
<br>
The cpd tool detects cut-and-paste coding. If one instance
of the cut-and-pasted code changes, all the other spots
should probably be changed, too. Therefore such code should
<br>
probably be turned into a subroutine or a macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpd
(http://pmd.sourceforge.net/cpd.html) is part of the pmd
project (http://pmd.sourceforge.net/). pmd was originally
written for static analysis of Java code, but later the cpd
<br>
part of it was extended to parse also C and C++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Download the pmd-bin-X.Y.zip ()
from the SourceForge site, extract the pmd-X.Y.jar from it,
and then run that on source code thusly:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">java -cp pmd-X.Y.jar
net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.CPD --minimum-tokens 100 --files
/some/where/src --language c &gt; cpd.txt</p>

in which case you should use the -Xmx option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">java -Xmx512M ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc warnings <br>
Though much can be written about the inconsistency and
coverage problems of gcc warnings (like &quot;-Wall&quot;
not meaning &quot;all the warnings&quot;, or some common
portability problems not <br>
being covered by &quot;-Wall&quot;, or &quot;-ansi&quot; and
&quot;-pedantic&quot; both being a poorly defined collection
of warnings, and so forth), gcc is still a useful tool in
keeping our coding nose <br>
clean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;-Wall&quot; is by
default on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;-ansi&quot; (and its
sidekick, &quot;-pedantic&quot;) would be nice to be on
always, but unfortunately they are not safe on all
platforms, they can for example cause fatal conflicts with
<br>
the system headers (Solaris being a prime example). If
Configure &quot;-Dgccansipedantic&quot; is used, the
&quot;cflags&quot; frontend selects &quot;-ansi
-pedantic&quot; for the platforms where they are <br>
known to be safe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting from Perl 5.9.4 the
following extra flags are added:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;-Wendif-labels&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;-Wextra&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;-Wdeclaration-after-statement&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following flags would be
nice to have but they would first need their own Augean

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;-Wpointer-arith&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;-Wshadow&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;-Wstrict-prototypes&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;-Wtraditional&quot; is
another example of the annoying tendency of gcc to bundle a
lot of warnings under one switch (it would be impossible to
deploy in practice because it would <br>
complain a lot) but it does contain some warnings that would
be beneficial to have available on their own, such as the
warning about string constants inside macros containing the
<br>
macro arguments: this behaved differently pre-ANSI than it
does in ANSI, and some C compilers are still in transition,
AIX being an example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warnings of other C compilers
<br>
Other C compilers (yes, there are other C compilers than
gcc) often have their &quot;strict ANSI&quot; or
&quot;strict ANSI with some portability extensions&quot;
modes on, like for example the Sun <br>
Workshop has its &quot;-Xa&quot; mode on (though
implicitly), or the DEC (these days, HP...) has its
&quot;-std1&quot; mode on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MEMORY DEBUGGERS <br>
NOTE 1: Running under memory debuggers such as Purify,
valgrind, or Third Degree greatly slows down the execution:
seconds become minutes, minutes become hours. For example as
of <br>
Perl 5.8.1, the ext/Encode/t/Unicode.t takes extraordinarily
long to complete under e.g. Purify, Third Degree, and
valgrind. Under valgrind it takes more than six hours, even
on <br>
a snappy computer. The said test must be doing something
that is quite unfriendly for memory debuggers. If you
don&rsquo;t feel like waiting, that you can simply kill away
the perl <br>
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE 2: To minimize the number
of memory leak false alarms (see
&quot;PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL&quot; for more information), you
have to set the environment variable PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL to
2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For csh-like shells:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setenv PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For Bourne-type shells:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2 <br>
export PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Unixy environments you can
also use the &quot;env&quot; command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">env PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2
valgrind ./perl -Ilib ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE 3: There are known memory
leaks when there are compile-time errors within eval or
require, seeing &quot;S_doeval&quot; in the call stack is a
good sign of these. Fixing these leaks is <br>
non-trivial, unfortunately, but they must be fixed
eventually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE 4: DynaLoader will not
clean up after itself completely unless Perl is built with
the Configure option
&quot;-Accflags=-DDL_UNLOAD_ALL_AT_EXIT&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rational Software&rsquo;s Purify
<br>
Purify is a commercial tool that is helpful in identifying
memory overruns, wild pointers, memory leaks and other such
badness. Perl must be compiled in a specific way for <br>
optimal testing with Purify. Purify is available under
Windows NT, Solaris, HP-UX, SGI, and Siemens Unix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Purify on Unix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Unix, Purify creates a new
Perl binary. To get the most benefit out of Purify, you
should create the perl to Purify using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh Configure -Accflags=-DPURIFY
-Doptimize=&rsquo;-g&rsquo; -Uusemymalloc
-Dusemultiplicity</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where these arguments mean:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
-Accflags=-DPURIFY</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disables Perl&rsquo;s arena
memory allocation functions, as well as forcing use of
memory allocation functions derived from the system
malloc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
-Doptimize=&rsquo;-g&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adds debugging information so
that you see the exact source statements where the problem
occurs. Without this flag, all you will see is the source
filename of where the error <br>
occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
-Uusemymalloc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disable Perl&rsquo;s malloc so
that Purify can more closely monitor allocations and leaks.
Using Perl&rsquo;s malloc will make Purify report most leaks
in the &quot;potential&quot; leaks category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
-Dusemultiplicity</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabling the multiplicity option
allows perl to clean up thoroughly when the interpreter
shuts down, which reduces the number of bogus leak reports
from Purify.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you&rsquo;ve compiled a
perl suitable for Purify&rsquo;ing, then you can just:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">make pureperl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which creates a binary named
&rsquo;pureperl&rsquo; that has been Purify&rsquo;ed. This
binary is used in place of the standard &rsquo;perl&rsquo;
binary when you want to debug Perl memory problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example, to show any
memory leaks produced during the standard Perl testset you
would create and run the Purify&rsquo;ed perl as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">make pureperl <br>
cd t <br>
../pureperl -I../lib harness</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which would run Perl on test.pl
and report any memory problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Purify outputs messages in
&quot;Viewer&quot; windows by default. If you don&rsquo;t
have a windowing environment or if you simply want the
Purify output to unobtrusively go to a log file <br>
instead of to the interactive window, use these following
options to output to the log file &quot;perl.log&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setenv PURIFYOPTIONS
&quot;-chain-length=25 -windows=no -log-file=perl.log
-append-logfile=yes&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you plan to use the
&quot;Viewer&quot; windows, then you only need this
option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setenv PURIFYOPTIONS
&quot;-chain-length=25&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Bourne-type shells:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PURIFYOPTIONS=&quot;...&quot;
<br>
export PURIFYOPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or if you have the
&quot;env&quot; utility:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">env
PURIFYOPTIONS=&quot;...&quot; ../pureperl ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Purify on NT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Purify on Windows NT instruments
the Perl binary &rsquo;perl.exe&rsquo; on the fly. <br>
There are several options in the makefile you should change
to get the most use out of Purify:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; DEFINES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should add -DPURIFY to the
DEFINES line so the DEFINES line looks something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFINES = -DWIN32 -D_CONSOLE
-DNO_STRICT $(CRYPT_FLAG) -DPURIFY=1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to disable Perl&rsquo;s arena
memory allocation functions, as well as to force use of
memory allocation functions derived from the system
malloc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; USE_MULTI =
define</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabling the multiplicity option
allows perl to clean up thoroughly when the interpreter
shuts down, which reduces the number of bogus leak reports
from Purify.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; #PERL_MALLOC =

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disable Perl&rsquo;s malloc so
that Purify can more closely monitor allocations and leaks.
Using Perl&rsquo;s malloc will make Purify report most leaks

memory, run Perl on test.pl, then finally report any memory
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">valgrind <br>
The excellent valgrind tool can be used to find out both
memory leaks and illegal memory accesses. As of version
3.3.0, Valgrind only supports Linux on x86, x86-64 and
PowerPC <br>
and Darwin (OS X) on x86 and x86-64). The special
&quot;test.valgrind&quot; target can be used to run the
tests under valgrind. Found errors and memory leaks are
logged in files named <br>
testfile.valgrind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Valgrind also provides a
cachegrind tool, invoked on perl as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VG_OPTS=--tool=cachegrind make
test.valgrind</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As system libraries (most
notably glibc) are also triggering errors, valgrind allows
to suppress such errors using suppression files. The default
suppression file that comes with <br>
valgrind already catches a lot of them. Some additional
suppressions are defined in t/perl.supp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To get valgrind and for more
information see</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://valgrind.org/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROFILING <br>
Depending on your platform there are various ways of
profiling Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two commonly used
techniques of profiling executables: statistical
time-sampling and basic-block counting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first method takes
periodically samples of the CPU program counter, and since
the program counter can be correlated with the code
generated for functions, we get a <br>
statistical view of in which functions the program is
spending its time. The caveats are that very small/fast
functions have lower probability of showing up in the
profile, and <br>
that periodically interrupting the program (this is usually
done rather frequently, in the scale of milliseconds)
imposes an additional overhead that may skew the results.
The <br>
first problem can be alleviated by running the code for
longer (in general this is a good idea for profiling), the
second problem is usually kept in guard by the profiling
tools <br>
themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second method divides up the
generated code into basic blocks. Basic blocks are sections
of code that are entered only in the beginning and exited
only at the end. For <br>
example, a conditional jump starts a basic block. Basic
block profiling usually works by instrumenting the code by
adding enter basic block #nnnn book-keeping code to the <br>
generated code. During the execution of the code the basic
block counters are then updated appropriately. The caveat is
that the added extra code can skew the results: again, the
<br>
profiling tools usually try to factor their own effects out
of the results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gprof Profiling <br>
gprof is a profiling tool available in many Unix platforms,
it uses statistical time-sampling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can build a profiled version
of perl called &quot;perl.gprof&quot; by invoking the make
target &quot;perl.gprof&quot; (What is required is that Perl
must be compiled using the &quot;-pg&quot; flag, you <br>
may need to re-Configure). Running the profiled version of
Perl will create an output file called gmon.out is created
which contains the profiling data collected during the <br>
execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The gprof tool can then display
the collected data in various ways. Usually gprof
understands the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; -a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppress statically defined
functions from the profile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; -b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppress the verbose
descriptions in the profile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; -e routine</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exclude the given routine and
its descendants from the profile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; -f routine</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display only the given routine
and its descendants in the profile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; -s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generate a summary file called
gmon.sum which then may be given to subsequent gprof runs to
accumulate data over several runs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; -z</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display routines that have zero
usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more detailed explanation of
the available commands and output formats, see your own
local documentation of gprof.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quick hint:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sh Configure -des -Dusedevel
-Doptimize=&rsquo;-pg&rsquo; &amp;&amp; make perl.gprof <br>
$ ./perl.gprof someprog # creates gmon.out in current
directory <br>
$ gprof ./perl.gprof &gt; out <br>
$ view out</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC gcov Profiling <br>
Starting from GCC 3.0 basic block profiling is officially
available for the GNU CC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can build a profiled version
of perl called perl.gcov by invoking the make target
&quot;perl.gcov&quot; (what is required that Perl must be
compiled using gcc with the flags <br>
&quot;-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage&quot;, you may need to
re-Configure).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running the profiled version of
Perl will cause profile output to be generated. For each
source file an accompanying &quot;.da&quot; file will be
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To display the results you use
the &quot;gcov&quot; utility (which should be installed if
you have gcc 3.0 or newer installed). gcov is run on source
code files, like this</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcov sv.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which will cause sv.c.gcov to be
created. The .gcov files contain the source code annotated
with relative frequencies of execution indicated by
&quot;#&quot; markers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Useful options of gcov include
&quot;-b&quot; which will summarise the basic block, branch,
and function call coverage, and &quot;-c&quot; which instead
of relative frequencies will use the actual <br>
counts. For more information on the use of gcov and basic
block profiling with gcc, see the latest GNU CC manual, as
of GCC 3.0 see</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.0/gcc.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and its section titled &quot;8.
gcov: a Test Coverage Program&quot;</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.0/gcc_8.html#SEC132</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quick hint:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sh Configure -des -Dusedevel
-Doptimize=&rsquo;-g&rsquo; -Accflags=&rsquo;-fprofile-arcs
-ftest-coverage&rsquo; -Aldflags=&rsquo;-fprofile-arcs

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MISCELLANEOUS TRICKS <br>
PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL <br>
If you want to run any of the tests yourself manually using
e.g. valgrind, or the pureperl or perl.third executables,
please note that by default perl does not explicitly <br>
cleanup all the memory it has allocated (such as global
memory arenas) but instead lets the exit() of the whole
program &quot;take care&quot; of such allocations, also
known as &quot;global <br>
destruction of objects&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a way to tell perl to
do complete cleanup: set the environment variable
PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL to a non-zero value. The t/TEST wrapper
does set this to 2, and this is what <br>
you need to do too, if you don&rsquo;t want to see the
&quot;global leaks&quot;: For example, for
&quot;third-degreed&quot; Perl:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">env PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2
./perl.third -Ilib t/foo/bar.t</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note: the mod_perl apache
module uses also this environment variable for its own
purposes and extended its semantics. Refer to the mod_perl
documentation for more information. <br>
Also, spawned threads do the equivalent of setting this
variable to the value 1.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If, at the end of a run you get
the message N scalars leaked, you can recompile with
&quot;-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS&quot;, which will cause the
addresses of all those leaked SVs to be <br>
dumped along with details as to where each SV was originally
allocated. This information is also displayed by
Devel::Peek. Note that the extra details recorded with each
SV <br>
increases memory usage, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be used in
production environments. It also converts
&quot;new_SV()&quot; from a macro into a real function, so
you can use your favourite debugger <br>
to discover where those pesky SVs were allocated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you see that you&rsquo;re
leaking memory at runtime, but neither valgrind nor
&quot;-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS&quot; will find anything,
you&rsquo;re probably leaking SVs that are still reachable
and <br>
will be properly cleaned up during destruction of the
interpreter. In such cases, using the &quot;-Dm&quot; switch
can point you to the source of the leak. If the executable
was built with <br>
&quot;-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS&quot;, &quot;-Dm&quot; will
output SV allocations in addition to memory allocations.
Each SV allocation has a distinct serial number that will be
written on creation <br>
and destruction of the SV. So if you&rsquo;re executing the
leaking code in a loop, you need to look for SVs that are
created, but never destroyed between each cycle. If such an
SV is <br>
found, set a conditional breakpoint within
&quot;new_SV()&quot; and make it break only when
&quot;PL_sv_serial&quot; is equal to the serial number of
the leaking SV. Then you will catch the <br>
interpreter in exactly the state where the leaking SV is
allocated, which is sufficient in many cases to find the
source of the leak.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As &quot;-Dm&quot; is using the
PerlIO layer for output, it will by itself allocate quite a
bunch of SVs, which are hidden to avoid recursion. You can
bypass the PerlIO layer if you use <br>
the SV logging provided by &quot;-DPERL_MEM_LOG&quot;
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL_MEM_LOG <br>
If compiled with &quot;-DPERL_MEM_LOG&quot;, both memory and
SV allocations go through logging functions, which is handy
for breakpoint setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless
&quot;-DPERL_MEM_LOG_NOIMPL&quot; is also compiled, the
logging functions read $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} to determine
whether to log the event, and if so how:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /m/ Log
all memory ops <br>
$ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /s/ Log all SV ops <br>
$ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /t/ include timestamp in Log <br>
$ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /^(+)/ write to FD given (default is
2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Memory logging is somewhat
similar to &quot;-Dm&quot; but is independent of
&quot;-DDEBUGGING&quot;, and at a higher level; all uses of
Newx(), Renew(), and Safefree() are logged with the
caller&rsquo;s <br>
source code file and line number (and C function name, if
supported by the C compiler). In contrast, &quot;-Dm&quot;
is directly at the point of &quot;malloc()&quot;. SV logging
is similar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the logging doesn&rsquo;t
use PerlIO, all SV allocations are logged and no extra SV
allocations are introduced by enabling the logging. If
compiled with <br>
&quot;-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS&quot;, the serial number for
each SV allocation is also logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DDD over gdb <br>
Those debugging perl with the DDD frontend over gdb may find
the following useful:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can extend the data
conversion shortcuts menu, so for example you can display an
SV&rsquo;s IV value with one click, without doing any
typing. To do that simply edit ~/.ddd/init <br>
file and add after:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! Display shortcuts. <br>
Ddd*gdbDisplayShortcuts: /t () // Convert to Bin /d () //
Convert to Dec /x () // Convert to Hex /o () // Convert to
Oct( <br>
the following two lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">((XPV*) (())-&gt;sv_any
)-&gt;xpv_pv // 2pvx ((XPVIV*) (())-&gt;sv_any )-&gt;xiv_iv
// 2ivx</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">so now you can do ivx and pvx
lookups or you can plug there the sv_peek
&quot;conversion&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl_sv_peek(my_perl, (SV*)())
// sv_peek</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(The my_perl is for threaded
builds.) Just remember that every line, but the last one,
should end with <br>
Alternatively edit the init file interactively via: 3rd
mouse button -&gt; New Display -&gt; Edit Menu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: you can define up to 20
conversion shortcuts in the gdb section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Poison <br>
If you see in a debugger a memory area mysteriously full of
0xABABABAB or 0xEFEFEFEF, you may be seeing the effect of
the Poison() macros, see perlclib.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Read-only optrees <br>
Under ithreads the optree is read only. If you want to
enforce this, to check for write accesses from buggy code,
compile with &quot;-DPL_OP_SLAB_ALLOC&quot; to enable the OP
slab <br>
allocator and &quot;-DPERL_DEBUG_READONLY_OPS&quot; to
enable code that allocates op memory via &quot;mmap&quot;,
and sets it read-only at run time. Any write access to an op
results in a &quot;SIGBUS&quot; <br>
and abort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This code is intended for
development only, and may not be portable even to all Unix
variants. Also, it is an 80% solution, in that it
isn&rsquo;t able to make all ops read only. <br>
Specifically it</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only sets read-only on all slabs
of ops at &quot;CHECK&quot; time, hence ops allocated later
via &quot;require&quot; or &quot;eval&quot; will be
re-write</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Turns an entire slab of ops
read-write if the refcount of any op in the slab needs to be
decreased.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Turns an entire slab of ops
read-write if any op from the slab is freed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s not possible to turn
the slabs to read-only after an action requiring read-write
access, as either can happen during op tree building time,
so there may still be legitimate <br>
write access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, as an 80% solution it
is still effective, as currently it catches a write access
during the generation of Config.pm, which means that we
can&rsquo;t yet build perl with this <br>
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .i Targets <br>
You can expand the macros in a foo.c file by saying</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">make foo.i</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which will expand the macros
using cpp. Don&rsquo;t be scared by the results.</p>
