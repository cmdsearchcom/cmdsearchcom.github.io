<p>MRTG(1) mrtg MRTG(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mrtg - What is MRTG ?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The Multi Router Traffic Grapher (MRTG) is a tool to monitor
the traffic load on network links. MRTG generates HTML pages
containing PNG images which provide a LIVE visual <br>
representation of this traffic. Check
http://www.stat.ee.ethz.ch/mrtg/ to see what it does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Go to <br>
http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg for all the details about
mrtg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HIGHLIGHTS <br>
Portable <br>
MRTG works on most UNIX platforms and Windows NT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl <br>
MRTG is written in Perl and comes with full source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portable SNMP <br>
MRTG Uses a highly portable SNMP implementation written
entirely in Perl (thanks to Simon Leinen). There is no need
to install any external SNMP package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SNMPv2c support <br>
MRTG can read the new SNMPv2c 64bit counters. No more
counter wrapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reliable Interface
Identification <br>
Router interfaces can be identified by IP address,
description and ethernet address in addition to the normal
interface number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Constant size Logfiles <br>
MRTG&rsquo;s logfiles do NOT grow thanks to the use of a
unique data consolidation algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatic Configuration <br>
MRTG comes with a set of configuration tools which make
configuration and setup very simple.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Performance <br>
Time critical routines are written in C (thanks to the
initiative of Dave Rand my Co-Author).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GIF free Graphics <br>
Graphics are generated directly in PNG format using the GD
library by Thomas Boutell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Customizability <br>
The look of the webpages produced by MRTG is highly
configurable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RRDtool <br>
MRTG has built-in hooks for using RRDtool. If you are
strapped for performance this may help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DETAILS <br>
MRTG consists of a Perl script which uses SNMP to read the
traffic counters of your routers and a fast C program which
logs the traffic data and creates beautiful graphs <br>
representing the traffic on the monitored network
connection. These graphs are embedded into webpages which
can be viewed from any modern Web-browser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to a detailed daily
view, MRTG also creates visual representations of the
traffic seen during the last seven days, the last five weeks
and the last twelve months. <br>
This is possible because MRTG keeps a log of all the data it
has pulled from the router. This log is automatically
consolidated so that it does not grow over time, but still
<br>
contains all the relevant data for all the traffic seen over
the last two years. This is all performed in an efficient
manner. Therefore you can monitor 200 or more network <br>
links from any halfway decent UNIX box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MRTG is not limited to
monitoring traffic, though. It is possible to monitor any
SNMP variable you choose. You can even use an external
program to gather the data which should <br>
be monitored via MRTG. People are using MRTG, to monitor
things such as System Load, Login Sessions, Modem
availability and more. MRTG even allows you to accumulate
two or more <br>
data sources into a single graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
In 1994 I was working at a site where we had one 64kbit line
to the outside world. Obviously, everybody was interested in
knowing how the link was performing. So I wrote a quick <br>
hack which created a constantly updated graph on the web
that showed the traffic load on our Internet link. This
eventually evolved into a rather configurable Perl script
called <br>
MRTG-1.0 which I released in spring 1995. After a few
updates, I left my job at DMU to start work at the Swiss
Federal Institute of Technology. Due to lack of time I had
to put <br>
MRTG aside. One day in January of 1996, I received email
from Dave Rand asking if I had any ideas why MRTG was so
slow. Actually, I did. MRTG&rsquo;s programming was not very
efficient <br>
and it was written entirely in Perl. After a week or so,
Dave wrote back to me and said he had tried what I had
suggested for improving MRTG&rsquo;s speed. Since the
changes did not <br>
help much, he had decided to rewrite the time-critical
sections of MRTG in C. The code was attached to his email.
His tool increased the speed of MRTG by a factor of 40! This
got <br>
me out of my &rsquo;MRTG ignorance&rsquo; and I started to
spend my spare time developing of MRTG-2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Soon after MRTG-2 development
had begun I started to give beta copies to interested
parties. In return I got many feature patches, a lot of user
feedback and bug fixes. The <br>
product you are getting now wouldn&rsquo;t be in this state
if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the great contributions and
support I received from of many people. I would like to take
this <br>
opportunity to thank them all. (See the files CHANGES for a
long list of folk people who helped to make MRTG what it is
today.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command-line <br>
Mrtg is also the name of the script you have to run to poll
data and generate the graphs. Most configuration is set
through the configuration file; some command-line options
<br>
exist all the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--user username and --group
groupname <br>
Run as the given user and/or group. (Unix Only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lock-file filename <br>
Use an alternate lock-file (the default is to use the
configuration-file appended with &quot;_l&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--confcache-file filename <br>
Use an alternate confcache-file (the default is to use the
configuration-file appended with &quot;.ok&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--logging filename|eventlog <br>
If this is set to writable filename, all output from mrtg
(warnings, debug messages, errors) will go to filename. If
you are running on Win32 you can specify eventlog instead
<br>
of a filename which will send all error to the windows event
log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE:Note, there is no Message
DLL for mrtg. This has the side effect that the windows
event logger will display a nice message with every entry in
the event log, complaing <br>
about the fact that mrtg has no message dll. If any of the
Windows folks want to contribute one, they are welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--daemon <br>
Put MRTG into the background, running as a daemon. This
works the same way as the config file option, but the switch
is required for proper FHS operation (because /var/run is
<br>
writable only by root)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fhs <br>
Configure all mrtg paths to conform to the FHS
specification; http://www.pathname.com/fhs/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check <br>
Only check the cfg file for errors. Do not do anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pid-file=s <br>
Define the name and path of the pid file for mrtg running as
a daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-only <br>
Only update the logfile, do not produce graphics or html
pages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug=s <br>
Enable debug options. The argument of the debug option is a
comma separated list of debug values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cfg - watch the config file
reading <br>
dir - directory mangeling <br>
base - basic program flow <br>
tarp - target parser <br>
snpo - snmp polling <br>
fork - forking view <br>
time - some timing info <br>
log - logging of data via rateup or rrdtool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug=&quot;cfg,snpo&quot;</p>
