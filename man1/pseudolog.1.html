pseudolog - pseudo log parser</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pseudolog -l [-Pv] [ -E timeformat ] [ -x flags ]
[SPECIFICATIONS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pseudolog [-UPv] [ -E timeformat
] [ -F format ] [ -x flags ]</p>

[SPECIFICATIONS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The pseudolog utility displays, creates, or deletes log
entries associated with the pseudo daemon. Creation of log
entries is useful only to create timestamps or notes; for
<br>
instance, you could create a log entry before beginning a
process, so there would be a timestamp for the beginning of
that process. There are a number of special options used to
<br>
match or create the components of a log entry; these are
called specifications, and are detailed in the
SPECIFICATIONS section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following other options are
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print a usage message and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Delete rows selected by the
query. This is not reversible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E timeformat <br>
Specify a format string (for strptime(3) or strftime(3) to
use) for displaying or interpreting time stamps. The same
format is used both for parsing and displaying <br>
stamps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F format <br>
Specifies a format string for displaying log entries. This
format cannot be used to create log entries, only for
display. The format string is a printf(3) type format <br>
string, with format specifiers matching the option
characters used in specifications (see SPECIFICATIONS).
There are some limitations on allowed formats, and misuse of
<br>
this feature could cause interesting or surprising
failures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Create a log entry. This
option is mutually exclusive with the -F option, or with any
relative specifications (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P path Specify that path should
be used as the PSEUDO_PREFIX value, overriding any
environment setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Restrict query output to
unique rows. Rows will have members defined by the -F
(format) option. If all members are the same between two
rows, only one is displayed. <br>
Applies only to queries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Increase verbosity (debug
level). Not useful except when debugging pseudo. Deprecated;
use -x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xflags Specify debugging flags
of interest. Not useful except when debugging pseudo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other option characters are
defined as specifications, and all of those require
arguments to specify their values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPECIFICATIONS <br>
The various components of a log entry can be specified,
either as command-line options, or as format specifiers. In
either case, the same character is used for a given
component <br>
of a log entry. When querying values, one of the following
prefixes may be prepended to a value; otherwise, the value
is used for a literal match (an SQL = operator).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; Greater than; true if the
related field is greater than the provided value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt; Less than; true if the
related field is less than the provided value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp; Bitwise and; true if the
related field, bitwise-and the provided value, is non-zero.
(This is useful primarily for permissions or modes.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= Equal to. (This is a no-op, as
of this writing.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! Not equal to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% Similar to ~. This is valid
only on text fields, and is equivalent to the SQL LIKE
operator, with % patterns on the ends; it performs an
unanchored, case-insensitive <br>
match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~ Similar to %. This is valid
only on text fields, and is equivalent to the SQL LIKE
operator, but performs an anchored match. The match is
case-insensitive. The speci&acirc; <br>
fier ~%foo% is equivalent to the specifier %foo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^ Unlike. This is the inverse of
~; it specifies NOT LIKE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Escape the string. This is
useful if you want to have one of the other modifiers at the
beginning of the string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only =and.ft R modifiers may be
used in conjunction with the -l option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following characters
correspond to specific fields in a log entry. In general,
numeric values are parsed in the standard C idiom (where a
leading 0 indicates an octal value, <br>
and a leading 0x indicates a hexadecimal value, and any
other number is decimal). A few fields are parsed or
displayed in other ways, as detailed in their entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a Access mode. This is an access
mode specified in the form used by fopen(3), such as
&quot;r+&quot; to indicate read/write access. Note that
specifying a as an access mode will <br>
include non-append writes, as the &quot;a&quot; mode implies
write and append both. This feature is slightly experimental
and may not correctly identify the access type of every <br>
access. The string x may be specified to indicate execute
access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Client ID (the PID of a
client).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Device number (from a stat
buffer).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f File descriptor. In some
cases, messages have an associated file descriptor
identified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g GID. The group ID associated
with an entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G Tag. This is a text field. In
log entries created by pseudo, this field holds the value
that the environment variable PSEUDO_TAG had in the
client&rsquo;s environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i Inode number (from a stat
buffer).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I ID. This is the database row
number. Normally these are assigned as monotonically
increasing values as rows are inserted, making them a more
reliable sorting mechanism <br>
than timestamps. The default ordering is by ID. m
Permissions. These can be entered as an octal value or as a
symbolic mode string, similar to the output of ls(1) -l.
<br>
The file type component is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M Mode. This can be entered as
an octal value or as a symbolic mode string, similar to the
output of ls(1) -l. This is tested against the whole file
mode, including both <br>
the type and permissions bits. In general, it is more useful
to use the m or t specifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Operation. This is the name of
the file system operation (e.g., &quot;open&quot; or
&quot;rename&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">O Order. This takes another
specification character as the field on which to order
results. A &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; implies a descending order
sort, a &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; or no modifier specifies an <br>
ascending order sort. By default, records are sorted by
ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p File path. This is a text
field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Result. This is the pseudo
result code, most often &quot;fail&quot; or
&quot;succeed&quot;. Note that &quot;fail&quot;
doesn&rsquo;t mean that an underlying operation failed; for
instance, if a &quot;stat&quot; <br>
operation fails, it usually means that there was no entry in
the pseudo database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R Program. This is the program
name (as retrieved by glibc&rsquo;s program_invocation_name
variable), which has the full path if and only if the
program was invoked by full path <br>
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s Timestamp. The format of this
field is controlled by the -E format string, which is used
with strftime(3) when displaying entries, or with
strptime(3) when interpreting <br>
command line values. There is a small selection of common
default time formats understood by the parser. Time fields
not specified default to the current time. Note <br>
that specifying a time stamp when creating a log entry may
yield confusing results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S Severity. Log messages can
have a severity, with the default for file operations being
&quot;info&quot;. t File type. This corresponds to the first
letter of a mode string, or <br>
the values accepted by the -type option to find(1). This is
compared only against the file type bits of a mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T Text. This is an optional
field available for user use when creating log entries, or
to hold the text of an error message when an error is
logged. It is, of course, a <br>
text field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u UID. The user ID associated
with an entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">y Type. This is usually
&quot;op&quot; for operations, or &quot;ping&quot; for the
ping messages clients send to confirm server availability.
Other types should rarely occur, but include <br>
&quot;ack&quot; and &quot;nak&quot; for server responses
(which are never logged), and &quot;halt&quot; for shutdown
messages (currently not logged).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following examples illustrate some of the likely usage
patterns for pseudolog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pseudolog -m
&rsquo;&amp;020&rsquo; -t d <br>
Report on all directories which are group-writeable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pseudolog -m 755 -t f <br>
Report on all plain files which have the mode rwxr-xr-x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pseudolog -s
&rsquo;&gt;03:19:00&rsquo; -s &rsquo;&lt;03:20:00&rsquo;
<br>
Report on all entries created after 03:19:00 and before
03:20:00 on the current date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pseudolog -p
&rsquo;~/usr/bin/%&rsquo; -F &rsquo;%-8o %p&rsquo; <br>
Report on every entry with a path beginning with the string
&rsquo;/usr/bin&rsquo;, displaying the operation name (in a
space-padded field of eight characters, left-adjusted)
fol&acirc; <br>
lowed by the path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pseudolog -l -T &rsquo;stamp
test&rsquo; <br>
Create an entry with all fields zero or blank, except for
the text field, which is set to the text &quot;stamp
test&quot;, and the timestamp, which is set to the current
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pseudolog -D -r succeed -F
&rsquo;%p&rsquo; -O p <br>
Display all paths for which operations succeeded, sorted by
path value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The only environment variable supported by pseudolog is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PSEUDO_PREFIX <br>
If set, the variable PSEUDO_PREFIX is used to determine the
path to use to find the logs.db database file, in
PSEUDO_PREFIX/var/pseudo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The user might think our intent is to replace all of SQL.
It&rsquo;s not. If the options here aren&rsquo;t enough,
rather than adding more options to this already fairly
elaborate program, <br>
just do raw SQL queries on the logs.db file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The formatting options are
handled by converting them into printf(3) format strings,
without much checking. As a result, it is possible for a
malformed format string to cause <br>
printf() to explode unexpectedly.</p>
