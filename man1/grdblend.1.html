<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
grdblend - Blend several partially over-lapping grids into
one large grid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
grdblend [ blendfile | grid1 grid2 &acirc;&brvbar; ]
-Goutgrid [ -Iincrement ] [ -Rregion ] [ -Cf|l|o|u ] [
-Nnodata ] [ -Q ] [ -Zscale ] [ -V[level] ] [ -W[z] ] [
-fflags ] [ -nflags <br>
] [ -r ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: No space is allowed
between the option flag and the associated arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
grdblend reads a listing of grid files and blend parameters
and creates a binary grid file by blending the other grids
using cosine-taper weights. grdblend will report if some of
<br>
the nodes are not filled in with data. Such unconstrained
nodes are set to a value specified by the user [Default is
NaN]. Nodes with more than one value will be set to the <br>
weighted average value. Any input grid that does not share
the final output grid&acirc;s node registration and grid
spacing will automatically be resampled via calls to
grdsample. <br>
Note: Due to the row-by-row i/o nature of operations in
grdblend we only support the netCDF and native binary grid
formats for both input and output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIRED ARGUMENTS <br>
-Goutgrid <br>
outgrid is the name of the binary output grid file. (See
GRID FILE FORMATS below). Only netCDF and native binary grid
formats are can be written directly. Other output <br>
format choices will be handled by reformatting the output
once blending is complete.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ixinc[unit][+e|n][/yinc[unit][+e|n]]
<br>
x_inc [and optionally y_inc] is the grid spacing.
Optionally, append a suffix modifier. Geographical (degrees)
coordinates: Append m to indicate arc minutes or s to
indi&acirc; <br>
cate arc seconds. If one of the units e, f, k, M, n or u is
appended instead, the increment is assumed to be given in
meter, foot, km, Mile, nautical mile or US survey <br>
foot, respectively, and will be converted to the equivalent
degrees longitude at the middle latitude of the region (the
conversion depends on PROJ_ELLIPSOID). If y_inc is <br>
given but set to 0 it will be reset equal to x_inc;
otherwise it will be converted to degrees latitude. All
coordinates: If +e is appended then the corresponding max x
<br>
(east) or y (north) may be slightly adjusted to fit exactly
the given increment [by default the increment may be
adjusted slightly to fit the given domain]. Finally, <br>
instead of giving an increment you may specify the number of
nodes desired by appending +n to the supplied integer
argument; the increment is then recalculated from the <br>
number of nodes and the domain. The resulting increment
value depends on whether you have selected a
gridline-registered or pixel-registered grid; see
App-file-formats for <br>
details. Note: if -Rgrdfile is used then the grid spacing
has already been initialized; use -I to override the
values.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Rxmin/xmax/ymin/ymax[+r][+uunit]
(more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Specify the region of interest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS <br>
blendfile <br>
ASCII file with one record per grid file to include in the
blend. Each record may contain up to three items, separated
by spaces or tabs: the gridfile name (required), <br>
the -R-setting for the interior region (optional), and the
relative weight wr (optional). In the combined weighting
scheme, this grid will be given zero weight outside its <br>
domain, weight = wr inside the interior region, and a 2-D
cosine-tapered weight between those end-members in the
boundary strip. However, if a negative wr is given then <br>
the sense of tapering is inverted (i.e., zero weight inside
its domain). If the inner region should instead exactly
match the grid region then specify a - instead of the <br>
-R-setting, or leave it off entirely. Likewise, if a weight
wr is not specified we default to a weight of 1. If the
ASCII blendfile file is not given grdblend will read <br>
standard input. Alternatively, if you have more than one
grid file to blend and you wish (a) all input grids to have
the same weight (1) and (b) all grids should use their <br>
actual region as the interior region, then you may simply
list all the grids on the command line instead of providing
a blendfile. You must specify at least 2 input grids <br>
for this mechanism to work. Any grid that is not
co-registered with the desired output layout implied by -R,
-I (and -r) will first be resampled via grdsample. Also,
grids <br>
that are not in netCDF or native binary format will first be
reformatted via grdconvert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Clobber mode: Instead of
blending, simply pick the value of one of the grids that
covers a node. Select from the following modes: f for the
first grid to visit a node; o <br>
for the last grid to visit a node; l for the grid with the
lowest value, and u for the grid with the uppermost value.
For modes f and o the ordering of grids in the blend&acirc;
<br>
file will dictate which grid contributes to the final
result. Weights and cosine tapering are not considered when
clobber mode is active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Nnodata <br>
No data. Set nodes with no input grid to this value [Default
is NaN].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Create a header-less grid
file suitable for use with grdraster. Requires that the
output grid file is a native format (i.e., not netCDF).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V[level] (more &acirc;&brvbar;)
<br>
Select verbosity level [c].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W[z] Do not blend, just output
the weights used for each node [Default makes the blend].
Append z to write the weight*z sum instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Zscale <br>
Scale output values by scale before writing to file.
[1].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f[i|o]colinfo (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Specify data types of input and/or output columns.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n[b|c|l|n][+a][+bBC][+c][+tthreshold]
(more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Select interpolation mode for grids.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r (more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Set pixel node registration [gridline].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-^ or just - <br>
Print a short message about the syntax of the command, then
exits (NOTE: on Windows just use -).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+ or just + <br>
Print an extensive usage (help) message, including the
explanation of any module-specific option (but not the GMT
common options), then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? or no arguments <br>
Print a complete usage (help) message, including the
explanation of all options, then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRID FILE FORMATS <br>
By default GMT writes out grid as single precision floats in
a COARDS-complaint netCDF file format. However, GMT is able
to produce grid files in many other commonly used grid <br>
file formats and also facilitates so called
&acirc;packing&acirc; of grids, writing out floating point
data as 1- or 2-byte integers. To specify the precision,
scale and offset, the user <br>
should add the suffix =ID[+sscale][+ooffset][+ninvalid],
where ID is a two-letter identifier of the grid type and
precision, and scale and offset are optional scale factor
and <br>
offset to be applied to all grid values, and invalid is the
value used to indicate missing data. See grdconvert and
Section grid-file-format of the GMT Technical Reference and
<br>
Cookbook for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When writing a netCDF file, the
grid is stored by default with the variable name
&acirc;z&acirc;. To specify another variable name varname,
append ?varname to the file name. Note that you <br>
may need to escape the special meaning of ? in your shell
program by putting a backslash in front of it, or by placing
the filename and suffix between quotes or double quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GEOGRAPHICAL AND TIME
COORDINATES <br>
When the output grid type is netCDF, the coordinates will be
labeled &acirc;longitude&acirc;, &acirc;latitude&acirc;, or
&acirc;time&acirc; based on the attributes of the input data
or grid (if any) or on the -f or <br>
-R options. For example, both -f0x -f1t and -R90w/90e/0t/3t
will result in a longitude/time grid. When the x, y, or z
coordinate is time, it will be stored in the grid as
rela&acirc; <br>
tive time since epoch as specified by TIME_UNIT and
TIME_EPOCH in the gmt.conf file or on the command line. In
addition, the unit attribute of the time variable will
indicate <br>
both this unit and epoch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TAPERING <br>
While the weights computed are tapered from 1 to 0, we are
computing weighted averages, so if there is only a single
grid given then the weighted output will be identical to the
<br>
input. If you are looking for a way to taper your data grid,
see grdmath&acirc;s TAPER operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To create a grid file from the four grid files piece_?.nc,
giving them each the different weights, make the blendfile
like this</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">piece_1.nc -R&lt;subregion_1&gt;
1 <br>
piece_2.nc -R&lt;subregion_2&gt; 1.5 <br>
piece_3.nc -R&lt;subregion_3&gt; 0.9 <br>
piece_4.nc -R&lt;subregion_4&gt; 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt grdblend blend.job
-Gblend.nc -R&lt;full_region&gt; -I&lt;dx/dy&gt; -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To blend all the grids called
MB_*.nc given them all equal weight, try</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt grdblend MB_*.nc -Gblend.nc
-R&lt;full_region&gt; -I&lt;dx/dy&gt; -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING ON LARGE FILE SETS <br>
While grdblend can process any number of files, it works by
keeping those files open that are being blended, and close
files as soon as they are finished. Depending on your
ses&acirc; <br>
sion, many files may remain open at the same time. Some
operating systems set fairly modest default limits on how
many concurrent files can be open, e.g., 256. If you run
into <br>
this problem then you can change this limit; see your
operating system documentation for how to change system
limits.</p>
