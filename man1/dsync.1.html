<p>DSYNC(1) Dovecot DSYNC(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dsync - Dovecot&rsquo;s mailbox synchronization utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dsync [options] mirror location2 <br>
dsync [options] backup location2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dsync is Dovecot&rsquo;s mailbox synchronization utility. It
can be used for several different use cases: Two-way
synchronization of mailboxes in different servers (via
ssh(1)), cre&acirc; <br>
ating backups of mails to a remote server, and convert
mailboxes from/to different mailbox formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syncing is done as perfectly
as possible: an IMAP or a POP3 client shouldn&rsquo;t be
able to notice any differences between the two mailboxes.
Two-way syncing means that it&rsquo;s <br>
safe to do any kind of modifications in both sides, and
dsync will merge the changes without losing any changes done
on either side. This is possible because dsync can access
<br>
Dovecot&rsquo;s index logs that keep track of changes.
It&rsquo;s of course possible to have conflicts during
merging, these are resolved in a safe way. See the dsync
design document for <br>
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dsync uses the same
configuration files as the rest of Dovecot (via doveconf
binary). The entire configuration can be changed by giving
-c parameter to another configuration <br>
file, or using -o parameter to override specific settings.
When executing a remote dsync program it works the same way:
it uses its own local configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dsync can be run completely
standalone. It doesn&rsquo;t require any Dovecot server
processes to be running, except when using -u parameter to
do a userdb lookup from auth process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dsync can currently sync only
one user at a time. If you want to dsync all users,
you&rsquo;ll need to get a list of all users and execute
dsync separately for each one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any errors are written to
stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
dsync recognizes the following command line options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c config-file <br>
read configuration from the given config-file. By default
/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf will be used. -C alt_char
Specifies an alternative mailbox name character. If source
<br>
and destination mailbox formats are different, it&rsquo;s
possible that on one side there exists a mailbox name that
isn&rsquo;t valid for the other side. These invalid mailbox
names <br>
are fixed by replacing such invalid characters with the
given alt_char. The default is &rsquo;_&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Activates debug messages and
makes dsync more verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Makes dsync run in &quot;full
sync&quot; mode rather than &quot;fast sync&quot; mode. In
fast sync mode dsync might skip syncing a mailbox, if both
locations had modified it equally many <br>
times (i.e. highest-modseqs were equal), but with different
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m mailbox <br>
Specifies the mailbox that should be synchronized or from
which mails should be converted. The default is to
synchronize all respectively convert from all mailboxes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o setting=value <br>
Overrides the configuration setting from
/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf and from the userdb with the given
value. In order to override multiple settings, the -o option
may be <br>
specified multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Reverse backup direction, so
mails in location2 are backed up to default mail
location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u user <br>
Specifies that the userdb lookup for the given user should
be done and used to set up the environment (uid, gid, home,
etc.). By default the system user&rsquo;s current
envi&acirc; <br>
ronment will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Makes dsync more verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
location2 <br>
The first mail location is based on configuration
(mail_location or userdb settings). It&rsquo;s also possible
to override it by giving -o mail_location=mail_location
setting. <br>
This parameter defines the other mail location that is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the location is on local
filesystem, you can use a regular mail_location, such as
maildir:/backup/user/Maildir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the location is on a remote
server, dsync can ssh to it by giving host or user@host as
the parameter. If user is specified, it&rsquo;s given as -u
parameter to dsync, not to <br>
ssh. The ssh username is always the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The final way to specify a
location is to give a full command line or a path to a
script that executes the dsync. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssh mailuser@host dsync -u
user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
dsync provides the following commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mirror <br>
Does a two-way synchronization between two mail locations.
Changes in both locations are synchronized to the other one,
without losing any changes made by either of them. Any <br>
potential UID conflicts are resolved by giving them new
UIDs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">backup <br>
Backup mails from default mail location to location2 (or
vice versa, if -R parameter is given). No changes are ever
done to the source location. Any changes done in destination
<br>
are discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
dsync will exit with one of the following values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Synchronization was done
perfectly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Synchronization was done
without errors, but some changes couldn&rsquo;t be done, so
the mailboxes aren&rsquo;t perfectly synchronized. Running
dsync again usually fixes this. Typically <br>
this occurs for message modification sequences with newly
created mailboxes. It can also occur if one of the mailboxes
change during the syncing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1, &gt;2 <br>
Synchronization failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
MIRRORING <br>
Mirror mailboxes to a remote server. Any errors are written
to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dsync -u username mirror
username@example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need more complex
parameters to ssh, you can use e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dsync -u username mirror ssh -i
id_dsa.dovecot mailuser@example.com dsync -u username</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONVERTING <br>
Assuming that the mail_location setting in
/etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-mail.conf is set to: mail_location =
mdbox:~/mdbox, a logged in system user may convert her/his
mails from its <br>
Maildir in her/his home directory to the mdbox mailbox
format. The user has to execute the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dsync mirror
maildir:~/Maildir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to do this without
any downtime, you can do the conversion one user at a time.
Initially:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Configuration
uses mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Set up the
possibility of doing per-user mail location using userdb
extra fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then for each user:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Run dsync mirror once to do
the initial conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Run dsync mirror again,
because the initial conversion could have taken a while and
new changes could have occurred during it. This second time
only applies changes, so <br>
it should be fast.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Update mail extra field in
userdb to mdbox:~/mdbox. If you&rsquo;re using auth cache,
you need to flush it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Wait for a few seconds and
then kill the user&rsquo;s all existing imap and pop3
sessions (that are still using maildir).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Run dsync mirror once more to
apply final changes that were possibly done. After this
there should be no changes to Maildir, because the
user&rsquo;s mail location has been <br>
changed and all existing processes using it have been
killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once all users have been
converted, you can set the default mail_location to mdbox
and remove the per-user mail locations from userdb.</p>
