<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pg_ctl is a utility for initializing a PostgreSQL database
cluster, starting, stopping, or restarting the PostgreSQL
database server (postgres(1)), or displaying the status of a
<br>
running server. Although the server can be started manually,
pg_ctl encapsulates tasks such as redirecting log output and
properly detaching from the terminal and process group. <br>
It also provides convenient options for controlled
shutdown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The init or initdb mode creates
a new PostgreSQL database cluster. A database cluster is a
collection of databases that are managed by a single server
instance. This mode invokes <br>
the initdb command. See initdb(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In start mode, a new server is
launched. The server is started in the background, and its
standard input is attached to /dev/null (or nul on Windows).
On Unix-like systems, by <br>
default, the server&rsquo;s standard output and standard
error are sent to pg_ctl&rsquo;s standard output (not
standard error). The standard output of pg_ctl should then
be redirected to a <br>
file or piped to another process such as a log rotating
program like rotatelogs; otherwise postgres will write its
output to the controlling terminal (from the background) and
<br>
will not leave the shell&rsquo;s process group. On Windows,
by default the server&rsquo;s standard output and standard
error are sent to the terminal. These default behaviors can
be changed <br>
by using -l to append the server&rsquo;s output to a log
file. Use of either -l or output redirection is
recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In stop mode, the server that is
running in the specified data directory is shut down. Three
different shutdown methods can be selected with the -m
option. &acirc;Smart&acirc; mode (the <br>
default) waits for all active clients to disconnect and any
online backup to finish. If the server is in hot standby,
recovery and streaming replication will be terminated once
<br>
all clients have disconnected. &acirc;Fast&acirc; mode does
not wait for clients to disconnect and will terminate an
online backup in progress. All active transactions are
rolled back and <br>
clients are forcibly disconnected, then the server is shut
down. &acirc;Immediate&acirc; mode will abort all server
processes immediately, without a clean shutdown. This will
lead to a <br>
crash-recovery run on the next restart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restart mode effectively
executes a stop followed by a start. This allows changing
the postgres command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reload mode simply sends the
postgres process a SIGHUP signal, causing it to reread its
configuration files (postgresql.conf, pg_hba.conf, etc.).
This allows changing of <br>
configuration-file options that do not require a complete
restart to take effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status mode checks whether a
server is running in the specified data directory. If it is,
the PID and the command line options that were used to
invoke it are displayed. If the <br>
server is not running, the process returns an exit status of
3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In promote mode, the standby
server that is running in the specified data directory is
commanded to exit recovery and begin read-write
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill mode allows you to send a
signal to a specified process. This is particularly valuable
for Microsoft Windows which does not have a kill command.
Use --help to see a list of <br>
supported signal names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">register mode allows you to
register a system service on Microsoft Windows. The -S
option allows selection of service start type, either
&acirc;auto&acirc; (start service automatically on <br>
system startup) or &acirc;demand&acirc; (start service on
demand).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unregister mode allows you to
unregister a system service on Microsoft Windows. This
undoes the effects of the register command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c, --core-file <br>
Attempt to allow server crashes to produce core files, on
platforms where this is possible, by lifting any soft
resource limit placed on core files. This is useful in <br>
debugging or diagnosing problems by allowing a stack trace
to be obtained from a failed server process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D datadir, --pgdata datadir
<br>
Specifies the file system location of the database files. If
this is omitted, the environment variable PGDATA is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l filename, --log filename <br>
Append the server log output to filename. If the file does
not exist, it is created. The umask is set to 077, so access
to the log file is disallowed to other users by <br>
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m mode, --mode mode <br>
Specifies the shutdown mode. mode can be smart, fast, or
immediate, or the first letter of one of these three. If
this is omitted, smart is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o options <br>
Specifies options to be passed directly to the postgres
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options should usually be
surrounded by single or double quotes to ensure that they
are passed through as a group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o initdb-options <br>
Specifies options to be passed directly to the initdb
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options should usually be
surrounded by single or double quotes to ensure that they
are passed through as a group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p path <br>
Specifies the location of the postgres executable. By
default the postgres executable is taken from the same
directory as pg_ctl, or failing that, the hard-wired
installation <br>
directory. It is not necessary to use this option unless you
are doing something unusual and get errors that the postgres
executable was not found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In init mode, this option
analogously specifies the location of the initdb
executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --silent <br>
Print only errors, no informational messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --timeout <br>
The maximum number of seconds to wait when waiting for
startup or shutdown to complete. Defaults to the value of
the PGCTLTIMEOUT environment variable or, if not set, to 60
<br>
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print the pg_ctl version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w <br>
Wait for the startup or shutdown to complete. Waiting is the
default option for shutdowns, but not startups. When waiting
for startup, pg_ctl repeatedly attempts to connect <br>
to the server. When waiting for shutdown, pg_ctl waits for
the server to remove its PID file. pg_ctl returns an exit
code based on the success of the startup or shutdown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W <br>
Do not wait for startup or shutdown to complete. This is the
default for start and restart modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Show help about pg_ctl command line arguments, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for Windows <br>
-N servicename <br>
Name of the system service to register. The name will be
used as both the service name and the display name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P password <br>
Password for the user to start the service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S start-type <br>
Start type of the system service to register. start-type can
be auto, or demand, or the first letter of one of these two.
If this is omitted, auto is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U username <br>
User name for the user to start the service. For domain
users, use the format DOMAINsername.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
PGCTLTIMEOUT <br>
Default limit on the number of seconds to wait when waiting
for startup or shutdown to complete. If not set, the default
is 60 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PGDATA <br>
Default data directory location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pg_ctl, like most other
PostgreSQL utilities, also uses the environment variables
supported by libpq (see Section 31.14, &acirc;Environment
Variables&acirc;, in the documentation). For <br>
additional server variables, see postgres(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
postmaster.pid <br>
The existence of this file in the data directory is used to
help pg_ctl determine if the server is currently
running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">postmaster.opts <br>
If this file exists in the data directory, pg_ctl (in
restart mode) will pass the contents of the file as options
to postgres, unless overridden by the -o option. The <br>
contents of this file are also displayed in status mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Starting the Server <br>
To start the server:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pg_ctl start</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start the server, waiting
until the server is accepting connections:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pg_ctl -w start</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start the server using port
5433, and running without fsync, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pg_ctl -o &quot;-F -p
5433&quot; start</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stopping the Server <br>
To stop the server, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pg_ctl stop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -m option allows control
over how the server shuts down:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pg_ctl stop -m fast</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Restarting the Server <br>
Restarting the server is almost equivalent to stopping the
server and starting it again, except that pg_ctl saves and
reuses the command line options that were passed to the <br>
previously running instance. To restart the server in the
simplest form, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pg_ctl restart</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To restart the server, waiting
for it to shut down and restart:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pg_ctl -w restart</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To restart using port 5433,
disabling fsync upon restart:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pg_ctl -o &quot;-F -p
5433&quot; restart</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Showing the Server Status <br>
Here is sample status output from pg_ctl:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pg_ctl status <br>
pg_ctl: server is running (PID: 13718) <br>
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/postgres &quot;-D&quot;
&quot;/usr/local/pgsql/data&quot; &quot;-p&quot;
&quot;5433&quot; &quot;-B&quot; &quot;128&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the command line that
would be invoked in restart mode.</p>
