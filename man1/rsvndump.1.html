<p>RSVNDUMP(1) User commands RSVNDUMP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rsvndump - Dumps a remote Subversion repository</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rsvndump [options] url</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
rsvndump dumps a Subversion repository without having actual
access to the repository data, as required by the
&quot;svnadmin(1) dump&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If invoked with valid options,
rsvndump will print a dump file to stdout and optional
progress to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since rsvndump is also able to
dump subdirectories of a repository, the revision numbers in
the dump don&acirc;t necessarily reflect the original
revision numbers. For more information <br>
on this, please refer to the REVISION NUMBERS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are also some additional
differences to a &quot;normal&quot; dump generated by
svnadmin(1), which are listed in DIFFERENCES TO SVNADMIN
DUMP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Most of the options can also be found in svnadmin(1) and
svn(1) and should be semantically equivalent, unless not
stated otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a nice help screen</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Don&acirc;t print any progress</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Print detailed progress, similar to &quot;svnadmin(1)
load&quot;. Can be specified multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --username username <br>
User name for repository authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --password password <br>
Password for repository authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --revision X or X:Y <br>
Specify the revision (or revision range) that should be
dumped. X and Y can either be a number or &quot;HEAD&quot;.
The default revision range is &quot;0:HEAD&quot;, i.e. the
complete revision <br>
history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In contrast to svnadmin(1),
dumps that were generated using this option can always be
loaded into a new repository, (unless --incremental is
given, of course). However, the <br>
resulting dump may not exactly represent the original
history. Please take a look at DIFFERENCES TO SVNADMIN DUMP
for further information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--deltas <br>
Use text deltas instead of full texts in dump output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--incremental <br>
Create incremental output, suitable for concatenation. This
results in a dump that does not contain a dumpfile header
and no full base revision if the revision range does not
<br>
start at 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-auth-cache <br>
Don&acirc;t cache the authentication tokens provided by the
user, e.g. user name and password, or manual SSL certificate
validation. This is equal to the corresponding option in
<br>
svn(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--non-interactive <br>
Instead of prompting, the program will exit with an error.
This is equal to the corresponding option in svn(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config-dir dir <br>
Use the given Subversion configuration directory when
opening a session to the repository. This is equal to the
corresponding option in svn(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--prefix prefix <br>
Prepend a given prefix to every node which is dumped. The
first revision dumped will also contain the paths necessary
to create the prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that is assumed that
prefix is really just a prefix string, with directories
separated by &quot;/&quot;. Therefore you need to append a
&quot;/&quot; at the end of the string to make <br>
it a directory. For example, a prefix of myrepo/old_ might
result in the following layout:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">myrepo <br>
|- old_branches <br>
|- old_tags <br>
|- old_trunk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keep-revnums <br>
Keep the revision numbers in the output in sync with the
repository. This is done by inserting empty revisions for
padding if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-incremental-header <br>
Don&acirc;t print the dumpfile header if --incrementals is
given and the revision range is not &quot;0:X&quot;. This is
useful if you really want to append an incremental dumps to
an <br>
existing file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --dry-run <br>
Don&acirc;t fetch text deltas, resulting in a dump without
file contents. This is mainly used for debugging purposes,
as the program operates normally but runs much faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--obfuscate <br>
Replaces all file and directory names with random strings.
This is useful for bug reports in combination with
--dry-run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REVISION NUMBERS <br>
The revision numbers in the dump output depend on the
options and the path that are given to rsvndump. If you are
dumping the root of a repository, you don&acirc;t need to
worry about <br>
revision numbers out of sync, of course. If you are dumping
a subdirectory, only the revisions that changed this
subdirectory will occur in the dump output. The revision
numbers <br>
in the dump are strictly sequential, so they will differ
from the original ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need the keep the
revision numbers from the original repository (e.g, if a bug
tracker depends on them), you can use the --keep-revnums
flag. It pads revisions that did <br>
not change the subdirectory with empty revisions. They
don&acirc;t have an author or date property, but contain the
log message &quot;This is an empty revision for
padding.&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIFFERENCES TO SVNADMIN DUMP
<br>
The output generated by rsvndump may differ from the one
generated by svnadmin(1) because rsvndump may handle file or
directory copies different than svnadmin(1). The latter does
<br>
not support dumping of subdirectories within a repository
out of the box. Instead, the svndumpfilter(1) tool will do
this job. However, sometimes subdirectories cannot be <br>
filtered exclusively with svndumpfilter(1) because they have
been copied from another place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since rsvndump has been designed
to allow dumps of subdirectories even if your repository
access is limited to this subdirectory (in fact, that was
the primary reason this <br>
project exists), it will not access other subdirectories
than the one you want to dump. Example given, dumping a
branch will most likely not result in the full history of
the <br>
branch as it might have been copied from trunk at some point
in time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus, rsvndump will generally
replace a copy action by a simple add operation if both of
the following conditions are true:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The source of
the copy is outside the directory tree which is being
dumped</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The source of
the copy is not included in the dump because the revision
range has been limited using the --revision flag</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second condition is without
effect if the --incremental flag is given, so that
incremental dumps yield the same result as normal dumps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Maybe I should also note that
the dump will only contain the repository&acirc;s UUID if
the following conditions are true:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The root of the
repository is being dumped</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; There is no user
prefix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
TMPDIR <br>
If TMPDIR is set, it specifies the directory to use for
temporary files. Otherwise, /tmp is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 on success, 1 on failure. Any error messages will be
printed to stderr.</p>
