<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ppmbrighten - change a PPM image&rsquo;s Saturation and
Value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ppmbrighten [-normalize] [-saturation
[+|-saturation_percent]] [-value [+|-value_percent]]
ppmfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimum unique abbreviation of
option is acceptable. You may use double hyphens instead of
single hyphen to denote options. You may use white space in
place of the equals sign <br>
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppmbrighten increases or
decreases the Saturation and Value (from the HSV color
space) of each pixel of a PPM image. You specify the per
centage change for each of those parame&acirc; <br>
ters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also remap the colors of
the pixels so their Values cover the full range of possible
Values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hue-Saturation-Value, or HSV, is
one way to represent a color, like the more well-known RGB.
Hue, Saturation, and Value are numbers in the range from 0
to 1. We always capital&acirc; <br>
ize them in this document when we mean the number from the
HSV color space, especially since &quot;value&quot; as a
conventional English word has a much more abstract
meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Value is a measure of how bright
the color is, relative to some specified maximum (the PPM
format is also defined in terms of a specified maximum
brightness -- For the purposes <br>
of this program, they are the same). In particular, it is
the brightness of the brightest primary color component of
the color divided by the maximum brightness possible for a
<br>
component. Zero Value means black. White has full Value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hue is an indication of the
secondary color with the same brightness that most closely
approximates the color. A secondary color is made of a
combination of at most two of the <br>
primary colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Saturation is a measure of how
close the color is to the color indicated by the Hue and
Value. A lower number means more light of the third primary
color must be added to get <br>
the exact color. Full Saturation means the color is a
secondary color. Zero Saturation means the color is gray (or
black or white). Decreasing the saturation of a color tends
<br>
to make it washed out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If it is impossible to increase
the Value of a pixel by the amount you specify (e.g. the
Value is .5 and you specify +200%), ppmbrighten increases it
to full Value instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If it is impossible to increase
the Saturation of a pixel by the amount you specify (e.g. it
is already half saturated and you specify +200%),
ppmbrighten increases it to full <br>
Saturation instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a simpler kind of
brightening, you can use pamfunc -multiplier simply to
increase the brightness of each pixel by a specified per
centage, clipping each RGB component where <br>
the calculated brightness would exceed full brightness.
Thus, the brightest colors in the image would change
chromaticity in addition to not getting the specified
brightness <br>
boost. For decreasing brightness, pamfunc should do the same
thing as ppmbrighten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppmflash does another kind of
brightening. It changes the color of each pixel to bring it
a specified per centage closer to white. This increases the
value and saturation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To double the Value of each pixel: <br>
ppmbrighten -v 100</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To double the Saturation and
halve the Value of each pixel: <br>
ppmbrighten -s 100 -v -50</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-value value_percent <br>
This option specifies the amount, as a per centage, by which
you want to change the Value of each pixel. It may be
negative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-saturation value_percent <br>
This option specifies the amount, as a per centage, by which
you want to change the Saturation of each pixel. It may be
negative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-normalize <br>
This option causes ppmbrighten to linearly remap the Values
of the pixels to cover the range 0 to 1. The option name is
wrong -- this operation is not normalization (it <br>
was named in error and the name has been kept for backward
compatibility).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppmbrighten applies the
brightening that you specify with the -value option after
the remapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 10.14 (March
2003), your input must be from a seekable file (not a pipe)
to use -normalize. If it isn&rsquo;t, the program fails with
a bogus error message.</p>
