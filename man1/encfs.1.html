<p>ENCFS(1) Encrypted Filesystem ENCFS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
encfs - mounts or creates an encrypted virtual
filesystem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
encfs [--version] [-s] [-f] [-v|--verbose] [-i
MINUTES|--idle=MINUTES] [--extpass=program] [-S|--stdinpass]
[--anykey] [--forcedecode] [-d|--fuse-debug] [--public] <br>
[--no-default-flags] [--ondemand] [--delaymount] [--reverse]
[--standard] [-o FUSE_OPTION] rootdir mountPoint [-- [Fuse
Mount Options]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
EncFS creates a virtual encrypted filesystem which stores
encrypted data in the rootdir directory and makes the
unencrypted data visible at the mountPoint directory. The
user <br>
must supply a password which is used to (indirectly) encrypt
both filenames and file contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If EncFS is unable to find a
supported filesystem at the specified rootdir, then the user
will be asked if they wish to create a new encrypted
filesystem at the specified <br>
location. Options will be presented to the user allowing
some control over the algorithms to use. As EncFS matures,
there may be an increasing number of choices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-i, --idle=MINUTES <br>
Enable automatic unmount of the filesystem after a period of
inactivity. The period is specified in minutes, so the
shortest timeout period that can be requested is one <br>
minute. EncFS will not automatically unmount if there are
files open within the filesystem, even if they are open in
read-only mode. However simply having files open does <br>
not count as activity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f The -f (foreground) option
causes EncFS to run in the foreground. Normally EncFS spawns
off as a daemon and runs in the background, returning
control to the spawning shell. <br>
With the -f option, it will run in the foreground and any
warning/debug log messages will be displayed on standard
error. In the default (background) mode, all log messages
<br>
are logged via syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Causes EncFS to enable logging of various debug channels
within EncFS. Normally these logging messages are disabled
and have no effect. It is recommended that you run in <br>
foreground (-f) mode when running with verbose enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s The -s (single threaded)
option causes EncFS to run in single threaded mode. By
default, EncFS runs in multi-threaded mode. This option is
used during EncFS development in <br>
order to simplify debugging and allow it to run under memory
checking tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --fuse-debug <br>
Enables debugging within the FUSE library. This should only
be used if you suspect a problem within FUSE itself (not
EncFS), as it generates a lot of low-level data and is <br>
not likely to be very helpful in general problem tracking.
Try verbose mode (-v) first, which gives a higher level view
of what is happening within EncFS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--forcedecode <br>
This option only has an effect on filesystems which use MAC
block headers. By default, if a block is decoded and the
stored MAC doesn&rsquo;t match what is calculated, then an
IO <br>
error is returned to the application and the block is not
returned. However, by specifying --forcedecode, only an
error will be logged and the data will still be returned to
<br>
the application. This may be useful for attempting to read
corrupted files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--public <br>
Attempt to make encfs behave as a typical multi-user
filesystem. By default, all FUSE based filesystems are
visible only to the user who mounted them. No other users
<br>
(including root) can view the filesystem contents. The
--public option does two things. It adds the FUSE flags
&quot;allow_other&quot; and &quot;default_permission&quot;
when mounting the <br>
filesystem, which tells FUSE to allow other users to access
the filesystem, and to use the ownership permissions
provided by the filesystem. Secondly, the --public flag <br>
changes how encfs&rsquo;s node creation functions work - as
they will try and set ownership of new nodes based on the
caller identification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: In order for this to
work, encfs must be run as root -- otherwise it will not
have the ability to change ownership of files. I recommend
that you instead <br>
investigate if the fuse allow_other option can be used to do
what you want before considering the use of --public.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ondemand <br>
Mount the filesystem on-demand. This currently only makes
sense in combination with --idle and --extpass options. When
the filesystem becomes idle, instead of exiting, <br>
EncFS stops allowing access to the filesystem by internally
dropping its reference to it. If someone attempts to access
the filesystem again, the extpass program is used to <br>
prompt the user for the password. If this succeeds, then the
filesystem becomes available again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--delaymount <br>
Do not mount the filesystem when encfs starts; instead,
delay mounting until first use. This option only makes sense
with --ondemand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--require-macs <br>
If creating a new filesystem, this forces block
authentication code headers to be enabled. When mounting an
existing filesystem, this causes encfs to exit if block <br>
authentication code headers are not enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be used to improve
security in case the ciphertext is vulnerable to tampering,
by preventing an attacker from disabling MACs in the config
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reverse <br>
Normally EncFS provides a plaintext view of data on demand:
it stores enciphered data and displays plaintext data. With
--reverse it takes as source plaintext data and <br>
produces enciphered data on-demand. This can be useful for
creating remote encrypted backups, where you do not wish to
keep the local files unencrypted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the following would
create an encrypted view in /tmp/crypt-view.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">encfs --reverse /home/me
/tmp/crypt-view</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You could then copy the
/tmp/crypt-view directory in order to have a copy of the
encrypted data. You must also keep a copy of the file
/home/me/.encfs6.xml which contains <br>
the filesystem information. Together, the two can be used to
reproduce the unencrypted data:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENCFS6_CONFIG=/home/me/.encfs6.xml
encfs /tmp/crypt-view /tmp/plain-view</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now /tmp/plain-view contains the
same data as /home/me</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that --reverse mode only
works with limited configuration options, so many settings
may be disabled when used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nocache <br>
Disable the kernel&rsquo;s cache of file attributes. Setting
this option makes EncFS pass &quot;attr_timeout=0&quot; and
&quot;entry_timeout=0&quot; to FUSE. This makes sure that
modifications to the <br>
backing files that occour outside EncFS show up immediately
in the EncFS mount. The main use case for
&quot;--nocache&quot; is reverse mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--standard <br>
If creating a new filesystem, this automatically selects
standard configuration options, to help with automatic
filesystem creation. This is the set of options that should
<br>
be used unless you know what you&rsquo;re doing and have
read the documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When not creating a filesystem,
this flag does nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o FUSE_ARG <br>
Pass through FUSE args to the underlying library. This makes
it easy to pass FUSE options when mounting EncFS via mount
(and /etc/fstab). Eg:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount encfs#/home/me-crypt
/home/me -t fuse -o kernel_cache</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that encfs arguments cannot
be set this way. If you need to set encfs arguments, create
a wrapper, such as encfs-reverse;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh <br>
encfs --reverse &quot;$@&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then mount using the script
path</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mount encfs-reverse#/home/me
/home/me-crypt -t fuse</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- The -- option tells EncFS to
send any remaining arguments directly to FUSE. In turn, FUSE
passes the arguments to fusermount. See the fusermount help
page for information <br>
on available commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-default-flags <br>
Encfs adds the FUSE flags &quot;use_ino&quot; and
&quot;default_permissions&quot; by default, as of version
1.2.2, because that improves compatibility with some
programs. If for some reason you <br>
need to disable one or both of these flags, use the option
--no-default-flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following command lines
produce the same result:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">encfs raw crypt <br>
encfs --no-default-flags raw crypt -- -o
use_ino,default_permissions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--extpass=program <br>
Specify an external program to use for getting the user
password. When the external program is spawned, the
environment variable &quot;RootDir&quot; will be set to
contain the path to <br>
the root directory. The program should print the password to
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EncFS takes everything returned
from the program to be the password, except for a trailing
newline (0 which will be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, specifying
--extpass=/usr/lib/ssh/ssh-askpass will cause EncFS to use
ssh&rsquo;s password prompt program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: EncFS reads at most 2k of
data from the password program, and it removes any trailing
newline. Versions before 1.4.x accepted only 64 bytes of
text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --stdinpass <br>
Read password from standard input, without prompting. This
may be useful for scripting encfs mounts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that you should make sure
the filesystem and mount points exist first. Otherwise encfs
will prompt for the filesystem creation options, which may
interfere with your <br>
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--anykey <br>
Turn off key validation checking. This allows EncFS to be
used with secondary passwords. This could be used to store a
separate set of files in an encrypted filesystem. <br>
EncFS ignores files which do not decode properly, so files
created with separate passwords will only be visible when
the filesystem is mounted with their associated
password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if the primary
password is changed (using encfsctl), the other passwords
will not be usable unless the primary password is set back
to what it was, as the other <br>
passwords rely on an invalid decoding of the volume key,
which will not remain the same if the primary password is
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: Use this option at your
own risk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
ENCFS6_CONFIG <br>
Which config file (typically named .encfs6.xml) to use. By
default, the config file is read from the encrypted
directory. Using this option allows to store the config file
<br>
separated from the encrypted files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: If you lose the config
file, the encrypted file contents are irrecoverably lost. It
contains the master key encrypted with your password.
Without the master key, <br>
recovery is impossible, even if you know the password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Create a new encrypted filesystem. Store the raw (encrypted)
data in &quot;~/.crypt&quot; , and make the unencrypted data
visible in &quot;~/crypt&quot;. Both directories are in the
home directory <br>
in this example. This example shows the full output of encfs
as it asks the user if they wish to create the
filesystem:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% encfs ~/.crypt ~/crypt <br>
Directory &quot;/home/me/.crypt&quot; does not exist, create
(y,n)?y <br>
Directory &quot;/home/me/crypt&quot; does not exist, create
(y,n)?y <br>
Creating new encrypted volume. <br>
Please choose from one of the following options: <br>
enter &quot;x&quot; for expert configuration mode, <br>
enter &quot;p&quot; for pre-configured paranoia mode, <br>
anything else, or an empty line will select standard mode.
<br>
?&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard configuration selected.
<br>
Using cipher Blowfish, key size 160, block size 512 <br>
New Password: &lt;password entered here&gt; <br>
Verify: &lt;password entered here&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filesystem is now mounted
and visible in ~/crypt. If files are created there, they can
be seen in encrypted form in ~/.crypt. To unmount the
filesystem, use fusermount with <br>
the -u (unmount) option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% fusermount -u ~/crypt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another example. To mount the
same filesystem, but have fusermount name the mount point
&rsquo;/dev/foo&rsquo; (as shown in df and other tools which
read /etc/mtab), and also request <br>
kernel-level caching of file data (which are both special
arguments to fusermount):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% encfs ~/.crypt ~/crypt -- -n
/dev/foo -c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or, if you find strange behavior
under some particular program when working in an encrypted
filesystem, it may be helpful to run in verbose mode while
reproducing the problem and <br>
send along the output with the problem report:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% encfs -v -f ~/.crypt ~/crypt
2&gt; encfs-report.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to avoid leaking
sensitive information through the debugging channels, all
warnings and debug messages (as output in verbose mode)
contain only encrypted filenames. You <br>
can use the encfsctl program&rsquo;s decode function to
decode filenames if desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
EncFS is not a true filesystem. It does not deal with any of
the actual storage or maintenance of files. It simply
translates requests (encrypting or decrypting as necessary)
<br>
and passes the requests through to the underlying host
filesystem. Therefore any limitations of the host filesystem
will be inherited by EncFS (or possibly be further
limited).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One such limitation is filename
length. If your underlying filesystem limits you to N
characters in a filename, then EncFS will limit you to
approximately 3*(N-2)/4. For <br>
example if the host filesystem limits to 256 characters,
then EncFS will be limited to 190 character filenames. This
is because encrypted filenames are always longer than <br>
plaintext filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILESYSTEM OPTIONS <br>
When EncFS is given a root directory which does not contain
an existing EncFS filesystem, it will give the option to
create one. Note that options can only be set at filesystem
<br>
creation time. There is no support for modifying a
filesystem&rsquo;s options in-place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to upgrade a
filesystem to use newer features, then you need to create a
new filesystem and mount both the old filesystem and new
filesystem at the same time and copy <br>
the old to the new.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple instances of encfs can
be run at the same time, including different versions of
encfs, as long as they are compatible with the current FUSE
module on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A choice is provided for two
pre-configured settings (&rsquo;standard&rsquo; and
&rsquo;paranoia&rsquo;), along with an expert configuration
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard mode uses the following
settings: <br>
Cipher: AES <br>
Key Size: 192 bits <br>
PBKDF2 with 1/2 second runtime, 160 bit salt <br>
Filesystem Block Size: 1024 bytes <br>
Filename Encoding: Block encoding with IV chaining <br>
Unique initialization vector file headers <br>
File holes passed through</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Paranoia mode uses the following
settings: <br>
Cipher: AES <br>
Key Size: 256 bits <br>
PBKDF2 with 3 second runtime, 160 bit salt <br>
Filesystem Block Size: 1024 bytes <br>
Filename Encoding: Block encoding with IV chaining <br>
Unique initialization vector file headers <br>
Message Authentication Code block headers <br>
External IV Chaining <br>
File holes passed through</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the expert / manual
configuration mode, each of the above options is
configurable. Here is a list of current options with some
notes about what they mean:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key Derivation Function <br>
As of version 1.5, EncFS now uses PBKDF2 as the default key
derivation function. The number of iterations in the keying
function is selected based on wall clock time to generate
<br>
the key. In standard mode, a target time of 0.5 seconds is
used, and in paranoia mode a target of 3.0 seconds is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On a 1.6Ghz AMD 64 system,
roughly 64k iterations of the key derivation function can be
handled in half a second. The exact number of iterations to
use is stored in the <br>
configuration file, as it is needed to remount the
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an EncFS filesystem
configuration from 1.4.x is modified with version 1.5 (such
as when using encfsctl to change the password), then the new
PBKDF2 function will be used and <br>
the filesystem will no longer be readable by older
versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cipher <br>
Which encryption algorithm to use. The list is generated
automatically based on what supported algorithms EncFS found
in the encryption libraries. When using a recent <br>
version of OpenSSL, Blowfish and AES are the typical
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blowfish is an 8 byte cipher -
encoding 8 bytes at a time. AES is a 16 byte cipher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cipher Key Size <br>
Many, if not all, of the supported ciphers support multiple
key lengths. There is not really much need to have enormous
key lengths. Even 160 bits (the default) is probably <br>
overkill.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filesystem Block Size <br>
This is the size (in bytes) that EncFS deals with at one
time. Each block gets its own initialization vector and is
encoded in the cipher&rsquo;s cipher-block-chaining mode. A
<br>
partial block at the end of a file is encoded using a stream
mode to avoid having to store the filesize somewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Having larger block sizes
reduces the overhead of EncFS a little, but it can also add
overhead if your programs read small parts of files. In
order to read a single byte <br>
from a file, the entire block that contains that byte must
be read and decoded, so a large block size adds overhead to
small requests. With write calls it is even worse, as <br>
a block must be read and decoded, the change applied and the
block encoded and written back out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is 512 bytes as of
version 1.0. It was hard coded to 64 bytes in version 0.x,
which was not as efficient as the current setting for
general usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filename Encoding <br>
New in 1.1. A choice is given between stream encoding of
filename and block encoding. The advantage of stream
encoding is that the encoded filenames will be as short as
<br>
possible. If you have a filename with a single letter, it
will be very short in the encoded form, where as block
encoded filenames are always rounded up to the block size of
<br>
the encryption cipher (8 bytes for Blowfish and 16 bytes for
AES).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The advantage of block encoding
mode is that filename lengths all come out as a multiple of
the cipher block size. This means that someone looking at
your encrypted data <br>
can&rsquo;t tell as much about the length of your filenames.
It is on by default, as it takes a similar amount of time to
using the stream cipher. However stream cipher mode may <br>
be useful if you want shorter encrypted filenames for some
reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prior to version 1.1, only
stream encoding was supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filename Initialization Vector
Chaining <br>
New in 1.1. In previous versions of EncFS, each filename
element in a path was encoded separately. So if
&quot;foo&quot; encoded to &quot;XXX&quot;, then it would
always encode that way (given <br>
the same encryption key), no matter if the path was
&quot;a/b/foo&quot;, or &quot;aa/foo/cc&quot;, etc. That
meant it was possible for someone looking at the encrypted
data to see if two files <br>
in different directories had the same name, even though they
wouldn&rsquo;t know what that name decoded to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With initialization vector
chaining, each directory gets its own initialization vector.
So &quot;a/foo&quot; and &quot;b/foo&quot; will have
completely different encoded names for &quot;foo&quot;. This
<br>
features has almost no performance impact (for most
operations), and so is the default in all modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: One significant
performance exception is directory renames. Since the
initialization vector for filename encoding depends on the
directory path, any rename requires <br>
re-encoding every filename in the tree of the directory
being changed. If there are thousands of files, then EncFS
will have to do thousands of renames. It may also be <br>
possible that EncFS will come across a file that it
can&rsquo;t decode or doesn&rsquo;t have permission to move
during the rename operation, in which case it will attempt
to undo any <br>
changes it made up to that point and the rename will
fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Per-File Initialization Vectors
<br>
New in 1.1. In previous versions of EncFS, each file was
encoded in the same way. Each block in a file has always had
its own initialization vector, but in a deterministic <br>
way, so that block N in one file was encoded in the same way
as block N in another file. That made it possible for
someone to tell if two files were identical (or parts of
<br>
the file were identical) by comparing the encoded data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With per-file initialization
vectors, each file gets its own 64-bit random initialization
vector, so that each file is encrypted in a different
way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is enabled by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">External IV Chaining <br>
New in 1.1.3. This option is closely related to Per-File
Initialization Vectors and Filename Initialization Vector
Chaining. Basically it extends the initialization vector
<br>
chaining from filenames to the per-file initialization
vector.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this option is enabled, the
per-file initialization vector is encoded using the
initialization vector derived from the filename
initialization vector chaining code. <br>
This means that the data in a file becomes tied to the
filename. If an encrypted file is renamed outside of encfs,
it will no longer be decodable within encfs. Note that <br>
unless Block MAC headers are enabled, the decoding error
will not be detected and will result in reading random
looking data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a cost associated with
this. When External IV Chaining is enabled, hard links will
not be allowed within the filesystem, as there would be no
way to properly decode <br>
two different filenames pointing to the same data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, renaming a file requires
modifying the file header. So renames will only be allowed
when the user has write access to the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because of these limits, this
option is disabled by default for standard mode (and enabled
by default for paranoia mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Block MAC headers <br>
New to 1.1. If this is enabled, every block in every file is
stored along with a cryptographic checksum (Message
Authentication Code). This makes it virtually impossible to
<br>
modify a file without the change being detected by EncFS.
EncFS will refuse to read data which does not pass the
checksum, and will log the error and return an IO error to
<br>
the application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This adds substantial overhead
(default being 8 bytes per filesystem block), plus
computational overhead, and is not enabled by default except
in paranoia mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this is not enabled and if
EncFS is asked to read modified or corrupted data, it will
have no way to verify that the decoded data is what was
originally encoded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File-hole pass-through <br>
Make encfs leave holes in files. If a block is read as all
zeros, it will be assumed to be a hole and will be left as
0&rsquo;s when read (not deciphered). This is required if
<br>
accessing encfs using the SMB protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled by default. Can be
disabled in expert mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attacks <br>
The primary goal of EncFS is to protect data off-line. That
is, provide a convenient way of storing files in a way that
will frustrate any attempt to read them if the files are
<br>
later intercepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some algorithms in EncFS are
also meant to frustrate on-line attacks where an attacker is
assumed to be able to modify the files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The most intrusive attacks,
where an attacker has complete control of the user&rsquo;s
machine (and can therefore modify EncFS, or FUSE, or the
kernel itself) are not guarded against. <br>
Do not assume that encrypted files will protect your
sensitive data if you enter your password into a compromised
computer. How you determine that the computer is safe to use
is <br>
beyond the scope of this documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That said, here are some example
attacks and data gathering techniques on the filesystem
contents along with the algorithms EncFS supports to thwart
them:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attack: modifying a few bytes of
an encrypted file (without knowing what they will decode
to). <br>
EncFS does not use any form of XOR encryption which would
allow single bytes to be modified without affecting others.
Most modifications would affect dozens or more bytes. <br>
Additionally, MAC Block headers can be used to identify any
changes to files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attack: copying a random block
of one file to a random block of another file. <br>
Each block has its own [deterministic] initialization
vector.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attack: copying block N to block
N of another file. <br>
When the Per-File Initialization Vector support is enabled
(default in 1.1.x filesystems), a copied block will not
decode properly when copied to another file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attack: copying an entire file
to another file. <br>
Can be prevented by enabling External IV Chaining mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attack: determine if two
filenames are the same by looking at encrypted names. <br>
Filename Initialization Vector chaining prevents this by
giving each file a 64-bit initialization vector derived from
its full path name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attack: compare if two files
contain the same data. <br>
Per-File Initialization Vector support prevents this.</p>
