<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>EncFS</b> creates a virtual encrypted filesystem which stores encrypted data
  in the <i>rootdir</i> directory and makes the unencrypted data visible at the
  <i>mountPoint</i> directory. The user must supply a password which is used to
  (indirectly) encrypt both filenames and file contents.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>EncFS</b> is unable to find a supported filesystem at the specified
  <i>rootdir</i>, then the user will be asked if they wish to create a new
  encrypted filesystem at the specified location. Options will be presented to
  the user allowing some control over the algorithms to use. As <b>EncFS</b>
  matures, there may be an increasing number of choices.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-i</b>, <b>--idle=MINUTES</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Enable automatic unmount of the filesystem after a period
      of inactivity. The period is specified in minutes, so the shortest timeout
      period that can be requested is one minute. <b>EncFS</b> will not
      automatically unmount if there are files open within the filesystem, even
      if they are open in read-only mode. However simply having files open does
      not count as activity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-f</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <b>-f</b> (<i>foreground</i>) option causes
      <b>EncFS</b> to run in the foreground. Normally <b>EncFS</b> spawns off as
      a daemon and runs in the background, returning control to the spawning
      shell. With the <b>-f</b> option, it will run in the foreground and any
      warning/debug log messages will be displayed on standard error. In the
      default (background) mode, all log messages are logged via syslog.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Causes <b>EncFS</b> to enable logging of various debug
      channels within <b>EncFS</b>. Normally these logging messages are disabled
      and have no effect. It is recommended that you run in foreground (
      <b>-f</b>) mode when running with verbose enabled.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-s</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <b>-s</b> (<i>single threaded</i>) option causes
      <b>EncFS</b> to run in single threaded mode. By default, <b>EncFS</b> runs
      in multi-threaded mode. This option is used during <b>EncFS</b>
      development in order to simplify debugging and allow it to run under
      memory checking tools.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d</b>, <b>--fuse-debug</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Enables debugging within the <b>FUSE</b> library. This
      should only be used if you suspect a problem within <b>FUSE</b> itself
      (not <b>EncFS</b>), as it generates a lot of low-level data and is not
      likely to be very helpful in general problem tracking. Try <i>verbose</i>
      mode ( <b>-v</b>) first, which gives a higher level view of what is
      happening within <b>EncFS</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--forcedecode</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option only has an effect on filesystems which use MAC
      block headers. By default, if a block is decoded and the stored MAC
      doesn't match what is calculated, then an IO error is returned to the
      application and the block is not returned. However, by specifying
      <b>--forcedecode</b>, only an error will be logged and the data will still
      be returned to the application. This may be useful for attempting to read
      corrupted files.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--public</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Attempt to make encfs behave as a typical multi-user
      filesystem. By default, all FUSE based filesystems are visible only to the
      user who mounted them. No other users (including root) can view the
      filesystem contents. The <b>--public</b> option does two things. It adds
      the FUSE flags &quot;allow_other&quot; and &quot;default_permission&quot;
      when mounting the filesystem, which tells FUSE to allow other users to
      access the filesystem, and to use the ownership permissions provided by
      the filesystem. Secondly, the <b>--public</b> flag changes how encfs's
      node creation functions work - as they will try and set ownership of new
      nodes based on the caller identification.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>Warning</b>: In order for this to work, encfs must be run as root --
      otherwise it will not have the ability to change ownership of files. I
      recommend that you instead investigate if the fuse allow_other option can
      be used to do what you want before considering the use of
    <b>--public</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--ondemand</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Mount the filesystem on-demand. This currently only makes
      sense in combination with <b>--idle</b> and <b>--extpass</b> options. When
      the filesystem becomes idle, instead of exiting, <b>EncFS</b> stops
      allowing access to the filesystem by internally dropping its reference to
      it. If someone attempts to access the filesystem again, the extpass
      program is used to prompt the user for the password. If this succeeds,
      then the filesystem becomes available again.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--delaymount</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Do not mount the filesystem when encfs starts; instead,

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--require-macs</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If creating a new filesystem, this forces block
      authentication code headers to be enabled. When mounting an existing

      are not enabled.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This can be used to improve security in case the ciphertext is vulnerable to

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--reverse</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Normally <b>EncFS</b> provides a plaintext view of data on
      demand: it stores enciphered data and displays plaintext data. With
      <b>--reverse</b> it takes as source plaintext data and produces enciphered
      data on-demand. This can be useful for creating remote encrypted backups,
      where you do not wish to keep the local files unencrypted.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example, the following would create an encrypted view in
      /tmp/crypt-view.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    encfs --reverse /home/me /tmp/crypt-view
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You could then copy the /tmp/crypt-view directory in order to have a copy of
      the encrypted data. You must also keep a copy of the file
      /home/me/.encfs6.xml which contains the filesystem information. Together,
      the two can be used to reproduce the unencrypted data:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    ENCFS6_CONFIG=/home/me/.encfs6.xml encfs /tmp/crypt-view /tmp/plain-view
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Now /tmp/plain-view contains the same data as /home/me
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that <b>--reverse</b> mode only works with limited configuration
      options, so many settings may be disabled when used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--nocache</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Disable the kernel's cache of file attributes. Setting this
      option makes EncFS pass &quot;attr_timeout=0&quot; and
      &quot;entry_timeout=0&quot; to FUSE. This makes sure that modifications to
      the backing files that occour outside EncFS show up immediately in the
      EncFS mount. The main use case for &quot;--nocache&quot; is reverse
    mode.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">If creating a new filesystem, this automatically selects

Create a new encrypted filesystem. Store the raw (encrypted) data in
  &quot;~/.crypt&quot; , and make the unencrypted data visible in
  &quot;~/crypt&quot;. Both directories are in the home directory in this
  example. This example shows the full output of encfs as it asks the user if
  they wish to create the filesystem:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    % encfs ~/.crypt ~/crypt
    Directory &quot;/home/me/.crypt&quot; does not exist, create (y,n)?y
    Directory &quot;/home/me/crypt&quot; does not exist, create (y,n)?y
    Creating new encrypted volume.
    Please choose from one of the following options:
     enter &quot;x&quot; for expert configuration mode,
     enter &quot;p&quot; for pre-configured paranoia mode,
     anything else, or an empty line will select standard mode.
    ?&gt; 
    Standard configuration selected.
    Using cipher Blowfish, key size 160, block size 512
    New Password: &lt;password entered here&gt;
    Verify: &lt;password entered here&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The filesystem is now mounted and visible in <i>~/crypt</i>. If files are
  created there, they can be seen in encrypted form in <i>~/.crypt</i>. To
  unmount the filesystem, use <i>fusermount</i> with the <b>-u</b> (unmount)
  option:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    % fusermount -u ~/crypt
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another example. To mount the same filesystem, but have fusermount name the
  mount point '/dev/foo' (as shown in <i>df</i> and other tools which read
  /etc/mtab), and also request kernel-level caching of file data (which are both
  special arguments to fusermount):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    % encfs ~/.crypt ~/crypt -- -n /dev/foo -c
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Or, if you find strange behavior under some particular program when working in
  an encrypted filesystem, it may be helpful to run in verbose mode while
  reproducing the problem and send along the output with the problem report:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    % encfs -v -f ~/.crypt ~/crypt 2&gt; encfs-report.txt
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to avoid leaking sensitive information through the debugging channels,
  all warnings and debug messages (as output in verbose mode) contain only
  encrypted filenames. You can use the <i>encfsctl</i> program's <i>decode</i>
  function to decode filenames if desired.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CAVEATS"><a class="selflink" href="#CAVEATS">CAVEATS</a></h1>
<b>EncFS</b> is not a true filesystem. It does not deal with any of the actual
  storage or maintenance of files. It simply translates requests (encrypting or
  decrypting as necessary) and passes the requests through to the underlying
  host filesystem. Therefore any limitations of the host filesystem will be
  inherited by <b>EncFS</b> (or possibly be further limited).
<div class="Pp"></div>
One such limitation is filename length. If your underlying filesystem limits you
  to N characters in a filename, then <b>EncFS</b> will limit you to
  approximately 3*(N-2)/4. For example if the host filesystem limits to 256
  characters, then <b>EncFS</b> will be limited to 190 character filenames. This
  is because encrypted filenames are always longer than plaintext filenames.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILESYSTEM_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#FILESYSTEM_OPTIONS">FILESYSTEM
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
When <b>EncFS</b> is given a root directory which does not contain an existing
  <b>EncFS</b> filesystem, it will give the option to create one. Note that
  options can only be set at filesystem creation time. There is no support for
  modifying a filesystem's options in-place.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to upgrade a filesystem to use newer features, then you need to
  create a new filesystem and mount both the old filesystem and new filesystem
  at the same time and copy the old to the new.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Multiple instances of encfs can be run at the same time, including different
  versions of encfs, as long as they are compatible with the current FUSE module
  on your system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A choice is provided for two pre-configured settings ('standard' and
  'paranoia'), along with an expert configuration mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Standard</i> mode uses the following settings:
<br/>
 Cipher: AES
<br/>
 Key Size: 192 bits
<br/>
 PBKDF2 with 1/2 second runtime, 160 bit salt
<br/>
 Filesystem Block Size: 1024 bytes
<br/>
 Filename Encoding: Block encoding with IV chaining
<br/>
 Unique initialization vector file headers
<br/>
 File holes passed through
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Paranoia</i> mode uses the following settings:
<br/>
 Cipher: AES
<br/>
 Key Size: 256 bits
<br/>
 PBKDF2 with 3 second runtime, 160 bit salt
<br/>
 Filesystem Block Size: 1024 bytes
<br/>
 Filename Encoding: Block encoding with IV chaining
<br/>
 Unique initialization vector file headers
<br/>
 Message Authentication Code block headers
<br/>
 External IV Chaining
<br/>
 File holes passed through
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the expert / manual configuration mode, each of the above options is
  configurable. Here is a list of current options with some notes about what
  they mean:
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Key_Derivation_Function"><a class="selflink" href="#Key_Derivation_Function">Key
  Derivation Function</a></h1>
As of version 1.5, <b>EncFS</b> now uses PBKDF2 as the default key derivation
  function. The number of iterations in the keying function is selected based on
  wall clock time to generate the key. In standard mode, a target time of 0.5
  seconds is used, and in paranoia mode a target of 3.0 seconds is used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On a 1.6Ghz AMD 64 system, roughly 64k iterations of the key derivation function
  can be handled in half a second. The exact number of iterations to use is
  stored in the configuration file, as it is needed to remount the filesystem.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If an <b>EncFS</b> filesystem configuration from 1.4.x is modified with version
  1.5 (such as when using encfsctl to change the password), then the new PBKDF2
  function will be used and the filesystem will no longer be readable by older
  versions.

  <dt class="It-tag"><i>Filesystem Block Size</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is the size (in bytes) that <b>EncFS</b> deals with at

      file is encoded using a stream mode to avoid having to store the filesize
      somewhere.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Having larger block sizes reduces the overhead of <b>EncFS</b> a little, but
      it can also add overhead if your programs read small parts of files. In
      order to read a single byte from a file, the entire block that contains
      that byte must be read and decoded, so a large block size adds overhead to
      small requests. With write calls it is even worse, as a block must be read
      and decoded, the change applied and the block encoded and written back
      out.

  <dt class="It-tag"><i>Filename Encoding</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>New in 1.1</b>. A choice is given between stream

      is that the encoded filenames will be as short as possible. If you have a
      filename with a single letter, it will be very short in the encoded form,
      where as block encoded filenames are always rounded up to the block size
      of the encryption cipher (8 bytes for Blowfish and 16 bytes for AES).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The advantage of block encoding mode is that filename lengths all come out
      as a multiple of the cipher block size. This means that someone looking at
      your encrypted data can't tell as much about the length of your filenames.
      It is on by default, as it takes a similar amount of time to using the
      stream cipher. However stream cipher mode may be useful if you want
      shorter encrypted filenames for some reason.

    Prior to version 1.1, only stream encoding was supported.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>Filename Initialization Vector Chaining</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>New in 1.1</b>. In previous versions of <b>EncFS</b>,
      each filename element in a path was encoded separately. So if
      &quot;foo&quot; encoded to &quot;XXX&quot;, then it would always encode
      that way (given the same encryption key), no matter if the path was
      &quot;a/b/foo&quot;, or &quot;aa/foo/cc&quot;, etc. That meant it was
      possible for someone looking at the encrypted data to see if two files in
      different directories had the same name, even though they wouldn't know
      what that name decoded to.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    With initialization vector chaining, each directory gets its own
      initialization vector. So &quot;a/foo&quot; and &quot;b/foo&quot; will
      have completely different encoded names for &quot;foo&quot;. This features
      has almost no performance impact (for most operations), and so is the
      default in all modes.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>Note:</b> One significant performance exception is directory renames.
      Since the initialization vector for filename encoding depends on the
      directory path, any rename requires re-encoding every filename in the tree
      of the directory being changed. If there are thousands of files, then
      EncFS will have to do thousands of renames. It may also be possible that
      EncFS will come across a file that it can't decode or doesn't have
      permission to move during the rename operation, in which case it will
      attempt to undo any changes it made up to that point and the rename will
      fail.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>Per-File Initialization Vectors</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>New in 1.1</b>. In previous versions of <b>EncFS</b>,
      each file was encoded in the same way. Each block in a file has always had
      its own initialization vector, but in a deterministic way, so that block N
      in one file was encoded in the same way as block N in another file. That
      made it possible for someone to tell if two files were identical (or parts
      of the file were identical) by comparing the encoded data.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    With per-file initialization vectors, each file gets its own 64-bit random
      initialization vector, so that each file is encrypted in a different way.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This option is enabled by default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>External IV Chaining</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>New in 1.1.3</b>. This option is closely related to
      Per-File Initialization Vectors and Filename Initialization Vector
      Chaining. Basically it extends the initialization vector chaining from
      filenames to the per-file initialization vector.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When this option is enabled, the per-file initialization vector is encoded
      using the initialization vector derived from the filename initialization
      vector chaining code. This means that the data in a file becomes tied to
      the filename. If an encrypted file is renamed outside of encfs, it will no
      longer be decodable within encfs. Note that unless Block MAC headers are
      enabled, the decoding error will not be detected and will result in
      reading random looking data.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    There is a cost associated with this. When External IV Chaining is enabled,
      hard links will not be allowed within the filesystem, as there would be no
      way to properly decode two different filenames pointing to the same data.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Also, renaming a file requires modifying the file header. So renames will
      only be allowed when the user has write access to the file.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Because of these limits, this option is disabled by default for standard
      mode (and enabled by default for paranoia mode).</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>Block MAC headers</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>New to 1.1</b>. If this is enabled, every block in every
      file is stored along with a cryptographic checksum (Message Authentication
      Code). This makes it virtually impossible to modify a file without the
      change being detected by <b>EncFS</b>. <b>EncFS</b> will refuse to read
      data which does not pass the checksum, and will log the error and return
      an IO error to the application.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This adds substantial overhead (default being 8 bytes per filesystem block),
      plus computational overhead, and is not enabled by default except in
      paranoia mode.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Attacks"><a class="selflink" href="#Attacks">Attacks</a></h1>
The primary goal of <b>EncFS</b> is to protect data off-line. That is, provide a
  convenient way of storing files in a way that will frustrate any attempt to
  read them if the files are later intercepted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some algorithms in <b>EncFS</b> are also meant to frustrate on-line attacks
  where an attacker is assumed to be able to modify the files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The most intrusive attacks, where an attacker has complete control of the user's
  machine (and can therefore modify <b>EncFS</b>, or <b>FUSE</b>, or the kernel
  itself) are not guarded against. Do not assume that encrypted files will
  protect your sensitive data if you enter your password into a compromised
  computer. How you determine that the computer is safe to use is beyond the
  scope of this documentation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
That said, here are some example attacks and data gathering techniques on the
  filesystem contents along with the algorithms <b>EncFS</b> supports to thwart
  them:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Attack</b>: modifying a few bytes of an encrypted file
    (without knowing what they will decode to).</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>EncFS</b> does not use any form of XOR encryption which
      would allow single bytes to be modified without affecting others. Most
      modifications would affect dozens or more bytes. Additionally, MAC Block
      headers can be used to identify any changes to files.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Attack</b>: copying a random block of one file to a
    random block of another file.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Each block has its own [deterministic] initialization
      vector.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Attack</b>: copying block N to block N of another
    file.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When the Per-File Initialization Vector support is enabled
      (default in 1.1.x filesystems), a copied block will not decode properly
      when copied to another file.</dd>
