<p>S_TIME(1) OpenSSL S_TIME(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
s_time - SSL/TLS performance timing program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
openssl s_time [-connect host:port] [-www page] [-cert
filename] [-key filename] [-CApath directory] [-CAfile
filename] [-trusted_first] [-reuse] [-new] [-verify depth]
[-nbio] <br>
[-time seconds] [-ssl2] [-ssl3] [-bugs] [-cipher
cipherlist]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The s_client command implements a generic SSL/TLS client
which connects to a remote host using SSL/TLS. It can
request a page from the server and includes the time to
transfer <br>
the payload data in its timing measurements. It measures the
number of connections within a given timeframe, the amount
of data transferred (if any), and calculates the average
<br>
time spent for one connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-connect host:port <br>
This specifies the host and optional port to connect to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-www page <br>
This specifies the page to GET from the server. A value of
&rsquo;/&rsquo; gets the index.htm[l] page. If this
parameter is not specified, then s_time will only perform
the handshake to <br>
establish SSL connections but not transfer any payload
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cert certname <br>
The certificate to use, if one is requested by the server.
The default is not to use a certificate. The file is in PEM
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-key keyfile <br>
The private key to use. If not specified then the
certificate file will be used. The file is in PEM
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verify depth <br>
The verify depth to use. This specifies the maximum length
of the server certificate chain and turns on server
certificate verification. Currently the verify operation
<br>
continues after errors so all the problems with a
certificate chain can be seen. As a side effect the
connection will never fail due to a server certificate
verify failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-CApath directory <br>
The directory to use for server certificate verification.
This directory must be in &quot;hash format&quot;, see
verify for more information. These are also used when
building the <br>
client certificate chain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-CAfile file <br>
A file containing trusted certificates to use during server
authentication and to use when attempting to build the
client certificate chain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-trusted_first <br>
Use certificates in CA file or CA directory over the
certificates provided by the server when building the trust
chain to verify server certificate. This is mainly useful in
<br>
environments with Bridge CA or Cross-Certified CAs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-new <br>
performs the timing test using a new session ID for each
connection. If neither -new nor -reuse are specified, they
are both on by default and executed in sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-reuse <br>
performs the timing test using the same session ID; this can
be used as a test that session caching is working. If
neither -new nor -reuse are specified, they are both on by
<br>
default and executed in sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nbio <br>
turns on non-blocking I/O.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ssl2, -ssl3 <br>
these options disable the use of certain SSL or TLS
protocols. By default the initial handshake uses a method
which should be compatible with all servers and permit them
to <br>
use SSL v3, SSL v2 or TLS as appropriate. The timing program
is not as rich in options to turn protocols on and off as
the s_client(1) program and may not connect to all <br>
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately there are a lot of
ancient and broken servers in use which cannot handle this
technique and will fail to connect. Some servers only work
if TLS is turned off <br>
with the -ssl3 option; others will only support SSL v2 and
may need the -ssl2 option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bugs <br>
there are several known bug in SSL and TLS implementations.
Adding this option enables various workarounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cipher cipherlist <br>
this allows the cipher list sent by the client to be
modified. Although the server determines which cipher suite
is used it should take the first supported cipher in the
list <br>
sent by the client. See the ciphers(1) command for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-time length <br>
specifies how long (in seconds) s_time should establish
connections and optionally transfer payload data from a
server. Server and client performance and the link speed
<br>
determine how many connections s_time can establish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
s_client can be used to measure the performance of an SSL
connection. To connect to an SSL HTTP server and get the
default page the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">openssl s_time -connect
servername:443 -www / -CApath yourdir -CAfile yourfile.pem
-cipher commoncipher [-ssl3]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would typically be used (https
uses port 443). &rsquo;commoncipher&rsquo; is a cipher to
which both client and server can agree, see the ciphers(1)
command for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the handshake fails then
there are several possible causes, if it is nothing obvious
like no client certificate then the -bugs, -ssl2, -ssl3
options can be tried in case it is <br>
a buggy server. In particular you should play with these
options before submitting a bug report to an OpenSSL mailing
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A frequent problem when
attempting to get client certificates working is that a web
client complains it has no certificates or gives an empty
list to choose from. This is <br>
normally because the server is not sending the clients
certificate authority in its &quot;acceptable CA list&quot;
when it requests a certificate. By using s_client(1) the CA
list can be <br>
viewed and checked. However some servers only request client
authentication after a specific URL is requested. To obtain
the list in this case it is necessary to use the -prexit
<br>
option of s_client(1) and send an HTTP request for an
appropriate page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a certificate is specified on
the command line using the -cert option it will not be used
unless the server specifically requests a client
certificate. Therefor merely <br>
including a client certificate on the command line is no
guarantee that the certificate works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Because this program does not have all the options of the
s_client(1) program to turn protocols on and off, you may
not be able to measure the performance of all protocols with
<br>
all servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -verify option should really
exit if the server verification fails.</p>
