The <b>s_client</b> command implements a generic SSL/TLS client which connects
  to a remote host using SSL/TLS. It can request a page from the server and
  includes the time to transfer the payload data in its timing measurements. It
  measures the number of connections within a given timeframe, the amount of
  data transferred (if any), and calculates the average time spent for one
  connection.

    failure.</dd>

      protocols on and off as the <i>s_client</i>(1) program and may not connect
      to all servers.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Unfortunately there are a lot of ancient and broken servers in use which
      cannot handle this technique and will fail to connect. Some servers only
      work if TLS is turned off with the <b>-ssl3</b> option; others will only
      support SSL v2 and may need the <b>-ssl2</b> option.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">this allows the cipher list sent by the client to be
      modified. Although the server determines which cipher suite is used it
      should take the first supported cipher in the list sent by the client. See
      the <i>ciphers</i>(1) command for more information.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-time length</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">specifies how long (in seconds) <b>s_time</b> should

      Server and client performance and the link speed determine how many
      connections <b>s_time</b> can establish.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<b>s_client</b> can be used to measure the performance of an SSL connection. To
  connect to an SSL HTTP server and get the default page the command
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 openssl s_time -connect servername:443 -www / -CApath yourdir -CAfile yourfile.pem -cipher commoncipher [-ssl3]
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
would typically be used (https uses port 443). 'commoncipher' is a cipher to
  which both client and server can agree, see the <i>ciphers</i>(1) command for
  details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the handshake fails then there are several possible causes, if it is nothing
  obvious like no client certificate then the <b>-bugs</b>, <b>-ssl2</b>,
  <b>-ssl3</b> options can be tried in case it is a buggy server. In particular
  you should play with these options <b>before</b> submitting a bug report to an
  OpenSSL mailing list.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A frequent problem when attempting to get client certificates working is that a
  web client complains it has no certificates or gives an empty list to choose
  from. This is normally because the server is not sending the clients
  certificate authority in its &quot;acceptable CA list&quot; when it requests a
  certificate. By using <i>s_client</i>(1) the CA list can be viewed and
  checked. However some servers only request client authentication after a
  specific URL is requested. To obtain the list in this case it is necessary to
  use the <b>-prexit</b> option of <i>s_client</i>(1) and send an HTTP request
  for an appropriate page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a certificate is specified on the command line using the <b>-cert</b> option
  it will not be used unless the server specifically requests a client
  certificate. Therefor merely including a client certificate on the command
  line is no guarantee that the certificate works.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Because this program does not have all the options of the <i>s_client</i>(1)
  program to turn protocols on and off, you may not be able to measure the
  performance of all protocols with all servers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-verify</b> option should really exit if the server verification fails.
