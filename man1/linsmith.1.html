<p>LINSMITH(1) General Commands Manual LINSMITH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
linsmith - Smith charting program, designed for educational
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
linsmith [-d opts]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page briefly documents linsmith. It was written
for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original
program does not have a manual page. A more complete
man&acirc; <br>
ual is included (in PDF form) with the installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">linSmith is a Smith Charting
program, mainly designed for educational use. As such, there
is an emphasis on capabilities that improve the
&rsquo;showing the effect of&rsquo;-style of opera&acirc;
<br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s main features are:
<br>
* Definition of multiple load impedances (at different
frequencies) <br>
* Addition of discrete (L, C, parallel and series LC, and
transformer) and line components (open and closed stubs,
line segments) <br>
* Connection in series and parallel <br>
* Easy experimentation with values using scrollbars <br>
* A &rsquo;virtual&rsquo; component switches from impedance
to admittance to help explaining (or understanding) parallel
components <br>
* The chart works in real impedances (not normalized ones)
<br>
* Direct view of the result on the screen <br>
* Ability to generate publication quality Postscript output
<br>
* A &rsquo;log&rsquo; file with textual results at each
intermediate step <br>
* Load and circuit configuration is stored separately,
permitting several solutions without re-defining the
other</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
This program is mainly designed for graphical use, and
therefore does not have many options. A summary of options
is included below.</p>
