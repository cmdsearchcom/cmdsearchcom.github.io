<p style="margin-top: 1em">cxref filename [ ... filename]
-delete [-Odirname] [-Nbasename] [-Rbasename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
A program that can automatically generate documentation and
cross references for a C program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The input is any C program with
appropriate comments and the output is LaTeX, HTML, RTF or
SGML files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
filename <br>
The name of the file to document, any number of files may be
documented at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-delete <br>
The files named are to be deleted from the output directory
and their entries in the cross reference database and main
output files are to be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Odirname <br>
The name of a directory to use for the output latex files
and the location of the cross reference files that are
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Nbasename <br>
The name to use for the first part of the output and cross
reference files instead of cxref, the file extensions remain
the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Rdirname <br>
When the source files are in more than one directory, set
dirname to the name of the root directory of the source tree
(use relative path if easier e.g. &lsquo;-R../..&rsquo;).
This <br>
will then run cxref from that root directory and the
&lsquo;-Odirname&rsquo; must be relative to that
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-all-comments <br>
In case you think that the existing comments might work,
(see above for description of special comments). [Danger!
This option can produce weird results.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-comments <br>
Ignores all comments, useful if you just want the cross
references and not the documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbatim-comments <br>
When the comments that you have in the code are formatted in
a predetermined style that you want to preserve on the
output, this option will force them not to be
reformat&acirc; <br>
ted. [Note, this is for file and function comments
only.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-block-comments <br>
When the comments in the program are formatted in the
&lsquo;block&rsquo; style (with a leading &rsquo;*&rsquo;
character on every line), this option will remove that
character from the output. <br>
[Works for a single &lsquo;*&rsquo;, &lsquo;+&rsquo;,
&lsquo;|&rsquo; or &lsquo;:&rsquo; on each line.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xref Produce cross referencing
information (see below). <br>
-all All cross references. <br>
-file Cross references for files. <br>
-func Cross references for functions. <br>
-var Cross references for variables. <br>
-type Cross references for types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-warn Produce warnings, the
options must be concatenated together: <br>
-all All warnings. <br>
-comment Warn of missing comments. <br>
-xref Warn of missing cross references.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-index Produce a cross reference
index, the options must be concatenated together: <br>
-all All indexes. <br>
-file Index of files. <br>
-func Index of functions. <br>
-var Index of variables. <br>
-type Index of types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-raw Produce a raw form of
output, not really of much use except with -warn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-latex Produce a LaTeX file to
document each of the source files and also an extra file
that includes each of these files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-html Produce an HTML 4.01 file
to document each of the source files and a main file to
reference each of these files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-html-src <br>
Produce the HTML output and an HTML version of the source
file with links into it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rtf Produce a Rich Text Format
(RTF) file to document the source file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sgml Produce an SGML file to
document the source file. (Using the LinuxDoc DTD).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Idirname <br>
GCC option to specify the path for include files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ddefine <br>
GCC option to define a pre-processor symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Udefine <br>
GCC option to undefine a pre-processor symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-CPP program <br>
The name of the program to use instead of the compile time
default. The program must be able to perform all of the
actions that &lsquo;gcc -E -C -dD&rsquo; does to work. If
the pro&acirc; <br>
gram takes arguments then the whole thing needs to be in
quotes so that it is interpreted as a single argument to
cxref.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--arg ... arg <br>
Extra arguments to be passed to the pre-processor can be
placed after the &lsquo;--&rsquo; separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C Compiler Replacement cxref-cc
<br>
To simplify using cxref on existing source code, there is
now a shell script that will call the C compiler and then
call cxref to process the source file. This means that it
can <br>
be used as a drop in replacement for CC in Makefiles and the
like.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usage: cxref-cc [usual cc
options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the source file is
extracted from the list of options as well as the
&lsquo;-D*&rsquo;, &lsquo;-I*&rsquo;, &lsquo;-U*&rsquo;
flags and when the C compiler exits succesfully cxref will
be called. The <br>
name of the C compiler to use is controlled by the CXREFCC
environment variable, or if this is not set then the CC
environment variable, or failing this just gcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using this script requires the
use of a &lsquo;.cxref&rsquo; configuration file to contain
the options since there is nowhere to put the options on the
command line for the C compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will only cross-reference
and document the C source files since they are the only ones
that are compiled, but it will make sure that they are
cross-referenced with the cor&acirc; <br>
rect options etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cxref Configuration File <br>
These command line arguments can also be put into a file
named &lsquo;.cxref&rsquo; instead of on the command line.
When cxref is run the arguments to the program are
interpreted in the <br>
following order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(1) Those on the command line.
(2) Those in the &lsquo;.cxref&rsquo; file in the current
directory. (3) Those in the &lsquo;.cxref&rsquo; file in the
source tree root specified by &lsquo;-R&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that in a
multi-directory source tree, each sub-directory can have a
&lsquo;.cxref&rsquo; file containing just the line
&lsquo;-R..&rsquo; or appropriate. The main directory can
have a <br>
&lsquo;.cxref&rsquo; file containing the remainder of the
options. This removes completely the need to have any
options on the command line apart from the source file
names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the
&lsquo;.cxref&rsquo; file is any number of lines, each one
containing a single command line argument (equivalent to one
of the argv). The only options that cannot be used <br>
are the names of source files themselves and the
&lsquo;-delete&rsquo; option. Blank lines are ignored and
lines starting with a &rsquo;#&rsquo; are comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Program Documentation Comments
<br>
The documentation for the program is produced from comments
in the code that are appropriately formatted. The cross
referencing comes from the code itself and requires no extra
<br>
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special comments are
&lsquo;/**** ****/&rsquo; (for a file) and &lsquo;/*++++
++++*/&rsquo; (for a data object) any number of
&lsquo;*&rsquo; or &lsquo;+&rsquo; can be used inside of the
standard &lsquo;/*&rsquo; and &lsquo;*/&rsquo; comment <br>
delimiters in the comments, they are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a comment line starts with
whitespace and is followed by &lsquo;+html+&rsquo; then the
rest of the line is included only in the HTML output, and is
not processed so it can include HTML <br>
markup, &lsquo;-html-&rsquo; means that the rest of the line
is included in all except the HTML output. The same also
applies to the other output formats, &lsquo;+none+&rsquo;
can be used for lines not <br>
to appear in any output. The exception to this is that the
raw output does not do any checking and will output all
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In any situation where a comment
follows a &lsquo;,&rsquo;, &lsquo;;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;)&rsquo; separated only by spaces and tabs, the
comment is pushed to before the punctuation to apply to
object there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program is implemented using
a full ANSI C grammar parser with some GCC extensions, this
means that the style of the code is unimportant, only the
content and comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cross Referencing <br>
The cross referencing is performed for the following
items</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files <br>
The files that the current file is included in <br>
(even when included via other files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#includes <br>
Files included in the current file. <br>
Files included by these files etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variables <br>
The location of the definition of external variables. <br>
The files that have visibility of global variables. <br>
The files / functions that use the variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Functions <br>
The file that the function is prototyped in. <br>
The functions that the function calls. <br>
The functions that call the function. <br>
The files and functions that reference the function. <br>
The variables that are used in the function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each of these items is cross
referenced in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The cross referencing uses files
&lsquo;cxref.variable&rsquo;, &lsquo;cxref.function&rsquo;,
&lsquo;cxref.include&rsquo; and &lsquo;cxref.typedef&rsquo;
in the output directory. These are a complete list of the
function and <br>
variable usage in the program and could be used to generate
a function call hierarchy or variable usage diagram for
example. Two cxref passes of each file is needed, the first
<br>
to build up the cross referencing files and the second to
use them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(The file names are different if
the &lsquo;-N&rsquo; option is used.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LaTeX Output <br>
The default LaTeX output is a file for each of the source
files with one extra file &lsquo;cxref.tex&rsquo; that
includes each of the other files. This is to allow a
makefile to only update <br>
the changed files (although the references may require all
of the files to be checked again). When the cxref.tex file
has been written it can be modified by the user, any new
<br>
files that are added are added at the end of the source code
section, the rest of the file being unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The index is written to a file
called &lsquo;cxref.apdx.tex&rsquo; and cxref.tex is updated
to refer to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also written out are three LaTeX
style files &lsquo;page.sty&rsquo;, &lsquo;fonts.sty&rsquo;
and &lsquo;cxref.sty&rsquo;. These set up the page to use a
smaller margin and smaller fonts to allow more to appear on
<br>
a page and also define the new commands for typesetting the
cxref output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(The file names
&lsquo;cxref.tex&rsquo; and &lsquo;cxref.apdx.tex&rsquo; are
different if the &lsquo;-N&rsquo; option is used.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTML Output <br>
The default HTML output is a file for each of the source
files with one extra file &lsquo;cxref.html&rsquo; that
includes each of the other files. This is to allow a
makefile to only update <br>
the changed files (although the references may require all
of the files to be checked again). When the cxref.html file
has been written it can be modified by the user, any new
<br>
files that are added are added at the end before the table
of contents, the rest of the file being unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The index is written to a file
called &lsquo;cxref.apdx.html&rsquo; and cxref.html is
updated to refer to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(The file names
&lsquo;cxref.html&rsquo; and &lsquo;cxref.apdx.html&rsquo;
are different if the &lsquo;-N&rsquo; option is used.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The HTML output uses the HTML
4.01 standard and all pages validate correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RTF Output <br>
Rich Text Format is a fairly low level page description
format devised by Microsoft. It is not a well defined and
easy to understand standard as are the other formats, but it
is <br>
popular for document exchange.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a single output file
for each of the source files and an index file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SGML Output <br>
Since SGML is a meta-language it is necessary to define the
layout elements as well as provide the information. The
cxref output uses the LinuxDoc document format and is <br>
designed for use with the SGMLtools programs
(http://www.sgmltools.org/).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a single output file
for each of the source files and an index file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
The files that come with the cxref source code distribution
give more information. The README file gives examples of how
to use the comments in source code. There is a list of <br>
frequently asked questions and their answers for the cxref
program in the FAQ file. A list of improvements planned for
future versions of the program are listed in the file <br>
TODO.</p>
