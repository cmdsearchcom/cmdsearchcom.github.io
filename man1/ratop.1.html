<p>RATOP(1) General Commands Manual RATOP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ratop - display and update sorted network flow data</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ratop [raoptions] [-- filter-expression]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ratop reads argus(8) data from an argus-file, or from a
remote data source, and periodically displays a sorted list
of network flow records. When read from a file, ratop
dis&acirc; <br>
plays the resulting flow caches when the file is completed,
updating its status display line with each input. When
reading from a live argus data stream, ratop will display
<br>
data, asynchronously in realtime, as it is received from the
source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flow data is aggregated as its
read, (see racluster.1), resulting in a single line for each
network transaction encountered in the data stream. The
default sorting key is total <br>
packets per flow, but other keys can be used instead. Flow
records that have been idle for more than the default 60s
are removed. Various output options, such as the specific
<br>
columns of data to display, the entry idle timeout value,
the screen refresh rate, etc ... are all configurable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ratop uses ncurses and
readline.3, when available, to provide a vi.1 look and feel
for displaying, navigating and modifying network flow
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While running ratop a lot of
help can be obtained from the on-line help system, using the
&quot;:h&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Command line option specifications are processed from left
to right. Options can be specified more than once. If
conflicting options are specified, later specifications
over&acirc; <br>
ride earlier ones. This makes it viable to create a shell
alias for ratop with preferred defaults specified, then
override those preferred defaults as desired on the command
<br>
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ratop, like all ra based
clients, supports a number of ra options including filtering
of input argus records through a terminating filter
expression, and the ability to specify <br>
the output style, format and contents for printing data. See
ra(1) for a complete description of ra options. ratop(1)
specific options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m aggregation object <br>
Supported aggregation objects are: <br>
none use a null flow key. <br>
srcid argus source identifier. <br>
smac source mac(ether) addr. <br>
dmac destination mac(ether) addr. <br>
soui oui portion of the source mac(ether) addr. <br>
doui oui portion of the destination mac(ether) addr. <br>
smpls source mpls label. <br>
dmpls destination label addr. <br>
svlan source vlan label. <br>
dvlan destination vlan addr. <br>
saddr/[l|m] source IP addr/[cidr len | m.a.s.k]. <br>
daddr/[l|m] destination IP addr/[cidr len | m.a.s.k]. <br>
matrix/l sorted src and dst IP addr/cidr len. <br>
proto transaction protocol. <br>
sport source port number. Implies use of
&rsquo;proto&rsquo;. <br>
dport destination port number. Implies use of
&rsquo;proto&rsquo;. <br>
stos source TOS byte value. <br>
dtos destination TOS byte value. <br>
sttl src -&gt; dst TTL value. <br>
dttl dst -&gt; src TTL value. <br>
stcpb src -&gt; dst TCP base sequence number. <br>
dtcpb dst -&gt; src TCP base sequence number. <br>
inode[/l|m]] intermediate node IP addr/[cidr len | m.a.s.k],
source of ICMP mapped events. <br>
sco source ARIN country code, if present. <br>
dco destination ARIN country code, if present. <br>
sas source node origin AS number, if available. <br>
das destination node origin AS number, if available. <br>
ias intermediate node origin AS number, if available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M modes <br>
Supported modes are: <br>
correct Attempt to correct the direction of flows by also
searching the reverse flow key, if a match isn&rsquo;t found
in the cache. This mode is on by default when <br>
using the default full 5-tuple flow key definitions. <br>
nocorrect Turn off flow correction for direction. This mode
is used by default if the flow key has been changed. <br>
preserve Preserve fields when aggregating matching flow
data. <br>
nopreserve Do not preserve fields when aggregating matching
flow data. <br>
norep Do not generate an aggregate statistic for each flow.
This is used primarily when the output represents a single
object. Primarily used when merging sta&acirc; <br>
tus records to generate single flows that represent single
transactions. <br>
rmon Generate data suitable for producing RMON types of
metrics. <br>
nocurses Do not use the curses interface to present data.
This option is primarily used when debugging ratop, to get
around the issues of screen maniuplation within <br>
a debugger like gdb or lldb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAY <br>
The first several lines of the ratop display show global
state. The top line shows how ratop is running, with the
list of command line options that are in effect. In the
upper <br>
most right corner is the current time. The next line is the
column title line, that labels each column. The bottom line
is the command line, where you will see and prepare
&rsquo;:&rsquo; <br>
commands. The line above the bottom line is the status line,
showing the number of flows that are in the ratop process
queue, display queue, the total number of flows read, the
<br>
rate of flow records read, and the current status, whether
it is Active, reading records, or Idle, when all input is
complete. This line can be toggled on or off using ^G.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flows caches are displayed one
per row and are sorted by total pkts, by default. ratop
sorting can be configured using the rarc variable
RA_SORT_ALGORITHMS, or by using the &quot;:P&quot; <br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ratop supports 3 basic filters.
Like all other ra* programs, ratop will send its command
line filter to its remote argus data sources, to limit the
load on the wire. This is <br>
the &quot;remote&quot; filter. Also, ratop supports a
&quot;local&quot; filter, that is applied to flow record
input. Normally this is used when the remote argus data
source doesn&rsquo;t support the <br>
syntax of the specific filter. ratop also support a
&quot;display&quot; filter, that is used to select which
flow records are to be displayed. This filter does not have
any impact on the <br>
internal flow caches that ratop is tracking, so you can
change the &quot;display&quot; filter at any time and see
the current state of other flows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLOR <br>
ratop supports color which is configured using the rarc
file. The RA_COLOR_CONFIG file is a fall through
specification of flow filters and field color definitions.
For flows <br>
that match a filter, specific fields in the row will be
painted the configured color. Because the filter
specification supports the &quot; cont &quot; directive, a
single row can be <br>
painted by any number of color definitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When color is enabled ratop will
attempt to color IP addresses to indicate that local host
address, and the local network. This is very helpful in
mobile host installations, <br>
where you may not know what IP address has been assigned the
localhost. ratop also supports coloring local addresses
based on the RA_LOCAL rarc variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See racolor.conf.5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUS EVENTS <br>
Introduced in argus-3.0.8, ratop supports correlating
specific ARGUS_EVENT data with flow data, which can be
turned on through the use of the RA_CORRELATE_EVENTS rarc
variable. <br>
ratop will process argus-lsof event data generated by host
bourne argi, and label flow data with user, pid and process
name metadata. While experimental, it is production level
<br>
functionality, and can be used with other ra* programs to
enhance flow data with host os process information. See
argus-3.0.8 documentation on ARGUS_EVENTS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
ratop -r argus.file -s rank stime dur:14 saddr daddr proto
pkts bytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Read the file argus.file, and
display the resulting aggregated and sorted list of flow
records, using the default sorting methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ratop -S localhost <br>
Run ratop as a live display of realtime flow traffic.</p>
