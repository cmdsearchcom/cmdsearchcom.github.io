<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
scanimage is a command-line interface to control image
acquisition devices such as flatbed scanners or cameras. The
device is controlled via command-line options. After
com&acirc; <br>
mand-line processing, scanimage normally proceeds to acquire
an image. The image data is written to standard output in
one of the PNM (portable aNyMaP) formats (PBM for black-
<br>
and-white images, PGM for grayscale images, and PPM for
color images) or in TIFF (black-and-white, grayscale or
color). scanimage accesses image acquisition devices through
the <br>
SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) interface and can thus
support any device for which there exists a SANE backend
(try apropos sane- to get a list of available backends).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To get a list of devices:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scanimage -L</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To scan with default settings to
the file image.pnm:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scanimage &gt;image.pnm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To scan 100x100 mm to the file
image.tiff (-x and -y may not be available with all
devices):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scanimage -x 100 -y 100
--format=tiff &gt;image.tiff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To print all available
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scanimage -h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Parameters are separated by a blank from single-character
options (e.g. -d epson) and by a &quot;=&quot; from
multi-character options (e.g. --device-name=epson).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -d or --device-name options
must be followed by a SANE device-name like
&lsquo;epson:/dev/sg0&rsquo; or
&lsquo;hp:/dev/usbscanner0&rsquo;. A (partial) list of
available devices can be obtained with <br>
the --list-devices option (see below). If no device-name is
specified explicitly, scanimage reads a device-name from the
environment variable SANE_DEFAULT_DEVICE. If this
vari&acirc; <br>
able is not set, scanimage will attempt to open the first
available device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --format format option
selects how image data is written to standard output. format
can be pnm or tiff. If --format is not used, PNM is
written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -i or --icc-profile option
is used to include an ICC profile into a TIFF file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -L or --list-devices option
requests a (partial) list of devices that are available. The
list is not complete since some devices may be available,
but are not listed in any <br>
of the configuration files (which are typically stored in
directory /etc/sane.d). This is particularly the case when
accessing scanners through the network. If a device is not
<br>
listed in a configuration file, the only way to access it is
by its full device name. You may need to consult your system
administrator to find out the names of such devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -f or
--formatted-device-list option works similar to
--list-devices, but requires a format string. scanimage
replaces the placeholders %d %v %m %t %i %n with the device
<br>
name, vendor name, model name, scanner type, an index number
and newline respectively. The command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scanimage -f &acirc; scanner
number %i device %d is a %t, model %m, produced by %v
&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will produce something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scanner number 0 device
sharp:/dev/sg1 is a flatbed scanner, model JX250 SCSI,
produced by SHARP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --batch* options provide the
features for scanning documents using document feeders.
--batch [format] is used to specify the format of the
filename that each page will be <br>
written to. Each page is written out to a single file. If
format is not specified, the default of out%d.pnm (or
out%d.tif for --format tiff) will be used. format is given
as a <br>
printf style string with one integer parameter.
--batch-start start selects the page number to start naming
files with. If this option is not given, the counter will
start at 1. <br>
--batch-count count specifies the number of pages to attempt
to scan. If not given, scanimage will continue scanning
until the scanner returns a state other than OK. Not all
<br>
scanners with document feeders signal when the ADF is empty,
use this command to work around them. With --batch-increment
increment you can change the amount that the number in <br>
the filename is incremented by. Generally this is used when
you are scanning double-sided documents on a single-sided
document feeder. A specific command is provided to aid <br>
this: --batch-double will automatically set the increment to
2. --batch-prompt will ask for pressing RETURN before
scanning a page. This can be used for scanning multiple
pages <br>
without an automatic document feeder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --accept-md5-only option
only accepts user authorization requests that support MD5
security. The SANE network daemon (saned) is capable of
doing such requests. See saned(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -p or --progress option
requests that scanimage prints a progress counter. It shows
how much image data of the current image has already been
received by scanimage (in per&acirc; <br>
cent).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -n or --dont-scan option
requests that scanimage only sets the options provided by
the user but doesn&rsquo;t actually perform a scan. This
option can be used to e.g. turn off the <br>
scanner&rsquo;s lamp (if supported by the backend).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -T or --test option requests
that scanimage performs a few simple sanity tests to make
sure the backend works as defined by the SANE API (in
particular the sane_read function <br>
is exercised by this test).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -A or --all-options option
requests that scanimage lists all available options exposed
the backend, including button options. The information is
printed on standard output <br>
and no scan will be done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -h or --help options request
help information. The information is printed on standard
output and in this case, no attempt will be made to acquire
an image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -v or --verbose options
increase the verbosity of the operation of scanimage. The
option may be specified repeatedly, each time increasing the
verbosity level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -B or --buffer-size changes
the input buffer size from 32KB to the number kB specified
or 1M.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -V or --version option
requests that scanimage prints the program and package name,
the version number of the SANE distribution that it came
with and the version of the back&acirc; <br>
end that it loads. Usually that&rsquo;s the dll backend. If
more information about the version numbers of the backends
are necessary, the DEBUG variable for the dll backend can be
<br>
used. Example: SANE_DEBUG_DLL=3 scanimage -L.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As you might imagine, much of
the power of scanimage comes from the fact that it can
control any SANE backend. Thus, the exact set of
command-line options depends on the capa&acirc; <br>
bilities of the selected device. To see the options for a
device named dev, invoke scanimage via a command-line of the
form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scanimage --help --device-name
dev</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The documentation for the
device-specific options printed by --help is best explained
with a few examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l 0..218mm [0] <br>
Top-left x position of scan area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The description above shows that
option -l expects an option value in the range from 0 to 218
mm. The value in square brackets indicates that the current
option value is <br>
0 mm. Most backends provide similar geometry options for
top-left y position (-t), width (-x) and height of scan-area
(-y).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--brightness -100..100% [0] <br>
Controls the brightness of the acquired image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The description above shows that
option --brightness expects an option value in the range
from -100 to 100 percent. The value in square brackets
indicates that the cur&acirc; <br>
rent option value is 0 percent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default-enhancements <br>
Set default values for enhancement controls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The description above shows that
option --default-enhancements has no option value. It should
be thought of as having an immediate effect at the point of
the command-line <br>
at which it appears. For example, since this option resets
the --brightness option, the option-pair --brightness 50
--default-enhancements would effectively be a no-op.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mode Lineart|Gray|Color [Gray]
<br>
Selects the scan mode (e.g., lineart or color).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The description above shows that
option --mode accepts an argument that must be one of the
strings Lineart, Gray, or Color. The value in the square
bracket indicates that <br>
the option is currently set to Gray. For convenience, it is
legal to abbreviate the string values as long as they remain
unique. Also, the case of the spelling doesn&rsquo;t <br>
matter. For example, option setting --mode col is identical
to --mode Color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--custom-gamma[=(yes|no)]
[inactive] <br>
Determines whether a builtin or a custom gamma-table <br>
should be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The description above shows that
option --custom-gamma expects either no option value, a
&quot;yes&quot; string, or a &quot;no&quot; string.
Specifying the option with no value is equivalent <br>
to specifying &quot;yes&quot;. The value in square-brackets
indicates that the option is not currently active. That is,
attempting to set the option would result in an error
mes&acirc; <br>
sage. The set of available options typically depends on the
settings of other options. For example, the --custom-gamma
table might be active only when a grayscale or <br>
color scan-mode has been requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the --help option is
processed only after all other options have been processed.
This makes it possible to see the option settings for a
particular mode by <br>
specifying the appropriate mode-options along with the
--help option. For example, the command-line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scanimage --help --mode
color</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would print the option settings
that are in effect when the color-mode is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gamma-table 0..255,... <br>
Gamma-correction table. In color mode this option <br>
equally affects the red, green, and blue channels <br>
simultaneously (i.e., it is an intensity gamma table).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The description above shows that
option --gamma-table expects zero or more values in the
range 0 to 255. For example, a legal value for this option
would be <br>
&quot;3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12&quot;. Since it&rsquo;s
cumbersome to specify long vectors in this form, the same
can be expressed by the abbreviated form
&quot;[0]3-[9]12&quot;. What this means is <br>
that the first vector element is set to 3, the 9-th element
is set to 12 and the values in between are interpolated
linearly. Of course, it is possible to specify multi&acirc;
<br>
ple such linear segments. For example,
&quot;[0]3-[2]3-[6]7,[7]10-[9]6&quot; is equivalent to
&quot;3,3,3,4,5,6,7,10,8,6&quot;. The program
gamma4scanimage can be used to generate such <br>
gamma tables (see gamma4scanimage(1) for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--filename &lt;string&gt;
[/tmp/input.ppm] <br>
The filename of the image to be loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The description above is an
example of an option that takes an arbitrary string value
(which happens to be a filename). Again, the value in
brackets show that the option <br>
is current set to the filename /tmp/input.ppm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
SANE_DEFAULT_DEVICE <br>
The default device-name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
