<p>BASHBURN(1) BashBurn - Bash CD writer/burner
BASHBURN(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
BashBurn - A bash script CD Burner Writer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Once upon a time, or more exactly sometime around December
year 2001 if I&rsquo;m not misaken, a young little nerd
named Anders Lind&Atilde;&copy;n was trying to burn some CDs
with his recently <br>
bought CD-burner. He tried a lot of different programs, but
for some reason it would just not work properly. So, the
little nerd thought to himself: &quot;I guess I just have to
do <br>
something about this myself&quot;. And so he did...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INFORMATION <br>
So, you downloaded BashBurn and now you want to burn a lot
of CDs? <br>
Well, if you&rsquo;ve used BashBurn before, you can stop
reading now and get <br>
going. If not, take your time to read this manpage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UPDATES <br>
See http://bashburn.dose.se/ for updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
1. Unpack the file (And if you are reading this I guess you
already did) <br>
2. Cd into the directory and run the installation script
(Install.sh) <br>
For options, run Install.sh --help <br>
(To do a global install that will affect all users on a
system <br>
you will have to be root or have global write permissions)
<br>
3. Start the program by running &rsquo;bashburn&rsquo; and
configure it. <br>
4. Enjoy!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For those that have systems
where the bash executable isn&rsquo;t located <br>
in /bin/bash, you might need to edit the scripts so they
contain the <br>
correct path, or create a symlink from the executable to
/bin/bash. <br>
(Like cd /bin &amp;&amp; ln -s /path/to/bash ./bash) <br>
Newer BashBurn versions should be able to handle systems
where bash is <br>
located somewhere else, if not then let me know.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gentoo Linux users can install
BashBurn by running &rsquo;emerge bashburn&rsquo;. <br>
Mandrake Linux users can find BashBurn in the contrib
repository. <br>
Damn Small Linux has BashBurn included on the cd. <br>
The latest version can always be downloaded from
http://bashburn.dose.se/. <br>
(If BashBurn is packaged for more distros, let me know and
I&rsquo;ll add it here)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any problems mail me on
anders.linden@gmail.com or post <br>
on the BashBurn mailinglist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
After installing BashBurn, start it up by typing
&rsquo;bashburn&rsquo;. <br>
The first time BashBurn will create a directory from where
it will <br>
read which files to be burnt. Default is /tmp/burn. <br>
Now choose configure. You will be presented with a menu of
options. <br>
Don&rsquo;t understand what they all mean? Don&rsquo;t
worry, there is an <br>
explanation for every one of them. If unsure, pick the
default value, <br>
it&rsquo;s often fine. <br>
After you&rsquo;ve gone through each option, choose Apply
Settings. <br>
(Remember to do this or nothing will be saved.) <br>
Now choose Return to go back to the main menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
BashBurn is designed to be as easy to understand as
possible. <br>
Let&rsquo;s say you want to burn an audio CD. Where do you
go? <br>
To Audio of course, and under Audio there are more options
to choose from. <br>
Just remember that before attempting a burn you must copy or
link the <br>
data or audio files to be burnt to the temporary burn
directory, <br>
which again by default is /tmp/burn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, let&rsquo;s say you
want to burn an ISO file. <br>
1: Start BashBurn, pick option 10, define data. <br>
2: Pick option 1, and follow instructions. Link the data
<br>
with &rsquo;ln -s /path/to/myfile.iso .&rsquo; <br>
(Without the &rsquo;&rsquo;. The dot is important) <br>
(You can also copy the data if you prefer that, <br>
cp -Rf &lt;data&gt; &lt;destination&gt;) <br>
3: Return to the main menu, choose ISO and pick the Burn ISO
option. <br>
4: Done!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any problems with BashBurn,
suggestions or complaints mail me at <br>
anders.linden@gmail.com or post on the BashBurn
mailinglist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Have fun using BashBurn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRANSLATION <br>
BashBurn translation rules for translators <br>
##########################################</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are 2 steps in translation
process we must distinguish:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- ADD (new) translation <br>
- UPDATE (existing) translation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both steps are described below
and each translator should know this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. ADD translation process <br>
--------------------------</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.1 <br>
--- <br>
CONTACT a bashburn developer and tell what you want
translate. He will do the <br>
necessary things to provide you a language directory with
different skeleton <br>
files. (Hint: You can also do this by yourself - but you
need a little <br>
knowledge of the bashburn translation structure and you
should only do this if <br>
you KNOW what you do! Otherwise you may &quot;damage&quot;
all other translations!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.2 <br>
--- <br>
Edit with a text editor the file &quot;TRANSLATOR&quot; in
the language directory of the <br>
language you want to translate and encode it in unicode
UTF8. It contains 4 <br>
lines which you should correctly edit:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First Name: Name <br>
Surname : Another_name <br>
E-Mail : mymail@xy.loc <br>
Exit-Date : ?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first lines should be clear.
<br>
The &quot;EXIT-DATE&quot; is the date which you know that
you can&rsquo;t do the translation <br>
anymore. There are 2 types of this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">12. August 2009 <br>
?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-&gt; In the first case you will
leave the translation project at 12. August 2009 <br>
(please use the shown date-format!). <br>
-&gt; If you don&rsquo;t know a date - just enter
&rsquo;?&rsquo;. This means you don&rsquo;t plan to exit
bashburn <br>
translation now - but you may do it and contact us if you
wish so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is not to nerve you. This
information is help us to ensure good <br>
translations: We can contact you in case of questions and we
can welcome <br>
another translator for your language in case you want not do
it anymore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In any case: <br>
- We contact you in case you should update a translation.
<br>
- If we don&rsquo;t hear anything from you over a longer
period of time AND we have a <br>
new interested translator - this person can starting
updating translation. You <br>
will be deleted from TRANSLATOR file (but maybe mentioned in
&quot;CREDITS&quot; file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now goto description of UPDATE
translation (step 2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. UPDATE translation process
<br>
-----------------------------</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2.1 <br>
--- <br>
You need a (text) editor which supports Unicode UTF8
encoding of the <br>
translation text files. Bashburn translation files must be
ENCODED in UTF8 (see <br>
&quot;http://www.utf-8.com/&quot;)!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bashburn uses the GNU
&quot;gettext&quot; translation system for translation (see
<br>
&quot;http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/&quot;). If you
don&rsquo;t know this, you should <br>
read more about it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now you can begin to translate
the &quot;.po&quot; files in your language directory. <br>
There also graphical programs like &quot;KBabel&quot; which
can support you by this step.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2.2 <br>
--- <br>
After finishing translation and you think all it&rsquo;s
done, edit the file <br>
&quot;STATE&quot; in your language directory. Delete the
message in it (e.g.):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Your language directory
need updating translation!&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and write in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;UPDATED&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After this, we know that we can
use &quot;savely&quot; your translation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2.3 <br>
--- <br>
Contact a bashburn developer to complete your translation
technically (this <br>
involves creating of &quot;.mo&quot; files and some file
coying). (You can do this also <br>
manually with &quot;make MO &lt;language&gt;&quot; and
&quot;make install &lt;language&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRANSLATOR MASTER <br>
Markus Kollmar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FAQ <br>
Q1: Why? <br>
A1: I felt like it. Well, I got sick of a program I used
always failing to burn audio cds, and since I don&rsquo;t
know how to program C or something I decided to write a
simple lit&acirc; <br>
tle shell script to do the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q2: What can BashBurn do? <br>
A2: BashBurn can burn data, music and multisession CDs/DVDs.
It can burn and create ISO files. It can burn bin/cue files,
create MP3s, OGGs and FLAC files. Maybe even more :-) <br>
In short, it can do most things you need, and if it
can&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re probably doing it wrong. ;-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q3: You/BashBurn/Ya mama/Vacuum
machines suck! <br>
A3: That&rsquo;s not a question.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q4: Why the name change? <br>
A4: Apparently there already was a program named Magma, so a
namechange was a must. I agree BashBurn isnt really a
kickass name, but hey! At least it can still get the work
<br>
done...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q5: Can I steal the code and
base my own programs on it? <br>
A5: Yes. Can&rsquo;t imagine why anyone would want to, but
sure. Just remember to release your program under the GPL,
and leaving the credits would be nice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q6: Can I help? <br>
A6: Sure! Code away and send me the patch. If I find it
worthy (Which I do most of the times) I&rsquo;ll include it
in the next release and add you to the credits file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q7: How do I install BashBurn?
<br>
A7: Read the INSTALL file dummy!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q8: BashBurn often failes to
write CDs. <br>
A8: Well I bet it isn&rsquo;t really BashBurns fault. Could
be that your system isn&rsquo;t fast enough. Try to reduce
the speed of your burner, or buy higher quality CDs. If your
burner <br>
supports it, try using burnfree/burnsafe. Of course it COULD
be BashBurn failing, in which case it&rsquo;s a bug. Send me
a mail with a description of the problem and I&rsquo;ll try
to fix <br>
it as soon as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q9: I try to create an ISO-file
from files in my harddrive, but all files from different
directories end up in the root, not in their respective
directories! <br>
A9: Yes, this is a known bug in Magma versions before 1.0.
If you are using a version that old you should be taken out
back and put down. You could also try to download a newer
<br>
version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q10: Who are you? <br>
A10: A little geek from Sweden, and thats all you need to
know. :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q11: How do I use driver
options? <br>
A11: You don&rsquo;t really have to, but if you want to try
it out, here is how. Under configure, choose driver options
and BashBurn will show what your burner supports. My burner
<br>
supports burnfree, so I enter burnfree and press enter. The
next time I burn a cd, BashBurn will enable burnfree to
prevent buffer underruns. You can enter several options by
<br>
separating them with a comma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q12: BashBurn cannot find my
cd-burner. What do I do? <br>
A12: Make sure that you have support for your burner in the
kernel. For IDE burners you can either use SCSI emulation or
ATAPI mode. (Check Q18) If you don&rsquo;t know how to
config&acirc; <br>
ure your kernel, use google (There is lots of good
information on the web), tldp.org or #linuxhelp on
irc.freenode.org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q13: Where do I report bugs?
Where do I find any help? <br>
A13: Join the mailinglist and report it there, or send me a
mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q14: When will Magma 2 be
released? <br>
A14: It wont. Magma doesnt exist anymore, remember?
We&rsquo;ll see what happens in the future, for now BashBurn
is what you have to settle with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q15: Does BashBurn support for
instance overburn? <br>
A15: Yes, though it&rsquo;s not really tested that much. Try
it out, and if it works, great, let me know. If it
doesn&rsquo;t work, crap, let me know.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q16: I can&rsquo;t mount my ISO
and view it. What&rsquo;s wrong? <br>
A16: Make sure you have support for loopback devices in your
kernel or compiled as a module and loaded. If you&rsquo;re
not root, make sure you are part of the sudoers group, since
<br>
BashBurn uses sudo when mounting the image in that case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q17: I ran Install.sh as root,
but I still cant start BashBurn as a regular user <br>
A17: Download and install BashBurn 1.0 or later. In those
versions the installation script is rewritten and works a
lot better.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q18: Does BashBurn support IDE
burners natively, or do I need to use SCSI emulation? <br>
A18: As from BashBurn 1.3, IDE burners should work just
fine. I use this myself and have not experienced any
problems so far. To be able to use this you will need a 2.6
Linux <br>
kernel, cdrtools version 2.0 or higher and BashBurn 1.3 or
higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q19: Running BashBurn in sudo
gives me an error. <br>
A19: The latest version of BashBurn should work fine in
sudo. If it doesn&rsquo;t tell me about it and I&rsquo;ll
try to find a workaround.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q20: Where is this mailinglist
I&rsquo;ve been hearing so mych about? <br>
A20: Go to http://bashburn.dose.se/, click on the link that
says &quot;mailinglist&quot; and follow the instructions
there on how to sign up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q21: Can BashBurn burn DVDs?
<br>
A21: See A2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q22: How do I install BashBurn?
<br>
A22: Read the INSTALL file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q23: What are the requirements
for BashBurn? <br>
A23: Check the webpage at http://bashburn.dose.se/ for
information. Once BashBurn is installed, you can also run
option 8 in the main menu, Check program paths to see if you
<br>
need to install any programs for full functionality. (Note:
In Ubuntu normalize is called normalize-audio)</p>
