<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bssrecv - Bundle Streaming Service reception test
program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bssrecv</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
bssrecv uses BSS to acquire streaming data from
bssStreamingApp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bssrecv is a menu-driven
interactive test program, run from the operating system
shell prompt. The program enables the user to begin and end
a session of BSS data acquisition <br>
from bssStreamingApp, displaying the data as it arrives in
real time; to replay data acquired during the current
session; and to replay data acquired during a prior
session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user must provide values for
three parameters in order to initiate the acquisition or
replay of data from bssStreamingApp:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BSS database name <br>
All data acquired by the BSS session thread will be written
to a BSS &quot;database&quot; comprising three files: table,
list, and data. The name of the database is the root name
that <br>
is common to the three files, e.g., db3.tbl, db3.lst,
db3.dat would be the three files making up the db3 BSS
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path name <br>
All three files of the selected BSS database must reside in
the same directory of the file system; the path name of that
directory is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">endpoint ID <br>
In order to acquire streaming data issued by
bssStreamingApp, the bssrecv session thread must open the BP
endpoint to which that data is directed. For this purpose,
the ID <br>
of that endpoint is needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bssrecv offers the following
menu options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Open BSS Receiver in playback
mode <br>
bssrecv prompts the user for the three parameter values
noted above, then opens the indicated BSS database for
replay of the data in that database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Start BSS receiving thread
<br>
bssrecv prompts the user for the three parameter values
noted above, then starts a background session thread to
acquire data into the indicated database. Each bundle that
is <br>
acquired is passed to a display function that prints a
single line consisting of N consecutive &rsquo;*&rsquo;
characters, where N is computed as the data number at the
start of the <br>
bundle&rsquo;s payload data, modulo 150. Note that the
database is not open for replay at this time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Run BSS receiver thread <br>
bssrecv prompts the user for the three parameter values
noted above, then starts a background session thread to
acquire data into the indicated database (displaying the
data <br>
as described for option 2 above) and also opens the database
for replay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Close current playback
session <br>
bssrecv closes the indicated BSS database, terminating
replay access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Stop BSS receiving thread
<br>
bssrecv terminates the current background session thread.
Replay access to the BSS database, if currently open, is not
terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Stop BSS Receiver <br>
bssrecv terminates the current background session thread.
Replay access to the BSS database, if currently open, is
also terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. Replay session <br>
bssrecv prompts the user for the start and end times
bounding the reception interval that is to be replayed, then
displays all data within that interval in both forward and
<br>
reverse time order. The display function performed for this
purpose is the same one that is exercised during real-time
acquisition of streaming data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. Exit <br>
bssrecv terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
&quot;0&quot; bssrecv has terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
No configuration files are needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
No environment variables apply.</p>
