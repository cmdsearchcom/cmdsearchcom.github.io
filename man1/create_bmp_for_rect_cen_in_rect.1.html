<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect - bitmap generator for
rectangular conductor inside rectangular conductor (part of
atlc)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect [options... ] W H w h Er
outfile.bmp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
This man page is not a complete set of documentation - the
complexity of the atlc project makes man pages not an ideal
way to document it, although out of completeness, man pages
<br>
are produced. The best documentation that was current at the
time the version was produced should be found on your hard
drive, usually at <br>
/usr/local/share/atlc/docs/html-docs/index.html <br>
although it might be elsewhere if your system administrator
chose to install the package elsewhere. Sometimes, errors
are corrected in the documentation and placed at <br>
http://atlc.sourceforge.net/ before a new release of atlc is
released. Please, if you notice a problem with the
documentation - even spelling errors and typos, please let
me <br>
know.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect is a pre-processor for atlc,
the finite difference program that is used to calculate the
properties of a two-conductor electrical transmission <br>
line of arbitrary cross section. The program
create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect is used as a fast way of
generating bitmaps (there is no need to use a graphics
program), for a rec&acirc; <br>
tangular conductor placed centrally inside another
rectangular conductor, like this:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-----------------------------------------------------

&lt;---------------------------W-----------------------&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parameters &rsquo;W&rsquo;
and &rsquo;H&rsquo; and the inner dimensions of the outer
conductor. The outer dimensions of the inner conductor are
&rsquo;w&rsquo; and &rsquo;h&rsquo;. The inner conductor is
assumed be be <br>
placed centrally inside the outer conductor. The spaced
between the two conductors is filled with a dielectric of
relative permittivity Er</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bitmaps produced by
create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect are 24-bit bit colour
bitmaps, as required by atlc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The permittivity of the bitmap,
set by &rsquo;Er&rsquo;, determine the colours in the
bitmap. If Er is 1.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.33, 2.5, 3.3, 3.335, 4.8
or 10.2, then the colour corresponding to <br>
that permittivity will be set according to the colours
defined in COLOURS below. If Er is not one of those
permittivities, the region of permittivity Er will be set to
the colour <br>
0xCAFF00. The program atlc does not know what these
permittivites are, so they atlc, must be told with the
comand line option -d, as in example 4 below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b bitmapsize <br>
is used to set the size of the bitmap, and so the accuracy
to which atlc is able to calculate the transmission
line&rsquo;s properties. The default value for
&rsquo;bitmapsize&rsquo; is normally <br>
4, although this is set at compile time. The value can be
set anywhere from 1 to 15, but more than 8 is probably not
sensible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f outfile <br>
Set the output filename. By default, the bitmap is sent to
stdout, but it *must* be sent to a file, with this option,
or as described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
Causes create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect to print some data to
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLOURS <br>
The 24-bit bitmaps that atlc expects, have 8 bits assigned
to represent the amount of red, 8 for blue and 8 for green.
Hence there are 256 levels of red, green and blue, making a
<br>
total of 256*256*256=16777216 colours. Every one of the
possible 16777216 colours can be defined precisely by the
stating the exact amount of red, green and blue, as in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">red = 255,000,000 or 0xff0000
<br>
green = 000,255,000 or 0x00ff00 <br>
blue = 000,000,255 or 0x0000ff <br>
black = 000,000,000 or 0x000000 <br>
white = 255,255,255 or 0xffffff <br>
Brown = 255,000,255 or 0xff00ff <br>
gray = 142,142,142 or 0x8e8e8e</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some colours, such as pink,
turquoise, sandy, brown, gray etc may mean slightly
different things to different people. This is not so with
atlc, as the program expects the colours <br>
below to be EXACTLY defined as given. Whether you feel the
colour is sandy or yellow is up to you, but if you use it in
your bitmap, then it either needs to be a colour
recog&acirc; <br>
nised by atlc, or you must define it with a command line
option (see OPTIONS and example 5 below). <br>
The following conductors are recognised by atlc: <br>
red = 255,000,000 or 0xff0000 is the live conductor. <br>
green = 000,255,000 or 0x00ff00 is the grounded conductor.
<br>
blue = 000,000,000 or 0x000000 is the negative conductor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All bitmaps must have the live
(red) and grounded (green) conductor. The blue conductor is
not currently supported, but it will be used to indicate a
negative conductor, which <br>
will be needed if/when the program gets extended to analyse
directional couplers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following dielectrics are
recognised by atlc and so are produced by
create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">white 255,255,255 or 0xFFFFFF as
Er=1.0 (vacuum) <br>
pink 255,202,202 or 0xFFCACA as Er=1.0006 (air) <br>
light blue 130,052,255 or 0x8235Ef as Er=2.1 (PTFE) <br>
Mid gray 142,242,142 or 0x8E8E8E as Er=2.2 (duroid 5880)
<br>
mauve 255.000,255 or 0xFF00FF as Er=2.33 (polyethylene)
yellow 255,255,000 or 0xFFFF00 as Er=2.5 (polystyrene) <br>
sandy 239,203,027 or 0xEFCC1A as Er=3.3 (PVC) <br>
brown 188,127,096 or 0xBC7F60 as Er=3.335 (epoxy resin) <br>
Turquoise 026,239,179 or 0x1AEFB3 as Er=4.8 (glass PCB) <br>
Dark gray 142,142,142 or ox696969 as Er=6.15 (duroid 6006)
<br>
L. gray 240,240,240 or 0xDCDCDC as Er=10.2 (duroid 6010)
<br>
D. orange 213,130,067 or 0xD5A04D as Er=100.0 (mainly for
test purposes) <br>
If the permittivity is one not in the above list, then those
parts of the image with Er will be set to 0xCAFF00.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Here are a few examples of the use of
create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect. Again, see the html
documentation in atlc-X.Y.Z/docs/html-doc/index.html for
more examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) In the first example, there
is just a vacuum dielectric, so Er=1.0. The inner of 1x1
inches (or mm, miles etc) is placed centrally in an outer
with dimensions 3.3 x 3.9 <br>
inches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%
create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect 3.3 3.9 1 1 1 &gt; 1.bmp
<br>
% atlc 1.bmp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) In this second example, an
inner of 15.0 mm x 5.0 mm is surrounded by an outer with
internal dimensions of 71.5 x 60.0 mm. There is a material
with permittivity 2.1 (Er of <br>
PTFE) around the inner conductor. The output from
create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect is sent to a file 2.bmp,
which is then processed by atlc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%
create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect 71.5 60.0 15.0 5.0 2.1 &gt;
2.bmp <br>
% atlc 2.bmp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3) In example 3, the bitmap is
made larger, to increase accuracy, but otherwise this is
identical to the second example. %
create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect -b7 71.5 60 15 5 2.1 &gt;
<br>
3.bmp <br>
% atlc 3.bmp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the fourth example, instead
of re-directing create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect&rsquo;s
output to a file with the &gt; sign, it is done using the -f
option. <br>
% create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect -f 4.bmp 61.5 28.1 5 22
2.1 <br>
% atlc 4.bmp</p>
