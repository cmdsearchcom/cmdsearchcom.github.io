<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
athena - interactive XAS data processing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
athena file...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manpage documents the athena program, for interactive
XAS data processing, including converting raw data to mu(E),
aligning, merging, deglitching, Fourier transforming, and
<br>
plotting. Basically, Athena is intended to handle all chores
involving XAS data except for quantitative analysis by
fitting to theoretical standards. Athena&rsquo;s sister
program <br>
Artemis is the fitting program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Athena has two interesting and
unusual features. The first is that there are no buttons for
explicitly removing the background from mu(E) data or for
performing Fourier trans&acirc; <br>
forms. The only active buttons displayed on the main window
are for plotting. Athena always knows when data requires a
background removal or a Fourier transform and will
per&acirc; <br>
form the necessary analysis steps before displaying the
plot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second interesting feature
is that it is just as easy to perform analysis and plotting
chores on multiple data sets as on an individual data set.
Athena automates the most <br>
common data processing chores and automatically generates
plots of one or more data sets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Athena is a graphical and interactive program written in the
perl programming language, using the Tk display engine, the
IFEFFIT EXAFS library, and the PGPLOT plotting library. <br>
(See below for a list of relevant URLs.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When Athena starts, you are
presented with a window whose layout looks something like
this:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">+----------------------------------------+
<br>
| menubar | <br>
+---------------------------+------------+ <br>
| | | <br>
| | | <br>
| | Group | <br>

| | Features | <br>
| | | <br>
| | | <br>
+---------------------------+------------+ <br>
| echo area | <br>
+----------------------------------------+</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As you import data into Athena,
data groups are created and those groups are listed in the
section labeled &lsquo;Group List&rsquo; . You select a
group as the active one by clicking the <br>
left mouse button on its entry in the group list. When
selected, the list entry is highlighted with an orange
background and the parameters associated with that group are
dis&acirc; <br>
played in the large area on the left labeled &lsquo;Group
Parameters&rsquo;. When you pass the mouse over a label in
the group parameters section, you will notice that the label
changes <br>
color. This indicates that a mouse click on the label will
have an effect. Clicking the left mouse button will display
a hint in the echo area as to the function of that
param&acirc; <br>
eter. See the section on group operations for the effect of
a right mouse click.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The view of the group parameters
is replaced when certain features of Athena are used.
Choosuing any of the options from the Data, Align, Diff, or
Analysis menus will temporar&acirc; <br>
ily replace the group parameters with views of parameters
relevant to the chosen task. For example, when the log-ratio
option is chosen from the Analysis menu, the view of group
<br>
parameters is replaced by a view of the interface to
Athena&rsquo;s log-ratio/phase-difference analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Below the group list are two
rows of button for plotting data. The red buttons are for
plotting the selected data group. The purple buttons are for
plotting multiple data <br>
groups. These buttons are labeled according to the data
space of the plot. E, k, R, and q refer to energy,
photoelectron k, real space R, and backtransform k,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Below the plot buttons are a set
of tabs for specifying the details of the plots in each
space. For each space you can specify the range of the
x-axis. For energy plots, you <br>
can select whether the background function is plotted along
with the data and whether the data and background are
normalized. For k-space plots, you can select the amount of
<br>
k-weighting. For R- and q-space plots, you can select which
part of those complex functions are plotted. There are also
tabs for setting up stacked plots and for establishing <br>
plot indicators. For a complete discussion see the section
on plotting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, at the bottom of the
page is the echo area. Athena uses this area to display
hints, brief help messages, warnings, and updates about
recently performed analysis or <br>
plotting actions. A few features of Athena will prompt the
user for a text string. In those situations, the echo area
is temporarily replaced by text string dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Throughout Athena the right
mouse button serves to post context sensitive menus. These
include parameter labels, groups list entries, and other
elements on the screen. You <br>
should try clicking the right mouse button in different
places to see what usefuls things might pop up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MISSING FEATURES <br>
You betcha! Lots! Here&rsquo;s a partial list:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Principal Component Analysis
on the set of marked groups</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* XANES analysis by fitting a
sum of scans to an unknown</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Dead-time and self-absorption
corrections</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Handle dispersive data sets,
i.e. data sets wherein the I0 and IT measurements are in
separate data files becuase the data were obtained
sequentially</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Calibrate dispersive data to a
trusted standard</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Handle SPEC files. An
independent perl module would be ideal. This is a project
some eager contributor could tackle without having to delve
into ATHENA&rsquo;s source code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Alignment of scans using a
reference, either of the same edge or of a nearby edge. (Any
suggestions? I am lacking a good idea about how to implement
this...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Formulas for the energy axis
(useful for converting encoder readings to energy
values)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* R and q space records, that is
to be able to read and write data in R and q space just as
easily as E or k space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Internationalization. That is,
build a framework for having text strings read from external
files and for the language to be a configuration option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Documentation, documentation,
documentation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WHAT&rsquo;S IN A NAME? <br>
Athena was the goddess of wisdom and is also associated with
skill and justice. Those are all good qualities for a data
analysis program!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
This program requires no options.</p>
