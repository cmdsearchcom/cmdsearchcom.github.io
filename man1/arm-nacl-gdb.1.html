<p>GDB(1) GNU Development Tools GDB(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gdb - The GNU Debugger</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gdb [-help] [-nh] [-nx] [-q] [-batch] [-cd=dir] [-f] [-b
bps] <br>
[-tty=dev] [-s symfile] [-e prog] [-se prog] [-c core] [-p
procID] <br>
[-x cmds] [-d dir] [prog|prog procID|prog core]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The purpose of a debugger such as GDB is to allow you to see
what is going on &quot;inside&quot; another program while it
executes -- or what another program was doing at the moment
it <br>
crashed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GDB can do four main kinds of
things (plus other things in support of these) to help you
catch bugs in the act:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Start your
program, specifying anything that might affect its
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Make your
program stop on specified conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Examine what has
happened, when your program has stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Change things in
your program, so you can experiment with correcting the
effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use GDB to debug
programs written in C, C@t{++}, Fortran and Modula-2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GDB is invoked with the shell
command &quot;gdb&quot;. Once started, it reads commands
from the terminal until you tell it to exit with the GDB
command &quot;quit&quot;. You can get online help <br>
from GDB itself by using the command &quot;help&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can run &quot;gdb&quot; with
no arguments or options; but the most usual way to start GDB
is with one argument or two, specifying an executable
program as the argument:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gdb program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also start with both an
executable program and a core file specified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gdb program core</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can, instead, specify a
process ID as a second argument, if you want to debug a
running process:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gdb program 1234 <br>
gdb -p 1234</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would attach GDB to process 1234
(unless you also have a file named 1234; GDB does check for
a core file first). With option -p you can omit the program
filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are some of the most
frequently needed GDB commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">break [file:]functiop <br>
Set a breakpoint at function (in file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">run [arglist] <br>
Start your program (with arglist, if specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bt Backtrace: display the
program stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print expr <br>
Display the value of an expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Continue running your program
(after stopping, e.g. at a breakpoint).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">next <br>
Execute next program line (after stopping); step over any
function calls in the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">edit [file:]function <br>
look at the program line where it is presently stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list [file:]function <br>
type the text of the program in the vicinity of where it is
presently stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">step <br>
Execute next program line (after stopping); step into any
function calls in the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help [name] <br>
Show information about GDB command name, or general
information about using GDB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit <br>
Exit from GDB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For full details on GDB, see
Using GDB: A Guide to the GNU Source-Level Debugger, by
Richard M. Stallman and Roland H. Pesch. The same text is
available online as the &quot;gdb&quot; <br>
entry in the &quot;info&quot; program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Any arguments other than options specify an executable file
and core file (or process ID); that is, the first argument
encountered with no associated option flag is equivalent to
<br>
a -se option, and the second, if any, is equivalent to a -c
option if it&rsquo;s the name of a file. Many options have
both long and short forms; both are shown here. The long
forms <br>
are also recognized if you truncate them, so long as enough
of the option is present to be unambiguous. (If you prefer,
you can flag option arguments with + rather than -, <br>
though we illustrate the more usual convention.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the options and command line
arguments you give are processed in sequential order. The
order makes a difference when the -x option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help <br>
-h List all options, with brief explanations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-symbols=file <br>
-s file <br>
Read symbol table from file file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-write <br>
Enable writing into executable and core files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-exec=file <br>
-e file <br>
Use file file as the executable file to execute when
appropriate, and for examining pure data in conjunction with
a core dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-se=file <br>
Read symbol table from file file and use it as the
executable file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-core=file <br>
-c file <br>
Use file file as a core dump to examine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-command=file <br>
-x file <br>
Execute GDB commands from file file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ex command <br>
Execute given GDB command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-directory=directory <br>
-d directory <br>
Add directory to the path to search for source files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nh Do not execute commands from
~/.gdbinit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nx <br>
-n Do not execute commands from any .gdbinit initialization
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quiet <br>
-q &quot;Quiet&quot;. Do not print the introductory and
copyright messages. These messages are also suppressed in
batch mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-batch <br>
Run in batch mode. Exit with status 0 after processing all
the command files specified with -x (and .gdbinit, if not
inhibited). Exit with nonzero status if an error occurs <br>
in executing the GDB commands in the command files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Batch mode may be useful for
running GDB as a filter, for example to download and run a
program on another computer; in order to make this more
useful, the message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Program exited normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(which is ordinarily issued
whenever a program running under GDB control terminates) is
not issued when running in batch mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cd=directory <br>
Run GDB using directory as its working directory, instead of
the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fullname <br>
-f Emacs sets this option when it runs GDB as a subprocess.
It tells GDB to output the full file name and line number in
a standard, recognizable fashion each time a stack <br>
frame is displayed (which includes each time the program
stops). This recognizable format looks like two 32
characters, followed by the file name, line number and <br>
character position separated by colons, and a newline. The
Emacs-to-GDB interface program uses the two 32 characters as
a signal to display the source code for the frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b bps <br>
Set the line speed (baud rate or bits per second) of any
serial interface used by GDB for remote debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tty=device <br>
Run using device for your program&rsquo;s standard input and
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
The full documentation for GDB is maintained as a Texinfo
manual. If the &quot;info&quot; and &quot;gdb&quot; programs
and GDB&rsquo;s Texinfo documentation are properly installed
at your site, the <br>
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info gdb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">should give you access to the
complete manual.</p>
