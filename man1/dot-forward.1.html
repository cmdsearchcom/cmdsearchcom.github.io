The <b>dotforward</b> program is a compatibility module that reads forwarding
  instructions in $HOME/.forward. <b>dotforward</b> is used for compatibility
  with <b>sendmail</b> or other mail servers that use the $HOME/.forward file.
  The <b>dotforward</b> program is intended to be executed from a
  <b></b><b>dot-courier</b>(5)[1] delivery instruction file. The system
  administrator can add it to the default set of delivery instructions, thus
  unilaterally implementing $HOME/.forward systemwide. To read forwarding
  instructions from $HOME/.forward, put &quot;|| dotforward&quot; on the first
  line of $HOME/.courier*. &quot;|| dotforward&quot; can also be added to the
  <b>DEFAULTDELIVERY</b> setting in the courierd configuration file. In both
  cases it must be followed by a newline, and the remaining delivery
  instructions, which will be used if $HOME/.forward does not exist.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>dotforward</b> expects to be invoked from <b></b><b>dot-courier</b>(5)[1]
  delivery instruction file via the &quot;||&quot; operator (or from
  <b>DEFAULTDELIVERY</b>). <b>dotforward</b> checks its environment, reads the
  message from standard input, reconciles its environment with the contents of
  $HOME/.forward, then prints on standard output equivalent
  <b></b><b>dot-courier</b>(5)[1] compatible delivery instructions. The
  &quot;||&quot; operator reinterprets <b>dotforward</b>'s output as additional
  delivery instructions, by the Courier mail server.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The different security models of the Courier mail server and other mail servers
  that use $HOME/.forward, such as <b>sendmail</b>, means that it is not
  possible to faithfully duplicate 100% of the behavior of $HOME/.forward that
  originated with <b>sendmail</b>. The following section documents the behavior
  of the <b>dotforward</b> utility in the the Courier mail server mail server.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="$HOME/.forward_processing"><a class="selflink" href="#$HOME/.forward_processing">$HOME/.forward
  processing</a></h2>
<b>dotforward</b> reads the <b>DTLINE</b> environment variable, and the headers
  of the message being delivered, from standard input. <b>DTLINE</b> contains
  the recipient's E-mail address. The Delivered-To headers list the recipients
  that already received this message. This is used to prevent mail loops between
  $HOME/.forward files from different recipients, which forward mail to each
  other.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If $HOME/.forward does not exist, <b>dotforward</b> quietly terminates with a
  zero exit code, doing nothing. The remaining delivery instructions in
  $HOME/.courier are then carried out.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If $HOME/.forward exists, it is expected to contain a list of addresses that the
  message should be forwarded to. An address may be an actual E-mail address, or
  a name of a program or a mailbox. Each line in $HOME/.forward should contain a
  list of comma-separated addresses. Use &quot;| /path/to/program&quot;
  (including the double quotes) to specify a delivery to a program (the message
  is piped to the given program). Use &quot;/path/to/mailbox&quot; or
  &quot;./path/to/mailbox&quot; (again including the double quotes) to specify a
  delivery to a mailbox (relative to $HOME in the second case).
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;| /path/to/program&quot;, &quot;/path/to/mailbox&quot;, and
  &quot;./path/to/mailbox&quot; may also be listed on a line by themselves
  without the double quotes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All other addresses are interpreted as E-mail addresses where the mail should be
  forwarded. Any backslash at the beginning of an E-mail address is removed.
  Backslashes are used by <b>sendmail</b> to prevent mail loops. The Courier
  mail server does not need the backslashes -- it uses a different mechanism to
  prevent mail loops.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Every E-mail address is checked against the list of E-mail addresses found in
  Delivered-To headers. If the E-mail address specified in $HOME/.forward
  matches any address in the Delivered-To header, it is automatically removed
  from a list of addresses.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>dotforward</b> normally terminates with the exit code set to <b>99</b>. This
  results in the Courier mail server considering the message to be succesfully
  delivered, and any additional delivery instructions in the .courier file will
  not be carried out. If an address read from $HOME/.forward matches the address
  in the <b>DTLINE</b> environment variable, the address is removed from the
  list of addresses that the message will be forwarded to, and <b>dotforward</b>
  terminates with the exit code set to 0 (after printing all the relevant
  delivery instructions to standard output). The messages will be forwarded, and
  the Courier mail server will proceed with additional delivery instructions in
  the .courier after finishing with the delivery instructions it reads from
  <b>dotforward</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
The restrictions and precautions mentioned in <b></b><b>dot-courier</b>(5)[1]
  are also applicable here. There is an upper limit on the maximum number of
  characters that are read from any process executed by ||. Also if any delivery
  instruction fails with a transit exit code, the message will be completely
  redelivered at a later point, even to all the addresses it has been
  succesfully delivered the first time around.
