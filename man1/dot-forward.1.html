<p>DOT-FORWARD(1) Double Precision, Inc. DOT-FORWARD(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dotforward, dot-forward - Read $HOME/.forward</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
$ cat $HOME/.courier <br>
|| dotforward <br>
./Maildir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The dotforward program is a compatibility module that reads
forwarding instructions in $HOME/.forward. dotforward is
used for compatibility with sendmail or other mail servers
<br>
that use the $HOME/.forward file. The dotforward program is
intended to be executed from a dot-courier(5)[1] delivery
instruction file. The system administrator can add it to the
<br>
default set of delivery instructions, thus unilaterally
implementing $HOME/.forward systemwide. To read forwarding
instructions from $HOME/.forward, put &quot;||
dotforward&quot; on the <br>
first line of $HOME/.courier*. &quot;|| dotforward&quot; can
also be added to the DEFAULTDELIVERY setting in the courierd
configuration file. In both cases it must be followed by a
<br>
newline, and the remaining delivery instructions, which will
be used if $HOME/.forward does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dotforward expects to be invoked
from dot-courier(5)[1] delivery instruction file via the
&quot;||&quot; operator (or from DEFAULTDELIVERY).
dotforward checks its environment, reads the <br>
message from standard input, reconciles its environment with
the contents of $HOME/.forward, then prints on standard
output equivalent dot-courier(5)[1] compatible delivery <br>
instructions. The &quot;||&quot; operator reinterprets
dotforward&rsquo;s output as additional delivery
instructions, by the Courier mail server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The different security models of
the Courier mail server and other mail servers that use
$HOME/.forward, such as sendmail, means that it is not
possible to faithfully duplicate <br>
100% of the behavior of $HOME/.forward that originated with
sendmail. The following section documents the behavior of
the dotforward utility in the the Courier mail server mail
<br>
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.forward processing <br>
dotforward reads the DTLINE environment variable, and the
headers of the message being delivered, from standard input.
DTLINE contains the recipient&rsquo;s E-mail address. The
<br>
Delivered-To headers list the recipients that already
received this message. This is used to prevent mail loops
between $HOME/.forward files from different recipients,
which <br>
forward mail to each other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If $HOME/.forward does not
exist, dotforward quietly terminates with a zero exit code,
doing nothing. The remaining delivery instructions in
$HOME/.courier are then carried out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If $HOME/.forward exists, it is
expected to contain a list of addresses that the message
should be forwarded to. An address may be an actual E-mail
address, or a name of a <br>
program or a mailbox. Each line in $HOME/.forward should
contain a list of comma-separated addresses. Use &quot;|
/path/to/program&quot; (including the double quotes) to
specify a delivery <br>
to a program (the message is piped to the given program).
Use &quot;/path/to/mailbox&quot; or
&quot;./path/to/mailbox&quot; (again including the double
quotes) to specify a delivery to a mailbox <br>
(relative to $HOME in the second case).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;| /path/to/program&quot;,
&quot;/path/to/mailbox&quot;, and
&quot;./path/to/mailbox&quot; may also be listed on a line
by themselves without the double quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All other addresses are
interpreted as E-mail addresses where the mail should be
forwarded. Any backslash at the beginning of an E-mail
address is removed. Backslashes are used <br>
by sendmail to prevent mail loops. The Courier mail server
does not need the backslashes -- it uses a different
mechanism to prevent mail loops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every E-mail address is checked
against the list of E-mail addresses found in Delivered-To
headers. If the E-mail address specified in $HOME/.forward
matches any address in the <br>
Delivered-To header, it is automatically removed from a list
of addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dotforward normally terminates
with the exit code set to 99. This results in the Courier
mail server considering the message to be succesfully
delivered, and any additional <br>
delivery instructions in the .courier file will not be
carried out. If an address read from $HOME/.forward matches
the address in the DTLINE environment variable, the address
is <br>
removed from the list of addresses that the message will be
forwarded to, and dotforward terminates with the exit code
set to 0 (after printing all the relevant delivery <br>
instructions to standard output). The messages will be
forwarded, and the Courier mail server will proceed with
additional delivery instructions in the .courier after
finishing <br>
with the delivery instructions it reads from dotforward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The restrictions and precautions mentioned in
dot-courier(5)[1] are also applicable here. There is an
upper limit on the maximum number of characters that are
read from any <br>
process executed by ||. Also if any delivery instruction
fails with a transit exit code, the message will be
completely redelivered at a later point, even to all the
addresses it <br>
has been succesfully delivered the first time around.</p>
