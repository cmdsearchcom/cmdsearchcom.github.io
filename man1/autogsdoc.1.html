<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The autogsdoc tool is a command-line utility that helps
developers produce reference documentation for GNUstep APIs.
It also enables developers to write and maintain other
docu&acirc; <br>
mentation in XML and have it converted to HTML. In detail,
autogsdoc will:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Extract special comments
describing the public interfaces of classes, categories,
protocols, functions, and macros from Objective C source
code (header files and optionally <br>
source files) into GSDoc XML files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Convert GSDoc XML files,
whether generated from source code or written manually by
developers, into HTML.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Construct indices based on
GSDoc XML file sets, and convert those to HTML as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The most common usage this is to
run the command with one or more header file names as
arguments ... the tool will automatically parse
corresponding source files in the same <br>
directory as the headers (or the current directory, or the
directory specified using the DocumentationDirectory
default), and produce GSDoc and HTML files as output. For
best <br>
results this mode should be run from the directory
containing the source files. (Note that since C is a subset
of Objective C, this tool can operate to document functions
and <br>
other C structures in plain C source.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GSDoc files may also be given
directly in addition or by themselves, and will be converted
to HTML. See the GSDoc HTML documentation or the gsdoc(7)
man page for information on <br>
the GSDoc format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, HTML files may be given
on the command line. Cross-references to other parts of code
documentation found within them will be rewritten based on
what is found in the <br>
project currently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOURCE CODE MARKUP <br>
The source code parser will automatically produce GSDoc
documents listing the methods in the classes found in the
source files, and it will include text from specially
formatted <br>
comments from the source files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any comment beginning with slash
and two asterisks rather than the common slash and single
asterisk, is taken to be GSDoc markup, to be use as the
description of the class or <br>
method following it. This comment text is reformatted and
then inserted into the output. <br>
Where multiple comments are associated with the same item,
they are joined together with a line break (&lt;br/&gt;)
between each if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tool can easily be used to
document programs as well as libraries, simply by giving it
the name of the source file containing the main() function
of the program - it takes <br>
the special comments from that function and handles them
specially, inserting them as a section at the end of the
first chapter of the document (it creates the first chapter
if <br>
necessary).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options are described in the
section Arguments and Defaults below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTRA MARKUP <br>
There are some cases where special extra processing is
performed, predominantly in the first comment found in the
source file, from which various chunks of GSDoc markup may
be <br>
extracted and placed into appropriate locations in the
output document -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AutogsdocSource: <br>
In any line where AutogsdocSource: is found, the remainder
of the line is taken as a source file name to be used
instead of making the assumption that each .h file processed
<br>
uses a .m file of the same name. You may supply multiple
AutogsdocSource: lines where a header file declares items
which are defined in multiple source files. If a file <br>
name is absolute, it is used just as supplied. If on the
other hand, it is a relative path, the software looks for
the source file first relative to the location of the <br>
header file, and if not found there, relative to the current
directory in which autogsdoc is running, and finally
relative to the directory specified by the
DocumentationDi&acirc; <br>
rectory default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;abstract&gt; <br>
An abstract of the content of the document ... placed in the
head of the GSDoc output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;author&gt; <br>
A description of the author of the code - may be repeated to
handle the case where a document has multiple authors.
Placed in the head of the GSDoc output. As an aid to <br>
readability of the source, some special additional
processing is performed related to the document author - Any
line of the form &rsquo;Author: name
&lt;email-address&gt;&rsquo;, or &rsquo;By: name <br>
&lt;email-address&gt;&rsquo;, or &rsquo;Author: name&rsquo;
or &rsquo;By: name&rsquo; will be recognised and converted
to an author element, possibly containing an email
element.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;back&gt; <br>
Placed in the GSDoc output just before the end of the body
of the document - intended to be used for appendices, index
etc..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;chapter&gt; <br>
Placed immediately before any generated class documentation
... intended to be used to provide overall description of
how the code being documented works. Any documentation <br>
for the main() function of a program is inserted as a
section at the end of this chapter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;copy&gt; <br>
Copyright of the content of the document ... placed in the
head of the GSDoc output. As an aid to readability of the
source, some special additional processing is performed <br>
- Any line of the form &rsquo;Copyright (C) text&rsquo; will
be recognised and converted to a copy element.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;date&gt; <br>
Date of the revision of the document ... placed in the head
of the GSDoc output. If this is omitted the tool will try to
construct a value from the RCS Date tag (if avail&acirc;
<br>
able).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;front&gt; <br>
Inserted into the document at the start of the body ...
intended to provide for introduction or contents pages
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;title&gt; <br>
Title of the document ... placed in the head of the GSDoc
output. If this is omitted the tool will generate a
(probably poor) title of its own - so you should include
this <br>
markup manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;version&gt; <br>
Version identifier of the document ... placed in the head of
the GSDoc output. If this is omitted the tool will try to
construct a value from the RCS Revision tag (if avail&acirc;
<br>
able).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NB The markup just described may
be used within class, category, or protocol documentation
... if so, it is extracted and wrapped round the rest of the
documentation for the <br>
class as the class&rsquo;s chapter. The rest of the class
documentation is normally inserted at the end of the
chapter, but may instead be substituted in in place of the
&lt;unit&gt; <br>
pseudo-element within the &lt;chapter&gt; element.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">METHOD MARKUP <br>
In comments being used to provide text for a method
description, the following markup is removed from the text
and handled specially -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;init&gt; <br>
The method is marked as being the designated initialiser for
the class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;override-subclass&gt; <br>
The method is marked as being one which subclasses must
override (e.g. an abstract method).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;override-never&gt; <br>
The method is marked as being one which subclasses should
NOT override.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;standards&gt; <br>
The markup is removed from the description and placed after
it in the GSDoc output - so that the method is described as
conforming (or not conforming) to the specified stan&acirc;
<br>
dards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTOMATED MARKUP <br>
Generally, the text in comments is reformatted to
standardise and indent it nicely ... the reformatting is not
performed on any text inside an &lt;example&gt; element.
When the text <br>
is reformatted, it is broken into whitespace separated
&acirc;words&acirc; which are then subjected to some extra
processing ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Certain well known constants
such as YES, NO, and nil are enclosed in &lt;code&gt; ...
&lt;/code&gt; markup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The names of method arguments
within method descriptions are enclosed in &lt;var&gt; ...
&lt;/var&gt; markup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Method names (beginning with a
plus or minus) are enclosed in &lt;ref...&gt; ...
&lt;/ref&gt; markup. E.g. &quot;-init&quot; (without the
quotes) would be wrapped in a GSDoc reference element to
<br>
point to the init method of the current class or, if only
one known class had an init method, it would refer to the
method of that class. Note the fact that the method name
<br>
must be surrounded by whitespace to be recognized (though a
comma, fullstop, or semicolon at the end of the specifier
will act like whitespace).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Method specifiers including
class names (beginning and ending with square brackets) are
enclosed in &lt;ref...&gt; ... &lt;/ref&gt; markup. e.g.
&rsquo;[NSObject-init]&rsquo;, will create a refer&acirc;
<br>
ence to the init method of NSObject (either the class
proper, or any of its categories), while
&rsquo;[(NSCopying)-copyWithZone:]&rsquo;, creates a
reference to a method in the NSCopying <br>
protocol. Note that no spaces must appear between the square
brackets in these specifiers. Protocol names are enclosed in
round brackets rather than the customary angle <br>
brackets, because GSDoc is an XML language, and XML treats
angle brackets specially.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Function names (ending with
&rsquo;()&rsquo;) other than &rsquo;main()&rsquo; are
enclosed in &lt;ref...&gt; ... &lt;/ref&gt; markup. E.g.
&quot;NSLogv()&quot; (without the quotes) would be wrapped
in a GSDoc reference <br>
element to point to the documentation of the NSLog function.
Note the fact that the function name must be surrounded by
whitespace (though a comma, fullstop, or semicolon at <br>
the end of the specifier will also act as a whitespace
terminator).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS AND DEFAULTS <br>
The tool accepts certain user defaults (which can of course
be supplied as command-line arguments by prepending
&rsquo;-&rsquo; before the default name and giving the value
afterwards, as in <br>
-Clean YES):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clean <br>
If this boolean value is set to YES, then rather than
generating documentation, the tool removes all GSDoc files
generated in the project, and all html files generated from
<br>
them (as well as any which would be generated from GSDoc
files listed explicitly), and finally removes the project
index file. The only exception to this is that template <br>
GSDoc files (i.e. those specified using
&quot;-ConstantsTemplate ...&quot;, &quot;-FunctionsTemplate
...&quot; arguments etc) are not deleted unless the
CleanTemplates flag is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CleanTemplates <br>
This flag specifies whether template GSDoc files are to be
removed along with other files when the Clean option is
specified. The default is for them not to be removed ...
<br>
since these templates may have been produced manually and
just had data inserted into them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ConstantsTemplate <br>
Specify the name of a template document into which
documentation about constants should be inserted from all
files in the project. This is useful if constants in the
source <br>
code are scattered around many files, and you need to group
them into one place. You are responsible for ensuring that
the basic template document (into which individual <br>
constant documentation is inserted) contains all the other
information you want, but as a convenience autogsdoc will
generate a simple template (which you may then edit) for
<br>
you if the file does not exist. Insertion takes place
immediately before the back element (or if that does not
exist, immediately before the end of the body element) in
the <br>
template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Declared <br>
Specify where headers are to be documented as being found.
The actual name produced in the documentation is formed by
appending the last component of the header file name to <br>
the value of this default. If this default is not specified,
the full name of the header file (as supplied on the command
line), with the HeaderDirectory default prepended, <br>
is used. A typical usage of this might be
&rsquo;&quot;-Declared Foundation&quot;&rsquo; when
generating documentation for the GNUstep base library. This
would result in the documentation saying <br>
that NSString is declared in
&rsquo;Foundation/NSString.h&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DocumentAllInstanceVariables
<br>
This flag permits you to generate documentation for all
instance variables. Normally, only those explicitly declared
&rsquo;public&rsquo; or &rsquo;protected&rsquo; will be
documented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DocumentInstanceVariables <br>
This flag permits you to turn off documentation for instance
variables completely. Normally, explicitly declared
&rsquo;public&rsquo; or &rsquo;protected&rsquo; instance
variables will be docu&acirc; <br>
mented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">InstanceVariablesAtEnd <br>
This flag, if set, directs the HTML generator to place
instance variable documentation at the end of the class,
instead of the beginning. This is useful if you use a lot of
<br>
protected instance variables which are only going to be of
secondary interest to general users of the class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DocumentationDirectory <br>
May be used to specify the directory in which generated
documentation is to be placed. If this is not set, output is
placed in the current directory. This directory is also <br>
used as a last resort to locate source files (not headers),
and more importantly, it is used as the first and only
resort to locate any .gsdoc files that are passed in on the
<br>
command line. Any path information given for these files is
removed and they are searched for in
&rsquo;DocumentationDirectory&rsquo; (even though they may
not have been autogenerated).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files <br>
Specifies the name of a file containing a list of file names
as a property list array (name1,name2,...) format. If this
is present, filenames in the program argument list <br>
are ignored and the names in this file are used as the list
of names to process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FunctionsTemplate <br>
Specify the name of a template document into which
documentation about functions should be inserted from all
files in the project. This is useful if function source code
is <br>
scattered around many files, and you need to group it into
one place. You are responsible for ensuring that the basic
template document (into which individual function
docu&acirc; <br>
mentation is inserted) contains all the other information
you want, but as a convenience autogsdoc will generate a
simple template (which you may then edit) for you if the
<br>
file does not exist. Insertion takes place immediately
before the back element (or if that does not exist,
immediately before the end of the body element) in the
template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GenerateHtml <br>
May be used to specify if HTML output is to be generated.
Defaults to YES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HeaderDirectory <br>
May be used to specify the directory to be searched for
header files. When supplied, this value is prepended to
relative header names, otherwise the relative header names
<br>
are interpreted relative to the current directory. Header
files specified as absolute paths are not influenced by this
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IgnoreDependencies <br>
A boolean value which may be used to specify that the
program should ignore file modification times and regenerate
files anyway. Provided for use in conjunction with the <br>
&rsquo;make&rsquo; system, which is expected to manage
dependency checking itsself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LocalProjects <br>
This value is used to control the automatic inclusion of
local external projects into the indexing system for
generation of cross-references in final document output. If
set <br>
to &rsquo;None&rsquo;, then no local project references are
done, otherwise, the &rsquo;Local&rsquo; GNUstep
documentation directory is recursively searched for files
with a &rsquo;.igsdoc&rsquo; extension, and <br>
the indexing information from those files is used. The value
of this string is also used to generate the filenames in the
cross reference ... if it is an empty string, the <br>
path to use is assumed to be a file in the same directory
where the igsdoc file was found, otherwise it is used as a
prefix to the name in the index. NB. Local projects with
<br>
the same name as the project currently being documented will
not be included by this mechanism. If you wish to include
such projects, you must do so explicitly using <br>
-Projects ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MacrosTemplate <br>
Specify the name of a template document into which
documentation about macros should be inserted from all files
in the project. This is useful if macro code is scattered
<br>
around many files, and you need to group it into one place.
You are responsible for ensuring that the basic template
document (into which individual macro documentation is <br>
inserted) contains all the other information you want, but
as a convenience autogsdoc will generate a simple template
(which you may then edit) for you if the file does not <br>
exist. Insertion takes place immediately before the back
element (or if that does not exist, immediately before the
end of the body <br>
element) in the template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MakeDependencies <br>
A filename to be used to output dependency information for
make. This will take the form of listing all header and
source files known for the project as dependencies of the
<br>
project name (see &rsquo;Project&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Project <br>
May be used to specify the name of this project ...
determines the name of the index reference file produced as
part of the documentation to provide information enabling
<br>
other projects to cross-reference to items in this
project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Projects <br>
This value may be supplied as a dictionary containing the
paths to the igsdoc index/reference files used by external
projects, along with values to be used to map the
file&acirc; <br>
names found in the indexes. For example, if a project index
(igsdoc) file says that the class &rsquo;Foo&rsquo; is found
in the file &rsquo;Foo&rsquo;, and the path associated with
that project <br>
index is &rsquo;/usr/share/doc/proj&rsquo;, Then generated
html output may reference the class as being in
&rsquo;/usr/share/doc/prj/Foo.html&rsquo; . Note that a
dictionary may be given on the <br>
command line by using the standard PropertyList format (not
the XML format of OS X), using semicolons as
line-separators, and enclosing it in single quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ShowDependencies <br>
A boolean value which may be used to specify that the
program should log which files are being regenerated because
of their dependencies on other files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standards <br>
A boolean value used to specify whether the program should
insert information about standards complience into the
documentation. This should only be used when documenting
<br>
the GNUstep libraries and tools themselves as it assumes
that the code being documented is part of GNUstep and
possibly complies with the OpenStep standard or implements
Mac&acirc; <br>
OS-X compatible methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SystemProjects <br>
This value is used to control the automatic inclusion of
system external projects into the indexing system for
generation of cross-references in final document output. If
<br>
set to &rsquo;None&rsquo;, then no system project references
are done, otherwise, the &rsquo;System&rsquo; GNUstep
documentation directory is recursively searched for files
with a &rsquo;.igsdoc&rsquo; exten&acirc; <br>
sion, and the indexing information from those files is used.
The value of this string is also used to generate the
filenames in the cross reference ... if it is an empty <br>
string, the path to use is assumed to be a file in the same
directory where the igsdoc file was found, otherwise it is
used as a prefix to the name in the index. NB. System <br>
projects with the same name as the project currently being
documented will not be included by this mechanism. If you
wish to include such projects, you must do so explicitly
<br>
using -Projects ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TypedefsTemplate <br>
Specify the name of a template document into which
documentation about typedefs should be inserted from all
files in the project. This is useful if typedef source code
is <br>
scattered around many files, and you need to group it into
one place. You are responsible for ensuring that the basic
template document (into which individual typedef docu&acirc;
<br>
mentation is inserted) contains all the other information
you want, but as a convenience autogsdoc will generate a
simple template (which you may then edit) for you if the
<br>
file does not exist. Insertion takes place immediately
before the back element (or if that does not exist,
immediately before the end of the body element) in the
template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Up A string used to supply the
name to be used in the &rsquo;up&rsquo; link from generated
GSDoc documents. This should normally be the name of a file
which contains an index of the con&acirc; <br>
tents of a project. If this is missing or set to an empty
string, then no &rsquo;up&rsquo; link will be provided in
the documents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VariablesTemplate <br>
Specify the name of a template document into which
documentation about variables should be inserted from all
files in the project. This is useful if variable source code
is <br>
scattered around many files, and you need to group it into
one place. You are responsible for ensuring that the basic
template document (into which individual variable
docu&acirc; <br>
mentation is inserted) contains all the other information
you want, but as a convenience autogsdoc will generate a
simple template (which you may then edit) for you if the
<br>
file does not exist. Insertion takes place immediately
before the back element (or if that does not exist,
immediately before the end of the body element) in the
template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verbose <br>
A boolean used to specify whether you want verbose
debug/warning output to be produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warn <br>
A boolean used to specify whether you want standard warning
output (e.g. report of undocumented methods) produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WordMap <br>
This value is a dictionary used to map identifiers/keywords
found in the source files to other words. Generally you will
not have to use this, but it is sometimes helpful <br>
to avoid the parser being confused by the use of C
preprocessor macros. You can effectively redefine the macro
to something less confusing. The value you map the
identifier <br>
to must be one of - Another identifier, An empty string -
the value is ignored, Two slashes (&rsquo;//&rsquo;) - the
rest of the line is ignored. Note that a dictionary may be
given on <br>
the command line by using the standard PropertyList format
(not the XML format of OS X), using semicolons as
line-separators, and enclosing it in single quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTER-DOCUMENT LINKAGE <br>
The &rsquo;Up&rsquo; default is used to specify the name of
a document which should be used as the &rsquo;up&rsquo; link
for any other documents used. This name must not include a
path or extension. <br>
Generally, the document referred to by this default should
be a hand-edited GSDoc document which should have a
&lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; section containing a project
index. e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;?xml
version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt; <br>
&lt;!DOCTYPE gsdoc PUBLIC &quot;-//GNUstep//DTD gsdoc

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
Autogsdoc combined the capabilities of two earlier tools,
&rsquo;autodoc&rsquo; and &rsquo;gsdoc&rsquo;, which
performed the source-&gt;GSDoc and GSDoc-&gt;HTML
translations respectively. These earlier tools <br>
and the GSDoc format were developed for GNUstep based on the
earlier GDML SGML language.</p>
