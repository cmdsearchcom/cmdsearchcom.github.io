The autogsdoc tool is a command-line utility that helps developers produce
  reference documentation for GNUstep APIs. It also enables developers to write
  and maintain other documentation in XML and have it converted to HTML. In
  detail, autogsdoc will:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Extract special comments describing the public interfaces
      of classes, categories, protocols, functions, and macros from Objective C
      source code (header files and optionally source files) into GSDoc XML
      files.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Convert GSDoc XML files, whether generated from source code
      or written manually by developers, into HTML.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Construct indices based on GSDoc XML file sets, and convert
      those to HTML as well.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The most common usage this is to run the command with one or more header file
  names as arguments ... the tool will automatically parse corresponding source
  files in the same directory as the headers (or the current directory, or the
  directory specified using the DocumentationDirectory default), and produce
  GSDoc and HTML files as output. For best results this mode should be run from
  the directory containing the source files. (Note that since C is a subset of
  Objective C, this tool can operate to document functions and other C
  structures in plain C source.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
GSDoc files may also be given directly in addition or by themselves, and will be
  converted to HTML. See the GSDoc HTML documentation or the gsdoc(7) man page
  for information on the GSDoc format.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, HTML files may be given on the command line. Cross-references to other
  parts of code documentation found within them will be rewritten based on what
  is found in the project currently.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SOURCE_CODE_MARKUP"><a class="selflink" href="#SOURCE_CODE_MARKUP">SOURCE
  CODE MARKUP</a></h1>
The source code parser will automatically produce GSDoc documents listing the
  methods in the classes found in the source files, and it will include text
  from specially formatted comments from the source files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any comment beginning with slash and <i>two</i> asterisks rather than the common
  slash and single asterisk, is taken to be GSDoc markup, to be use as the
  description of the class or method following it. This comment text is
  reformatted and then inserted into the output.
<div style="margin-left: 0.00ex;">Where multiple comments are associated with
  the same item, they are joined together with a line break (&lt;br/&gt;)
  between each if necessary.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The tool can easily be used to document programs as well as libraries, simply by
  giving it the name of the source file containing the main() function of the
  program - it takes the special comments from that function and handles them
  specially, inserting them as a section at the end of the first chapter of the
  document (it creates the first chapter if necessary).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Options</b> are described in the section <i>Arguments and Defaults</i> below.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXTRA_MARKUP"><a class="selflink" href="#EXTRA_MARKUP">EXTRA
  MARKUP</a></h1>
There are some cases where special extra processing is performed, predominantly
  in the first comment found in the source file, from which various chunks of
  GSDoc markup may be extracted and placed into appropriate locations in the
  output document -
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>AutogsdocSource:</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In any line where <i>AutogsdocSource:</i> is found, the
      remainder of the line is taken as a source file name to be used instead of
      making the assumption that each .h file processed uses a .m file of the
      same name. You may supply multiple <i>AutogsdocSource:</i> lines where a
      header file declares items which are defined in multiple source files. If
      a file name is absolute, it is used just as supplied. If on the other
      hand, it is a relative path, the software looks for the source file first
      relative to the location of the header file, and if not found there,
      relative to the current directory in which autogsdoc is running, and
      finally relative to the directory specified by the
      <i>DocumentationDirectory</i> default.</dd>

      - Any line of the form <small>'Author:</small> name
      &lt;email-address&gt;', or <small>'By:</small> name
      &lt;email-address&gt;', or <small>'Author:</small> name' or

<b>NB</b> The markup just described may be used within class, category, or
  protocol documentation ... if so, it is extracted and wrapped round the rest
  of the documentation for the class as the class's chapter. The rest of the

  instead be substituted in in place of the &lt;unit&gt; pseudo-element within
  the &lt;chapter&gt; element.

In comments being used to provide text for a method description, the following

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>&lt;init&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The method is marked as being the designated initialiser

Generally, the text in comments is reformatted to standardise and indent it
  nicely ... the reformatting is <i>not</i> performed on any text inside an
  &lt;example&gt; element. When the text is reformatted, it is broken into
  whitespace separated &#x201C;words&#x201D; which are then subjected to some
  extra processing ...
<dl class="Bl-tag">

      the quotes) would be wrapped in a GSDoc reference element to point to the
      init method of the current class or, if only one known class had an init
      method, it would refer to the method of that class. Note the fact that the
      method name must be surrounded by whitespace to be recognized (though a
      comma, fullstop, or semicolon at the end of the specifier will act like

      the init method of NSObject (either the class proper, or any of its
      categories), while '[(NSCopying)-copyWithZone:]', creates a reference to a
      method in the NSCopying protocol. Note that no spaces must appear between
      the square brackets in these specifiers. Protocol names are enclosed in
      round brackets rather than the customary angle brackets, because GSDoc is

The tool accepts certain user defaults (which can of course be supplied as

  the value afterwards, as in -Clean YES):
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Clean</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If this boolean value is set to YES, then rather than
      generating documentation, the tool removes all GSDoc files generated in
      the project, and all html files generated from them (as well as any which
      would be generated from GSDoc files listed explicitly), and finally
      removes the project index file. The only exception to this is that
      template GSDoc files (i.e. those specified using &quot;-ConstantsTemplate
      ...&quot;, &quot;-FunctionsTemplate ...&quot; arguments etc) are not
      deleted unless the CleanTemplates flag is set.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">This flag specifies whether template GSDoc files are to be

      responsible for ensuring that the basic template document (into which
      individual constant documentation is inserted) contains all the other
      information you want, but as a convenience autogsdoc will generate a
      simple template (which you may then edit) for you if the file does not

      this default is not specified, the full name of the header file (as
      supplied on the command line), with the HeaderDirectory default prepended,
      is used. A typical usage of this might be '&quot;-Declared

  <dd class="It-tag">This value is used to control the automatic inclusion of
      system external projects into the indexing system for generation of
      cross-references in final document output. If set to 'None', then no
      system project references are done, otherwise, the 'System' GNUstep
      documentation directory is recursively searched for files with a '.igsdoc'
      extension, and the indexing information from those files is used. The
      value of this string is also used to generate the filenames in the cross
      reference ... if it is an empty string, the path to use is assumed to be a
      file in the same directory where the igsdoc file was found, otherwise it
      is used as a prefix to the name in the index. NB. System projects with the
      same name as the project currently being documented will <i>not</i> be
      included by this mechanism. If you wish to include such projects, you must
      do so explicitly using <i>-Projects ...</i></dd>

      ensuring that the basic template document (into which individual typedef
      documentation is inserted) contains all the other information you want,
      but as a convenience autogsdoc will generate a simple template (which you
      may then edit) for you if the file does not exist. Insertion takes place

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>WordMap</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This value is a dictionary used to map identifiers/keywords
      found in the source files to other words. Generally you will not have to
      use this, but it is sometimes helpful to avoid the parser being confused
      by the use of C preprocessor macros. You can effectively redefine the
      macro to something less confusing. The value you map the identifier to
      must be one of - Another identifier, An empty string - the value is
      ignored, Two slashes ('//') - the rest of the line is ignored. Note that a
      dictionary may be given on the command line by using the standard
      PropertyList format (not the XML format of OS X), using semicolons as
      line-separators, and enclosing it in single quotes.

The 'Up' default is used to specify the name of a document which should be used
  as the 'up' link for any other documents used. This name must not include a
  path or extension. Generally, the document referred to by this default should
  be a hand-edited GSDoc document which should have a &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt;

Autogsdoc combined the capabilities of two earlier tools, 'autodoc' and 'gsdoc',
  which performed the source-&gt;GSDoc and GSDoc-&gt;HTML translations
  respectively. These earlier tools and the GSDoc format were developed for
  GNUstep based on the earlier GDML SGML language.
