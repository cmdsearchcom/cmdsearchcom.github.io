<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dncopy - Copy files to/from a VMS system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dncopy [options] source dest <br>
dncopy [options] source... directory <br>
dntype source... <br>
Options: <br>
[-vdisklEVh] [-m mode] [-a record attributes] [-r record
format] [-b block size] [-p VMS protection]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dncopy copies files to and from VMS systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files on VMS systems should be
specified in the usual transparent DECnet format of
node&quot;username password&quot;::[directory]file. To
protect quotes and dollar signs from shell expan&acirc; <br>
sion I recommend that all VMS file specifications be
enclosed in single quotes (see EXAMPLES below). If you
don&rsquo;t want to type the password on the command-line
then put a hyphen <br>
(&quot;-&quot;) in its place and you will be prompted for
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dncopy can copy single files and
multiple files. If multiple files are copied the destination
must be a directory but it may be on the local Linux system
or a VMS system. The <br>
files to be copied can be a mixture of VMS files and local
files (yes, you can copy from VMS to VMS with this program,
though quite why you would want to I&rsquo;m not sure)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wildcards are supported for
local and VMS files (of course local wildcards are expanded
by the shell). Remember to use VMS wildcards (*%) on VMS
filesystems and Unix wildcards <br>
(*? etc) on Unix files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pseudo-filename
&rsquo;-&rsquo; may be used to represent standard input or
standard output to enable dncopy to be used in a pipeline.
Filenames are changed to lower case when copied <br>
from VMS to Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment DNCOPY_OPTIONS
may be used to provide a default set of options for copying
files. If (for example) you wanted to normally send files as
blocks rather than records <br>
you could set DNCOPY_OPTIONS=&quot;-mblock&quot;. Then, to
send a file as records you would need to type dncopy
-mrecord myfile.txt vmsbox:: instead. <br>
Options in DNCOPY_OPTIONS may be overridden by options typed
on the command-line except where there is no negating option
available (see -k -d -i ). If you put these options in <br>
DNCOPY_OPTIONS then to remove them you will have to override
the whole environment variable eg: <br>
$ DNCOPY_OPTIONS=&quot;&quot; dncopy myfile.txt vmsbox::</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dntype is simply a version of
dncopy where the output file is forced to &quot;-&quot;.
Thus it takes all the same options as dncopy. It is merely a
convenience.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v Verbose operation. The more -v options are present the
more verbose dncopy will become. One -v is roughly
equivalent to the /LOG qualifier on the DCL copy command.
More <br>
than one is really just useful for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Interactive operation.
Prompts before copying a file. This option is roughly
equivalent to the /CONFIRM qualifier on the DCL copy
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Ignore interlocks on files
copied from VMS. This will do its best to read the data
regardless of record or file locking, but it won&rsquo;t
always succeed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Show transfer statistics.
This shows the throughput of all copies (in the case of
wildcard transfers) undertaken in K bytes/second. This time
does not include that to <br>
establish the connection. eg when sending to VMS the
overhead of creating a NETSERVER process is not
included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Keep version numbers on files
copied from VMS systems. By default dncopy will strip the
version number from files because they have no meaning in
Linux. if you specify -k <br>
on the command line then the VMS file will be created with
exactly the same name as it had on the VMS system. To access
these files under Linux you will need to enclose <br>
them in quotes. eg less &quot;vmsfile.txt;1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m {record|block} <br>
Sets the transfer mode to block or record. record is the
default. Normally record is what you want but block is used
for sending binary files to the VMS system. Note that <br>
if you use -mblock to pull files from VMS you may not be
able to make sense of the file on Linux because dncopy will
also pull all the VMS internal structuring of the file <br>
as well as the data. Unless you really know what you are
doing -mblock is only really useful for sending files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a {none|ftn|cr|prn} <br>
Sets the carriage control attributes for files copied to a
VMS system. The default is cr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r {fix|var|vfc|stm} <br>
Sets the record format for files copied to a VMS system. The
default is stm. In fact the default is STREAMLF as this
corresponds to the format of files on Unix systems <br>
and so is the least likely to result in file corruption. If
you are sending a pure text file then var or vfc may be more
appropriate for your application. fix may be <br>
useful for block-structures files and data files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b N Set the block size for
transfers. The default is high enough for all record
structured files. if you are sending a file with -mblock
then you should use this to set the <br>
block size of the file to be created at the VMS end. When
sending block files the default changes to 512 as this is
typically what you would want (I hope).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Remove any trailing CR
characters at the end of a line. This is useful for sending
DOS files to VMS. Only works when transferring in record
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p &rsquo;protection&rsquo; <br>
When sending files to VMS, sets the protection of the newly
created remote file. Without this option, VMS will set the
protection to be the default for the remote user. <br>
The protection should be in VMS-style format and enclosed in
single quotes to protect it from the shell (see example).
<br>
This option is ignored when copying from VMS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Queue the file for printing
to SYS$PRINT when it arrives at the VMS end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Delete the file when it is
closed. This is only really useful in conjunction with
-P.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T connect timeout <br>
Specifies the maximum amount of time the command will wait
to establish a connection with the remote node. a 0 here
will cause it to wait forever. The default is 60 sec&acirc;
<br>
onds</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Ignore errors opening output
files. This is handy if you are sending a lot of Unix files
to VMS, some of which have illegal filenames (eg ~ backup
files). dncopy will <br>
report an error for each file but continue sending.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h -? Displays help for using
the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Show the version of the tools
package that dncopy comes from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE <br>
You can put your most commonly used defaults in the
environment variable DNCOPY_OPTIONS eg:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bash or ksh: <br>
$ DNCOPY_OPTIONS=&quot;-mblock -anone -b1024&quot; ; export
DNCOPY_OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">csh or tcsh: <br>
$ setenv DNCOPY_OPTIONS &quot;-mblock -anone
-b1024&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makes dncopy send files as 1024
byte blocks with no carriage control. You can override these
options by specifying replacements on the command-line as
usual. Be aware that some <br>
options have no converse (eg -i -k -d -v) so if you put
these in DNCOPY_OPTIONS you cannot disable them without
deassigning the variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Copy LOGIN.COM from the VMS system &quot;tramp&quot; to
Linux as mylogin.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dncopy
&rsquo;tramp&quot;christine pjc123&quot;::login.com&rsquo;
mylogin.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copy all .TXT files from the VMS
directory SYS$SYSDEVICE:[WP] to /tmp:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dncopy
&rsquo;tramp&quot;christine
pjc123&quot;::sys$sysdevice:[wp]*.txt&rsquo; /tmp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copy an executable to VMS:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dncopy -mblock test.exe
&rsquo;tramp&quot;christine pjc123&quot;::[.BIN]&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copy a file to VMS and set its
protection</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dncopy secret.dat marsha:: -p
(s:, o:rwed, g:re, w:)&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display the contents of
LOGIN.COM:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dtype
&rsquo;trisha&quot;christine -&quot;::login.com&rsquo; <br>
You will then be prompted for a password</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HELPFUL HINTS <br>
For fetching files the defaults should serve for most
purposes. Most VMS files are record orientated and -mrecord
is the default transfer mode. It is rare you will need to
fetch <br>
files using -mblock because you will get all the record
control information downloaded too and that probably
isn&rsquo;t any use to you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sending files is more complex
because VMS supports far more attributes than Linux so you
will need to know something about the file you are sending.
Text files should be OK with <br>
the defaults unless you need to change the format from the
default STREAMLF to VFC or VAR. Carriage control can also be
specified if you want to be that picky.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Binary files may often need to
be sent -mblock to be useful at the VMS end, You will
probably want to specify a block size with the -b option.
The default is 512 which is fairly <br>
useful but if you are sending (say) a saveset 8192 or 32256
may be required. Trial-and-error may be the only way in some
cases unless you know the file contents very well. If <br>
you really don&rsquo;t know what to do, just send it -mblock
and use the set file/attr command to massage it on the VMS
end until you are happy with it. (If you are using VMS
earlier <br>
than 6.1 then you will need the freeware FILE utility to do
this)</p>
