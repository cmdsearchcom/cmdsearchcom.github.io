<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
TeXsis - TeX macros for Physicists</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
texsis [ filename ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
TeXsis is a collection of TeX macros for typesetting physics
documents such as papers and preprints, conference
proceedings, books, theses, referee reports, letters, and
memos. <br>
TeXsis macros provide automatic numbering of equations,
automatic numbering and formatting of references, double
column formatting, macros for making tables and figures,
with or <br>
without captions, including tables with horizontal and
vertical rules. TeXsis supports a wide variety of type sizes
and a number of specialized document formats, and it even
<br>
includes macros for making form letters for job applications
or letters of recommendation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TeXsis is an extension of
&quot;plain&quot; TeX, so anything you know how to do in
plain TeX you can do in TeXsis. TeXsis macro instructions
are simply abbreviations for often used combi&acirc; <br>
nations of control sequences used to typeset physics
documents. For more information about plain TeX see the man
pages for tex(1), and/or The TeXbook, by D.E. Knuth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TeXsis is stored as a pre-loaded
format so that it loads quickly (see the man pages for
initex(1), and/or &quot;preloaded formats&quot; in The
TeXbook ). To run TeXsis simply give the <br>
command texsis in place of the tex command, i.e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">texsis [ filename ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where filename.tex is the name
of a file containing TeX and/or TeXsis <br>
TeXsis is initally in plain TeX mode, i.e. 10pt type and
singlespaced, but the control sequence exsis selects 12pt
type, doublespacing, and enables other useful features. <br>
Alternatively, aper turns on these features and sets things
up to typeset a paper, hesis does the same for typesetting a
thesis, ter is used to produce a letter using <br>
macros similar to those listed in the back of The TeXbook,
mo gives a setup for producing memoranda, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A manual which describes all of
the TeXsis macro instructions is available. It is written in
TeXsis, so it serves as its own example of how to write a
document with TeXsis. The <br>
source code is also heavily commented, so it is possible to
extract useful macros from the source code and modify them
to suit your own purposes. Provisions are made for local
<br>
customization of TeXsis. In particular, the file
TXSmods.tex, if it exists, is read from the current
directory or from the path TEXINPUTS whenever TeXsis is
started. You can <br>
therefore put your own custom macros for a given project in
a directory and they will automatically be loaded when
TeXsis is run from that directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
There is an appendix to the printed manual containing
detailed installation instructions, but they are also
provided in a form which can be processed by plain TeX, in
the file <br>
Install.tex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
TeXsis informational messages are written to the terminal
and the log file begining with &lsquo;% &rsquo;. Warning and
error messages begin with &lsquo;&gt; &rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
The source files for TeXsis and the TeXsis manual are
usually installed in the same place the rest of TeX is kept.
Although this may vary from intallation to installation, it
<br>
will generally include a root directory named texmf. Common
examples are /usr/share/texmf/, /usr/lib/teTeX/texmf, or
/usr/local/lib/texmf. Filenames here are relative to this
<br>
texmf root directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">web2c/texsis.fmt TeXsis
pre-loaded format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tex/texsis/TXS*.tex TeXsis
source code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tex/texsis/*.txs
&quot;Style&quot; files which can be read in at run time for
special document formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">doc/texsis/TXS*.doc Source for
the printed TeXsis manual (written in TeXsis).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tex/texsis/TXSsite.tex Local
site customization instructions (this is read only once,
when the format file is created).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tex/texsis/TXSpatch.tex Run time
patch file (like a system TeXsis.rc file, it is read every
time TeXsis is run).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TXSmods.tex Run time init file
(this is read every time TeXsis is run from the current
directory, or from the search path in TEXINPUTS ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
Please note that TeXsis is designed to be completely
compatible with plain TeX. As a result it cannot be
compatible with LaTeX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Having the full manual written
in TeXsis can cause a problem if you don&rsquo;t have a
version of TeXsis already running. To get around this you
can run Manual.tex through plain TeX <br>
and it will load the TeXsis files before processing the
manual. This takes longer, but not by much.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Please report bugs (or suggestions for improvements) to
texsis@feynman.physics.lsa.umich.edu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patchs to correct small problems
or make small improvements are available at</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp://feynman.physics.lsa.umich.edu/texsis/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in the file TXSpatch.tex (If
that file doesn&rsquo;t exist then there are no current
patches.)</p>
