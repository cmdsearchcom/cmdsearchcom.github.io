<p>DNSDIST(1) DNSDIST(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dnsdist - tool to balance DNS queries over downstream
servers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dnsdist [OPTION]... ADDRESS...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dnsdist receives DNS queries and relays them to one or more
downstream servers. It subsequently sends back responses to
the original requestor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dnsdist operates over TCP and
UDP, and strives to deliver very high performance over
both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, queries are sent to
the downstream server with the least outstanding queries.
This effectively implies load balancing, making sure that
slower servers get less <br>
queries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a reply has not come in after
a few seconds, it is removed from the queue, but in the
short term, timeouts do cause a server to get less
traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPv4 and IPv6 operation can be
mixed and matched, in other words, queries coming in over
IPv6 could be forwarded to IPv4 and vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dnsdist is scriptable in Lua,
see the dnsdist documentation for more information on
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCOPE <br>
dnsdist does not &rsquo;think&rsquo; about DNS queries, it
restricts itself to measuring response times and error codes
and routing questions accordingly. It comes with a very high
perfor&acirc; <br>
mance packet-cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The goal for dnsdist is to
remain simple. If more powerful loadbalancing is required,
dedicated hardware or software is recommended. Linux Virtual
Server for example is often <br>
mentioned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a,--acl NETMASK <br>
Add NETMASK to the ACL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C,--config FILE <br>
Load configuration from FILE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check-config <br>
Test the configuration file (which may be set with --config
or -C) for errors. dnsdist will show the errors and exit
with a non-zero exit-code when errors are found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c,--client [ADDRESS[:PORT]]
<br>
Operate as a client, connect to dnsdist. This will read the
dnsdist configuration for the controlSocket statement and
connect to it. When ADDRESS (with optional PORT) is <br>
set, dnsdist will connect to that instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k,--setkey KEY <br>
When operating as a client(-c, --client), use KEY as shared
secret to connect to dnsdist. This should be the same key
that is used on the server (set with setKey()). <br>
Note that this will leak the key into your shell&rsquo;s
history. Only available when dnsdist is compiled with
libsodium support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d,--daemon <br>
Operate as a daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e,--execute CMD <br>
Connect to dnsdist and execute CMD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h,--help <br>
Display a helpful message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l,--local ADDRESS <br>
Bind to ADDRESS, Supply as many addresses (using multiple
--local statements) to listen on as required. Specify IPv4
as 0.0.0.0:53 and IPv6 as [::]:53.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--supervised <br>
Run in foreground, but do not spawn a console. Use this
switch to run dnsdist inside a supervisor (use with e.g.
systemd and daemontools).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-syslog <br>
Disable logging to syslog. Use this when running inside a
supervisor that handles logging (like systemd). Do not use
in combination with --daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p,--pidfile FILE <br>
Write a pidfile to FILE, works only with --daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u,--uid UID <br>
Change the process user to UID after binding sockets. UID
can be a name or number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g,--gid GID <br>
Change the process group to GID after binding sockets. GID
Can be a name or number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V,--version <br>
Show the dnsdist version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v,--verbose <br>
Be verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADDRESS <br>
Any number of downstream DNS servers, in the same syntax as
used with --local. If the port is not specified, 53 is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Right now, the TCP support has some rather arbitrary
limits.</p>
