<p>PMLOGREWRITE(1) General Commands Manual
PMLOGREWRITE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmlogrewrite - rewrite Performance Co-Pilot archives</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmlogrewrite [-Cdiqsvw ] [-c config] inlog
[outlog]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmlogrewrite reads a set of Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
archive logs identified by inlog and creates a PCP archive
log in outlog. Under normal usage, the -c option will be
used <br>
to nominate a configuration file or files that contains
specifications (see the REWRITING RULES SYNTAX section
below) that describe how the data and metadata from inlog
should be <br>
transformed to produce outlog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The typical uses for
pmlogrewrite would be to accommodate the evolution of
Performance Metric Domain Agents (PMDAs) where the names,
metadata and semantics of metrics and their <br>
associated instance domains may change over time, e.g.
promoting the type of a metric from a 32-bit to a 64-bit
integer, or renaming a group of metrics. Refer to the
EXAMPLES <br>
section for some additional use cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmlogrewrite is most useful
where PMDA changes, or errors in the production environment,
result in archives that cannot be combined with
pmlogextract(1). By pre-processing the <br>
archives with pmlogrewrite the resulting archives may be
able to be merged with pmlogextract(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The input inlog must be a set of
PCP archive logs created by pmlogger(1), or possibly one of
the tools that read and create PCP archives, e.g.
pmlogextract(1) and pmlogre&acirc; <br>
duce(1). inlog is a comma-separated list of names, each of
which may be the base name of an archive or the name of a
directory containing one or more archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no -c option is specified,
then the default behavior simply creates outlog as a copy of
inlog. This is a little more complicated than cat(1), as
each PCP archive is made up <br>
of several physical files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While pmlogrewrite may be used
to repair some data consistency issues in PCP archives,
there is also a class of repair tasks that cannot be handled
by pmlogrewrite and <br>
pmloglabel(1) may be a useful tool in these cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
The command line options for pmlogrewrite are as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Parse the rewriting rules and
quit. outlog is not created. When -C is specified, this also
sets -v and -w so that all warnings and verbose messages are
displayed as con&acirc; <br>
fig is parsed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c config <br>
If config is a file or symbolic link, read and parse
rewriting rules from there. If config is a directory, then
all of the files or symbolic links in that directory <br>
(excluding those beginning with a period
&lsquo;&lsquo;.&rsquo;&rsquo;) will be used to provide the
rewriting rules. Multiple -c options are allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Desperate mode. Normally if a
fatal error occurs, all trace of the partially written PCP
archive outlog is removed. With the -d option, the partially
created outlog ar&acirc; <br>
chive log is not removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Rather than creating outlog,
inlog is rewritten in place when the -i option is used. A
new archive is created using temporary file names and then
renamed to inlog in such <br>
a way that if any errors (not warnings) are encountered,
inlog remains unaltered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quick mode, where if there
are no rewriting actions to be performed (none of the global
data, instance domains or metrics from inlog will be
changed), then pmlogrewrite <br>
will exit (with status 0, so success) immediately after
parsing the configuration file(s) and outlog is not
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s When the
&lsquo;&lsquo;units&rsquo;&rsquo; of a metric are changed,
if the dimension in terms of space, time and count is
unaltered, then the scaling factor is being changed, e.g.
BYTE to KBYTE, <br>
or MSEC-1 to USEC-1, or the composite MBYTE.SEC-1 to
KBYTE.USEC-1. The motivation may be (a) that the original
metadata was wrong but the values in inlog are correct, or
<br>
(b) the metadata is changing so the values need to change as
well. The default pmlogrewrite behaviour matches case (a).
If case (b) applies, then use the -s option and <br>
the values of all the metrics with a scale factor change in
each result will be rescaled. For finer control over value
rescaling refer to the RESCALE option for the UNITS <br>
clause of the metric rewriting rule described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Increase verbosity of
diagnostic output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Emit warnings. Normally
pmlogrewrite remains silent for any warning that is not
fatal and it is expected that for a particular archive, some
(or indeed, all) of the <br>
rewriting specifications may not apply. For example, changes
to a PMDA may be captured in a set of rewriting rules, but a
single archive may not contain all of the modi&acirc; <br>
fied metrics nor all of the modified instance domains and/or
instances. Because these cases are expected, they do not
prevent pmlogrewrite executing, and rules that do <br>
not apply to inlog are silently ignored by default.
Similarly, some rewriting rules may involve no change
because the metadata in inlog already matches the intent of
the <br>
rewriting rule to correct data from a previous version of a
PMDA. The -w flag forces warnings to be emitted for all of
these cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument outlog is required
in all cases, except when -i is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REWRITING RULES SYNTAX <br>
A configuration file contains zero or more rewriting rules
as defined below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keywords and special punctuation
characters are shown below in bolditalic font and are
case-insensitive, so METRIC, metric and Metric are all
equivalent in rewriting rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The character
&lsquo;&lsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo; introduces a comment and the
remainder of the line is ignored. Otherwise the input is
relatively free format with optional white space (spaces,
tabs or new&acirc; <br>
lines) between lexical items in the rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A global rewriting rule has the
form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLOBAL { globalspec ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where globalspec is zero or more
of the following clauses:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTNAME -&gt; hostname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modifies the label records in
the outlog PCP archive, so that the metrics will appear to
have been collected from the host hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIME -&gt; delta</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both metric values and the
instance domain metadata in a PCP archive carry timestamps.
This clause forces all the timestamps to be adjusted by
delta, where delta is an <br>
optional sign &lsquo;&lsquo;+&rsquo;&rsquo; (the default) or
&lsquo;&lsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo;, an optional number of hours
followed by a colon &lsquo;&lsquo;:&rsquo;&rsquo;, an
optional number of minutes followed by a colon
&lsquo;&lsquo;:&rsquo;&rsquo;, a number of <br>
seconds, an optional fraction of seconds following a period
&lsquo;&lsquo;.&rsquo;&rsquo;. The simplest example would be
&lsquo;&lsquo;30&rsquo;&rsquo; to increase the timestamps by
30 seconds. A more complex example <br>
would be &lsquo;&lsquo;-23:59:59.999&rsquo;&rsquo; to move
the timestamps backwards by one millisecond less than one
day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TZ -&gt;
&quot;timezone&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modifies the label records in
the outlog PCP archive, so that the metrics will appear to
have been collected from a host with a local timezone of
timezone. timezone must <br>
be enclosed in quotes, and should conform to the valid
timezone syntax rules for the local platform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An indom rewriting rule modifies
an instance domain and has the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INDOM domain.serial { indomspec
... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where domain and serial identify
one or more existing instance domains from inlog - typically
domain would be an integer in the range 1 to 510 and serial
would be an integer in <br>
the range 0 to 4194304.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special case serial could
be an asterisk &lsquo;&lsquo;*&rsquo;&rsquo; which means the
rule applies to every instance domain with a domain number
of domain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a designated instance domain
is not in inlog the rule has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The indomspec is zero or more of
the following clauses:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INAME &quot;oldname&quot; -&gt;
&quot;newname&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The instance identified by the
external instance name oldname is renamed to newname. Both
oldname and newname must be enclosed in quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special case, the new name
may be the keyword DELETE (with no quotes), and then the
instance oldname will be expunged from outlog which removes
it from the instance <br>
domain metadata and removes all values of this instance for
all the associated metrics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the instance names contain
any embedded spaces then special care needs to be taken in
respect of the PCP instance naming rule that treats the
leading non-space part of <br>
the instance name as the unique portion of the name for the
purposes of matching and ensuring uniqueness within an
instance domain, refer to pmdaInstance(3) for a
discus&acirc; <br>
sion of this issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an illustration, consider the
hypothetical instance domain for a metric which contains 2
instances with the following names: <br>
red <br>
eek urk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then some possible INAME clauses
might be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;eek&quot; -&gt;
&quot;yellow like a flower&quot; <br>
Acceptable, oldname &quot;eek&quot; matches the &quot;eek
urk&quot; instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;red&quot; -&gt;
&quot;eek&quot; <br>
Error, newname &quot;eek&quot; matches the existing
&quot;eek urk&quot; instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;eek urk&quot; -&gt;
&quot;red of another hue&quot; <br>
Error, newname &quot;red of another hue&quot; matches the
existing &quot;red&quot; instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INDOM -&gt;
newdomain.newserial</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modifies the metadata for the
instance domain and every metric associated with the
instance domain. As a special case, newserial could be an
asterisk &lsquo;&lsquo;*&rsquo;&rsquo; which means <br>
use serial from the indom rewriting rule, although this is
most useful when serial is also an asterisk. So for example:
<br>
indom 29.* { indom -&gt; 109.* } <br>
will move all instance domains from domain 29 to domain
109.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INDOM -&gt; DUPLICATE
newdomain.newserial</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A special case of the previous
INDOM clause where the instance domain is a duplicate copy
of the domain.serial instance domain from the indom
rewriting rule, and then any <br>
mapping rules are applied to the copied newdomain.newserial
instance domain. This is useful when a PMDA is split and the
same instance domain needs to be replicated for <br>
domain domain and domain newdomain. So for example if the
metrics foo.one and foo.two are both defined over instance
domain 12.34, and foo.two is moved to another PMDA <br>
using domain 27, then the following rewriting rules could be
used: <br>
indom 12.34 { indom -&gt; duplicate 27.34 } <br>
metric foo.two { indom -&gt; 27.34 pmid -&gt; 27.*.* }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INST oldid -&gt; newid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The instance identified by the
internal instance identifier oldid is renumbered to newid.
Both oldid and newid are integers in the range 0 to
231-1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special case, newid may be
the keyword DELETE and then the instance oldid will be
expunged from outlog which removes it from the instance
domain metadata and removes <br>
all values of this instance for all the associated
metrics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A metric rewriting rule has the
form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">METRIC metricid { metricspec ...
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where metricid identifies one or
more existing metrics from inlog using either a metric name,
or the internal encoding for a metric&rsquo;s PMID as
domain.cluster.item. In the latter <br>
case, typically domain would be an integer in the range 1 to
510, cluster would be an integer in the range 0 to 4095, and
item would be an integer in the range 0 to 1023.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As special cases item could be
an asterisk &lsquo;&lsquo;*&rsquo;&rsquo; which means the
rule applies to every metric with a domain number of domain
and a cluster number of cluster, or cluster could be <br>
an asterisk which means the rule applies to every metric
with a domain number of domain and an item number of item,
or both cluster and item could be asterisks, and rule
applies <br>
to every metric with a domain number of domain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a designated metric is not in
inlog the rule has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The metricspec is zero or more
of the following clauses:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DELETE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The metric is completely removed
from outlog, both the metadata and all values in results are
expunged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INDOM -&gt; newdomain.newserial
[ pick ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modifies the metadata to change
the instance domain for this metric. The new instance domain
must exist in outlog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional pick clause may be
used to select one input value, or compute an aggregate
value from the instances in an input result, or assign an
internal instance iden&acirc; <br>
tifier to a single output value. If no pick clause is
specified, the default behaviour is to copy all input values
from each input result to an output result, however if <br>
the input instance domain is singular (indom PM_INDOM_NULL)
then the one output value must be assigned an internal
instance identifier, which is 0 by default, unless <br>
over-ridden by a INST or INAME clause as defined below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The choices for pick are as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FIRST <br>
choose the value of the first instance from each input
result</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT LAST choose the value of
the last instance from each input result</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT INST instid <br>
choose the value of the instance with internal instance
identifier instid from each result; the sequence of
rewriting rules ensures the OUTPUT processing hap&acirc;
<br>
pens before instance identifier renumbering from any
associated indom rule, so instid should be one of the
internal instance identifiers that appears in inlog</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT INAME &quot;name&quot;
<br>
choose the value of the instance with name for its external
instance name from each result; the sequence of rewriting
rules ensures the OUTPUT processing hap&acirc; <br>
pens before instance renaming from any associated indom
rule, so name should be one of the external instance names
that appears in inlog</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT MIN choose the smallest
value in each result (metric type must be numeric and output
instance will be 0 for a non-singular instance domain)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT MAX choose the largest
value in each result (metric type must be numeric and output
instance will be 0 for a non-singular instance domain)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT SUM choose the sum of all
values in each result (metric type must be numeric and
output instance will be 0 for a non-singular instance
domain)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT AVG choose the average of
all values in each result (metric type must be numeric and
output instance will be 0 for a non-singular instance
domain)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the input instance domain is
singular (indom PM_INDOM_NULL) then independent of any pick
specifications, there is at most one value in each input
result and so FIRST, <br>
LAST, MIN, MAX, SUM and AVG are all equivalent and the
output instance identifier will be 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general it is an error to
specify a rewriting action for the same metadata or result
values more than once, e.g. more than one INDOM clause for
the same instance <br>
domain. The one exception is the possible interaction
between the INDOM clauses in the indom and metric rules. For
example the metric sample.bin is defined over the <br>
instance domain 29.2 in inlog and the following is
acceptable (albeit redundant): <br>
indom 29.* { indom -&gt; 109.* } <br>
metric sample.bin { indom -&gt; 109.2 } <br>
However the following is an error, because the instance
domain for sample.bin has two conflicting definitions: <br>
indom 29.* { indom -&gt; 109.* } <br>
metric sample.bin { indom -&gt; 123.2 }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INDOM -&gt; NULL[ pick ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The metric (which must have been
previously defined over an instance domain) is being
modified to be a singular metric. This involves a metadata
change and collapsing <br>
all results for this metric so that multiple values become
one value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional pick part of the
clause defines how the one value for each result should be
calculated and follows the same rules as described for the
non-NULL INDOM case <br>
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the absence of pick, the
default is OUTPUT FIRST.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME -&gt; newname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Renames the metric in the PCP
archive&rsquo;s metadata that supports the Performance
Metrics Name Space (PMNS). newname should not match any
existing name in the archive&rsquo;s <br>
PMNS and must follow the syntactic rules for valid metric
names as outlined in pmns(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PMID -&gt;
newdomain.newcluster.newitem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modifies the metadata and
results to renumber the metric&rsquo;s PMID. As special
cases, newcluster could be an asterisk
&lsquo;&lsquo;*&rsquo;&rsquo; which means use cluster from
the metric rewrit&acirc; <br>
ing rule and/or item could be an asterisk which means use
item from the metric rewriting rule. This is most useful
when cluster and/or item is also an asterisk. So for <br>
example: <br>
metric 30.*.* { pmid -&gt; 123.*.* } <br>
will move all metrics from domain 30 to domain 123.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEM -&gt; newsem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change the semantics of the
metric. newsem should be the XXX part of the name of one of
the PM_SEM_XXX macros defined in &lt;pcp/pmapi.h&gt; or
pmLookupDesc(3), e.g. COUNTER <br>
for PM_TYPE_COUNTER.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No data value rewriting is
performed as a result of the SEM clause, so the usefulness
is limited to cases where a version of the associated PMDA
was exporting incorrect <br>
semantics for the metric. pmlogreduce(1) may provide an
alternative in cases where re-computation of result values
is desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TYPE -&gt; newtype</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change the type of the metric
which alters the metadata and may change the encoding of
values in results. newtype should be the XXX part of the
name of one of the <br>
PM_TYPE_XXX macros defined in &lt;pcp/pmapi.h&gt; or
pmLookupDesc(3), e.g. FLOAT for PM_TYPE_FLOAT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Type conversion is only
supported for cases where the old and new metric type is
numeric, so PM_TYPE_STRING, PM_TYPE_AGGREGATE and
PM_TYPE_EVENT are not allowed. Even <br>
for the numeric cases, some conversions may produce run-time
errors, e.g. integer overflow, or attempting to rewrite a
negative value into an unsigned type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNITS -&gt; newunits [ RESCALE
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newunits is six values separated
by commas. The first 3 values describe the dimension of the
metric along the dimensions of space, time and count; these
are integer val&acirc; <br>
ues, usually 0, 1 or -1. The remaining 3 values describe the
scale of the metric&rsquo;s values in the dimensions of
space, time and count. Space scale values should be 0 (if
<br>
the space dimension is 0), else the XXX part of the name of
one of the PM_SPACE_XXX macros, e.g. KBYTE for
PM_TYPE_KBYTE. Time scale values should be 0 (if the time
<br>
dimension is 0), else the XXX part of the name of one of the
PM_TIME_XXX macros, e.g. SEC for PM_TIME_SEC. Count scale
values should be 0 (if the time dimension is 0), <br>
else ONE for PM_COUNT_ONE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PM_SPACE_XXX, PM_TIME_XXX
and PM_COUNT_XXX macros are defined in &lt;pcp/pmapi.h&gt;
or pmLookupDesc(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the scale is changed (but
the dimension is unaltered) the optional keyword RESCALE may
be used to chose value rescaling as per the -s command line
option, but <br>
applied to just this metric.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When changing the domain number
for a metric or instance domain, the new domain number will
usually match an existing PMDA&rsquo;s domain number. If
this is not the case, then the <br>
new domain number should not be randomly chosen; consult
$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/stdpmid for domain numbers that are
already assigned to PMDAs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To promote the values of the per-disk IOPS metrics to 64-bit
to allow aggregation over a long time period for capacity
planning, or because the PMDA has changed to export 64-bit
<br>
counters and we want to convert old archives so they can be
processed alongside new archives. <br>
metric disk.dev.read { type -&gt; U64 } <br>
metric disk.dev.write { type -&gt; U64 } <br>
metric disk.dev.total { type -&gt; U64 }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The instances associated with
the load average metric kernel.all.load could be renamed and
renumbered by the rules below. <br>
# for the Linux PMDA, the kernel.all.load metric is defined
<br>
# over instance domain 60.2 <br>
indom 60.2 { <br>
inst 1 -&gt; 60 iname &quot;1 minute&quot; -&gt; &quot;60
second&quot; <br>
inst 5 -&gt; 300 iname &quot;5 minute&quot; -&gt; &quot;300
second&quot; <br>
inst 15 -&gt; 900 iname &quot;15 minute&quot; -&gt;
&quot;900 second&quot; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If we decide to split the
&lsquo;&lsquo;proc&rsquo;&rsquo; metrics out of the Linux
PMDA, this will involve changing the domain number for the
PMID of these metrics and the associated instance domains.
<br>
The rules below would rewrite an old archive to match the
changes after the PMDA split. <br>
# all Linux proc metrics are in 7 clusters <br>
metric 60.8.* { pmid -&gt; 123.*.* } <br>
metric 60.9.* { pmid -&gt; 123.*.* } <br>
metric 60.13.* { pmid -&gt; 123.*.* } <br>
metric 60.24.* { pmid -&gt; 123.*.* } <br>
metric 60.31.* { pmid -&gt; 123.*.* } <br>
metric 60.32.* { pmid -&gt; 123.*.* } <br>
metric 60.51.* { pmid -&gt; 123.*.* } <br>
# only one instance domain for Linux proc metrics <br>
indom 60.9 { indom -&gt; 123.0 }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
For each of the inlog and outlog archive logs, several
physical files are used. <br>
archive.meta <br>
metadata (metric descriptions, instance domains, etc.) for
the archive log <br>
archive.0 initial volume of metrics values (subsequent
volumes have suffixes 1, 2, ...). <br>
archive.index <br>
temporal index to support rapid random access to the other
files in the archive log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
All error conditions detected by pmlogrewrite are reported
on stderr with textual (if sometimes terse) explanation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Should the input archive log be
corrupted (this can happen if the pmlogger instance writing
the log suddenly dies), then pmlogrewrite will detect and
report the position of the <br>
corruption in the file, and any subsequent information from
that archive log will not be processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any error is detected,
pmlogrewrite will exit with a non-zero status.</p>
