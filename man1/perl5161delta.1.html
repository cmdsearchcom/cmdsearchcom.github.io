<p>PERL5161DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL5161DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5161delta - what is new for perl v5.16.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.16.0
release and the 5.16.1 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.14.0, first read perl5160delta,
which describes differences between 5.14.0 and 5.16.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
an off-by-two error in Scalar-List-Util has been fixed <br>
The bugfix was in Scalar-List-Util 1.23_04, and perl 5.16.1
includes Scalar-List-Util 1.25.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.16.0
If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit
a report. See &quot;Reporting Bugs&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
Updated Modules and Pragmata <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Scalar::Util and List::Util have been
upgraded from version 1.23 to version 1.25.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; B::Deparse has
been updated from version 1.14 to 1.14_01. An
&quot;uninitialized&quot; warning emitted by B::Deparse has
been squashed [perl #113464].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration and Compilation
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; Building perl with some Windows compilers
used to fail due to a problem with miniperl&rsquo;s
&quot;glob&quot; operator (which uses the
&quot;perlglob&quot; program) deleting the PATH environment
<br>
variable [perl #113798].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Support <br>
Platform-Specific Notes <br>
VMS All C header files from the top-level directory of the
distribution are now installed on VMS, providing consistency
with a long-standing practice on other platforms. <br>
Previously only a subset were installed, which broke
non-core extension builds for extensions that depended on
the missing include files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; A regression introduced in Perl v5.16.0
involving &quot;tr/SEARCHLIST/REPLACEMENTLIST/&quot; has
been fixed. Only the first instance is supposed to be
meaningful if a character <br>
appears more than once in &quot;SEARCHLIST&quot;. Under some
circumstances, the final instance was overriding all earlier
ones. [perl #113584]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;B::COP::stashlen&quot; has been added. This provides
access to an internal field added in perl 5.16 under
threaded builds. It was broken at the last minute before
5.16 was <br>
released [perl #113034].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The re pragma
will no longer clobber $_. [perl #113750]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Unicode 6.1
published an incorrect alias for one of the
Canonical_Combining_Class property&rsquo;s values (which
range between 0 and 254). The alias &quot;CCC133&quot;
should have been <br>
&quot;CCC132&quot;. Perl now overrides the data file
furnished by Unicode to give the correct value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Duplicating
scalar filehandles works again. [perl #113764]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Under threaded
perls, a runtime code block in a regular expression could
corrupt the package name stored in the op tree, resulting in
bad reads in &quot;caller&quot;, and possibly <br>
crashes [perl #113060].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; For
efficiency&rsquo;s sake, many operators and built-in
functions return the same scalar each time. Lvalue
subroutines and subroutines in the CORE:: namespace were
allowing this <br>
implementation detail to leak through. &quot;print
&amp;CORE::uc(&quot;a&quot;),
&amp;CORE::uc(&quot;b&quot;)&quot; used to print
&quot;BB&quot;. The same thing would happen with an lvalue
subroutine returning the return <br>
value of &quot;uc&quot;. Now the value is copied in such
cases [perl #113044].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;__SUB__&quot; now works in special blocks
(&quot;BEGIN&quot;, &quot;END&quot;, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Formats that
reference lexical variables from outside no longer result in
crashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known Problems <br>
There are no new known problems, but consult &quot;Known
Problems&quot; in perl5160delta to see those identified in
the 5.16.0 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acknowledgements <br>
Perl 5.16.1 represents approximately 2 months of development
since Perl 5.16.0 and contains approximately 14,000 lines of
changes across 96 files from 8 authors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl continues to flourish into
its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and
developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that <br>
became Perl 5.16.1:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Chris &rsquo;BinGOs&rsquo;
Williams, Craig A. Berry, Father Chrysostomos, Karl
Williamson, Paul Johnson, Reini Urban, Ricardo Signes, Tony
Cook.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list above is almost
certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from
version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much <br>
appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl
bug tracker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the changes included in
this version originated in the CPAN modules included in
Perl&rsquo;s core. We&rsquo;re grateful to the entire CPAN
community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a more complete list of all
of Perl&rsquo;s historical contributors, please see the
AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . <br>
There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the
Perl Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the bug you are reporting has
security implications, which make it inappropriate to send
to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to
<br>
perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the
core committers, who will be able to help assess the impact
<br>
of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the
release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use <br>
this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for
modules independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
