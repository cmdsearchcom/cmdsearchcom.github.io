<p>RRDFETCH(1) rrdtool RRDFETCH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rrdfetch - Fetch data from an RRD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rrdtool fetch filename CF [--resolution|-r resolution]
[--start|-s start] [--end|-e end] [--daemon address]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The fetch function is normally used internally by the graph
function to get data from RRDs. fetch will analyze the RRD
and try to retrieve the data in the resolution requested.
<br>
The data fetched is printed to stdout. *UNKNOWN* data is
often represented by the string &quot;NaN&quot; depending on
your OS&rsquo;s printf function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename <br>
the name of the RRD you want to fetch the data from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CF the consolidation function
that is applied to the data you want to fetch
(AVERAGE,MIN,MAX,LAST)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resolution|-r resolution
(default is the highest resolution) <br>
the interval you want the values to have (seconds per
value). rrdfetch will try to match your request, but it will
return data even if no absolute match is possible. NB. <br>
See note below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--start|-s start (default
end-1day) <br>
start of the time series. A time in seconds since epoch
(1970-01-01) is required. Negative numbers are relative to
the current time. By default, one day worth of data <br>
will be fetched. See also AT-STYLE TIME SPECIFICATION
section for a detailed explanation on ways to specify the
start time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--end|-e end (default now) <br>
the end of the time series in seconds since epoch. See also
AT-STYLE TIME SPECIFICATION section for a detailed
explanation of how to specify the end time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--daemon address <br>
Address of the rrdcached daemon. If specified, a
&quot;flush&quot; command is sent to the server before
reading the RRD files. This allows rrdtool to return fresh
data even if the <br>
daemon is configured to cache values for a long time. For a
list of accepted formats, see the -l option in the rrdcached
manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rrdtool fetch --daemon
unix:/var/run/rrdcached.sock /var/lib/rrd/foo.rrd
AVERAGE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESOLUTION INTERVAL <br>
In order to get RRDtool to fetch anything other than the
finest resolution RRA both the start and end time must be
specified on boundaries that are multiples of the desired
<br>
resolution. Consider the following example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rrdtool create subdata.rrd -s 10
DS:ds0:GAUGE:300:0:U RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:30:3600
RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:90:1200 RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:360:1200
RRA:MAX:0.5:360:1200 RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:8640:600
RRA:MAX:0.5:8640:600</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This RRD collects data every 10
seconds and stores its averages over 5 minutes, 15 minutes,
1 hour, and 1 day, as well as the maxima for 1 hour and 1
day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consider now that you want to
fetch the 15 minute average data for the last hour. You
might try</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rrdtool fetch subdata.rrd
AVERAGE -r 900 -s -1h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, this will almost always
result in a time series that is NOT in the 15 minute RRA.
Therefore, the highest resolution RRA, i.e. 5 minute
averages, will be chosen which in <br>
this case is not what you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hence, make sure that</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. both start and end time are a
multiple of 900</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. both start and end time are
within the desired RRA</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So, if time now is called
&quot;t&quot;, do</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">end time == int(t/900)*900, <br>
start time == end time - 1hour, <br>
resolution == 900.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the bash shell, this could
look be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIME=$(date +%s) <br>
RRDRES=900 <br>
rrdtool fetch subdata.rrd AVERAGE -r $RRDRES -e
$(($TIME/$RRDRES*$RRDRES)) -s e-1h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or in Perl:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -e &rsquo;$ctime = time;
$rrdres = 900; system &quot;rrdtool fetch subdata.rrd
AVERAGE -r $rrdres -e @{[int($ctime/$rrdres)*$rrdres]} -s
e-1h&quot;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AT-STYLE TIME SPECIFICATION <br>
Apart from the traditional Seconds since epoch, RRDtool does
also understand at-style time specification. The
specification is called &quot;at-style&quot; after the Unix
command at(1) that <br>
has moderately complex ways to specify time to run your job
at a certain date and time. The at-style specification
consists of two parts: the TIME REFERENCE specification and
the <br>
TIME OFFSET specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIME REFERENCE SPECIFICATION
<br>
The time reference specification is used, well, to establish
a reference moment in time (to which the time offset is then
applied to). When present, it should come first, when <br>
omitted, it defaults to now. On its own part, time reference
consists of a time-of-day reference (which should come
first, if present) and a day reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The time-of-day can be specified
as HH:MM, HH.MM, or just HH. You can suffix it with am or pm
or use 24-hours clock. Some special times of day are
understood as well, including <br>
midnight (00:00), noon (12:00) and British teatime
(16:00).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The day can be specified as
month-name day-of-the-month and optional a 2- or 4-digit
year number (e.g. March 8 1999). Alternatively, you can use
day-of-week-name (e.g. Monday), <br>
or one of the words: yesterday, today, tomorrow. You can
also specify the day as a full date in several numerical
formats, including MM/DD/[YY]YY, DD.MM.[YY]YY, or
YYYYMMDD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE1: this is different from
the original at(1) behavior, where a single-number date is
interpreted as MMDD[YY]YY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE2: if you specify the day in
this way, the time-of-day is REQUIRED as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, you can use the words
now, start, end or epoch as your time reference. Now refers
to the current moment (and is also the default time
reference). Start (end) can be used <br>
to specify a time relative to the start (end) time for those
tools that use these categories (rrdfetch, rrdgraph) and
epoch indicates the *IX epoch (*IX timestamp 0 = 1970-01-01
<br>
00:00:00 UTC). epoch is useful to disambiguate between a
timestamp value and some forms of abbreviated date/time
specifications, because it allows to use time offset <br>
specifications using units, eg. epoch+19711205s
unambiguously denotes timestamp 19711205 and not 1971-12-05
00:00:00 UTC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Month and day of the week names
can be used in their naturally abbreviated form (e.g., Dec
for December, Sun for Sunday, etc.). The words now, start,
end can be abbreviated as n, <br>
s, e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIME OFFSET SPECIFICATION <br>
The time offset specification is used to add/subtract
certain time intervals to/from the time reference moment. It
consists of a sign (+ or -) and an amount. The following
time <br>
units can be used to specify the amount: years, months,
weeks, days, hours, minutes, or seconds. These units can be
used in singular or plural form, and abbreviated naturally
or <br>
to a single letter (e.g. +3days, -1wk, -3y). Several time
units can be combined (e.g., -5mon1w2d) or concatenated
(e.g., -5h45min = -5h-45min = -6h+15min = -7h+1h30m-15min,
etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE3: If you specify time
offset in days, weeks, months, or years, you will end with
the time offset that may vary depending on your time
reference, because all those time units <br>
have no single well defined time interval value (1 year
contains either 365 or 366 days, 1 month is 28 to 31 days
long, and even 1 day may be not equal to 24 hours twice a
year, <br>
when DST-related clock adjustments take place). To cope with
this, when you use days, weeks, months, or years as your
time offset units your time reference date is adjusted <br>
accordingly without too much further effort to ensure
anything about it (in the hope that mktime(3) will take care
of this later). This may lead to some surprising (or even
<br>
invalid!) results, e.g. &rsquo;May 31 -1month&rsquo; =
&rsquo;Apr 31&rsquo; (meaningless) = &rsquo;May 1&rsquo;
(after mktime(3) normalization); in the EET timezone
&rsquo;3:30am Mar 29 1999 -1 day&rsquo; yields &rsquo;3:30am
Mar 28 <br>
1999&rsquo; (Sunday) which is an invalid time/date
combination (because of 3am -&gt; 4am DST forward clock
adjustment, see the below example).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In contrast, hours, minutes, and
seconds are well defined time intervals, and these are
guaranteed to always produce time offsets exactly as
specified (e.g. for EET timezone, <br>
&rsquo;8:00 Mar 27 1999 +2 days&rsquo; = &rsquo;8:00 Mar 29
1999&rsquo;, but since there is 1-hour DST forward clock
adjustment that occurs around 3:00 Mar 28 1999, the actual
time interval between <br>
8:00 Mar 27 1999 and 8:00 Mar 29 1999 equals 47 hours; on
the other hand, &rsquo;8:00 Mar 27 1999 +48 hours&rsquo; =
&rsquo;9:00 Mar 29 1999&rsquo;, as expected)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE4: The single-letter
abbreviation for both months and minutes is m. To
disambiguate them, the parser tries to read your mind :) by
applying the following two heuristics:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If m is used in context of
(i.e. right after the) years, months, weeks, or days it is
assumed to mean months, while in the context of hours,
minutes, and seconds it means <br>
minutes. (e.g., in -1y6m or +3w1m m is interpreted as
months, while in -3h20m or +5s2m m the parser decides for
minutes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Out of context (i.e. right
after the + or - sign) the meaning of m is guessed from the
number it directly follows. Currently, if the number&rsquo;s
absolute value is below 25 it is <br>
assumed that m means months, otherwise it is treated as
minutes. (e.g., -25m == -25 minutes, while +24m == +24
months)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Final NOTES: Time specification
is case-insensitive. Whitespace can be inserted freely or
omitted altogether. There are, however, cases when
whitespace is required (e.g., <br>
&rsquo;midnight Thu&rsquo;). In this case you should either
quote the whole phrase to prevent it from being taken apart
by your shell or use &rsquo;_&rsquo; (underscore) or
&rsquo;,&rsquo; (comma) which also count <br>
as whitespace (e.g., midnight_Thu or midnight,Thu).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIME SPECIFICATION EXAMPLES <br>
Oct 12 -- October 12 this year</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1month or -1m -- current time
of day, only a month before (may yield surprises, see NOTE3
above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noon yesterday -3hours --
yesterday morning; can also be specified as 9am-1day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">23:59 31.12.1999 -- 1 minute to
the year 2000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">12/31/99 11:59pm -- 1 minute to
the year 2000 for imperialists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">12am 01/01/01 -- start of the
new millennium</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">end-3weeks or e-3w -- 3 weeks
before end time (may be used as start time
specification).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start+6hours or s+6h -- 6 hours
after start time (may be used as end time
specification).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">931225537 -- 18:45 July 5th,
1999 (yes, seconds since 1970 are valid as well).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">19970703 12:45 -- 12:45 July
3th, 1997 (my favorite, and its even got an ISO number
(8601)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables may be used to change
the behavior of &quot;rrdtool fetch&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RRDCACHED_ADDRESS <br>
If this environment variable is set it will have the same
effect as specifying the &quot;--daemon&quot; option on the
command line. If both are present, the command line argument
takes <br>
precedence.</p>
