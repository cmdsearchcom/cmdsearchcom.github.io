<p style="margin-top: 1em">This man page briefly describes
all Qhull options. Please report any mismatches with
Qhull&rsquo;s html manual (index.htm).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION <br>
Qhull is a general dimension code for computing convex
hulls, Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi diagram,
furthest&acirc;site Voronoi diagram, furthest&acirc;site
Delaunay triangulations, and <br>
halfspace intersections about a point. It implements the
Quickhull algorithm for computing the convex hull. Qhull
handles round&acirc;off errors from floating point
arithmetic. It <br>
can approximate a convex hull.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program includes options for
hull volume, facet area, partial hulls, input
transformations, randomization, tracing, multiple output
formats, and execution statistics. The <br>
program can be called from within your application. You can
view the results in 2&acirc;d, 3&acirc;d and 4&acirc;d with
Geomview.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The format of input is the following: first line contains
the dimension, second line contains the number of input
points, and point coordinates follow. The dimension and
number <br>
of points can be reversed. Comments and line breaks are
ignored. A comment starts with a non&acirc;numeric character
and continues to the end of line. The first comment is
reported <br>
in summaries and statistics. Error reporting is better if
there is one point per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default printout option is a
short summary. There are many other output formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qhull implements the Quickhull
algorithm for convex hull. This algorithm combines the
2&acirc;d Quickhull algorithm with the n&acirc;d
beneath&acirc;beyond algorithm [c.f., Preparata &amp; Shamos
<br>
&rsquo;85]. It is similar to the randomized algorithms of
Clarkson and others [Clarkson et al. &rsquo;93]. The main
advantages of Quickhull are output sensitive performance,
reduced space <br>
requirements, and automatic handling of precision
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The data structure produced by
Qhull consists of vertices, ridges, and facets. A vertex is
a point of the input set. A ridge is a set of d vertices and
two neighboring facets. <br>
For example in 3&acirc;d, a ridge is an edge of the
polyhedron. A facet is a set of ridges, a set of neighboring
facets, a set of incident vertices, and a hyperplane
equation. For <br>
simplicial facets, the ridges are defined by the vertices
and neighboring facets. When Qhull merges two facets, it
produces a non&acirc;simplicial facet. A
non&acirc;simplicial facet has <br>
more than d neighbors and may share more than one ridge with
a neighbor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPRECISION <br>
Since Qhull uses floating point arithmetic, roundoff error
may occur for each calculation. This causes problems for
most geometric algorithms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qhull automatically sets option
&rsquo;C-0&rsquo; in 2&acirc;d, 3&acirc;d, and 4&acirc;d, or
option &rsquo;Qx&rsquo; in 5&acirc;d and higher. These
options handle precision problems by merging facets.
Alternatively, use <br>
option &rsquo;QJ&rsquo; to joggle the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With &rsquo;C-0&rsquo;, Qhull
merges non&acirc;convex facets while constructing the hull.
The remaining facets are clearly convex. With
&rsquo;Qx&rsquo;, Qhull merges coplanar horizon facets,
flipped facets, <br>
concave facets and duplicated ridges. It merges coplanar
facets after constructing the hull. With &rsquo;Qx&rsquo;,
coplanar points may be missed, but it appears to be
unlikely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To guarantee triangular output,
joggle the input with option &rsquo;QJ&rsquo;. Facet merging
will not occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
To get a list of the most important options, execute
&rsquo;qhull&rsquo; by itself. To get a complete list of
options, execute &rsquo;qhull -&rsquo;. To get a complete,
concise list of options, exe&acirc; <br>
cute &rsquo;qhull .&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options can be in any order.
Capitalized options take an argument (except
&rsquo;PG&rsquo; and &rsquo;F&rsquo; options). Single
letters are used for output formats and precision constants.
The other <br>
options are grouped into menus for other output formats
(&rsquo;F&rsquo;), Geomview output (&rsquo;G&rsquo;),
printing (&rsquo;P&rsquo;), Qhull control (&rsquo;Q&rsquo;),
and tracing (&rsquo;T&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Main options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default <br>
Compute the convex hull of the input points. Report a
summary of the result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Compute the Delaunay
triangulation by lifting the input points to a paraboloid.
The &rsquo;o&rsquo; option prints the input points and
facets. The &rsquo;QJ&rsquo; option guarantees triangular
<br>
output. The &rsquo;Ft&rsquo; option prints a triangulation.
It adds points (the centrums) to non&acirc;simplicial
facets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v Compute the Voronoi diagram
from the Delaunay triangulation. The &rsquo;p&rsquo; option
prints the Voronoi vertices. The &rsquo;o&rsquo; option
prints the Voronoi vertices and the vertices in <br>
each Voronoi region. It lists regions in site ID order. The
&rsquo;Fv&rsquo; option prints each ridge of the Voronoi
diagram. The first or zero&rsquo;th vertex indicates the
infinity <br>
vertex. Its coordinates are qh_INFINITE (-10.101). It
indicates unbounded Voronoi regions or degenerate Delaunay
triangles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hn,n,... <br>
Compute halfspace intersection about [n,n,0,...]. The input
is a set of halfspaces defined in the same format as
&rsquo;n&rsquo;, &rsquo;Fo&rsquo;, and &rsquo;Fi&rsquo;. Use
&rsquo;Fp&rsquo; to print the intersection <br>
points. Use &rsquo;Fv&rsquo; to list the intersection points
for each halfspace. The other output formats display the
dual convex hull.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The point [n,n,n,...] is a
feasible point for the halfspaces, i.e., a point that is
inside all of the halfspaces (Hx+b &lt;= 0). The default
coordinate value is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The input may start with a
feasible point. If so, use &rsquo;H&rsquo; by itself. The
input starts with a feasible point when the first number is
the dimension, the second number is <br>
&quot;1&quot;, and the coordinates complete a line. The
&rsquo;FV&rsquo; option produces a feasible point for a
convex hull.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Qu Compute the
furthest&acirc;site Delaunay triangulation from the upper
convex hull. The &rsquo;o&rsquo; option prints the input
points and facets. The &rsquo;QJ&rsquo; option guarantees
triangular <br>
otuput. You can also use &rsquo;Ft&rsquo; to triangulate via
the centrums of non&acirc;simplicial facets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v Qu Compute the
furthest&acirc;site Voronoi diagram. The &rsquo;p&rsquo;
option prints the Voronoi vertices. The &rsquo;o&rsquo;
option prints the Voronoi vertices and the vertices in each
Voronoi <br>
region. The &rsquo;Fv&rsquo; option prints each ridge of the
Voronoi diagram. The first or zero&rsquo;th vertex indicates
the infinity vertex at infinity. Its coordinates are
qh_INFINITE <br>
(-10.101). It indicates unbounded Voronoi regions and
degenerate Delaunay triangles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input/Output options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f Print out all facets and all
fields of each facet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G Output the hull in Geomview
format. For imprecise hulls, Geomview displays the inner and
outer hull. Geomview can also display points, ridges,
vertices, coplanar points, <br>
and facet intersections. See below for a list of
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For Delaunay triangulations,
&rsquo;G&rsquo; displays the corresponding paraboloid. For
halfspace intersection, &rsquo;G&rsquo; displays the dual
polytope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i Output the incident vertices
for each facet. Qhull prints the number of facets followed
by the vertices of each facet. One facet is printed per
line. The numbers are <br>
the 0&acirc;relative indices of the corresponding input
points. The facets are oriented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In 4d and higher, Qhull
triangulates non&acirc;simplicial facets. Each apex (the
first vertex) is a created point that corresponds to the
facet&rsquo;s centrum. Its index is greater <br>
than the indices of the input points. Each base corresponds
to a simplicial ridge between two facets. To print the
vertices without triangulation, use option
&rsquo;Fv&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m Output the hull in Mathematica
format. Qhull writes a Mathematica file for 2&acirc;d and
3&acirc;d convex hulls and for 2&acirc;d Delaunay
triangulations. Qhull produces a list of <br>
objects that you can assign to a variable in Mathematica,
for example: &quot;list= &lt;&lt; &lt;outputfilename&gt;
&quot;. If the object is 2&acirc;d, it can be visualized by
&quot;Show[Graphics[list]] &quot;. <br>
For 3&acirc;d objects the command is
&quot;Show[Graphics3D[list]]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Output the normal equation for
each facet. Qhull prints the dimension (plus one), the
number of facets, and the normals for each facet. The
facet&rsquo;s offset follows its <br>
normal coefficients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Output the facets in OFF file
format. Qhull prints the dimension, number of points, number
of facets, and number of ridges. Then it prints the
coordinates of the input <br>
points and the vertices for each facet. Each facet is on a
separate line. The first number is the number of vertices.
The remainder are the indices of the corresponding <br>
points. The vertices are oriented in 2&acirc;d, 3&acirc;d,
and in simplicial facets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For 2&acirc;d Voronoi diagrams,
the vertices are sorted by adjacency, but not oriented. In
3&acirc;d and higher, the Voronoi vertices are sorted by
index. See the &rsquo;v&rsquo; option for <br>
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Output the coordinates of each
vertex point. Qhull prints the dimension, the number of
points, and the coordinates for each vertex. With the
&rsquo;Gc&rsquo; and &rsquo;Gi&rsquo; options, it <br>
also prints coplanar and interior points. For Voronoi
diagrams, it prints the coordinates of each Voronoi
vertex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s Print a summary to stderr. If
no output options are specified at all, a summary goes to
stdout. The summary lists the number of input points, the
dimension, the number <br>
of vertices in the convex hull, the number of facets in the
convex hull, the number of good facets (if
&rsquo;Pg&rsquo;), and statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last two statistics (if
needed) measure the maximum distance from a point or vertex
to a facet. The number in parenthesis (e.g., 2.1x) is the
ratio between the maxi&acirc; <br>
mum distance and the worst&acirc;case distance due to
merging two simplicial facets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Precision options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An Maximum angle given as a
cosine. If the angle between a pair of facet normals is
greater than n, Qhull merges one of the facets into a
neighbor. If &rsquo;n&rsquo; is negative, <br>
Qhull tests angles after adding each point to the hull
(pre&acirc;merging). If &rsquo;n&rsquo; is positive, Qhull
tests angles after constructing the hull
(post&acirc;merging). Both pre&acirc; and <br>
post&acirc;merging can be defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option &rsquo;C0&rsquo; or
&rsquo;C-0&rsquo; is set if the corresponding
&rsquo;Cn&rsquo; or &rsquo;C-n&rsquo; is not set. If
&rsquo;Qx&rsquo; is set, then &rsquo;A-n&rsquo; and
&rsquo;C-n&rsquo; are checked after the hull is constructed
and before &rsquo;An&rsquo; <br>
and &rsquo;Cn&rsquo; are checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cn Centrum radius. If a centrum
is less than n below a neighboring facet, Qhull merges one
of the facets. If &rsquo;n&rsquo; is negative or
&rsquo;-0&rsquo;, Qhull tests and merges facets after <br>
adding each point to the hull. This is called
&quot;pre&acirc;merging&quot;. If &rsquo;n&rsquo; is
positive, Qhull tests for convexity after constructing the
hull (&quot;post&acirc;merging&quot;). Both pre&acirc; and
<br>
post&acirc;merging can be defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For 5&acirc;d and higher,
&rsquo;Qx&rsquo; should be used instead of
&rsquo;C-n&rsquo;. Otherwise, most or all facets may be
merged together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">En Maximum roundoff error for
distance computations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rn Randomly perturb distance
computations up to +/- n * max_coord. This option perturbs
every distance, hyperplane, and angle computation. To use
time as the random number <br>
seed, use option &rsquo;QR-1&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vn Minimum distance for a facet
to be visible. A facet is visible if the distance from the
point to the facet is greater than &rsquo;Vn&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without merging, the default
value for &rsquo;Vn&rsquo; is the round&acirc;off error
(&rsquo;En&rsquo;). With merging, the default value is the
pre&acirc;merge centrum (&rsquo;C-n&rsquo;) in 2&acirc;d or
3&acirc;d, or three times <br>
that in other dimensions. If the outside width is specified
(&rsquo;Wn&rsquo;), the maximum, default value for
&rsquo;Vn&rsquo; is &rsquo;Wn&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Un Maximum distance below a
facet for a point to be coplanar to the facet. The default
value is &rsquo;Vn&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wn Minimum outside width of the
hull. Points are added to the convex hull only if they are
clearly outside of a facet. A point is outside of a facet if
its distance to the <br>
facet is greater than &rsquo;Wn&rsquo;. The normal value for
&rsquo;Wn&rsquo; is &rsquo;En&rsquo;. If the user specifies
pre&acirc;merging and does not set &rsquo;Wn&rsquo;, than
&rsquo;Wn&rsquo; is set to the premerge &rsquo;Cn&rsquo; and
maxco&acirc; <br>
ord*(1-An).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional input/output
formats</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fa Print area for each facet.
For Delaunay triangulations, the area is the area of the
triangle. For Voronoi diagrams, the area is the area of the
dual facet. Use &rsquo;PAn&rsquo; <br>
for printing the n largest facets, and option
&rsquo;PFn&rsquo; for printing facets larger than
&rsquo;n&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The area for
non&acirc;simplicial facets is the sum of the areas for each
ridge to the centrum. Vertices far below the facet&rsquo;s
hyperplane are ignored. The reported area may <br>
be significantly less than the actual area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FA Compute the total area and
volume for option &rsquo;s&rsquo;. It is an approximation
for non&acirc;simplicial facets (see &rsquo;Fa&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fc Print coplanar points for
each facet. The output starts with the number of facets.
Then each facet is printed one per line. Each line is the
number of coplanar points <br>
followed by the point ids. Option &rsquo;Qi&rsquo; includes
the interior points. Each coplanar point (interior point) is
assigned to the facet it is furthest above (resp., least
<br>
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FC Print centrums for each
facet. The output starts with the dimension followed by the
number of facets. Then each facet centrum is printed, one
per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fd Read input in cdd format with
homogeneous points. The input starts with comments. The
first comment is reported in the summary. Data starts after
a &quot;begin&quot; line. The <br>
next line is the number of points followed by the
dimension+1 and &quot;real&quot; or &quot;integer&quot;.
Then the points are listed with a leading &quot;1&quot; or
&quot;1.0&quot;. The data ends with an <br>
&quot;end&quot; line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For halfspaces (&rsquo;Fd
Hn,n,...&rsquo;), the input format is the same. Each
halfspace starts with its offset. The sign of the offset is
the opposite of Qhull&rsquo;s convention.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FD Print normals
(&rsquo;n&rsquo;, &rsquo;Fo&rsquo;, &rsquo;Fi&rsquo;) or
points (&rsquo;p&rsquo;) in cdd format. The first line is
the command line that invoked Qhull. Data starts with a
&quot;begin&quot; line. The next line is <br>
the number of normals or points followed by the dimension+1
and &quot;real&quot;. Then the normals or points are listed
with the offset before the coefficients. The offset for <br>
points is 1.0. The offset for normals has the opposite sign.
The data ends with an &quot;end&quot; line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FF Print facets (as in
&rsquo;f&rsquo;) without printing the ridges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fi Print inner planes for each
facet. The inner plane is below all vertices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fi Print separating hyperplanes
for bounded, inner regions of the Voronoi diagram. The first
line is the number of ridges. Then each hyperplane is
printed, one per line. A <br>
line starts with the number of indices and floats. The first
pair lists adjacent input sites, the next d floats are the
normalized coefficients for the hyperplane, and <br>
the last float is the offset. The hyperplane is oriented
toward &rsquo;QVn&rsquo; (if defined), or the first input
site of the pair. Use &rsquo;Tv&rsquo; to verify that the
hyperplanes are per&acirc; <br>
pendicular bisectors. Use &rsquo;Fo&rsquo; for unbounded
regions, and &rsquo;Fv&rsquo; for the corresponding Voronoi
vertices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FI Print facet identifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fm Print number of merges for
each facet. At most 511 merges are reported for a facet. See
&rsquo;PMn&rsquo; for printing the facets with the most
merges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FM Output the hull in Maple
format. Qhull writes a Maple file for 2&acirc;d and
3&acirc;d convex hulls and for 2&acirc;d Delaunay
triangulations. Qhull produces a &rsquo;.mpl&rsquo; file for
displaying <br>
with display3d().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fn Print neighbors for each
facet. The output starts with the number of facets. Then
each facet is printed one per line. Each line is the number
of neighbors followed by <br>
an index for each neighbor. The indices match the other
facet output formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A negative index indicates an
unprinted facet due to printing only good facets
(&rsquo;Pg&rsquo;). It is the negation of the facet&rsquo;s
ID (option &rsquo;FI&rsquo;). For example, negative indices
<br>
are used for facets &quot;at infinity&quot; in the Delaunay
triangulation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FN Print vertex neighbors or
coplanar facet for each point. The first line is the number
of points. Then each point is printed, one per line. If the
point is coplanar, the <br>
line is &quot;1&quot; followed by the facet&rsquo;s ID. If
the point is not a selected vertex, the line is
&quot;0&quot;. Otherwise, each line is the number of
neighbors followed by the corre&acirc; <br>
sponding facet indices (see &rsquo;Fn&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fo Print outer planes for each
facet in the same format as &rsquo;n&rsquo;. The outer plane
is above all points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fo Print separating hyperplanes
for unbounded, outer regions of the Voronoi diagram. The
first line is the number of ridges. Then each hyperplane is
printed, one per line. <br>
A line starts with the number of indices and floats. The
first pair lists adjacent input sites, the next d floats are
the normalized coefficients for the hyperplane, and <br>
the last float is the offset. The hyperplane is oriented
toward &rsquo;QVn&rsquo; (if defined), or the first input
site of the pair. Use &rsquo;Tv&rsquo; to verify that the
hyperplanes are per&acirc; <br>
pendicular bisectors. Use &rsquo;Fi&rsquo; for bounded
regions, and &rsquo;Fv&rsquo; for the corresponding Voronoi
vertices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FO List all options to stderr,
including the default values. Additional &rsquo;FO&rsquo;s
are printed to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fp Print points for halfspace
intersections (option &rsquo;Hn,n,...&rsquo;). Each
intersection corresponds to a facet of the dual polytope.
The &quot;infinity&quot; point [-10.101,-10.101,...] <br>
indicates an unbounded intersection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FP For each coplanar point
(&rsquo;Qc&rsquo;) print the point ID of the nearest vertex,
the point ID, the facet ID, and the distance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FQ Print command used for qhull
and input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fs Print a summary. The first
line consists of the number of integers (&quot;8&quot;),
followed by the dimension, the number of points, the number
of vertices, the number of facets, <br>
the number of vertices selected for output, the number of
facets selected for output, the number of coplanar points
selected for output, number of simplicial, unmerged <br>
facets in output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second line consists of the
number of reals (&quot;2&quot;), followed by the maxmimum
offset to an outer plane and and minimum offset to an inner
plane. Roundoff is included. <br>
Later versions of Qhull may produce additional integers or
reals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FS Print the size of the hull.
The first line consists of the number of integers
(&quot;0&quot;). The second line consists of the number of
reals (&quot;2&quot;), followed by the total facet <br>
area, and the total volume. Later versions of Qhull may
produce additional integers or reals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The total volume measures the
volume of the intersection of the halfspaces defined by each
facet. Both area and volume are approximations for
non&acirc;simplicial facets. See <br>
option &rsquo;Fa&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ft Print a triangulation with
added points for non&acirc;simplicial facets. The first line
is the dimension and the second line is the number of points
and the number of facets. <br>
The points follow, one per line, then the facets follow as a
list of point indices. With option &rsquo;Qz&rsquo;, the
points include the point&acirc;at&acirc;infinity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fv Print vertices for each
facet. The first line is the number of facets. Then each
facet is printed, one per line. Each line is the number of
vertices followed by the <br>
corresponding point ids. Vertices are listed in the order
they were added to the hull (the last one is first).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fv Print all ridges of a Voronoi
diagram. The first line is the number of ridges. Then each
ridge is printed, one per line. A line starts with the
number of indices. The <br>
first pair lists adjacent input sites, the remaining indices
list Voronoi vertices. Vertex &rsquo;0&rsquo; indicates the
vertex&acirc;at&acirc;infinity (i.e., an unbounded ray). In
3&acirc;d, the <br>
vertices are listed in order. See &rsquo;Fi&rsquo; and
&rsquo;Fo&rsquo; for separating hyperplanes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FV Print average vertex. The
average vertex is a feasible point for halfspace
intersection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fx List extreme points
(vertices) of the convex hull. The first line is the number
of points. The other lines give the indices of the
corresponding points. The first point <br>
is &rsquo;0&rsquo;. In 2&acirc;d, the points occur in
counter&acirc;clockwise order; otherwise they occur in input
order. For Delaunay triangulations, &rsquo;Fx&rsquo; lists
the extreme points of the input <br>
sites. The points are unordered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Geomview options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G Produce a file for viewing
with Geomview. Without other options, Qhull displays edges
in 2&acirc;d, outer planes in 3&acirc;d, and ridges in
4&acirc;d. A ridge can be explicit or <br>
implicit. An explicit ridge is a dim-1 dimensional simplex
between two facets. In 4&acirc;d, the explicit ridges are
triangles. When displaying a ridge in 4&acirc;d, Qhull
projects <br>
the ridge&rsquo;s vertices to one of its facets&rsquo;
hyperplanes. Use &rsquo;Gh&rsquo; to project ridges to the
intersection of both hyperplanes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ga Display all input points as
dots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gc Display the centrum for each
facet in 3&acirc;d. The centrum is defined by a green radius
sitting on a blue plane. The plane corresponds to the
facet&rsquo;s hyperplane. The radius <br>
is defined by &rsquo;C-n&rsquo; or &rsquo;Cn&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GDn Drop dimension n in
3&acirc;d or 4&acirc;d. The result is a 2&acirc;d or
3&acirc;d object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gh Display hyperplane
intersections in 3&acirc;d and 4&acirc;d. In 3&acirc;d, the
intersection is a black line. It lies on two neighboring
hyperplanes (c.f., the blue squares associated <br>
with centrums (&rsquo;Gc&rsquo;)). In 4&acirc;d, the ridges
are projected to the intersection of both hyperplanes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gi Display inner planes in
2&acirc;d and 3&acirc;d. The inner plane of a facet is below
all of its vertices. It is parallel to the facet&rsquo;s
hyperplane. The inner plane&rsquo;s color is the <br>
opposite (1-r,1-g,1-b) of the outer plane. Its edges are
determined by the vertices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gn Do not display inner or outer
planes. By default, Geomview displays the precise plane (no
merging) or both inner and output planes (merging). Under
merging, Geomview <br>
does not display the inner plane if the the difference
between inner and outer is too small.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Go Display outer planes in
2&acirc;d and 3&acirc;d. The outer plane of a facet is above
all input points. It is parallel to the facet&rsquo;s
hyperplane. Its color is determined by the <br>
facet&rsquo;s normal, and its edges are determined by the
vertices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gp Display coplanar points and
vertices as radii. A radius defines a ball which corresponds
to the imprecision of the point. The imprecision is the
maximum of the roundoff <br>
error, the centrum radius, and maxcoord * (1-An). It is at
least 1/20&rsquo;th of the maximum coordinate, and ignores
post&acirc;merging if pre&acirc;merging is done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gr Display ridges in 3&acirc;d.
A ridge connects the two vertices that are shared by
neighboring facets. Ridges are always displayed in
4&acirc;d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gt A 3&acirc;d Delaunay
triangulation looks like a convex hull with interior facets.
Option &rsquo;Gt&rsquo; removes the outside ridges to reveal
the outermost facets. It automatically sets <br>
options &rsquo;Gr&rsquo; and &rsquo;GDn&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gv Display vertices as spheres.
The radius of the sphere corresponds to the imprecision of
the data. See &rsquo;Gp&rsquo; for determining the
radius.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAn Only the n largest facets
are marked good for printing. Unless &rsquo;PG&rsquo; is
set, &rsquo;Pg&rsquo; is automatically set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pdk:n Drop facet from output if
normal[k] &lt;= n. The option &rsquo;Pdk&rsquo; uses the
default value of 0 for n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDk:n Drop facet from output if
normal[k] &gt;= n. The option &rsquo;PDk&rsquo; uses the
default value of 0 for n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PFn Only facets with area at
least &rsquo;n&rsquo; are marked good for printing. Unless
&rsquo;PG&rsquo; is set, &rsquo;Pg&rsquo; is automatically
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pg Print only good facets. A
good facet is either visible from a point (the
&rsquo;QGn&rsquo; option) or includes a point (the
&rsquo;QVn&rsquo; option). It also meets the requirements of
&rsquo;Pdk&rsquo; <br>
and &rsquo;PDk&rsquo; options. Option &rsquo;Pg&rsquo; is
automatically set for options &rsquo;PAn&rsquo; and
&rsquo;PFn&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PG Print neighbors of good
facets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PMn Only the n facets with the
most merges are marked good for printing. Unless
&rsquo;PG&rsquo; is set, &rsquo;Pg&rsquo; is automatically
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Po Force output despite
precision problems. Verify (&rsquo;Tv&rsquo;) does not check
coplanar points. Flipped facets are reported and concave
facets are counted. If &rsquo;Po&rsquo; is used, <br>
points are not partitioned into flipped facets and a flipped
facet is always visible to a point. Also, if an error occurs
before the completion of Qhull and tracing is <br>
not active, &rsquo;Po&rsquo; outputs a neighborhood of the
erroneous facets (if any).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pp Do not report precision
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qhull control options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qbk:0Bk:0 <br>
Drop dimension k from the input points. This allows the user
to take convex hulls of sub&acirc;dimensional objects. It
happens before the Delaunay and Voronoi transformation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QbB Scale the input points to
fit the unit cube. After scaling, the lower bound will be
-0.5 and the upper bound +0.5 in all dimensions. For
Delaunay and Voronoi diagrams, <br>
scaling happens after projection to the paraboloid. Under
precise arithmetic, scaling does not change the topology of
the convex hull.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qbb Scale the last coordinate to
[0, m] where m is the maximum absolute value of the other
coordinates. For Delaunay and Voronoi diagrams, scaling
happens after projection to <br>
the paraboloid. It reduces roundoff error for inputs with
integer coordinates. Under precise arithmetic, scaling does
not change the topology of the convex hull.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qbk:n Scale the k&rsquo;th
coordinate of the input points. After scaling, the lower
bound of the input points will be n. &rsquo;Qbk&rsquo;
scales to -0.5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QBk:n Scale the k&rsquo;th
coordinate of the input points. After scaling, the upper
bound will be n. &rsquo;QBk&rsquo; scales to +0.5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qc Keep coplanar points with the
nearest facet. Output formats &rsquo;p&rsquo;,
&rsquo;f&rsquo;, &rsquo;Gp&rsquo;, &rsquo;Fc&rsquo;,
&rsquo;FN&rsquo;, and &rsquo;FP&rsquo; will print the
points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qf Partition points to the
furthest outside facet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qg Only build good facets. With
the &rsquo;Qg&rsquo; option, Qhull will only build those
facets that it needs to determine the good facets in the
output. See &rsquo;QGn&rsquo;, &rsquo;QVn&rsquo;, and
&rsquo;PdD&rsquo; <br>
for defining good facets, and &rsquo;Pg&rsquo; and
&rsquo;PG&rsquo; for printing good facets and their
neighbors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QGn A facet is good (see
&rsquo;Qg&rsquo; and &rsquo;Pg&rsquo;) if it is visible from
point n. If n &lt; 0, a facet is good if it is not visible
from point n. Point n is not added to the hull (unless <br>
&rsquo;TCn&rsquo; or &rsquo;TPn&rsquo;). With rbox, use the
&rsquo;Pn,m,r&rsquo; option to define your point; it will be
point 0 (QG0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qi Keep interior points with the
nearest facet. Output formats &rsquo;p&rsquo;,
&rsquo;f&rsquo;, &rsquo;Gp&rsquo;, &rsquo;FN&rsquo;,
&rsquo;FP&rsquo;, and &rsquo;Fc&rsquo; will print the
points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QJn Joggle each input coordinate
by adding a random number in [-n,n]. If a precision error
occurs, then qhull increases n and tries again. It does not
increase n beyond a <br>
certain value, and it stops after a certain number of
attempts [see user.h]. Option &rsquo;QJ&rsquo; selects a
default value for n. The output will be simplicial. For
Delaunay tri&acirc; <br>
angulations, &rsquo;QJn&rsquo; sets &rsquo;Qbb&rsquo; to
scale the last coordinate (not if &rsquo;Qbk:n&rsquo; or
&rsquo;QBk:n&rsquo; is set). &Acirc;&acute;QJn&rsquo; is
deprecated for Voronoi diagrams. See also
&rsquo;Qt&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qm Only process points that
would otherwise increase max_outside. Other points are
treated as coplanar or interior points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qr Process random outside points
instead of furthest ones. This makes Qhull equivalent to the
randomized incremental algorithms. CPU time is not reported
since the random&acirc; <br>
ization is inefficient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QRn Randomly rotate the input
points. If n=0, use time as the random number seed. If
n&gt;0, use n as the random number seed. If n=-1,
don&rsquo;t rotate but use time as the random <br>
number seed. For Delaunay triangulations (&rsquo;d&rsquo;
and &rsquo;v&rsquo;), rotate about the last axis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qs Search all points for the
initial simplex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qt Triangulated output.
Triangulate all non&acirc;simplicial facets.
&Acirc;&acute;Qt&rsquo; is deprecated for Voronoi diagrams.
See also &rsquo;Qt&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qv Test vertex neighbors for
convexity after post&acirc;merging. To use the
&rsquo;Qv&rsquo; option, you also need to set a merge option
(e.g., &rsquo;Qx&rsquo; or &rsquo;C-0&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QVn A good facet (see
&rsquo;Qg&rsquo; and &rsquo;Pg&rsquo;) includes point n. If
n&lt;0, then a good facet does not include point n. The
point is either in the initial simplex or it is the first
<br>
point added to the hull. Option &rsquo;QVn&rsquo; may not be
used with merging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qx Perform exact merges while
building the hull. The &quot;exact&quot; merges are merging
a point into a coplanar facet (defined by &rsquo;Vn&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Un&rsquo;, and &rsquo;C-n&rsquo;), merging concave
facets, <br>
merging duplicate ridges, and merging flipped facets.
Coplanar merges and angle coplanar merges
(&rsquo;A-n&rsquo;) are not performed. Concavity testing is
delayed until a merge <br>
occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the hull is built, all
coplanar merges are performed (defined by &rsquo;C-n&rsquo;
and &rsquo;A-n&rsquo;), then post&acirc;merges are performed
(defined by &rsquo;Cn&rsquo; and &rsquo;An&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qz Add a point &quot;at
infinity&quot; that is above the paraboloid for Delaunay
triangulations and Voronoi diagrams. This reduces precision
problems and allows the triangulation of <br>
cospherical points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qhull experiments and
speedups</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q0 Turn off pre&acirc;merging as
a default option. With &rsquo;Q0&rsquo;/&rsquo;Qx&rsquo; and
without explicit pre&acirc;merge options, Qhull ignores
precision issues while constructing the convex hull. This
<br>
may lead to precision errors. If so, a descriptive warning
is generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q1 With &rsquo;Q1&rsquo;, Qhull
sorts merges by type (coplanar, angle coplanar, concave)
instead of by angle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q2 With &rsquo;Q2&rsquo;, Qhull
merges all facets at once instead of using independent sets
of merges and then retesting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q3 With &rsquo;Q3&rsquo;, Qhull
does not remove redundant vertices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q4 With &rsquo;Q4&rsquo;, Qhull
avoids merges of an old facet into a new facet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q5 With &rsquo;Q5&rsquo;, Qhull
does not correct outer planes at the end. The maximum outer
plane is used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q6 With &rsquo;Q6&rsquo;, Qhull
does not pre&acirc;merge concave or coplanar facets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q7 With &rsquo;Q7&rsquo;, Qhull
processes facets in depth&acirc;first order instead of
breadth&acirc;first order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q8 With &rsquo;Q8&rsquo; and
merging, Qhull does not retain near&acirc;interior points
for adjusting outer planes. &rsquo;Qc&rsquo; will probably
retain all points that adjust outer planes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q9 With &rsquo;Q9&rsquo;, Qhull
processes the furthest of all outside sets at each
iteration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q10 With &rsquo;Q10&rsquo;,
Qhull does not use special processing for narrow
distributions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q11 With &rsquo;Q11&rsquo;,
Qhull copies normals and recompute centrums for tricoplanar
facets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q12 With &rsquo;Q12&rsquo;,
Qhull does not report a very wide merge due to a duplicated
ridge with nearly coincident vertices</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trace options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tn Trace at level n. Qhull
includes full execution tracing. &rsquo;T-1&rsquo; traces
events. &rsquo;T1&rsquo; traces the overall execution of the
program. &rsquo;T2&rsquo; and &rsquo;T3&rsquo; trace overall
execution <br>
and geometric and topological events. &rsquo;T4&rsquo;
traces the algorithm. &rsquo;T5&rsquo; includes information
about memory allocation and Gaussian elimination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ta Annotate output with codes
that identify the corresponding qh_fprintf() statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tc Check frequently during
execution. This will catch most inconsistency errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCn Stop Qhull after building
the cone of new facets for point n. The output for
&rsquo;f&rsquo; includes the cone and the old hull. See also
&rsquo;TVn&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TFn Report progress whenever
more than n facets are created During post&acirc;merging,
&rsquo;TFn&rsquo; reports progress after more than n/2
merges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TI file <br>
Input data from &rsquo;file&rsquo;. The filename may not
include spaces or quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TO file <br>
Output results to &rsquo;file&rsquo;. The name may be
enclosed in single quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TPn Turn on tracing when point n
is added to the hull. Trace partitions of point n. If used
with TWn, turn off tracing after adding point n to the
hull.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRn Rerun qhull n times. Usually
used with &rsquo;QJn&rsquo; to determine the probability
that a given joggle will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ts Collect statistics and print
to stderr at the end of execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tv Verify the convex hull. This
checks the topological structure, facet convexity, and point
inclusion. If precision problems occurred, facet convexity
is tested whether or <br>
not &rsquo;Tv&rsquo; is selected. Option &rsquo;Tv&rsquo;
does not check point inclusion if forcing output with
&rsquo;Po&rsquo;, or if &rsquo;Q5&rsquo; is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For point inclusion testing,
Qhull verifies that all points are below all outer planes
(facet-&gt;maxoutside). Point inclusion is exhaustive if
merging or if the facet&acirc;point <br>
product is small enough; otherwise Qhull verifies each point
with a directed search (qh_findbest).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Point inclusion testing occurs
after producing output. It prints a message to stderr unless
option &rsquo;Pp&rsquo; is used. This allows the user to
interrupt Qhull without changing <br>
the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TVn Stop Qhull after adding
point n. If n &lt; 0, stop Qhull before adding point n.
Output shows the hull at this time. See also
&rsquo;TCn&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMn Turn on tracing at
n&rsquo;th merge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TWn Trace merge facets when the
width is greater than n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tz Redirect stderr to
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Please report bugs to Brad Barber at
qhull_bug@qhull.org.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Qhull does not compile, it is
due to an incompatibility between your system and ours. The
first thing to check is that your compiler is ANSI standard.
If it is, check the <br>
man page for the best options, or find someone to help you.
If you locate the cause of your problem, please send email
since it might help others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Qhull compiles but crashes on
the test case (rbox D4), there&rsquo;s still incompatibility
between your system and ours. Typically it&rsquo;s been due
to mem.c and memory alignment. You <br>
can use qh_NOmem in mem.h to turn off memory management.
Please let us know if you figure out how to fix these
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do find a problem, try to
simplify it before reporting the error. Try different size
inputs to locate the smallest one that causes an error.
You&rsquo;re welcome to hunt <br>
through the code using the execution trace as a guide. This
is especially true if you&rsquo;re incorporating Qhull into
your own program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you do report an error,
please attach a data set to the end of your message. This
allows us to see the error for ourselves. Qhull is
maintained part&acirc;time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E&acirc;MAIL <br>
Please send correspondence to qhull@qhull.org and report
bugs to qhull_bug@qhull.org. Let us know how you use Qhull.
If you mention it in a paper, please send the reference and
<br>
an abstract.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you would like to get Qhull
announcements (e.g., a new version) and news (any bugs that
get fixed, etc.), let us know and we will add you to our
