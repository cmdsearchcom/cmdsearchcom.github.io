<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
&quot;mvs&quot; is a command line client whose purpose is to
simplify offline editing of Wiki content. It allows you to
get any number of pages from a given Mediawiki site, edit
the pages <br>
with any editor, get and merge any concurrent updates of the
pages, and then safely commit the users own changes back to
the version of the page on the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;mvs&quot; commands
which take a filename argument only accept a single filename
as so to avoid taking up too much server bandwidth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note:Users of &quot;mvs&quot;
from before version 0.27 will notice that in this
documentation the options are mostly listed after the
&quot;mvs&quot; sub-command. This makes &quot;mvs&quot;
behave more like <br>
&quot;cvs&quot;, &quot;svn&quot;, or &quot;tla&quot;, and so
should make it easier for people who are used to using those
programs. If you prefer to use &quot;mvs&quot; the old way,
that will still work, at least for <br>
the next few versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUICKSTART <br>
Step 1: Create an account on the Mediawiki server. <br>
This should be done the normal way, by visiting the
Mediawiki website to which you want to contribute and
creating a new account, setting the preferences, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It should hopefully go without
saying that you will want to become familiar with the
editorial, usage, and copyright guidelines of the site. You
should probably also make some <br>
contributions through the normal UI, and learn about
following recent changes before contributing using mvs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition for the sake of this
test you should already have a user page like
User:&lt;username&gt; with something on it, where
&lt;username&gt; is the user name with which you established
<br>
the account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Step 2: Create a working
directory <br>
&quot;mvs&quot; works with Mediawiki formatted files with a
&quot;.wiki&quot; extension and which are stored together
with server information in a working directory. You will
have to have at least <br>
one working directory for each Mediawiki site to which you
contribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simply use &quot;mkdir&quot; or
the equivalent to make a new directory, and then before cd
into that directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mkdir wikitravel.en <br>
cd wikitravel.en</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of the operations below
should be done from this directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Step 3: Login using &quot;mvs
login&quot; <br>
To use login you will need to know the hostname for the
Mediawiki site to which you want to contribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">www.wikitravel.org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now use the host with your
username and password to login.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mvs login -d www.wikitravel.org
-u &lt;username&gt; -p &rsquo;secret&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;mvs&quot; knows about
your Mediawiki host it will set set the
&quot;wiki_path&quot; to the correct default for that
server. In this case it will also be able to select the
language version <br>
of that Wiki for you if you specify a
&quot;language_code&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mvs login -d www.wikitravel.org
-l fr -u &lt;username&gt; -p &rsquo;secret&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The code must match the one
which your wiki host uses for a given language, and of
course the language version must exist for the given
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your Mediawiki install uses a
nonstandard path to the wiki script you can specify it on
login. The path to the wiki script is the part of the URL
after the host name, and <br>
before the &rsquo;?&rsquo;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mvs login -d www.wikitravel.org
-u &lt;username&gt; -p &rsquo;secret&rsquo; -w
&rsquo;mw/wiki.phtml&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can change the edit and
action paths in the created .mediawiki file after successful
login accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now anything you submit to the
Mediawiki server will be credited to user
&quot;&lt;username&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: If you have been using an
earlier version of &quot;mvs&quot; you should probably
delete the .mediawiki file in your working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Step 4: Use &quot;mvs
update&quot; to fetch one or more working files <br>
You can fetch existing material off of the site, or create
new pages with &quot;mvs update&quot;, remembering that your
files will need a &quot;.wiki&quot; extension:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mvs update
User:&lt;username&gt;.wiki
User:&lt;username&gt;/Test_Page.wiki</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This should produce the
output:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U User:&lt;username&gt;.wiki
<br>
A User:&lt;username&gt;/Test_Page.wiki</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The U (for Updated) means that
User:&lt;username&gt; was found on the server and its
contents inserted into the local files. The A (for Added)
means that the <br>
User:&lt;username&gt;/Test_Page.wiki page does not yet exist
on the server, and will be added when you run &quot;mvs
commit&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that both of the pages we
are working with are within your User Namespace. It&rsquo;s
probably a good idea to restrict yourself to working with
such pages while you are <br>
experimenting with &quot;mvs&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Step 5: Edit the files to make
corrections and contributions <br>
Use your favorite text editor to edit the files. You might
want to check out this page to see if there is a Mediawiki
syntax highlighting file for your editor:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Syntax_highlighting</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course if you don&rsquo;t
find a highlighting file for you editor you are welcome to
create one and submit it to the page above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Step 6: Use &quot;mvs
commit&quot; to submit your changes <br>
When you are done editing a file and would like to submit
your changes to the wiki server use &quot;mvs commit&quot;
to do so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mvs commit -m &rsquo;commit
message&rsquo; User:&lt;username&gt;.wiki</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where &rsquo;commit
message&rsquo; is whatever you want to say about the changes
you are submitting and why. You must provide a commit
message or &quot;mvs commit&quot; will fail. You might also
<br>
find that &quot;mvs commit&quot; fails complaining that the
file has changed on the server. If this is the case you will
need to use &quot;mvs update&quot; again to get the most
recent changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Step 7: Update your wiki files
<br>
You can use &quot;mvs update&quot; again at any time to
reconcile any of your files with the most recent changes
from the server. Your changes will not be overwritten, but
rather &quot;mvs&quot; <br>
will try to merge any server changes into the files as they
exist in your working directory. Note that update and commit
only work on one file at a time, as so to help prevent <br>
accidents and server congestion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If for some reason there is a
conflict, i.e. you and someone else have made changes which
appear to be incompatible, and cannot be resolved then your
file will contain a conflict <br>
message, as detailed in the documentation for &quot;mvs
update&quot; below. You must resolve any conflicts before
attempting to use &quot;mvs commit&quot; on the file. This
is usually a very <br>
simple matter of choosing one version of the change or
another. You should use your best judgement, consulting the
relevant &quot;Talk:&quot; page to try to work out an
agreement with the <br>
other contributor in cases where you just simply
disagree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Repeat <br>
You can continue editing and committing changes with the
files in your working directory. It might be a good idea for
you to eventually create multiple working directories per
<br>
site, perhaps grouping them by subject. This will work fine
with &quot;mvs&quot; since it does not need to have a
complete copy of all of the pages from a given server in a
given working <br>
directory to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHARACTER ENCODING <br>
All of your &quot;.wiki&quot; files should be stored with
UTF-8 encoding. Upon login to a given server mvs will
determine the encoding used by that server, and will upload
in that <br>
encoding only. For servers using non-UTF-8 character sets
you should use HTML entities for any character you want to
represent which is outside of the server&rsquo;s character
set. <br>
This includes the english Wikipedia. Most newer Mediawiki
sites however do use UTF-8, on these sites HTML entities are
never needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
Commands <br>
The first argument after the options should be one of the
following two commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mvs login <br>
Allows the user to login to the Mediawiki server using an
existing login and password for that server. After calling
&quot;login&quot; all &quot;commit&quot;s from the same
working directory <br>
will be logged as from the logged-in user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mvs update <br>
Updates the specified file[s] with content from the
Mediawiki server. If a file does not exist it is created and
populated with the current online version. If there is no
<br>
online version, the file either created and left blank, or
just left as it is. If there is content in both the
specified file and in the corresponding Wiki page, an
attempt <br>
is made to merge the two, line by line. Files which are the
same as the server version are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no filenames are given on the
command line, all visible files with the .wiki extension are
processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conflicting changes to a given
line are detected on the basis of the date of the most
recent update of the local file and date of the most recent
change to the online Wiki <br>
page. If a line has changed in both the online page and the
local file it is flagged as a conflict, as in CVS, but with
a slightly different syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">********************Start of
conflict 1 Insert to Primary, Insert to Secondary
************************************************************</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The line as it appears on the
server</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">****************************************************************************************************</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The line as it appears locally
<br>
********************End of conflict
1********************************************************************************</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;mvs update&quot; reports
the status of files which it touches to STDERR with a letter
indicating the file status, and then name of the file, again
like CVS. The status letters <br>
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= (Unchanged) <br>
The file is the same as the page on the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A (Added) <br>
The file will become a new page on the wiki server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M (Modified) <br>
The file has been modified locally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U (Updated) <br>
The file has been updated with changes from the wiki
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C (Conflicts) <br>
The file contains conflict markers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? (Unknown) <br>
Neither the file, nor a corresponding server page exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">commit <br>
Commits any changes in the specified local file to the Wiki
site. A check is made first to make sure that there are no
changes on the server more recent than the most recent <br>
update. Nothing will be comitted if the file and server
version are identical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running &quot;mvs
commit&quot; you must use the &quot;-m&quot; flag to send a
commit message to the Mediawiki server. e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mvs commit -m &rsquo;Added Hotel
Eldorado&rsquo; Paris.wiki</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">preview <br>
This command functions identically to &quot;mvs
commit&quot;, except that nothing is actually committed.
Instead, the file is uploaded and the Mediawiki server sends
back a formatted <br>
preview. The &quot;-m&quot; flag is optional. If you set the
MVS_BROWSER environmental variable to the path and filename
of your favorite browser, mvs will launch it with the
preview <br>
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clean <br>
This command removes any local version reference files
relating to pages you&rsquo;ve deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rm Paris.wiki <br>
mvs clean</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File names <br>
Any additional arguments are taken as local filenames to be
processed. The local filename of a given Mediawiki page will
be the same as its URL encoded name with the extension <br>
&quot;.wiki&quot;. If no arguments are given then any
filenames with the &quot;wiki&quot; extension and under the
current directory are processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h <br>
Display usage information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D <br>
Print information about known Mediawiki servers, then
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q <br>
Causes the command to be quiet. Informational messages are
suppressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u &quot;&lt;username&gt;&quot;
<br>
Specifies a username for &quot;mvs login&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p &quot;&lt;password&gt;&quot;
<br>
Specifies a password for &quot;mvs login&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l
&quot;&lt;language_code&gt;&quot; <br>
The language code the wiki server uses to differentiate
between language versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m &quot;&lt;your
message&gt;&quot; <br>
A commit message for &quot;mvs commit&quot;. Use this to
explain the nature of your changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s &quot;&lt;your
message&gt;&quot; <br>
Same as &quot;-m&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--minor &lt;yes|no|default&gt;
<br>
Choose whether to mark change as a minor edit. The default
is to mark changes as minor if the Mediawiki user profile is
set to do so by default. Use this when committing a <br>
change with &quot;mvs commit&quot; or previewing with
&quot;mvs preview&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M <br>
Same as &quot;--minor yes&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--watch
&lt;yes|no|keep|default&gt; <br>
Choose whether to add the edited page to your watchlist.
Specifying &quot;keep&quot; will maintain the current
watched status. The default is to watch the page if it is
already being <br>
watched, or if the Mediawiki user profile is set to do so by
default. Use this when committing a change with &quot;mvs
commit&quot; or previewing with &quot;mvs preview&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W <br>
Same as &quot;--watch yes&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w &quot;&lt;wiki path&gt;&quot;
<br>
The path on the given &quot;host&quot; to the Mediawiki
script. This defaults to wiki/wiki.phtml which is correct
for a vanilla install of Mediawiki 1.4.x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
Verbose. If this is set &quot;mvs&quot; will give you lots
of extra information about what it&rsquo;s doing. The -q
flag overrides this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES <br>
MVS_BROWSER <br>
The browser you prefer to use for previewing changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTTP_PROXY <br>
A proxy server to use (if any), expressed as a standard URL,
something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export
HTTP_PROXY=http://[username:password@]proxy.myorg.org:8080</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
This is an early version of this program. Future versions
may have major differences which will effect your ability to
use them interchangeably with this one. In particular the
<br>
initial &quot;command&quot; arguments may become options and
the handling of conflicts might change dramatically.</p>
