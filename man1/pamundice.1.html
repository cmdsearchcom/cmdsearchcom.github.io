<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pamundice - combine grid of images (tiles) into one</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
$ pamdice myimage.ppm -outstem=myimage_part -width=10
-height=8 <br>
$ pamundice myimage_part_%1d_%1a.ppm -across=10 -down=8
&gt;myimage.ppm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pamundice myimage.ppm
myimage_part_%2a -across=13 -hoverlap=9</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pamundice</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-across=n]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-down=n]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-hoverlap=pixels]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-voverlap=pixels]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-verbose]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">input_filename_pattern</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the minimum unique
abbreviation of the options. You can use two hyphens instead
of one. You can separate an option name from its value with
white space instead of <br>
an equals sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamundice reads a bunch of
Netpbm images as input and combines them as a grid of tiles
into a single output image of the same kind on Standard
Output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can optionally make the
pieces overlap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the input_filename_pattern
argument for information on naming of the input files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The input images must all have
the same format (PAM, PPM, etc.) and maxval and for PAM must
have the same depth and tuple type. All the images in a rank
(horizontal row of <br>
tiles) must have the same height. All the images in a file
(vertical column of tiles) must have the same width. But it
is not required that every rank have the same height or <br>
every file have the same width.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamdice is the inverse of
pamundice. You can use pamundice to reassemble an image
sliced up by pamdice. You can use pamdice to recreate the
tiles of an image created by <br>
pamundice, but to do this the original ranks must all have
been the same height except for the bottom one and the
original files must all have been the same width except the
<br>
right one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One use for this is to make
pieces that take less computer resources than the whole
image to process. For example, you might have an image so
large that an image editor can&rsquo;t <br>
read it all into memory or processes it very slowly. You can
split it into smaller pieces with pamdice, edit one at a
time, and then reassemble them with pamundice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alternative to join images in
a single direction (i.e. a single rank or a single file) is
pnmcat. pnmcat gives you more flexibility than pamundice in
identifying the input <br>
images: you can supply them on Standard Input or as a list
of arbitrarily named files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To join piecewise photographs,
use pnmstitch instead of pamundice, because it figures out
where the pieces overlap, even if they don&rsquo;t overlap
exactly vertically or horizontally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create an image of the same
tile repeated in a grid, that&rsquo;s pnmtile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmindex does a similar thing to
pamundice: it combines a bunch of small images in a grid
into a big one. But its purpose is to produce a an index
image of the input images. So <br>
it leaves space between them and has labels for them, for
example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
There is one non-option argument, and it is mandatory:
input_filename_pattern. This tells pamundice what files
contain the input tiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamundice reads the input images
from files which are named with a pattern that indicates
their positions in the combined image. For example,
tile_00_05.ppm could be the 6th <br>
tile over in the 1st rank, while tile_04_01 is the 2nd tile
over in the 5th rank.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You cannot supply any of the
data on Standard Input, and the files must be the kind that
pamundice can close and reopen and read the same image a
second time (e.g. a regular file <br>
is fine; a named pipe is probably not).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">input_filename_pattern is a
printf-style pattern. (See the standard C library printf
subroutine). For the example above, it would be
tile_%2d_%2a.ppm. The only possible con&acirc; <br>
version specifiers are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d &rsquo;down&rsquo;: The rank
(row) number, starting with 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a &rsquo;across&rsquo;: The file
(column) number, starting with 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% The per cent character
(%).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number between the % and the
conversion specifier is the precision and is required. It
says how many characters of the file name are described by
that conversion. The rank <br>
or file number is filled with leading zeroes as
necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So the example tile_%2d_%2a.ppm
means to get the name of the file that contains the tile at
Rank 0, File 5, you:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; replace the
&rsquo;%2d&rsquo; with the rank number, as a 2 digit decimal
number: &rsquo;00&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Replace the
&rsquo;%2a&rsquo; with the file number, as a 2 digit decimal
number: &rsquo;05&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this pattern describes
file names that pamdice produces, except that the precision
may be more or less. (pamdice uses however many digits are
required for the highest <br>
numbered image).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-across=N <br>
This is the number of tiles across in the grid, i.e. the
number of tiles in each rank, or the number of files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-down=N <br>
This is the number of tiles up and down in the grid, i.e.
the number of tiles in each file, or the number of
ranks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hoverlap=pixels <br>
This is the amount in pixels to overlap the tiles
horizontally. pamundice clips this much off the right edge
of every tile before joining it to the adjacent image to the
<br>
right. The tiles along the right edge remain whole.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There must not be any input
image narrower than this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this undoes the effect
of the same -hoverlap option of pamdice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default is zero -- no
overlap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-voverlap=pixels <br>
This is analogous to -hoverlap, but pamundice clips the
bottom edge of each image before joining it to the one
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Print information about the processing to Standard
Error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
pamundice was new in Netpbm 10.39 (June 2007). Before that,
pnmcat is the best substitute.</p>
