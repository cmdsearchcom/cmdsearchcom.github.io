<p>IFSTAT(1) System Utilities IFSTAT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ifstat - Report InterFace STATistics</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ifstat [-a] [-l] [-z] [-n] [-v] [-h] [-t] [-i if0,if1,...]
[-d drv[:opt]] [-s [comm@][#]host[/nn]] [-T] [-A] [-w] [-W]
[-S] [-b] [-q] [delay[/delay] [count]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ifstat is a little tool to report interface activity, just
like iostat/vmstat do for other system statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
ifstat accepts the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Enables monitoring of
loopback interfaces for which statistics are available. By
default, ifstat monitors all non-loopback interfaces that
are up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Enables monitoring of all
interfaces found for which statistics are available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Hides interface which
counters are null, eg interfaces that are up but not
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Specifies the list of
interfaces to monitor, separated by commas (if an interface
name has a comma, it can be escaped with &rsquo;&acute;).
Multiple instances of the options are added <br>
together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Equivalent to -d
snmp:[comm@][#]host[/nn]] to poll a remote host through
SNMP. See below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Displays a short help
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Turns off displaying the
header periodically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Adds a timestamp at the
beginning of each line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Reports total bandwith for
all monitored interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Disables use of interface
indexes: by default, when polling mechanism is index based
(snmp, ifmib), ifstat remembers indexes of monitored
interfaces to poll only them. How&acirc; <br>
ever, if interfaces indexes change often (new interfaces
added, etc), you might loose some stats, hence this flag.
Note that if you ask ifstat to monitor a non existent <br>
interface, it will poll all interfaces until it finds the
requested one (regardless of this flag) so you can poll for
an interface that goes up and down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Uses fixed width columns,
instead of enlarging them if needed for interfaces names to
fit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W Wrap lines that are larger
than the terminal width (implies -w). Wrapped lines are
prefixed with a cycling letter to ease reading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Keep stats updated on the
same line if possible (no scrolling nor wrapping).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Reports bandwith in kbits/sec
instead of kbytes/sec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet mode, warnings are not
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Displays version and the
compiled-in drivers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Specifies a driver to use to
gather stats and an eventual option for this driver
separated of the driver name by a colon. If this is not
specified, ifstat uses the first <br>
driver compiled in, with no options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following drivers are
available (depending on the operating system and
compile-time options, not all of them might be present):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">proc <br>
This driver gets statistics from Linux&rsquo;s /proc/net/dev
file. An alternate file name to get stats from can be passed
as the option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifmib <br>
This driver gets statistics from FreeBSD&rsquo;s ifmib
sysctl. It doesn&rsquo;t accept any options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kstat <br>
This driver gets statistics from Solaris kstat interface. It
doesn&rsquo;t accept any options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifdata <br>
This driver gets statistics using SIOCGIFDATA ioctl under
IRIX and OpenBSD (different semantics). It doesn&rsquo;t
accept any options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">route <br>
This driver gets statistics using routing sysctl on BSD
based systems. It doesn&rsquo;t accept any options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kvm This driver gets statistics
by reading the kernel live structures. It accepts an option
specifying which files/devices to use in the following
format : [execfile][,[core&acirc; <br>
file][,swapfile]] (see kvm_open(3) for details on those
fields). If a null string is passed for a parameter, the
system default will be used for it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that for this driver to
work, ifstat needs to have read access to the system memory
device. This is usually done by running it as root, or by
installing setgid mem <br>
or kmem. ifstat will NOT install setgid by default; It is up
to you to decide if you trust it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dlpi <br>
This driver gets statistics using the DLPI streams interface
available on HP-UX. An alternate device to query statistics
from can be passed as the option (default is <br>
/dev/dlpi).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">win32 <br>
This driver gets statistics using the GetIfTable interface
available on Win32 systems. It doesn&rsquo;t accept any
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">snmp <br>
This driver gets statistics through SNMP. The option, in the
form [comm@][#]host[/nn]], specifies the host and eventual
community to poll. Default community is public, <br>
but can be changed by prepending &quot;comm@&quot; to the
hostname. If host starts by a #, interface names are
generated from their index as &lsquo;ifNN&rsquo; (this is a
workaround for some <br>
equipments that give all interfaces the same description).
Default host is localhost, and this will be used by default
if snmp is the only available driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The driver will try to poll
several interfaces at once by grouping requests in SNMP
packets. By default interfaces will be polled by group of 8.
If this doesn&rsquo;t work well <br>
with your equipments, you can lower that number by suffixing
the hostname with /nn, where nn is the number of interfaces
to poll at once. You can also increase the number <br>
if you want to poll a large number of interfaces efficiently
and if your server supports it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delay <br>
delay is the delay between updates in seconds, which
defaults to 1. A decimal number can be specified for
intervals shorter than a second. (minimum 0.1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A second delay can also be
specified (separated from the first one by a
&rsquo;/&rsquo;). In that case the first delay will be used
for the first poll after start and the second one will <br>
be used for all following polls (This can be used to have a
&quot;fast&quot; start when running for a long while with a
big delay).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">count <br>
count is the number of updates before stopping. If not
specified, it is unlimited.</p>
