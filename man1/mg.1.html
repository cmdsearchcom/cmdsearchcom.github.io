<p>MG(1) BSD General Commands Manual MG(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mg &acirc; emacs-like text editor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mg [-nR] [-f mode] [+number] [file ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mg is intended to be a small, fast, and portable editor for
people who can&rsquo;t (or don&rsquo;t want to) run emacs
for one reason or another, or are not familiar with the
vi(1) editor. It <br>
is compatible with emacs because there shouldn&rsquo;t be
any reason to learn more editor types than emacs or
vi(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+number <br>
Go to the line specified by number (do not insert a space
between the &acirc;+&acirc; sign and the number). If a
negative number is specified, the line number counts
backwards from <br>
the end of the file i.e. +-1 will be the last line of the
file, +-2 will be second last, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f mode <br>
Run the mode command for all buffers created from arguments
on the command line, including the scratch buffer and all
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Turn off backup file
generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Files specified on the
command line will be opened read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINDOWS AND BUFFERS <br>
When a file is loaded into mg, it is stored in a buffer.
This buffer may be displayed on the screen in more than one
window. At present, windows may only be split horizontally,
<br>
so each window is delineated by a modeline at the bottom. If
changes are made to a buffer, it will be reflected in all
open windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a file is changed outside mg
and its buffer is about to be changed, mg prompts if the
change should go ahead (y), not go ahead (n) or if the
buffer should be reverted (r) to the <br>
latest file on disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a buffer name begins and ends
with an asterisk, the buffer is considered throwaway; i.e.
the user will not be prompted to save changes when the
buffer is killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POINT AND MARK <br>
The current cursor location in mg is called the point (or
dot). It is possible to define a window-specific region of
text by setting a second location, called the mark. The <br>
region is the text between point and mark inclusive.
Deleting the character at the mark position leaves the mark
at the point of deletion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The point and mark are
window-specific in mg, not buffer-specific, as in other
emacs flavours.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BACKUP FILES <br>
Backup files have a &acirc;~&acirc; character appended to
the file name and are created in the current working
directory by default. Whether to create backup files or not
can be toggled with <br>
the make-backup-files command. The backup file location can
either be in the current working directory, or all backups
can be moved to a ~/.mg.d directory where files retain their
<br>
path name to retain uniqueness. Use the
backup-to-home-directory to alternate between these two
locations. Further, if any application creates backup files
in /tmp, these can be <br>
left with the leave-tmpdir-backups command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TAGS <br>
mg supports tag files created by ctags(1), allowing the user
to quickly locate various object definitions. Note though
that emacs uses etags, not ctags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CSCOPE <br>
mg supports navigating source code using cscope. However, mg
requires cscope and cscope-indexer executables to be present
in PATH for it to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS <br>
Normal editing commands are very similar to GNU Emacs. In
the following examples, C-x means Control-x, and M-x means
Meta-x, where the Meta key may be either a special key on
the <br>
keyboard or the ALT key; otherwise ESC followed by the key X
works as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a complete description of mg
commands, see MG COMMANDS. To see the active keybindings at
any time, type &acirc;M-x describe-bindings&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MG COMMANDS <br>
Commands are invoked by &acirc;M-x&acirc;, or by binding to
a key. Many commands take an optional numerical parameter,
n. This parameter is set either by M-&lt;n&gt; (where n is
the numerical <br>
argument) before the command, or by one or more invocations
of the universal argument, usually bound to C-u. When
invoked in this manner, the value of the numeric parameter
to be <br>
passed is displayed in the minibuffer before the M-x. One
common use of the parameter is in mode toggles (e.g.
make-backup-files). If no parameter is supplied, the mode is
tog&acirc; <br>
gled to its alternate state. If a positive parameter is
supplied, the mode is forced to on. Otherwise, it is forced
to off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apropos <br>
Help Apropos. Prompt the user for a string, open the *help*
buffer, and list all mg commands that contain that
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">audible-bell <br>
Toggle the audible system bell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto-execute <br>
Register an auto-execute hook; that is, specify a filename
pattern (conforming to the shell&rsquo;s filename globbing
rules) and an associated function to execute when a file
<br>
matching the specified pattern is read into a buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto-fill-mode <br>
Toggle auto-fill mode (sometimes called mail-mode) in the
current buffer, where text inserted past the fill column is
automatically wrapped to a new line. Can be set glob&acirc;
<br>
ally with set-default-mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto-indent-mode <br>
Toggle indent mode in the current buffer, where indentation
is preserved after a newline. Can be set globally with
set-default-mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">back-to-indentation <br>
Move the dot to the first non-whitespace character on the
current line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">backup-to-home-directory <br>

brackets, and braces, the character itself is used <br>
as its own match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bsmap-mode <br>
Toggle bsmap mode, where DEL and C-h are swapped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c-mode <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILES <br>
There are two configuration files, .mg and .mg-TERM. Here,
TERM represents the name of the terminal type; e.g. if the
terminal type is set to &acirc;vt100&acirc;, mg will use
.mg-vt100 as a <br>
startup file. The terminal type startup file is used
first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The startup file format is a
list of commands, one per line, as used for interactive
evaluation. Strings that are normally entered by the user at
any subsequent prompts may be <br>
specified after the command name; e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">global-set-key &quot;)&quot;
self-insert-command <br>
global-set-key &quot;xf&quot; find-file <br>
global-set-key &quot;\[Z&quot; backward-char <br>
set-default-mode fill <br>
set-fill-column 72 <br>
auto-execute *.c c-mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comments can be added to the
startup files by placing &acirc;;&acirc; or &acirc;#&acirc;
as the first character of a line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.mg normal startup file <br>
~/.mg-TERM terminal-specific startup file <br>
~/.mg.d alternative backup file location <br>
/usr/share/doc/mg/tutorial concise tutorial</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
ctags(1), vi(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
Since it is written completely in C, there is currently no
language in which extensions can be written; however, keys
can be rebound and certain parameters can be changed in <br>
startup files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to use 8-bit characters
(such as German umlauts), the Meta key needs to be disabled
via the &acirc;meta-key-mode&acirc; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multi-byte character sets, such
as UTF-8, are not supported.</p>
