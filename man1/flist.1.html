<p>FLIST(1) General Commands Manual FLIST(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
flist, flists - list the number of messages in given
sequence(s)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
flist [+folder1 [+folder2 ...]] [-sequence name1 [-sequence
name2 ...]] [-all | -noall] [-showzero | -noshowzero]
[-recurse | -norecurse] [-fast | -nofast] [-alpha |
-noalpha] <br>
[-version] [-help]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flists is equivalent to flist
-all</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Flist is used to search a list of folders and display the
number of messages in these folders that are in a given
sequence or set of sequences (for example the
&acirc;unseen&acirc; <br>
sequence). This is especially useful if you use some
mechanism such as slocal or procmail (typically in
conjunction with rcvstore) to pre-sort your mail into
different folders <br>
before you view it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the command flist
will search the current folder for the given sequence or
sequences (usually &acirc;unseen&acirc;). If (possibly
multiple) folders are specified on the command <br>
line with +folder, then all these folders are searched for
the given sequence(s). Flist will display for each folder
searched, the number of messages in each of the specified
<br>
sequences, and the total number of messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -sequence is used to
specify the name of a sequence in which to search for. This
option may be used multiple times to specify multiple
sequences. If this is not <br>
given, then the default is to search for all the sequences
specified by the &acirc;Unseen-Sequence&acirc; profile
component. For more details about sequences, read the
mh-sequence(5) man <br>
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typically, flist will produce a
line for each sequence, for every folder that is searched,
even those which do not contain any messages in the given
sequence. Specifying <br>
-noshowzero will cause flist to print only those
folder/sequence combinations such the folder has a non-zero
number of messages in the given specified sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -recurse is given, then for
each folder that is search, flist will also recursively
descend into those folders to search subfolders for the
given sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -fast is given, only the
names of the folders searched will be displayed, and flist
will suppress all other output. If this option is used in
conjunction with -noshowzero, <br>
then flist will only print the names of those folders
searched that contain messages in in at least one of the
specified sequences..SS &quot;Multiple Folders&quot; If the
option -all is <br>
given (and no folders are specified with +folder), then
flist will search all the folders in the top level of the
users nmh directory. These folders are all preceded by the
<br>
read-only folders, which occur as &acirc;atr-cur-&acirc;
entries in the user&rsquo;s nmh context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example of the output of
flist -all is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/work/Mail has 5 in sequence
unseen (private); out of 46 <br>
inbox+ has 10 in sequence unseen ; out of 153 <br>
junklist has 0 in sequence unseen ; out of 63 <br>
postmaster has 1 in sequence unseen ; out of 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;+&acirc; after inbox
indicates that it is the current folder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;private&acirc; flag
indicates that the given sequence for that folder is
private. See the mh-sequence(5) man page for details about
private sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the option -all and +folder
are both specified, then flist will search this folder, and
all its first level subfolders for the given sequence. You
may specify multiple fold&acirc; <br>
ers in this way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If flist is invoked by a name
ending with &acirc;s&acirc; (e.g. flists), then the switch
-all is assumed by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sorting order for the
listing is alphabetical (with -alpha), or in a priority
order defined by the &acirc;Flist-Order&acirc; profile entry
(with -noalpha). Each item in the &acirc;Flist- <br>
Order&acirc; is a folder name or a folder name pattern that
uses * to match zero or more characters. Longer matching
patterns have precedence over shorter matching patterns. For
<br>
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flist-Order: personal petproject
mh* * admin *junk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This order puts a few
interesting folders first, such as those with mail addressed
to you personally, those about a pet project, and those
about mh-related things. It places <br>
uninteresting folders at the end, and it puts everything
else in the middle in alphabetical order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$HOME/.mh_profile The user&rsquo;s profile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROFILE COMPONENTS <br>
Path: To determine the user&rsquo;s nmh directory. <br>
mh-sequences: File that contains public sequences. <br>
Unseen-Sequence: The name of the unseen message sequence.
<br>
Flist-Order: To sort folders by priority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
folder(1), rcvstore(1), slocal(1), mh-sequence(5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFAULTS <br>
-sequence The Unseen-Sequence profile entry. <br>
-showzero <br>
-noall <br>
-norecurse <br>
-noalpha <br>
-nofast</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTEXT <br>
If +folder is given, it will become the current folder. If
multiple folders are given, the last one specified will
become the current folder.</p>
