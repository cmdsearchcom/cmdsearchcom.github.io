<p>GZIP(1) General Commands Manual GZIP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gzip, gunzip, zcat - compress or expand files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gzip [ -acdfhklLnNrtvV19 ] [-S suffix] [ name ... ] <br>
gunzip [ -acfhklLnNrtvV ] [-S suffix] [ name ... ] <br>
zcat [ -fhLV ] [ name ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Gzip reduces the size of the named files using Lempel-Ziv
coding (LZ77). Whenever possible, each file is replaced by
one with the extension .gz, while keeping the same ownership
<br>
modes, access and modification times. (The default extension
is -gz for VMS, z for MSDOS, OS/2 FAT, Windows NT FAT and
Atari.) If no files are specified, or if a file name is <br>
&quot;-&quot;, the standard input is compressed to the
standard output. Gzip will only attempt to compress regular
files. In particular, it will ignore symbolic links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the compressed file name is
too long for its file system, gzip truncates it. Gzip
attempts to truncate only the parts of the file name longer
than 3 characters. (A part is <br>
delimited by dots.) If the name consists of small parts
only, the longest parts are truncated. For example, if file
names are limited to 14 characters, gzip.msdos.exe is
com&acirc; <br>
pressed to gzi.msd.exe.gz. Names are not truncated on
systems which do not have a limit on file name length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, gzip keeps the
original file name and timestamp in the compressed file.
These are used when decompressing the file with the -N
option. This is useful when the com&acirc; <br>
pressed file name was truncated or when the time stamp was
not preserved after a file transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compressed files can be restored
to their original form using gzip -d or gunzip or zcat. If
the original name saved in the compressed file is not
suitable for its file system, a <br>
new name is constructed from the original one to make it
legal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gunzip takes a list of files on
its command line and replaces each file whose name ends with
.gz, -gz, .z, -z, or _z (ignoring case) and which begins
with the correct magic num&acirc; <br>
ber with an uncompressed file without the original
extension. gunzip also recognizes the special extensions
.tgz and .taz as shorthands for .tar.gz and .tar.Z
respectively. <br>
When compressing, gzip uses the .tgz extension if necessary
instead of truncating a file with a .tar extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gunzip can currently decompress
files created by gzip, zip, compress, compress -H or pack.
The detection of the input format is automatic. When using
the first two formats, <br>
gunzip checks a 32 bit CRC. For pack and gunzip checks the
uncompressed length. The standard compress format was not
designed to allow consistency checks. However gunzip is
some&acirc; <br>
times able to detect a bad .Z file. If you get an error when
uncompressing a .Z file, do not assume that the .Z file is
correct simply because the standard uncompress does not <br>
complain. This generally means that the standard uncompress
does not check its input, and happily generates garbage
output. The SCO compress -H format (lzh compression method)
<br>
does not include a CRC but also allows some consistency
checks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files created by zip can be
uncompressed by gzip only if they have a single member
compressed with the &rsquo;deflation&rsquo; method. This
feature is only intended to help conversion of <br>
tar.zip files to the tar.gz format. To extract a zip file
with a single member, use a command like gunzip &lt;foo.zip
or gunzip -S .zip foo.zip. To extract zip files with several
<br>
members, use unzip instead of gunzip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zcat is identical to gunzip -c.
(On some systems, zcat may be installed as gzcat to preserve
the original link to compress.) zcat uncompresses either a
list of files on the <br>
command line or its standard input and writes the
uncompressed data on standard output. zcat will uncompress
files that have the correct magic number whether they have a
.gz <br>
suffix or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gzip uses the Lempel-Ziv
algorithm used in zip and PKZIP. The amount of compression
obtained depends on the size of the input and the
distribution of common substrings. Typi&acirc; <br>
cally, text such as source code or English is reduced by
60-70%. Compression is generally much better than that
achieved by LZW (as used in compress), Huffman coding (as
used in <br>
pack), or adaptive Huffman coding (compact).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compression is always performed,
even if the compressed file is slightly larger than the
original. The worst case expansion is a few bytes for the
gzip file header, plus 5 bytes <br>
every 32K block, or an expansion ratio of 0.015% for large
files. Note that the actual number of used disk blocks
almost never increases. gzip preserves the mode, ownership
and <br>
timestamps of files when compressing or decompressing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a --ascii <br>
Ascii text mode: convert end-of-lines using local
conventions. This option is supported only on some non-Unix
systems. For MSDOS, CR LF is converted to LF when
compress&acirc; <br>
ing, and LF is converted to CR LF when decompressing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c --stdout --to-stdout <br>
Write output on standard output; keep original files
unchanged. If there are several input files, the output
consists of a sequence of independently compressed members.
<br>
To obtain better compression, concatenate all input files
before compressing them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d --decompress --uncompress
<br>
Decompress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f --force <br>
Force compression or decompression even if the file has
multiple links or the corresponding file already exists, or
if the compressed data is read from or written to a <br>
terminal. If the input data is not in a format recognized by
gzip, and if the option --stdout is also given, copy the
input data without change to the standard output: let <br>
zcat behave as cat. If -f is not given, and when not running
in the background, gzip prompts to verify whether an
existing file should be overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h --help <br>
Display a help screen and quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k --keep <br>
Keep (don&rsquo;t delete) input files during compression or
decompression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l --list <br>
For each compressed file, list the following fields:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compressed size: size of the
compressed file <br>
uncompressed size: size of the uncompressed file <br>
ratio: compression ratio (0.0% if unknown) <br>
uncompressed_name: name of the uncompressed file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The uncompressed size is given
as -1 for files not in gzip format, such as compressed .Z
files. To get the uncompressed size for such a file, you can
use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zcat file.Z | wc -c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In combination with the
--verbose option, the following fields are also
displayed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">method: compression method <br>
crc: the 32-bit CRC of the uncompressed data <br>
date &amp; time: time stamp for the uncompressed file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compression methods
currently supported are deflate, compress, lzh (SCO compress
-H) and pack. The crc is given as ffffffff for a file not in
gzip format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With --name, the uncompressed
name, date and time are those stored within the compress
file if present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With --verbose, the size totals
and compression ratio for all files is also displayed,
unless some sizes are unknown. With --quiet, the title and
totals lines are not dis&acirc; <br>
played.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L --license <br>
Display the gzip license and quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n --no-name <br>
When compressing, do not save the original file name and
time stamp by default. (The original name is always saved if
the name had to be truncated.) When decompressing, do <br>
not restore the original file name if present (remove only
the gzip suffix from the compressed file name) and do not
restore the original time stamp if present (copy it <br>
from the compressed file). This option is the default when
decompressing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N --name <br>
When compressing, always save the original file name and
time stamp; this is the default. When decompressing, restore
the original file name and time stamp if present. <br>
This option is useful on systems which have a limit on file
name length or when the time stamp has been lost after a
file transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q --quiet <br>
Suppress all warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r --recursive <br>
Travel the directory structure recursively. If any of the
file names specified on the command line are directories,
gzip will descend into the directory and compress all <br>
the files it finds there (or decompress them in the case of
gunzip ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S .suf --suffix .suf <br>
When compressing, use suffix .suf instead of .gz. Any
non-empty suffix can be given, but suffixes other than .z
and .gz should be avoided to avoid confusion when files <br>
are transferred to other systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When decompressing, add .suf to
the beginning of the list of suffixes to try, when deriving
an output file name from an input file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--synchronous <br>
Use synchronous output. With this option, gzip is less
likely to lose data during a system crash, but it can be
considerably slower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t --test <br>
Test. Check the compressed file integrity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v --verbose <br>
Verbose. Display the name and percentage reduction for each
file compressed or decompressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V --version <br>
Version. Display the version number and compilation options
then quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-# --fast --best <br>
Regulate the speed of compression using the specified digit
#, where -1 or --fast indicates the fastest compression
method (less compression) and -9 or --best indicates <br>
the slowest compression method (best compression). The
default compression level is -6 (that is, biased towards
high compression at expense of speed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rsyncable <br>
When you synchronize a compressed file between two
computers, this option allows rsync to transfer only files
that were changed in the archive instead of the entire
ar&acirc; <br>
chive. Normally, after a change is made to any file in the
archive, the compression algorithm can generate a new
version of the archive that does not match the previous <br>
version of the archive. In this case, rsync transfers the
entire new version of the archive to the remote computer.
With this option, rsync can transfer only the changed <br>
files as well as a small amount of metadata that is required
to update the archive structure in the area that was
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADVANCED USAGE <br>
Multiple compressed files can be concatenated. In this case,
gunzip will extract all members at once. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gzip -c file1 &gt; foo.gz <br>
gzip -c file2 &gt;&gt; foo.gz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gunzip -c foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is equivalent to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat file1 file2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In case of damage to one member
of a .gz file, other members can still be recovered (if the
damaged member is removed). However, you can get better
compression by compressing all <br>
members at once:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat file1 file2 | gzip &gt;
foo.gz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compresses better than</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gzip -c file1 file2 &gt;
foo.gz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to recompress
concatenated files to get better compression, do:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gzip -cd old.gz | gzip &gt;
new.gz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a compressed file consists of
several members, the uncompressed size and CRC reported by
the --list option applies to the last member only. If you
need the uncompressed size <br>
for all members, you can use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gzip -cd file.gz | wc -c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish to create a single
archive file with multiple members so that members can later
be extracted independently, use an archiver such as tar or
zip. GNU tar supports the <br>
-z option to invoke gzip transparently. gzip is designed as
a complement to tar, not as a replacement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The obsolescent environment variable GZIP can hold a set of
default options for gzip. These options are interpreted
first and can be overwritten by explicit command line
parame&acirc; <br>
ters. As this can cause problems when using scripts, this
feature is supported only for options that are reasonably
likely to not cause too much harm, and gzip warns if it is
<br>
used. This feature will be removed in a future release of
gzip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use an alias or script
instead. For example, if gzip is in the directory /usr/bin
you can prepend $HOME/bin to your PATH and create an
executable script $HOME/bin/gzip <br>
containing the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#! /bin/sh <br>
export PATH=/usr/bin <br>
exec gzip -9 &quot;$@&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On VMS, the name of the
obsolescent environment variable is GZIP_OPT, to avoid a
conflict with the symbol set for invocation of the
program.</p>

unzip(1), compress(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The gzip file format is
specified in P. Deutsch, GZIP file format specification
version 4.3, &lt;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt&gt;,
Internet RFC 1952 (May 1996). The zip defla&acirc; <br>
tion format is specified in P. Deutsch, DEFLATE Compressed
Data Format Specification version 1.3,
&lt;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt&gt;, Internet RFC
1951 (May 1996).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Exit status is normally 0; if an error occurs, exit status
is 1. If a warning occurs, exit status is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usage: gzip [-cdfhklLnNrtvV19]
[-S suffix] [file ...] <br>
Invalid options were specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file: not in gzip format <br>
The file specified to gunzip has not been compressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file: Corrupt input. Use zcat to
recover some data. <br>
The compressed file has been damaged. The data up to the
point of failure can be recovered using</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zcat file &gt; recover</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file: compressed with xx bits,
can only handle yy bits <br>
File was compressed (using LZW) by a program that could deal
with more bits than the decompress code on this machine.
Recompress the file with gzip, which compresses bet&acirc;
<br>
ter and uses less memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file: already has .gz suffix --
unchanged <br>
The file is assumed to be already compressed. Rename the
file and try again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file already exists; do you wish
to overwrite (y or n)? <br>
Respond &quot;y&quot; if you want the output file to be
replaced; &quot;n&quot; if not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gunzip: corrupt input <br>
A SIGSEGV violation was detected which usually means that
the input file has been corrupted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xx.x% Percentage of the input
saved by compression. <br>
(Relevant only for -v and -l.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- not a regular file or
directory: ignored <br>
When the input file is not a regular file or directory,
(e.g. a symbolic link, socket, FIFO, device file), it is
left unaltered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- has xx other links: unchanged
<br>
The input file has links; it is left unchanged. See ln(1)
for more information. Use the -f flag to force compression
of multiply-linked files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
When writing compressed data to a tape, it is generally
necessary to pad the output with zeroes up to a block
boundary. When the data is read and the whole block is
passed to <br>
gunzip for decompression, gunzip detects that there is extra
trailing garbage after the compressed data and emits a
warning by default. You can use the --quiet option to
sup&acirc; <br>
press the warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The gzip format represents the input size modulo 2^32, so
the --list option reports incorrect uncompressed sizes and
compression ratios for uncompressed files 4 GB and larger.
<br>
To work around this problem, you can use the following
command to discover a large uncompressed file&rsquo;s true
size:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zcat file.gz | wc -c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --list option reports sizes
as -1 and crc as ffffffff if the compressed file is on a non
seekable media.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some rare cases, the --best
option gives worse compression than the default compression
level (-6). On some highly redundant files, compress
compresses better than gzip.</p>
