perlhacktut - Walk through the creation of a simple C code patch

This document takes you through a simple patch example.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you haven't read perlhack yet, go do that first! You might also want to read
  through perlsource too.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLE_OF_A_SIMPLE_PATCH"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLE_OF_A_SIMPLE_PATCH">EXAMPLE
  OF A SIMPLE PATCH</a></h1>
Let's take a simple patch from start to finish.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here's something Larry suggested: if a &quot;U&quot; is the first active format
  during a &quot;pack&quot;, (for example, &quot;pack &quot;U3C8&quot;,
  @stuff&quot;) then the resulting string should be treated as UTF-8 encoded.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are working with a git clone of the Perl repository, you will want to
  create a branch for your changes. This will make creating a proper patch much
  simpler. See the perlgit for details on how to do this.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Writing_the_patch"><a class="selflink" href="#Writing_the_patch">Writing
  the patch</a></h2>
How do we prepare to fix this up? First we locate the code in question - the
  &quot;pack&quot; happens at runtime, so it's going to be in one of the
  <i>pp</i> files. Sure enough, &quot;pp_pack&quot; is in <i>pp.c</i>. Since
  we're going to be altering this file, let's copy it to <i>pp.c~</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
[Well, it was in <i>pp.c</i> when this tutorial was written. It has now been
  split off with &quot;pp_unpack&quot; to its own file, <i>pp_pack.c</i>]
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now let's look over &quot;pp_pack&quot;: we take a pattern into &quot;pat&quot;,
  and then loop over the pattern, taking each format character in turn into
  &quot;datum_type&quot;. Then for each possible format character, we swallow up
  the other arguments in the pattern (a field width, an asterisk, and so on) and
  convert the next chunk input into the specified format, adding it onto the
  output SV &quot;cat&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
How do we know if the &quot;U&quot; is the first format in the &quot;pat&quot;?
  Well, if we have a pointer to the start of &quot;pat&quot; then, if we see a
  &quot;U&quot; we can test whether we're still at the start of the string. So,
  here's where &quot;pat&quot; is set up:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    STRLEN fromlen;
    register char *pat = SvPVx(*++MARK, fromlen);
    register char *patend = pat + fromlen;
    register I32 len;
    I32 datumtype;
    SV *fromstr;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We'll have another string pointer in there:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    STRLEN fromlen;
    register char *pat = SvPVx(*++MARK, fromlen);
    register char *patend = pat + fromlen;
 +  char *patcopy;
    register I32 len;
    I32 datumtype;
    SV *fromstr;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And just before we start the loop, we'll set &quot;patcopy&quot; to be the start
  of &quot;pat&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    items = SP - MARK;
    MARK++;
    sv_setpvn(cat, &quot;&quot;, 0);
 +  patcopy = pat;
    while (pat &lt; patend) {
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now if we see a &quot;U&quot; which was at the start of the string, we turn on
  the &quot;UTF8&quot; flag for the output SV, &quot;cat&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 +  if (datumtype == 'U' &amp;&amp; pat==patcopy+1)
 +      SvUTF8_on(cat);
    if (datumtype == '#') {
        while (pat &lt; patend &amp;&amp; *pat != '\n')
            pat++;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Remember that it has to be &quot;patcopy+1&quot; because the first character of
  the string is the &quot;U&quot; which has been swallowed into
  &quot;datumtype!&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
Oops, we forgot one thing: what if there are spaces at the start of the pattern?
  &quot;pack(&quot; U*&quot;, @stuff)&quot; will have &quot;U&quot; as the first
  active character, even though it's not the first thing in the pattern. In this
  case, we have to advance &quot;patcopy&quot; along with &quot;pat&quot; when
  we see spaces:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    if (isSPACE(datumtype))
        continue;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
needs to become
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    if (isSPACE(datumtype)) {
        patcopy++;
        continue;
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
OK. That's the C part done. Now we must do two additional things before this
  patch is ready to go: we've changed the behaviour of Perl, and so we must
  document that change. We must also provide some more regression tests to make
  sure our patch works and doesn't create a bug somewhere else along the line.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Testing_the_patch"><a class="selflink" href="#Testing_the_patch">Testing
  the patch</a></h2>
The regression tests for each operator live in <i>t/op/</i>, and so we make a
  copy of <i>t/op/pack.t</i> to <i>t/op/pack.t~</i>. Now we can add our tests to
  the end. First, we'll test that the &quot;U&quot; does indeed create Unicode
  strings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
t/op/pack.t has a sensible <i>ok()</i> function, but if it didn't we could use
  the one from t/test.pl.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 require './test.pl';
 plan( tests =&gt; 159 );
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
so instead of this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 print 'not ' unless &quot;1.20.300.4000&quot; eq sprintf &quot;%vd&quot;,
                                               pack(&quot;U*&quot;,1,20,300,4000);
 print &quot;ok $test\n&quot;; $test++;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
we can write the more sensible (see Test::More for a full explanation of
  <i>is()</i> and other testing functions).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 is( &quot;1.20.300.4000&quot;, sprintf &quot;%vd&quot;, pack(&quot;U*&quot;,1,20,300,4000),
                                       &quot;U* produces Unicode&quot; );
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now we'll test that we got that space-at-the-beginning business right:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 is( &quot;1.20.300.4000&quot;, sprintf &quot;%vd&quot;, pack(&quot;  U*&quot;,1,20,300,4000),
                                     &quot;  with spaces at the beginning&quot; );
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And finally we'll test that we don't make Unicode strings if &quot;U&quot; is
  <b>not</b> the first active format:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 isnt( v1.20.300.4000, sprintf &quot;%vd&quot;, pack(&quot;C0U*&quot;,1,20,300,4000),
                                       &quot;U* not first isn't Unicode&quot; );
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mustn't forget to change the number of tests which appears at the top, or else
  the automated tester will get confused. This will either look like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 print &quot;1..156\n&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 plan( tests =&gt; 156 );
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We now compile up Perl, and run it through the test suite. Our new tests pass,
  hooray!
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Documenting_the_patch"><a class="selflink" href="#Documenting_the_patch">Documenting
  the patch</a></h2>
Finally, the documentation. The job is never done until the paperwork is over,
  so let's describe the change we've just made. The relevant place is
  <i>pod/perlfunc.pod</i>; again, we make a copy, and then we'll insert this
  text in the description of &quot;pack&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 =item *
 If the pattern begins with a C&lt;U&gt;, the resulting string will be treated
 as UTF-8-encoded Unicode. You can force UTF-8 encoding on in a string
 with an initial C&lt;U0&gt;, and the bytes that follow will be interpreted as
 Unicode characters. If you don't want this to happen, you can begin
 your pattern with C&lt;C0&gt; (or anything else) to force Perl not to UTF-8
 encode your string, and then follow this with a C&lt;U*&gt; somewhere in your
 pattern.
