<p>TCSH(1) General Commands Manual TCSH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tcsh - C shell with file name completion and command line
editing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tcsh [-bcdefFimnqstvVxX] [-Dname[=value]] [arg ...] <br>
tcsh -l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tcsh is an enhanced but completely compatible version of the
Berkeley UNIX C shell, csh(1). It is a command language
interpreter usable both as an interactive login shell and a
<br>
shell script command processor. It includes a command-line
editor (see The command-line editor), programmable word
completion (see Completion and listing), spelling correction
<br>
(see Spelling correction), a history mechanism (see History
substitution), job control (see Jobs) and a C-like syntax.
The NEW FEATURES section describes major enhancements of
<br>
tcsh over csh(1). Throughout this manual, features of tcsh
not found in most csh(1) implementations (specifically, the
4.4BSD csh) are labeled with &lsquo;(+)&rsquo;, and features
which are <br>
present in csh(1) but not usually documented are labeled
with &lsquo;(u)&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Argument list processing <br>
If the first argument (argument 0) to the shell is
&lsquo;-&rsquo; then it is a login shell. A login shell can
be also specified by invoking the shell with the -l flag as
the only argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rest of the flag arguments
are interpreted as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Forces a
&lsquo;&lsquo;break&rsquo;&rsquo; from option processing,
causing any further shell arguments to be treated as
non-option arguments. The remaining arguments will not be
interpreted as <br>
shell options. This may be used to pass options to a shell
script without confusion or possible subterfuge. The shell
will not run a set-user ID script without this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Commands are read from the
following argument (which must be present, and must be a
single argument), stored in the command shell variable for
reference, and executed. Any <br>
remaining arguments are placed in the argv shell
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d The shell loads the directory
stack from ~/.cshdirs as described under Startup and
shutdown, whether or not it is a login shell. (+)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dname[=value] <br>
Sets the environment variable name to value. (Domain/OS
only) (+)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e The shell exits if any
invoked command terminates abnormally or yields a non-zero
exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f The shell does not load any
resource or startup files, or perform any command hashing,
and thus starts faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F The shell uses fork(2)
instead of vfork(2) to spawn processes. (+)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i The shell is interactive and
prompts for its top-level input, even if it appears to not
be a terminal. Shells are interactive without this option if
their inputs and outputs <br>
are terminals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l The shell is a login shell.
Applicable only if -l is the only flag specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m The shell loads ~/.tcshrc
even if it does not belong to the effective user. Newer
versions of su(1) can pass -m to the shell. (+)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n The shell parses commands but
does not execute them. This aids in debugging shell
scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q The shell accepts SIGQUIT
(see Signal handling) and behaves when it is used under a
debugger. Job control is disabled. (u)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Command input is taken from
the standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t The shell reads and executes
a single line of input. A &lsquo;&acute; may be used to
escape the newline at the end of this line and continue onto
another line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Sets the verbose shell
variable, so that command input is echoed after history
substitution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Sets the echo shell variable,
so that commands are echoed immediately before
execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Sets the verbose shell
variable even before executing ~/.tcshrc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X Is to -x as -V is to -v.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
Print a help message on the standard output and exit.
(+)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print the version/platform/compilation options on the
standard output and exit. This information is also contained
in the version shell variable. (+)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After processing of flag
arguments, if arguments remain but none of the -c, -i, -s,
or -t options were given, the first argument is taken as the
name of a file of commands, or <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;script&rsquo;&rsquo;, to be executed. The
shell opens this file and saves its name for possible
resubstitution by &lsquo;$0&rsquo;. Because many systems use
either the standard version 6 or version <br>
7 shells whose shell scripts are not compatible with this
shell, the shell uses such a &lsquo;standard&rsquo; shell to
execute a script whose first character is not a
&lsquo;#&rsquo;, i.e., that does <br>
not start with a comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remaining arguments are placed
in the argv shell variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Startup and shutdown <br>
A login shell begins by executing commands from the system
files /etc/csh.cshrc and /etc/csh.login. It then executes
commands from files in the user&rsquo;s home directory:
first <br>
~/.tcshrc (+) or, if ~/.tcshrc is not found, ~/.cshrc, then
~/.history (or the value of the histfile shell variable),
then ~/.login, and finally ~/.cshdirs (or the value of the
<br>
dirsfile shell variable) (+). The shell may read
/etc/csh.login before instead of after /etc/csh.cshrc, and
~/.login before instead of after ~/.tcshrc or ~/.cshrc and
~/.his&acirc; <br>
tory, if so compiled; see the version shell variable.
(+)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-login shells read only
/etc/csh.cshrc and ~/.tcshrc or ~/.cshrc on startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For examples of startup files,
please consult http://tcshrc.sourceforge.net.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands like stty(1) and
tset(1), which need be run only once per login, usually go
in one&rsquo;s ~/.login file. Users who need to use the same
set of files with both csh(1) and <br>
tcsh can have only a ~/.cshrc which checks for the existence
of the tcsh shell variable (q.v.) before using tcsh-specific
commands, or can have both a ~/.cshrc and a ~/.tcshrc <br>
which sources (see the builtin command) ~/.cshrc. The rest
of this manual uses &lsquo;~/.tcshrc&rsquo; to mean
&lsquo;~/.tcshrc or, if ~/.tcshrc is not found,
~/.cshrc&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the normal case, the shell
begins reading commands from the terminal, prompting with
&lsquo;&gt; &rsquo;. (Processing of arguments and the use of
the shell to process files containing com&acirc; <br>
mand scripts are described later.) The shell repeatedly
reads a line of command input, breaks it into words, places
it on the command history list, parses it and executes each
<br>
command in the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One can log out by typing
&lsquo;^D&rsquo; on an empty line, &lsquo;logout&rsquo; or
&lsquo;login&rsquo; or via the shell&rsquo;s autologout
mechanism (see the autologout shell variable). When a login
shell terminates <br>
it sets the logout shell variable to &lsquo;normal&rsquo; or
&lsquo;automatic&rsquo; as appropriate, then executes
commands from the files /etc/csh.logout and ~/.logout. The
shell may drop DTR on <br>
logout if so compiled; see the version shell variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The names of the system login
and logout files vary from system to system for
compatibility with different csh(1) variants; see FILES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Editing <br>
We first describe The command-line editor. The Completion
and listing and Spelling correction sections describe two
sets of functionality that are implemented as editor
commands <br>
but which deserve their own treatment. Finally, Editor
commands lists and describes the editor commands specific to
the shell and their default bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command-line editor (+) <br>
Command-line input can be edited using key sequences much
like those used in GNU Emacs or vi(1). The editor is active
only when the edit shell variable is set, which it is by
<br>
default in interactive shells. The bindkey builtin can
display and change key bindings. Emacs-style key bindings
are used by default (unless the shell was compiled
otherwise; <br>
see the version shell variable), but bindkey can change the
key bindings to vi-style bindings en masse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shell always binds the arrow
keys (as defined in the TERMCAP environment variable) to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">down down-history <br>
up up-history <br>
left backward-char <br>
right forward-char</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unless doing so would alter
another single-character binding. One can set the arrow key
escape sequences to the empty string with settc to prevent
these bindings. The <br>
ANSI/VT100 sequences for arrow keys are always bound.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other key bindings are, for the
most part, what Emacs and vi(1) users would expect and can
easily be displayed by bindkey, so there is no need to list
them here. Likewise, bind&acirc; <br>
key can list the editor commands with a short description of
each.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that editor commands do not
have the same notion of a &lsquo;&lsquo;word&rsquo;&rsquo;
as does the shell. The editor delimits words with any
non-alphanumeric characters not in the shell variable <br>
wordchars, while the shell recognizes only whitespace and
some of the characters with special meanings to it, listed
under Lexical structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Completion and listing (+) <br>
The shell is often able to complete words when given a
unique abbreviation. Type part of a word (for example
&lsquo;ls /usr/lost&rsquo;) and hit the tab key to run the
complete-word editor <br>
command. The shell completes the filename
&lsquo;/usr/lost&rsquo; to &lsquo;/usr/lost+found/&rsquo;,
replacing the incomplete word with the complete word in the
input buffer. (Note the terminal &lsquo;/&rsquo;; <br>
completion adds a &lsquo;/&rsquo; to the end of completed
directories and a space to the end of other completed words,
to speed typing and provide a visual indicator of successful
comple&acirc; <br>
tion. The addsuffix shell variable can be unset to prevent
this.) If no match is found (perhaps
&lsquo;/usr/lost+found&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t exist), the
terminal bell rings. If the word is <br>
already complete (perhaps there is a &lsquo;/usr/lost&rsquo;
on your system, or perhaps you were thinking too far ahead
and typed the whole thing) a &lsquo;/&rsquo; or space is
added to the end if it <br>
isn&rsquo;t already there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Completion works anywhere in the
line, not at just the end; completed text pushes the rest of
the line to the right. Completion in the middle of a word
often results in leftover <br>
characters to the right of the cursor that need to be
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands and variables can be
completed in much the same way. For example, typing
&lsquo;em[tab]&rsquo; would complete &lsquo;em&rsquo; to
&lsquo;emacs&rsquo; if emacs were the only command on your
system begin&acirc; <br>
ning with &lsquo;em&rsquo;. Completion can find a command in
any directory in path or if given a full pathname. Typing
&lsquo;echo $ar[tab]&rsquo; would complete &lsquo;$ar&rsquo;
to &lsquo;$argv&rsquo; if no other variable <br>
began with &lsquo;ar&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shell parses the input
buffer to determine whether the word you want to complete
should be completed as a filename, command or variable. The
first word in the buffer and the <br>
first word following &lsquo;;&rsquo;, &lsquo;|&rsquo;,
&lsquo;|&amp;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&amp;&amp;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;||&rsquo; is considered to be a command. A word
beginning with &lsquo;$&rsquo; is considered to be a
variable. Anything else is a filename. An <br>
empty line is &lsquo;completed&rsquo; as a filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can list the possible
completions of a word at any time by typing &lsquo;^D&rsquo;
to run the delete-char-or-list-or-eof editor command. The
shell lists the possible completions using <br>
the ls-F builtin (q.v.) and reprints the prompt and
unfinished command line, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; ls /usr/l[^D] <br>
lbin/ lib/ local/ lost+found/ <br>
&gt; ls /usr/l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the autolist shell variable
is set, the shell lists the remaining choices (if any)
whenever completion fails:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; set autolist <br>
&gt; nm /usr/lib/libt[tab] <br>
libtermcap.a@ libtermlib.a@ <br>
&gt; nm /usr/lib/libterm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If autolist is set to
&lsquo;ambiguous&rsquo;, choices are listed only when
completion fails and adds no new characters to the word
being completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A filename to be completed can
contain variables, your own or others&rsquo; home
directories abbreviated with &lsquo;~&rsquo; (see Filename
substitution) and directory stack entries abbreviated <br>
with &lsquo;=&rsquo; (see Directory stack substitution). For
example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; ls ~k[^D] <br>
kahn kas kellogg <br>
&gt; ls ~ke[tab] <br>
&gt; ls ~kellogg/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; set local = /usr/local <br>
&gt; ls $lo[tab] <br>
&gt; ls $local/[^D] <br>
bin/ etc/ lib/ man/ src/ <br>
&gt; ls $local/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that variables can also be
expanded explicitly with the expand-variables editor
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete-char-or-list-or-eof lists
at only the end of the line; in the middle of a line it
deletes the character under the cursor and on an empty line
it logs one out or, if <br>
ignoreeof is set, does nothing. &lsquo;M-^D&rsquo;, bound to
the editor command list-choices, lists completion
possibilities anywhere on a line, and list-choices (or any
one of the related <br>
editor commands that do or don&rsquo;t delete, list and/or
log out, listed under delete-char-or-list-or-eof) can be
bound to &lsquo;^D&rsquo; with the bindkey builtin command
if so desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The complete-word-fwd and
complete-word-back editor commands (not bound to any keys by
default) can be used to cycle up and down through the list
of possible completions, replac&acirc; <br>
ing the current word with the next or previous word in the
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shell variable fignore can
be set to a list of suffixes to be ignored by completion.
Consider the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; ls <br>
Makefile condiments.h~ main.o side.c <br>
README main.c meal side.o <br>
condiments.h main.c~ <br>
&gt; set fignore = (.o &nbsp;) <br>
&gt; emacs ma[^D] <br>
main.c main.c~ main.o <br>
&gt; emacs ma[tab] <br>
&gt; emacs main.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;main.c~&rsquo; and
&lsquo;main.o&rsquo; are ignored by completion (but not
listing), because they end in suffixes in fignore. Note that
a &lsquo;&acute; was needed in front of &lsquo;~&rsquo; to
prevent it from being <br>
expanded to home as described under Filename substitution.
fignore is ignored if only one completion is possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the complete shell variable
is set to &lsquo;enhance&rsquo;, completion 1) ignores case
and 2) considers periods, hyphens and underscores
(&lsquo;.&rsquo;, &lsquo;-&rsquo; and &lsquo;_&rsquo;) to be
word separators and <br>
hyphens and underscores to be equivalent. If you had the
following files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comp.lang.c comp.lang.perl
comp.std.c++ <br>
comp.lang.c++ comp.std.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and typed &lsquo;mail -f
c.l.c[tab]&rsquo;, it would be completed to &lsquo;mail -f
comp.lang.c&rsquo;, and ^D would list
&lsquo;comp.lang.c&rsquo; and &lsquo;comp.lang.c++&rsquo;.
&lsquo;mail -f c..c++[^D]&rsquo; would list <br>
&lsquo;comp.lang.c++&rsquo; and &lsquo;comp.std.c++&rsquo;.
Typing &lsquo;rm a--file[^D]&rsquo; in the following
directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A_silly_file a-hyphenated-file
another_silly_file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would list all three files,
because case is ignored and hyphens and underscores are
equivalent. Periods, however, are not equivalent to hyphens
or underscores.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the complete shell variable
is set to &lsquo;Enhance&rsquo;, completion ignores case and
differences between a hyphen and an underscore word
separator only when the user types a lowercase <br>
character or a hyphen. Entering an uppercase character or an
underscore will not match the corresponding lowercase
character or hyphen word separator. Typing &lsquo;rm
a--file[^D]&rsquo; <br>
in the directory of the previous example would still list
all three files, but typing &lsquo;rm A--file&rsquo; would
match only &lsquo;A_silly_file&rsquo; and typing &lsquo;rm
a__file[^D]&rsquo; would match just <br>
&lsquo;A_silly_file&rsquo; and
&lsquo;another_silly_file&rsquo; because the user explicitly
used an uppercase or an underscore character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Completion and listing are
affected by several other shell variables: recexact can be
set to complete on the shortest possible unique match, even
if more typing might result in a <br>
longer match:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; ls <br>
fodder foo food foonly <br>
&gt; set recexact <br>
&gt; rm fo[tab]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">just beeps, because
&lsquo;fo&rsquo; could expand to &lsquo;fod&rsquo; or
&lsquo;foo&rsquo;, but if we type another
&lsquo;o&rsquo;,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; rm foo[tab] <br>
&gt; rm foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the completion completes on
&lsquo;foo&rsquo;, even though &lsquo;food&rsquo; and
&lsquo;foonly&rsquo; also match. autoexpand can be set to
run the expand-history editor command before each completion
attempt, <br>
autocorrect can be set to spelling-correct the word to be
completed (see Spelling correction) before each completion
attempt and correct can be set to complete commands
automati&acirc; <br>
cally after one hits &lsquo;return&rsquo;. matchbeep can be
set to make completion beep or not beep in a variety of
situations, and nobeep can be set to never beep at all.
nostat can be <br>
set to a list of directories and/or patterns that match
directories to prevent the completion mechanism from
stat(2)ing those directories. listmax and listmaxrows can be
set to <br>
limit the number of items and rows (respectively) that are
listed without asking first. recognize_only_executables can
be set to make the shell list only executables when
list&acirc; <br>
ing commands, but it is quite slow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, the complete builtin
command can be used to tell the shell how to complete words
other than filenames, commands and variables. Completion and
listing do not work on <br>
glob-patterns (see Filename substitution), but the list-glob
and expand-glob editor commands perform equivalent functions
for glob-patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spelling correction (+) <br>
The shell can sometimes correct the spelling of filenames,
commands and variable names as well as completing and
listing them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Individual words can be
spelling-corrected with the spell-word editor command
(usually bound to M-s and M-S) and the entire input buffer
with spell-line (usually bound to M-$). <br>
The correct shell variable can be set to &lsquo;cmd&rsquo;
to correct the command name or &lsquo;all&rsquo; to correct
the entire line each time return is typed, and autocorrect
can be set to correct <br>
the word to be completed before each completion attempt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When spelling correction is
invoked in any of these ways and the shell thinks that any
part of the command line is misspelled, it prompts with the
corrected line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; set correct = cmd <br>
&gt; lz /usr/bin <br>
CORRECT&gt;ls /usr/bin (y|n|e|a)?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One can answer &lsquo;y&rsquo;
or space to execute the corrected line, &lsquo;e&rsquo; to
leave the uncorrected command in the input buffer,
&lsquo;a&rsquo; to abort the command as if &lsquo;^C&rsquo;
had been hit, and any&acirc; <br>
thing else to execute the original line unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spelling correction recognizes
user-defined completions (see the complete builtin command).
If an input word in a position for which a completion is
defined resembles a word in <br>
the completion list, spelling correction registers a
misspelling and suggests the latter word as a correction.
However, if the input word does not match any of the
possible com&acirc; <br>
pletions for that position, spelling correction does not
register a misspelling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like completion, spelling
correction works anywhere in the line, pushing the rest of
the line to the right and possibly leaving extra characters
to the right of the cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beware: spelling correction is
not guaranteed to work the way one intends, and is provided
mostly as an experimental feature. Suggestions and
improvements are welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Editor commands (+) <br>
&lsquo;bindkey&rsquo; lists key bindings and &lsquo;bindkey
-l&rsquo; lists and briefly describes editor commands. Only
new or especially interesting editor commands are described
here. See emacs(1) <br>
and vi(1) for descriptions of each editor&rsquo;s key
bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The character or characters to
which each command is bound by default is given in
parentheses. &lsquo;^character&rsquo; means a control
character and &lsquo;M-character&rsquo; a meta character,
typed <br>
as escape-character on terminals without a meta key. Case
counts, but commands that are bound to letters by default
are bound to both lower- and uppercase letters for
conve&acirc; <br>
nience.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">complete-word (tab) <br>
Completes a word as described under Completion and
listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">complete-word-back (not bound)
<br>
Like complete-word-fwd, but steps up from the end of the
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">complete-word-fwd (not bound)
<br>
Replaces the current word with the first word in the list of
possible completions. May be repeated to step down through
the list. At the end of the list, beeps and <br>
reverts to the incomplete word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">complete-word-raw (^X-tab) <br>
Like complete-word, but ignores user-defined
completions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copy-prev-word (M-^_) <br>
Copies the previous word in the current line into the input
buffer. See also insert-last-word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dabbrev-expand (M-/) <br>
Expands the current word to the most recent preceding one
for which the current is a leading substring, wrapping
around the history list (once) if necessary. Repeating <br>
dabbrev-expand without any intervening typing changes to the
next previous word etc., skipping identical matches much
like history-search-backward does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete-char (not bound) <br>
Deletes the character under the cursor. See also
delete-char-or-list-or-eof.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete-char-or-eof (not bound)
<br>
Does delete-char if there is a character under the cursor or
end-of-file on an empty line. See also
delete-char-or-list-or-eof.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete-char-or-list (not bound)
<br>
Does delete-char if there is a character under the cursor or
list-choices at the end of the line. See also
delete-char-or-list-or-eof.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete-char-or-list-or-eof (^D)
<br>
Does delete-char if there is a character under the cursor,
list-choices at the end of the line or end-of-file on an
empty line. See also those three commands, each of <br>
which does only a single action, and delete-char-or-eof,
delete-char-or-list and list-or-eof, each of which does a
different two out of the three.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">down-history (down-arrow, ^N)
<br>
Like up-history, but steps down, stopping at the original
input line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">end-of-file (not bound) <br>
Signals an end of file, causing the shell to exit unless the
ignoreeof shell variable (q.v.) is set to prevent this. See
also delete-char-or-list-or-eof.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expand-history (M-space) <br>
Expands history substitutions in the current word. See
History substitution. See also magic-space,
toggle-literal-history and the autoexpand shell
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expand-glob (^X-*) <br>
Expands the glob-pattern to the left of the cursor. See
Filename substitution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expand-line (not bound) <br>
Like expand-history, but expands history substitutions in
each word in the input buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expand-variables (^X-$) <br>
Expands the variable to the left of the cursor. See Variable
substitution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">history-search-backward (M-p,
M-P) <br>
Searches backwards through the history list for a command
beginning with the current contents of the input buffer up
to the cursor and copies it into the input buffer. <br>
The search string may be a glob-pattern (see Filename
substitution) containing &lsquo;*&rsquo;, &lsquo;?&rsquo;,
&lsquo;[]&rsquo; or &lsquo;{}&rsquo;. up-history and
down-history will proceed from the appropriate <br>
point in the history list. Emacs mode only. See also
history-search-forward and i-search-back.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">history-search-forward (M-n,
M-N) <br>
Like history-search-backward, but searches forward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i-search-back (not bound) <br>
Searches backward like history-search-backward, copies the
first match into the input buffer with the cursor positioned
at the end of the pattern, and prompts with &lsquo;bck: <br>
&rsquo; and the first match. Additional characters may be
typed to extend the search, i-search-back may be typed to
continue searching with the same pattern, wrapping around
<br>
the history list if necessary, (i-search-back must be bound
to a single character for this to work) or one of the
following special characters may be typed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^W Appends the rest of the word
under the cursor to the search pattern. <br>
delete (or any character bound to backward-delete-char) <br>
Undoes the effect of the last character typed and deletes a
character from the search pattern if appropriate. <br>
^G If the previous search was successful, aborts the entire
search. If not, goes back to the last successful search.
<br>
escape Ends the search, leaving the current line in the
input buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other character not bound to
self-insert-command terminates the search, leaving the
current line in the input buffer, and is then interpreted as
normal input. In <br>
particular, a carriage return causes the current line to be
executed. Emacs mode only. See also i-search-fwd and
history-search-backward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i-search-fwd (not bound) <br>
Like i-search-back, but searches forward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">insert-last-word (M-_) <br>
Inserts the last word of the previous input line
(&lsquo;!$&rsquo;) into the input buffer. See also
copy-prev-word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-choices (M-^D) <br>
Lists completion possibilities as described under Completion
and listing. See also delete-char-or-list-or-eof and
list-choices-raw.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-choices-raw (^X-^D) <br>
Like list-choices, but ignores user-defined completions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-glob (^X-g, ^X-G) <br>
Lists (via the ls-F builtin) matches to the glob-pattern
(see Filename substitution) to the left of the cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-or-eof (not bound) <br>
Does list-choices or end-of-file on an empty line. See also
delete-char-or-list-or-eof.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">magic-space (not bound) <br>
Expands history substitutions in the current line, like
expand-history, and inserts a space. magic-space is designed
to be bound to the space bar, but is not bound by <br>
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">normalize-command (^X-?) <br>
Searches for the current word in PATH and, if it is found,
replaces it with the full path to the executable. Special
characters are quoted. Aliases are expanded and <br>
quoted but commands within aliases are not. This command is
useful with commands that take commands as arguments, e.g.,
&lsquo;dbx&rsquo; and &lsquo;sh -x&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">normalize-path (^X-n, ^X-N) <br>
Expands the current word as described under the
&lsquo;expand&rsquo; setting of the symlinks shell
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">overwrite-mode (unbound) <br>
Toggles between input and overwrite modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">run-fg-editor (M-^Z) <br>
Saves the current input line and looks for a stopped job
with a name equal to the last component of the file name
part of the EDITOR or VISUAL environment variables, or, <br>
if neither is set, &lsquo;ed&rsquo; or &lsquo;vi&rsquo;. If
such a job is found, it is restarted as if &lsquo;fg
%job&rsquo; had been typed. This is used to toggle back and
forth between an editor and the <br>
shell easily. Some people bind this command to
&lsquo;^Z&rsquo; so they can do this even more easily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">run-help (M-h, M-H) <br>
Searches for documentation on the current command, using the
same notion of &lsquo;current command&rsquo; as the
completion routines, and prints it. There is no way to use a
pager; <br>
run-help is designed for short help files. If the special
alias helpcommand is defined, it is run with the command
name as a sole argument. Else, documentation should <br>
be in a file named command.help, command.1, command.6,
command.8 or command, which should be in one of the
directories listed in the HPATH environment variable. If
there <br>
is more than one help file only the first is printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">self-insert-command (text
characters) <br>
In insert mode (the default), inserts the typed character
into the input line after the character under the cursor. In
overwrite mode, replaces the character under the <br>
cursor with the typed character. The input mode is normally
preserved between lines, but the inputmode shell variable
can be set to &lsquo;insert&rsquo; or
&lsquo;overwrite&rsquo; to put the <br>
editor in that mode at the beginning of each line. See also
overwrite-mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sequence-lead-in (arrow prefix,
meta prefix, ^X) <br>
Indicates that the following characters are part of a
multi-key sequence. Binding a command to a multi-key
sequence really creates two bindings: the first character to
<br>
sequence-lead-in and the whole sequence to the command. All
sequences beginning with a character bound to
sequence-lead-in are effectively bound to undefined-key
unless <br>
bound to another command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spell-line (M-$) <br>
Attempts to correct the spelling of each word in the input
buffer, like spell-word, but ignores words whose first
character is one of &lsquo;-&rsquo;, &lsquo;!&rsquo;,
&lsquo;^&rsquo; or &lsquo;%&rsquo;, or which con&acirc; <br>
tain &lsquo;&acute;, &lsquo;*&rsquo; or &lsquo;?&rsquo;, to
avoid problems with switches, substitutions and the like.
See Spelling correction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spell-word (M-s, M-S) <br>
Attempts to correct the spelling of the current word as
described under Spelling correction. Checks each component
of a word which appears to be a pathname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">toggle-literal-history (M-r,
M-R) <br>
Expands or &lsquo;unexpands&rsquo; history substitutions in
the input buffer. See also expand-history and the autoexpand
shell variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">undefined-key (any unbound key)
<br>
Beeps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">up-history (up-arrow, ^P) <br>
Copies the previous entry in the history list into the input
buffer. If histlit is set, uses the literal form of the
entry. May be repeated to step up through the his&acirc;
<br>
tory list, stopping at the top.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vi-search-back (?) <br>
Prompts with &lsquo;?&rsquo; for a search string (which may
be a glob-pattern, as with history-search-backward),
searches for it and copies it into the input buffer. The
bell rings <br>
if no match is found. Hitting return ends the search and
leaves the last match in the input buffer. Hitting escape
ends the search and executes the match. vi mode <br>
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vi-search-fwd (/) <br>
Like vi-search-back, but searches forward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which-command (M-?) <br>
Does a which (see the description of the builtin command) on
the first word of the input buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yank-pop (M-y) <br>
When executed immediately after a yank or another yank-pop,
replaces the yanked string with the next previous string
from the killring. This also has the effect of rotat&acirc;
<br>
ing the killring, such that this string will be considered
the most recently killed by a later yank command. Repeating
yank-pop will cycle through the killring any number <br>
of times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lexical structure <br>
The shell splits input lines into words at blanks and tabs.
The special characters &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo;, &lsquo;|&rsquo;,
&lsquo;;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&lt;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&gt;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;(&rsquo;, and &lsquo;)&rsquo; and the doubled
characters &lsquo;&amp;&amp;&rsquo;, &lsquo;||&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lt;&lt;&rsquo; and &lsquo;&gt;&gt;&rsquo; are <br>
always separate words, whether or not they are surrounded by
whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the shell&rsquo;s input is
not a terminal, the character &lsquo;#&rsquo; is taken to
begin a comment. Each &lsquo;#&rsquo; and the rest of the
input line on which it appears is discarded before further
<br>
parsing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A special character (including a
blank or tab) may be prevented from having its special
meaning, and possibly made part of another word, by
preceding it with a backslash (&lsquo;&acute;) or <br>
enclosing it in single (&lsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo;), double
(&lsquo;&quot;&rsquo;) or backward (&lsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;)
quotes. When not otherwise quoted a newline preceded by a
&lsquo;&acute; is equivalent to a blank, but inside quotes
this <br>
sequence results in a newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, all Substitutions
(see below) except History substitution can be prevented by
enclosing the strings (or parts of strings) in which they
appear with single quotes or <br>
by quoting the crucial character(s) (e.g., &lsquo;$&rsquo;
or &lsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo; for Variable substitution or
Command substitution respectively) with &lsquo;&acute;.
(Alias substitution is no exception: quoting in <br>
any way any character of a word for which an alias has been
defined prevents substitution of the alias. The usual way of
quoting an alias is to precede it with a backslash.) <br>
History substitution is prevented by backslashes but not by
single quotes. Strings quoted with double or backward quotes
undergo Variable substitution and Command substitution, <br>
but other substitutions are prevented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text inside single or double
quotes becomes a single word (or part of one).
Metacharacters in these strings, including blanks and tabs,
do not form separate words. Only in one <br>
special case (see Command substitution below) can a
double-quoted string yield parts of more than one word;
single-quoted strings never do. Backward quotes are special:
they <br>
signal Command substitution (q.v.), which may result in more
than one word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quoting complex strings,
particularly strings which themselves contain quoting
characters, can be confusing. Remember that quotes need not
be used as they are in human writing! <br>
It may be easier to quote not an entire string, but only
those parts of the string which need quoting, using
different types of quoting to do so if appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The backslash_quote shell
variable (q.v.) can be set to make backslashes always quote
&lsquo;&acute;, &lsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;&quot;&rsquo;. (+) This may make complex quoting
tasks easier, but it can cause syntax <br>
errors in csh(1) scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Substitutions <br>
We now describe the various transformations the shell
performs on the input in the order in which they occur. We
note in passing the data structures involved and the
commands <br>
and variables which affect them. Remember that substitutions
can be prevented by quoting as described under Lexical
structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">History substitution <br>
Each command, or &lsquo;&lsquo;event&rsquo;&rsquo;, input
from the terminal is saved in the history list. The previous
command is always saved, and the history shell variable can
be set to a number to <br>
save that many commands. The histdup shell variable can be
set to not save duplicate events or consecutive duplicate
events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Saved commands are numbered
sequentially from 1 and stamped with the time. It is not
usually necessary to use event numbers, but the current
event number can be made part of the <br>
prompt by placing an &lsquo;!&rsquo; in the prompt shell
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shell actually saves history
in expanded and literal (unexpanded) forms. If the histlit
shell variable is set, commands that display and store
history use the literal form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The history builtin command can
print, store in a file, restore and clear the history list
at any time, and the savehist and histfile shell variables
can be set to store the his&acirc; <br>
tory list automatically on logout and restore it on
login.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">History substitutions introduce
words from the history list into the input stream, making it
easy to repeat commands, repeat arguments of a previous
command in the current com&acirc; <br>
mand, or fix spelling mistakes in the previous command with
little typing and a high degree of confidence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">History substitutions begin with
the character &lsquo;!&rsquo;. They may begin anywhere in
the input stream, but they do not nest. The &lsquo;!&rsquo;
may be preceded by a &lsquo;&acute; to prevent its special
<br>
meaning; for convenience, a &lsquo;!&rsquo; is passed
unchanged when it is followed by a blank, tab, newline,
&lsquo;=&rsquo; or &lsquo;(&rsquo;. History substitutions
also occur when an input line begins with <br>
&lsquo;^&rsquo;. This special abbreviation will be described
later. The characters used to signal history substitution
(&lsquo;!&rsquo; and &lsquo;^&rsquo;) can be changed by
setting the histchars shell variable. <br>
Any input line which contains a history substitution is
printed before it is executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A history substitution may have
an &lsquo;&lsquo;event specification&rsquo;&rsquo;, which
indicates the event from which words are to be taken, a
&lsquo;&lsquo;word designator&rsquo;&rsquo;, which selects
particular words from <br>
the chosen event, and/or a
&lsquo;&lsquo;modifier&rsquo;&rsquo;, which manipulates the
selected words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An event specification can
be</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n A number, referring to a
particular event <br>
-n An offset, referring to the event n before the current
event <br>
# The current event. This should be used carefully in
csh(1), where there is no check for recursion. tcsh allows
10 levels of recursion. (+) <br>
! The previous event (equivalent to &lsquo;-1&rsquo;) <br>
s The most recent event whose first word begins with the
string s <br>
?s? The most recent event which contains the string s. The
second &lsquo;?&rsquo; can be omitted if it is immediately
followed by a newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, consider this bit
of someone&rsquo;s history list:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9 8:30 nroff -man wumpus.man
<br>
10 8:31 cp wumpus.man wumpus.man.old <br>
11 8:36 vi wumpus.man <br>
12 8:37 diff wumpus.man.old wumpus.man</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The commands are shown with
their event numbers and time stamps. The current event,
which we haven&rsquo;t typed in yet, is event 13.
&lsquo;!11&rsquo; and &lsquo;!-2&rsquo; refer to event 11.
&lsquo;!!&rsquo; refers <br>
to the previous event, 12. &lsquo;!!&rsquo; can be
abbreviated &lsquo;!&rsquo; if it is followed by
&lsquo;:&rsquo; (&lsquo;:&rsquo; is described below).
&lsquo;!n&rsquo; refers to event 9, which begins with
&lsquo;n&rsquo;. &lsquo;!?old?&rsquo; also refers <br>
to event 12, which contains &lsquo;old&rsquo;. Without word
designators or modifiers history references simply expand to
the entire event, so we might type &lsquo;!cp&rsquo; to redo
the copy command or <br>
&lsquo;!!|more&rsquo; if the &lsquo;diff&rsquo; output
scrolled off the top of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">History references may be
insulated from the surrounding text with braces if
necessary. For example, &lsquo;!vdoc&rsquo; would look for a
command beginning with &lsquo;vdoc&rsquo;, and, in this
exam&acirc; <br>
ple, not find one, but &lsquo;!{v}doc&rsquo; would expand
unambiguously to &lsquo;vi wumpus.mandoc&rsquo;. Even in
braces, history substitutions do not nest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(+) While csh(1) expands, for
example, &lsquo;!3d&rsquo; to event 3 with the letter
&lsquo;d&rsquo; appended to it, tcsh expands it to the last
event beginning with &lsquo;3d&rsquo;; only completely
numeric argu&acirc; <br>
ments are treated as event numbers. This makes it possible
to recall events beginning with numbers. To expand
&lsquo;!3d&rsquo; as in csh(1) say &lsquo;!{3}d&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To select words from an event we
can follow the event specification by a &lsquo;:&rsquo; and
a designator for the desired words. The words of an input
line are numbered from 0, the first <br>
(usually command) word being 0, the second word (first
argument) being 1, etc. The basic word designators are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 The first (command) word <br>
n The nth argument <br>
^ The first argument, equivalent to &lsquo;1&rsquo; <br>
$ The last argument <br>
% The word matched by an ?s? search <br>
x-y A range of words <br>
-y Equivalent to &lsquo;0-y&rsquo; <br>
* Equivalent to &lsquo;^-$&rsquo;, but returns nothing if
the event contains only 1 word <br>
x* Equivalent to &lsquo;x-$&rsquo; <br>
x- Equivalent to &lsquo;x*&rsquo;, but omitting the last
word (&lsquo;$&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected words are inserted into
the command line separated by single blanks. For example,
the &lsquo;diff&rsquo; command in the previous example might
have been typed as &lsquo;diff !!:1.old <br>
!!:1&rsquo; (using &lsquo;:1&rsquo; to select the first
argument from the previous event) or &lsquo;diff !-2:2
!-2:1&rsquo; to select and swap the arguments from the
&lsquo;cp&rsquo; command. If we didn&rsquo;t care about the
<br>
order of the &lsquo;diff&rsquo; we might have said
&lsquo;diff !-2:1-2&rsquo; or simply &lsquo;diff
!-2:*&rsquo;. The &lsquo;cp&rsquo; command might have been
written &lsquo;cp wumpus.man !#:1.old&rsquo;, using
&lsquo;#&rsquo; to refer to the cur&acirc; <br>
rent event. &lsquo;!n:- hurkle.man&rsquo; would reuse the
first two words from the &lsquo;nroff&rsquo; command to say
&lsquo;nroff -man hurkle.man&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lsquo;:&rsquo; separating
the event specification from the word designator can be
omitted if the argument selector begins with a
&lsquo;^&rsquo;, &lsquo;$&rsquo;, &lsquo;*&rsquo;,
&lsquo;%&rsquo; or &lsquo;-&rsquo;. For example, our
&lsquo;diff&rsquo; com&acirc; <br>
mand might have been &lsquo;diff !!^.old !!^&rsquo; or,
equivalently, &lsquo;diff !!$.old !!$&rsquo;. However, if
&lsquo;!!&rsquo; is abbreviated &lsquo;!&rsquo;, an argument
selector beginning with &lsquo;-&rsquo; will be interpreted
as <br>
an event specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A history reference may have a
word designator but no event specification. It then
references the previous command. Continuing our
&lsquo;diff&rsquo; example, we could have said simply <br>
&lsquo;diff !^.old !^&rsquo; or, to get the arguments in the
opposite order, just &lsquo;diff !*&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The word or words in a history
reference can be edited, or
&lsquo;&lsquo;modified&rsquo;&rsquo;, by following it with
one or more modifiers, each preceded by a
&lsquo;:&rsquo;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h Remove a trailing pathname
component, leaving the head. <br>
t Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the tail.
<br>
r Remove a filename extension &lsquo;.xxx&rsquo;, leaving
the root name. <br>
e Remove all but the extension. <br>
u Uppercase the first lowercase letter. <br>
l Lowercase the first uppercase letter. <br>
s/l/r/ Substitute l for r. l is simply a string like r, not
a regular expression as in the eponymous ed(1) command. Any
character may be used as the delimiter in place of <br>
&lsquo;/&rsquo;; a &lsquo;&acute; can be used to quote the
delimiter expect &lsquo;(&rsquo;, &lsquo;)&rsquo;,
&lsquo;|&rsquo; and &lsquo;&gt;&rsquo; inside l and r. The
character &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; in the r is replaced by l;
&lsquo;&acute; also quotes &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo;. If l is <br>
empty (&lsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo;), the l from a previous
substitution or the s from a previous search or event number
in event specification is used. The trailing delimiter may
be omit&acirc; <br>
ted if it is immediately followed by a newline. <br>
&amp; Repeat the previous substitution. <br>
g Apply the following modifier once to each word. <br>
a (+) Apply the following modifier as many times as possible
to a single word. &lsquo;a&rsquo; and &lsquo;g&rsquo; can be
used together to apply a modifier globally. With the
&lsquo;s&rsquo; modifier, only <br>
the patterns contained in the original word are substituted,
not patterns that contain any substitution result. <br>
p Print the new command line but do not execute it. <br>
q Quote the substituted words, preventing further
substitutions. <br>
x Like q, but break into words at blanks, tabs and
newlines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modifiers are applied to only
the first modifiable word (unless &lsquo;g&rsquo; is used).
It is an error for no word to be modifiable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the
&lsquo;diff&rsquo; command might have been written as
&lsquo;diff wumpus.man.old !#^:r&rsquo;, using
&lsquo;:r&rsquo; to remove &lsquo;.old&rsquo; from the first
argument on the same line (&lsquo;!#^&rsquo;). We could <br>
say &lsquo;echo hello out there&rsquo;, then &lsquo;echo
!*:u&rsquo; to capitalize &lsquo;hello&rsquo;, &lsquo;echo
!*:au&rsquo; to say it out loud, or &lsquo;echo
!*:agu&rsquo; to really shout. We might follow &lsquo;mail
-s &quot;I forgot my <br>
password&quot; rot&rsquo; with &lsquo;!:s/rot/root&rsquo; to
correct the spelling of &lsquo;root&rsquo; (but see Spelling
correction for a different approach).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a special abbreviation
for substitutions. &lsquo;^&rsquo;, when it is the first
character on an input line, is equivalent to
&lsquo;!:s^&rsquo;. Thus we might have said
&lsquo;^rot^root&rsquo; to make <br>
the spelling correction in the previous example. This is the
only history substitution which does not explicitly begin
with &lsquo;!&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(+) In csh as such, only one
modifier may be applied to each history or variable
expansion. In tcsh, more than one may be used, for
example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% mv wumpus.man
/usr/man/man1/wumpus.1 <br>
% man !$:t:r <br>
man wumpus</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In csh, the result would be
&lsquo;wumpus.1:r&rsquo;. A substitution followed by a colon
may need to be insulated from it with braces:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; mv a.out /usr/games/wumpus
<br>
&gt; setenv PATH !$:h:$PATH <br>
Bad ! modifier: $. <br>
&gt; setenv PATH !{-2$:h}:$PATH <br>
setenv PATH /usr/games:/bin:/usr/bin:.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first attempt would succeed
in csh but fails in tcsh, because tcsh expects another
modifier after the second colon rather than
&lsquo;$&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, history can be accessed
through the editor as well as through the substitutions just
described. The up- and down-history, history-search-backward
and -forward, i- <br>
search-back and -fwd, vi-search-back and -fwd,
copy-prev-word and insert-last-word editor commands search
for events in the history list and copy them into the input
buffer. The <br>
toggle-literal-history editor command switches between the
expanded and literal forms of history lines in the input
buffer. expand-history and expand-line expand history
substi&acirc; <br>
tutions in the current word and in the entire input buffer
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alias substitution <br>
The shell maintains a list of aliases which can be set,
unset and printed by the alias and unalias commands. After a
command line is parsed into simple commands (see Commands)
<br>
the first word of each command, left-to-right, is checked to
see if it has an alias. If so, the first word is replaced by
the alias. If the alias contains a history reference, <br>
it undergoes History substitution (q.v.) as though the
original command were the previous input line. If the alias
does not contain a history reference, the argument list is
<br>
left untouched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus if the alias for
&lsquo;ls&rsquo; were &lsquo;ls -l&rsquo; the command
&lsquo;ls /usr&rsquo; would become &lsquo;ls -l /usr&rsquo;,
the argument list here being undisturbed. If the alias for
&lsquo;lookup&rsquo; were &lsquo;grep !^ <br>
/etc/passwd&rsquo; then &lsquo;lookup bill&rsquo; would
become &lsquo;grep bill /etc/passwd&rsquo;. Aliases can be
used to introduce parser metasyntax. For example,
&lsquo;alias print &rsquo;pr * | lpr&rsquo;&rsquo; defines a
<br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;command&rsquo;&rsquo; (&lsquo;print&rsquo;)
which pr(1)s its arguments to the line printer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alias substitution is repeated
until the first word of the command has no alias. If an
alias substitution does not change the first word (as in the
previous example) it is <br>
flagged to prevent a loop. Other loops are detected and
cause an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some aliases are referred to by
the shell; see Special aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable substitution <br>
The shell maintains a list of variables, each of which has
as value a list of zero or more words. The values of shell
variables can be displayed and changed with the set and <br>
unset commands. The system maintains its own list of
&lsquo;&lsquo;environment&rsquo;&rsquo; variables. These can
be displayed and changed with printenv, setenv and
unsetenv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(+) Variables may be made
read-only with &lsquo;set -r&rsquo; (q.v.). Read-only
variables may not be modified or unset; attempting to do so
will cause an error. Once made read-only, a <br>
variable cannot be made writable, so &lsquo;set -r&rsquo;
should be used with caution. Environment variables cannot be
made read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some variables are set by the
shell or referred to by it. For instance, the argv variable
is an image of the shell&rsquo;s argument list, and words of
this variable&rsquo;s value are <br>
referred to in special ways. Some of the variables referred
to by the shell are toggles; the shell does not care what
their value is, only whether they are set or not. For <br>
instance, the verbose variable is a toggle which causes
command input to be echoed. The -v command line option sets
this variable. Special shell variables lists all variables
<br>
which are referred to by the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other operations treat variables
numerically. The &lsquo;@&rsquo; command permits numeric
calculations to be performed and the result assigned to a
variable. Variable values are, however, <br>
always represented as (zero or more) strings. For the
purposes of numeric operations, the null string is
considered to be zero, and the second and subsequent words
of multi-word <br>
values are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the input line is aliased
and parsed, and before each command is executed, variable
substitution is performed keyed by &lsquo;$&rsquo;
characters. This expansion can be prevented by <br>
preceding the &lsquo;$&rsquo; with a &lsquo;&acute; except
within &lsquo;&quot;&rsquo;s where it always occurs, and
within &lsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo;s where it never occurs. Strings
quoted by &lsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo; are interpreted later (see
Command substitu&acirc; <br>
tion below) so &lsquo;$&rsquo; substitution does not occur
there until later, if at all. A &lsquo;$&rsquo; is passed
unchanged if followed by a blank, tab, or end-of-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input/output redirections are
recognized before variable expansion, and are variable
expanded separately. Otherwise, the command name and entire
argument list are expanded <br>
together. It is thus possible for the first (command) word
(to this point) to generate more than one word, the first of
which becomes the command name, and the rest of which <br>
become arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless enclosed in
&lsquo;&quot;&rsquo; or given the &lsquo;:q&rsquo; modifier
the results of variable substitution may eventually be
command and filename substituted. Within
&lsquo;&quot;&rsquo;, a variable whose value <br>
consists of multiple words expands to a (portion of a)
single word, with the words of the variable&rsquo;s value
separated by blanks. When the &lsquo;:q&rsquo; modifier is
applied to a substitu&acirc; <br>
tion the variable will expand to multiple words with each
word separated by a blank and quoted to prevent later
command or filename substitution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following metasequences are
provided for introducing variable values into the shell
input. Except as noted, it is an error to reference a
variable which is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$name <br>
${name} Substitutes the words of the value of variable name,
each separated by a blank. Braces insulate name from
following characters which would otherwise be part of it.
<br>
Shell variables have names consisting of letters and digits
starting with a letter. The underscore character is
considered a letter. If name is not a shell variable, <br>
but is set in the environment, then that value is returned
(but some of the other forms given below are not available
in this case). <br>
$name[selector] <br>
${name[selector]} <br>
Substitutes only the selected words from the value of name.
The selector is subjected to &lsquo;$&rsquo; substitution
and may consist of a single number or two numbers separated
by <br>
a &lsquo;-&rsquo;. The first word of a variable&rsquo;s
value is numbered &lsquo;1&rsquo;. If the first number of a
range is omitted it defaults to &lsquo;1&rsquo;. If the last
member of a range is omitted it <br>
defaults to &lsquo;$#name&rsquo;. The selector
&lsquo;*&rsquo; selects all words. It is not an error for a
range to be empty if the second argument is omitted or in
range. <br>
$0 Substitutes the name of the file from which command input
is being read. An error occurs if the name is not known.
<br>
$number <br>
${number} <br>
Equivalent to &lsquo;$argv[number]&rsquo;. <br>
$* Equivalent to &lsquo;$argv&rsquo;, which is equivalent to
&lsquo;$argv[*]&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lsquo;:&rsquo; modifiers
described under History substitution, except for
&lsquo;:p&rsquo;, can be applied to the substitutions above.
More than one may be used. (+) Braces may be needed to
insu&acirc; <br>
late a variable substitution from a literal colon just as
with History substitution (q.v.); any modifiers must appear
within the braces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following substitutions can
not be modified with &lsquo;:&rsquo; modifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$?name <br>
${?name} <br>
Substitutes the string &lsquo;1&rsquo; if name is set,
&lsquo;0&rsquo; if it is not. <br>
$?0 Substitutes &lsquo;1&rsquo; if the current input
filename is known, &lsquo;0&rsquo; if it is not. Always
&lsquo;0&rsquo; in interactive shells. <br>
$#name <br>
${#name} <br>
Substitutes the number of words in name. <br>
$# Equivalent to &lsquo;$#argv&rsquo;. (+) <br>
$%name <br>
${%name} <br>
Substitutes the number of characters in name. (+) <br>
$%number <br>
${%number} <br>
Substitutes the number of characters in $argv[number]. (+)
<br>
$? Equivalent to &lsquo;$status&rsquo;. (+) <br>
$$ Substitutes the (decimal) process number of the (parent)
shell. <br>
$! Substitutes the (decimal) process number of the last
background process started by this shell. (+) <br>
$_ Substitutes the command line of the last command
executed. (+) <br>
$&lt; Substitutes a line from the standard input, with no
further interpretation thereafter. It can be used to read
from the keyboard in a shell script. (+) While csh always
<br>
quotes $&lt;, as if it were equivalent to
&lsquo;$&lt;:q&rsquo;, tcsh does not. Furthermore, when tcsh
is waiting for a line to be typed the user may type an
interrupt to interrupt the <br>
sequence into which the line is to be substituted, but csh
does not allow this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The editor command
expand-variables, normally bound to &lsquo;^X-$&rsquo;, can
be used to interactively expand individual variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command, filename and directory
stack substitution <br>
The remaining substitutions are applied selectively to the
arguments of builtin commands. This means that portions of
expressions which are not evaluated are not subjected to
<br>
these expansions. For commands which are not internal to the
shell, the command name is substituted separately from the
argument list. This occurs very late, after input-output
<br>
redirection is performed, and in a child of the main
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command substitution <br>
Command substitution is indicated by a command enclosed in
&lsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;. The output from such a command is
broken into separate words at blanks, tabs and newlines, and
null words are <br>
discarded. The output is variable and command substituted
and put in place of the original string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command substitutions inside
double quotes (&lsquo;&quot;&rsquo;) retain blanks and tabs;
only newlines force new words. The single final newline does
not force a new word in any case. It is <br>
thus possible for a command substitution to yield only part
of a word, even if the command outputs a complete line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the shell since
version 6.12 replaces all newline and carriage return
characters in the command by spaces. If this is switched off
by unsetting csubstnonl, newlines <br>
separate commands as usual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filename substitution <br>
If a word contains any of the characters &lsquo;*&rsquo;,
&lsquo;?&rsquo;, &lsquo;[&rsquo; or &lsquo;{&rsquo; or
begins with the character &lsquo;~&rsquo; it is a candidate
for filename substitution, also known as
&lsquo;&lsquo;globbing&rsquo;&rsquo;. This word <br>
is then regarded as a pattern
(&lsquo;&lsquo;glob-pattern&rsquo;&rsquo;), and replaced
with an alphabetically sorted list of file names which match
the pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In matching filenames, the
character &lsquo;.&rsquo; at the beginning of a filename or
immediately following a &lsquo;/&rsquo;, as well as the
character &lsquo;/&rsquo; must be matched explicitly (unless
either <br>
globdot or globstar or both are set(+)). The character
&lsquo;*&rsquo; matches any string of characters, including
the null string. The character &lsquo;?&rsquo; matches any
single character. The <br>
sequence &lsquo;[...]&rsquo; matches any one of the
characters enclosed. Within &lsquo;[...]&rsquo;, a pair of
characters separated by &lsquo;-&rsquo; matches any
character lexically between the two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(+) Some glob-patterns can be
negated: The sequence &lsquo;[^...]&rsquo; matches any
single character not specified by the characters and/or
ranges of characters in the braces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An entire glob-pattern can also
be negated with &lsquo;^&rsquo;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; echo * <br>
bang crash crunch ouch <br>
&gt; echo ^cr* <br>
bang ouch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Glob-patterns which do not use
&lsquo;?&rsquo;, &lsquo;*&rsquo;, or &lsquo;[]&rsquo; or
which use &lsquo;{}&rsquo; or &lsquo;~&rsquo; (below) are
not negated correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The metanotation
&lsquo;a{b,c,d}e&rsquo; is a shorthand for &lsquo;abe ace
ade&rsquo;. Left-to-right order is preserved:
&lsquo;/usr/source/s1/{oldls,ls}.c&rsquo; expands to
&lsquo;/usr/source/s1/oldls.c <br>
/usr/source/s1/ls.c&rsquo;. The results of matches are
sorted separately at a low level to preserve this order:
&lsquo;../{memo,*box}&rsquo; might expand to &lsquo;../memo
../box ../mbox&rsquo;. (Note that <br>
&lsquo;memo&rsquo; was not sorted with the results of
matching &lsquo;*box&rsquo;.) It is not an error when this
construct expands to files which do not exist, but it is
possible to get an error from a <br>
command to which the expanded list is passed. This construct
may be nested. As a special case the words &lsquo;{&rsquo;,
&lsquo;}&rsquo; and &lsquo;{}&rsquo; are passed
undisturbed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The character &lsquo;~&rsquo; at
the beginning of a filename refers to home directories.
Standing alone, i.e., &lsquo;~&rsquo;, it expands to the
invoker&rsquo;s home directory as reflected in the value of
<br>
the home shell variable. When followed by a name consisting
of letters, digits and &lsquo;-&rsquo; characters the shell
searches for a user with that name and substitutes their
home direc&acirc; <br>
tory; thus &lsquo;~ken&rsquo; might expand to
&lsquo;/usr/ken&rsquo; and &lsquo;~ken/chmach&rsquo; to
&lsquo;/usr/ken/chmach&rsquo;. If the character
&lsquo;~&rsquo; is followed by a character other than a
letter or &lsquo;/&rsquo; or appears else&acirc; <br>
where than at the beginning of a word, it is left
undisturbed. A command like &lsquo;setenv MANPATH
/usr/man:/usr/local/man:~/lib/man&rsquo; does not,
therefore, do home directory substitu&acirc; <br>
tion as one might hope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is an error for a
glob-pattern containing &lsquo;*&rsquo;, &lsquo;?&rsquo;,
&lsquo;[&rsquo; or &lsquo;~&rsquo;, with or without
&lsquo;^&rsquo;, not to match any files. However, only one
pattern in a list of glob-patterns must match a <br>
file (so that, e.g., &lsquo;rm *.a *.c *.o&rsquo; would fail
only if there were no files in the current directory ending
in &lsquo;.a&rsquo;, &lsquo;.c&rsquo;, or &lsquo;.o&rsquo;),
and if the nonomatch shell variable is set a <br>
pattern (or list of patterns) which matches nothing is left
unchanged rather than causing an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The globstar shell variable can
be set to allow &lsquo;**&rsquo; or &lsquo;***&rsquo; as a
file glob pattern that matches any string of characters
including &lsquo;/&rsquo;, recursively traversing any
existing sub- <br>
directories. For example, &lsquo;ls **.c&rsquo; will list
all the .c files in the current directory tree. If used by
itself, it will match zero or more sub-directories (e.g.
&lsquo;ls <br>
/usr/include/**/time.h&rsquo; will list any file named
&lsquo;time.h&rsquo; in the /usr/include directory tree;
&lsquo;ls /usr/include/**time.h&rsquo; will match any file
in the /usr/include directory tree <br>
ending in &lsquo;time.h&rsquo;; and &lsquo;ls
/usr/include/**time**.h&rsquo; will match any .h file with
&lsquo;time&rsquo; either in a subdirectory name or in the
filename itself). To prevent problems with recur&acirc; <br>
sion, the &lsquo;**&rsquo; glob-pattern will not descend
into a symbolic link containing a directory. To override
this, use &lsquo;***&rsquo; (+)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The noglob shell variable can be
set to prevent filename substitution, and the expand-glob
editor command, normally bound to &lsquo;^X-*&rsquo;, can be
used to interactively expand individ&acirc; <br>
ual filename substitutions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Directory stack substitution (+)
<br>
The directory stack is a list of directories, numbered from
zero, used by the pushd, popd and dirs builtin commands
(q.v.). dirs can print, store in a file, restore and clear
<br>
the directory stack at any time, and the savedirs and
dirsfile shell variables can be set to store the directory
stack automatically on logout and restore it on login. The
<br>
dirstack shell variable can be examined to see the directory
stack and set to put arbitrary directories into the
directory stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The character &lsquo;=&rsquo;
followed by one or more digits expands to an entry in the
directory stack. The special case &lsquo;=-&rsquo; expands
to the last directory in the stack. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; dirs -v <br>
0 /usr/bin <br>
1 /usr/spool/uucp <br>
2 /usr/accts/sys <br>
&gt; echo =1 <br>
/usr/spool/uucp <br>
&gt; echo =0/calendar <br>
/usr/bin/calendar <br>
&gt; echo =- <br>
/usr/accts/sys</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The noglob and nonomatch shell
variables and the expand-glob editor command apply to
directory stack as well as filename substitutions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other substitutions (+) <br>
There are several more transformations involving filenames,
not strictly related to the above but mentioned here for
completeness. Any filename may be expanded to a full path
<br>
when the symlinks variable (q.v.) is set to
&lsquo;expand&rsquo;. Quoting prevents this expansion, and
the normalize-path editor command does it on demand. The
normalize-command editor <br>
command expands commands in PATH into full paths on demand.
Finally, cd and pushd interpret &lsquo;-&rsquo; as the old
working directory (equivalent to the shell variable owd).
This is not <br>
a substitution at all, but an abbreviation recognized by
only those commands. Nonetheless, it too can be prevented by
quoting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands <br>
The next three sections describe how the shell executes
commands and deals with their input and output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simple commands, pipelines and
sequences <br>
A simple command is a sequence of words, the first of which
specifies the command to be executed. A series of simple
commands joined by &lsquo;|&rsquo; characters forms a
pipeline. The <br>
output of each command in a pipeline is connected to the
input of the next.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simple commands and pipelines
may be joined into sequences with &lsquo;;&rsquo;, and will
be executed sequentially. Commands and pipelines can also be
joined into sequences with &lsquo;||&rsquo; or <br>
&lsquo;&amp;&amp;&rsquo;, indicating, as in the C language,
that the second is to be executed only if the first fails or
succeeds respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A simple command, pipeline or
sequence may be placed in parentheses, &lsquo;()&rsquo;, to
form a simple command, which may in turn be a component of a
pipeline or sequence. A command, pipe&acirc; <br>
line or sequence can be executed without waiting for it to
terminate by following it with an &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Builtin and non-builtin command
execution <br>
Builtin commands are executed within the shell. If any
component of a pipeline except the last is a builtin
command, the pipeline is executed in a subshell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parenthesized commands are
always executed in a subshell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(cd; pwd); pwd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">thus prints the home directory,
leaving you where you were (printing this after the home
directory), while</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd; pwd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">leaves you in the home
directory. Parenthesized commands are most often used to
prevent cd from affecting the current shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a command to be executed is
found not to be a builtin command the shell attempts to
execute the command via execve(2). Each word in the variable
path names a directory in <br>
which the shell will look for the command. If the shell is
not given a -f option, the shell hashes the names in these
directories into an internal table so that it will try an
<br>
execve(2) in only a directory where there is a possibility
that the command resides there. This greatly speeds command
location when a large number of directories are present in
<br>
the search path. This hashing mechanism is not used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If hashing is turned
explicitly off via unhash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If the shell was given a -f
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. For each directory component
of path which does not begin with a &lsquo;/&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. If the command contains a
&lsquo;/&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the above four cases the
shell concatenates each component of the path vector with
the given command name to form a path name of a file which
it then attempts to execute it. <br>
If execution is successful, the search stops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file has execute
permissions but is not an executable to the system (i.e., it
is neither an executable binary nor a script that specifies
its interpreter), then it is <br>
assumed to be a file containing shell commands and a new
shell is spawned to read it. The shell special alias may be
set to specify an interpreter other than the shell
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems which do not
understand the &lsquo;#!&rsquo; script interpreter
convention the shell may be compiled to emulate it; see the
version shell variable. If so, the shell checks the <br>
first line of the file to see if it is of the form
&lsquo;#!interpreter arg ...&rsquo;. If it is, the shell
starts interpreter with the given args and feeds the file to
it on standard <br>
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input/output <br>
The standard input and standard output of a command may be
redirected with the following syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt; name Open file name (which
is first variable, command and filename expanded) as the
standard input. <br>
&lt;&lt; word Read the shell input up to a line which is
identical to word. word is not subjected to variable,
filename or command substitution, and each input line is
compared to <br>
word before any substitutions are done on this input line.
Unless a quoting &lsquo;&acute;, &lsquo;&quot;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&rsquo; or &lsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo; appears in word
variable and command substitution is performed on the <br>
intervening lines, allowing &lsquo;&acute; to quote
&lsquo;$&rsquo;, &lsquo;&acute; and &lsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;.
Commands which are substituted have all blanks, tabs, and
newlines preserved, except for the final newline <br>
which is dropped. The resultant text is placed in an
anonymous temporary file which is given to the command as
standard input. <br>
&gt; name <br>
&gt;! name <br>
&gt;&amp; name <br>
&gt;&amp;! name <br>
The file name is used as standard output. If the file does
not exist then it is created; if the file exists, it is
truncated, its previous contents being lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the shell variable noclobber
is set, then the file must not exist or be a character
special file (e.g., a terminal or &lsquo;/dev/null&rsquo;)
or an error results. This helps <br>
prevent accidental destruction of files. In this case the
&lsquo;!&rsquo; forms can be used to suppress this
check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The forms involving
&lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; route the diagnostic output into the
specified file as well as the standard output. name is
expanded in the same way as &lsquo;&lt;&rsquo; input
filenames are. <br>
&gt;&gt; name <br>
&gt;&gt;&amp; name <br>
&gt;&gt;! name <br>
&gt;&gt;&amp;! name <br>
Like &lsquo;&gt;&rsquo;, but appends output to the end of
name. If the shell variable noclobber is set, then it is an
error for the file not to exist, unless one of the
&lsquo;!&rsquo; forms is <br>
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A command receives the
environment in which the shell was invoked as modified by
the input-output parameters and the presence of the command
in a pipeline. Thus, unlike some <br>
previous shells, commands run from a file of shell commands
have no access to the text of the commands by default;
rather they receive the original standard input of the
shell. <br>
The &lsquo;&lt;&lt;&rsquo; mechanism should be used to
present inline data. This permits shell command scripts to
function as components of pipelines and allows the shell to
block read its input. <br>
Note that the default standard input for a command run
detached is not the empty file /dev/null, but the original
standard input of the shell. If this is a terminal and if
the <br>
process attempts to read from the terminal, then the process
will block and the user will be notified (see Jobs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Diagnostic output may be
directed through a pipe with the standard output. Simply use
the form &lsquo;|&amp;&rsquo; rather than just
&lsquo;|&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shell cannot presently
redirect diagnostic output without also redirecting standard
output, but &lsquo;(command &gt; output-file) &gt;&amp;
error-file&rsquo; is often an acceptable workaround. <br>
Either output-file or error-file may be
&lsquo;/dev/tty&rsquo; to send output to the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Features <br>
Having described how the shell accepts, parses and executes
command lines, we now turn to a variety of its useful
features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control flow <br>
The shell contains a number of commands which can be used to
regulate the flow of control in command files (shell
scripts) and (in limited but useful ways) from terminal
input. <br>
These commands all operate by forcing the shell to reread or
skip in its input and, due to the implementation, restrict
the placement of some of the commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The foreach, switch, and while
statements, as well as the if-then-else form of the if
statement, require that the major keywords appear in a
single simple command on an input <br>
line as shown below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the shell&rsquo;s input is
not seekable, the shell buffers up input whenever a loop is
being read and performs seeks in this internal buffer to
accomplish the rereading implied by <br>
the loop. (To the extent that this allows, backward gotos
will succeed on non-seekable inputs.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expressions <br>
The if, while and exit builtin commands use expressions with
a common syntax. The expressions can include any of the
operators described in the next three sections. Note that
<br>
the @ builtin command (q.v.) has its own separate
syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logical, arithmetical and
comparison operators <br>
These operators are similar to those of C and have the same
precedence. They include</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">|| &amp;&amp; | ^ &amp; == != =~
!~ &lt;= &gt;= <br>
&lt; &gt; &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; + - * / % ! ~ ( )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here the precedence increases to
the right, &lsquo;==&rsquo; &lsquo;!=&rsquo;
&lsquo;=~&rsquo; and &lsquo;!~&rsquo;, &lsquo;&lt;=&rsquo;
&lsquo;&gt;=&rsquo; &lsquo;&lt;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&gt;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&lt;&lt;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&gt;&gt;&rsquo;, &lsquo;+&rsquo; and &lsquo;-&rsquo;,
&lsquo;*&rsquo; &lsquo;/&rsquo; and &lsquo;%&rsquo; being,
in groups, at the same level. When <br>
multiple operators which have same precedence are used in
one expression, calculation must be done from operator of
right side. The &lsquo;==&rsquo; &lsquo;!=&rsquo;
&lsquo;=~&rsquo; and &lsquo;!~&rsquo; operators compare <br>
their arguments as strings; all others operate on numbers.
The operators &lsquo;=~&rsquo; and &lsquo;!~&rsquo; are like
&lsquo;!=&rsquo; and &lsquo;==&rsquo; except that the right
hand side is a glob-pattern (see Filename <br>
substitution) against which the left hand operand is
matched. This reduces the need for use of the switch builtin
command in shell scripts when all that is really needed is
pat&acirc; <br>
tern matching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Null or missing arguments are
considered &lsquo;0&rsquo;. The results of all expressions
are strings, which represent decimal numbers. It is
important to note that no two components of an <br>
expression can appear in the same word; except when adjacent
to components of expressions which are syntactically
significant to the parser (&lsquo;&amp;&rsquo;
&lsquo;|&rsquo; &lsquo;&lt;&rsquo; &lsquo;&gt;&rsquo;
&lsquo;(&rsquo; &lsquo;)&rsquo;) they should <br>
be surrounded by spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command exit status <br>
Commands can be executed in expressions and their exit
status returned by enclosing them in braces
(&lsquo;{}&rsquo;). Remember that the braces should be
separated from the words of the <br>
command by spaces. Command executions succeed, returning
true, i.e., &lsquo;1&rsquo;, if the command exits with
status 0, otherwise they fail, returning false, i.e.,
&lsquo;0&rsquo;. If more detailed <br>
status information is required then the command should be
executed outside of an expression and the status shell
variable examined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File inquiry operators <br>
Some of these operators perform true/false tests on files
and related objects. They are of the form -op file, where op
is one of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Read access <br>
w Write access <br>
x Execute access <br>
X Executable in the path or shell builtin, e.g., &lsquo;-X
ls&rsquo; and &lsquo;-X ls-F&rsquo; are generally true, but
&lsquo;-X /bin/ls&rsquo; is not (+) <br>
e Existence <br>
o Ownership <br>
z Zero size <br>
s Non-zero size (+) <br>
f Plain file <br>
d Directory <br>
l Symbolic link (+) * <br>
b Block special file (+) <br>
c Character special file (+) <br>
p Named pipe (fifo) (+) * <br>
S Socket special file (+) * <br>
u Set-user-ID bit is set (+) <br>
g Set-group-ID bit is set (+) <br>
k Sticky bit is set (+) <br>
t file (which must be a digit) is an open file descriptor
for a terminal device (+) <br>
R Has been migrated (Convex only) (+) <br>
L Applies subsequent operators in a multiple-operator test
to a symbolic link rather than to the file to which the link
points (+) *</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file is command and filename
expanded and then tested to see if it has the specified
relationship to the real user. If file does not exist or is
inaccessible or, for the opera&acirc; <br>
tors indicated by &lsquo;*&rsquo;, if the specified file
type does not exist on the current system, then all
inquiries return false, i.e., &lsquo;0&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These operators may be combined
for conciseness: &lsquo;-xy file&rsquo; is equivalent to
&lsquo;-x file &amp;&amp; -y file&rsquo;. (+) For example,
&lsquo;-fx&rsquo; is true (returns &lsquo;1&rsquo;) for
plain executable files, but <br>
not for directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L may be used in a
multiple-operator test to apply subsequent operators to a
symbolic link rather than to the file to which the link
points. For example, &lsquo;-lLo&rsquo; is true for <br>
links owned by the invoking user. Lr, Lw and Lx are always
true for links and false for non-links. L has a different
meaning when it is the last operator in a multiple-operator
<br>
test; see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible but not useful,
and sometimes misleading, to combine operators which expect
file to be a file with operators which do not (e.g., X and
t). Following L with a non- <br>
file operator can lead to particularly strange results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other operators return other
information, i.e., not just &lsquo;0&rsquo; or
&lsquo;1&rsquo;. (+) They have the same format as before; op
may be one of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Last file access time, as the
number of seconds since the epoch <br>
A: Like A, but in timestamp format, e.g., &lsquo;Fri May 14
16:36:10 1993&rsquo; <br>
M Last file modification time <br>
M: Like M, but in timestamp format <br>
C Last inode modification time <br>
C: Like C, but in timestamp format <br>
D Device number <br>
I Inode number <br>
F Composite file identifier, in the form device:inode <br>
L The name of the file pointed to by a symbolic link <br>
N Number of (hard) links <br>
P Permissions, in octal, without leading zero <br>
P: Like P, with leading zero <br>
Pmode Equivalent to &lsquo;-P file &amp; mode&rsquo;, e.g.,
&lsquo;-P22 file&rsquo; returns &lsquo;22&rsquo; if file is
writable by group and other, &lsquo;20&rsquo; if by group
only, and &lsquo;0&rsquo; if by neither <br>
Pmode: Like Pmode, with leading zero <br>
U Numeric userid <br>
U: Username, or the numeric userid if the username is
unknown <br>
G Numeric groupid <br>
G: Groupname, or the numeric groupid if the groupname is
unknown <br>
Z Size, in bytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only one of these operators may
appear in a multiple-operator test, and it must be the last.
Note that L has a different meaning at the end of and
elsewhere in a multiple-opera&acirc; <br>
tor test. Because &lsquo;0&rsquo; is a valid return value
for many of these operators, they do not return
&lsquo;0&rsquo; when they fail: most return
&lsquo;-1&rsquo;, and F returns &lsquo;:&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the shell is compiled with
POSIX defined (see the version shell variable), the result
of a file inquiry is based on the permission bits of the
file and not on the result of <br>
the access(2) system call. For example, if one tests a file
with -w whose permissions would ordinarily allow writing but
which is on a file system mounted read-only, the test <br>
will succeed in a POSIX shell but fail in a non-POSIX
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File inquiry operators can also
be evaluated with the filetest builtin command (q.v.)
(+).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Jobs <br>
The shell associates a job with each pipeline. It keeps a
table of current jobs, printed by the jobs command, and
assigns them small integer numbers. When a job is started
<br>
asynchronously with &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo;, the shell prints a
line which looks like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[1] 1234</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indicating that the job which
was started asynchronously was job number 1 and had one
(top-level) process, whose process id was 1234.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are running a job and
wish to do something else you may hit the suspend key
(usually &lsquo;^Z&rsquo;), which sends a STOP signal to the
current job. The shell will then normally <br>
indicate that the job has been &lsquo;Suspended&rsquo; and
print another prompt. If the listjobs shell variable is set,
all jobs will be listed like the jobs builtin command; if it
is set <br>
to &lsquo;long&rsquo; the listing will be in long format,
like &lsquo;jobs -l&rsquo;. You can then manipulate the
state of the suspended job. You can put it in the
&lsquo;&lsquo;background&rsquo;&rsquo; with the bg command
<br>
or run some other commands and eventually bring the job back
into the &lsquo;&lsquo;foreground&rsquo;&rsquo; with fg.
(See also the run-fg-editor editor command.) A
&lsquo;^Z&rsquo; takes effect immediately and <br>
is like an interrupt in that pending output and unread input
are discarded when it is typed. The wait builtin command
causes the shell to wait for all background jobs to
com&acirc; <br>
plete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lsquo;^]&rsquo; key sends a
delayed suspend signal, which does not generate a STOP
signal until a program attempts to read(2) it, to the
current job. This can usefully be typed ahead <br>
when you have prepared some commands for a job which you
wish to stop after it has read them. The &lsquo;^Y&rsquo;
key performs this function in csh(1); in tcsh,
&lsquo;^Y&rsquo; is an editing command. <br>
(+)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A job being run in the
background stops if it tries to read from the terminal.
Background jobs are normally allowed to produce output, but
this can be disabled by giving the <br>
command &lsquo;stty tostop&rsquo;. If you set this tty
option, then background jobs will stop when they try to
produce output like they do when they try to read input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several ways to refer
to jobs in the shell. The character &lsquo;%&rsquo;
introduces a job name. If you wish to refer to job number 1,
you can name it as &lsquo;%1&rsquo;. Just naming a job <br>
brings it to the foreground; thus &lsquo;%1&rsquo; is a
synonym for &lsquo;fg %1&rsquo;, bringing job 1 back into
the foreground. Similarly, saying &lsquo;%1 &amp;&rsquo;
resumes job 1 in the background, just like &lsquo;bg <br>
%1&rsquo;. A job can also be named by an unambiguous prefix
of the string typed in to start it: &lsquo;%ex&rsquo; would
normally restart a suspended ex(1) job, if there were only
one suspended <br>
job whose name began with the string &lsquo;ex&rsquo;. It is
also possible to say &lsquo;%?string&rsquo; to specify a job
whose text contains string, if there is only one such
job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shell maintains a notion of
the current and previous jobs. In output pertaining to jobs,
the current job is marked with a &lsquo;+&rsquo; and the
previous job with a &lsquo;-&rsquo;. The abbrevia&acirc;
<br>
tions &lsquo;%+&rsquo;, &lsquo;%&rsquo;, and (by analogy
with the syntax of the history mechanism) &lsquo;%%&rsquo;
all refer to the current job, and &lsquo;%-&rsquo; refers to
the previous job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The job control mechanism
requires that the stty(1) option &lsquo;new&rsquo; be set on
some systems. It is an artifact from a &lsquo;new&rsquo;
implementation of the tty driver which allows generation
<br>
of interrupt characters from the keyboard to tell jobs to
stop. See stty(1) and the setty builtin command for details
on setting options in the new tty driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Status reporting <br>
The shell learns immediately whenever a process changes
state. It normally informs you whenever a job becomes
blocked so that no further progress is possible, but only
right <br>
before it prints a prompt. This is done so that it does not
otherwise disturb your work. If, however, you set the shell
variable notify, the shell will notify you immediately <br>
of changes of status in background jobs. There is also a
shell command notify which marks a single process so that
its status changes will be immediately reported. By default
<br>
notify marks the current process; simply say
&lsquo;notify&rsquo; after starting a background job to mark
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you try to leave the shell
while jobs are stopped, you will be warned that &lsquo;There
are suspended jobs.&rsquo; You may use the jobs command to
see what they are. If you do this or <br>
immediately try to exit again, the shell will not warn you a
second time, and the suspended jobs will be terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatic, periodic and timed
events (+) <br>
There are various ways to run commands and take other
actions automatically at various times in the
&lsquo;&lsquo;life cycle&rsquo;&rsquo; of the shell. They
are summarized here, and described in <br>
detail under the appropriate Builtin commands, Special shell
variables and Special aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sched builtin command puts
commands in a scheduled-event list, to be executed by the
shell at a given time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The beepcmd, cwdcmd, periodic,
precmd, postcmd, and jobcmd Special aliases can be set,
respectively, to execute commands when the shell wants to
ring the bell, when the working <br>
directory changes, every tperiod minutes, before each
prompt, before each command gets executed, after each
command gets executed, and when a job is started or is
brought into <br>
the foreground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The autologout shell variable
can be set to log out or lock the shell after a given number
of minutes of inactivity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mail shell variable can be
set to check for new mail periodically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The printexitvalue shell
variable can be set to print the exit status of commands
which exit with a status other than zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rmstar shell variable can be
set to ask the user, when &lsquo;rm *&rsquo; is typed, if
that is really what was meant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The time shell variable can be
set to execute the time builtin command after the completion
of any process that takes more than a given number of CPU
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The watch and who shell
variables can be set to report when selected users log in or
out, and the log builtin command reports on those users at
any time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Native Language System support
(+) <br>
The shell is eight bit clean (if so compiled; see the
version shell variable) and thus supports character sets
needing this capability. NLS support differs depending on
whether <br>
or not the shell was compiled to use the system&rsquo;s NLS
(again, see version). In either case, 7-bit ASCII is the
default character code (e.g., the classification of which
charac&acirc; <br>
ters are printable) and sorting, and changing the LANG or
LC_CTYPE environment variables causes a check for possible
changes in these respects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using the system&rsquo;s
NLS, the setlocale(3) function is called to determine
appropriate character code/classification and sorting (e.g.,
a &rsquo;en_CA.UTF-8&rsquo; would yield &quot;UTF-8&quot; as
<br>
a character code). This function typically examines the LANG
and LC_CTYPE environment variables; refer to the system
documentation for further details. When not using the
sys&acirc; <br>
tem&rsquo;s NLS, the shell simulates it by assuming that the
ISO 8859-1 character set is used whenever either of the LANG
and LC_CTYPE variables are set, regardless of their values.
<br>
Sorting is not affected for the simulated NLS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, with both real and
simulated NLS, all printable characters in the range
200-377, i.e., those that have M-char bindings, are
automatically rebound to self-insert- <br>
command. The corresponding binding for the escape-char
sequence, if any, is left alone. These characters are not
rebound if the NOREBIND environment variable is set. This
may <br>
be useful for the simulated NLS or a primitive real NLS
which assumes full ISO 8859-1. Otherwise, all M-char
bindings in the range 240-377 are effectively undone.
Explicitly <br>
rebinding the relevant keys with bindkey is of course still
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unknown characters (i.e., those
that are neither printable nor control characters) are
printed in the format 0n. If the tty is not in 8 bit mode,
other 8 bit characters are <br>
printed by converting them to ASCII and using standout mode.
The shell never changes the 7/8 bit mode of the tty and
tracks user-initiated changes of 7/8 bit mode. NLS users
<br>
(or, for that matter, those who want to use a meta key) may
need to explicitly set the tty in 8 bit mode through the
appropriate stty(1) command in, e.g., the ~/.login file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OS variant support (+) <br>
A number of new builtin commands are provided to support
features in particular operating systems. All are described
in detail in the Builtin commands section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems that support TCF
(aix-ibm370, aix-ps2), getspath and setspath get and set the
system execution path, getxvers and setxvers get and set the
experimental version prefix <br>
and migrate migrates processes between sites. The jobs
builtin prints the site on which each job is executing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under BS2000, bs2cmd executes
commands of the underlying BS2000/OSD operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under Domain/OS, inlib adds
shared libraries to the current environment, rootnode
changes the rootnode and ver changes the systype.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under Mach, setpath is
equivalent to Mach&rsquo;s setpath(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under Masscomp/RTU and Harris
CX/UX, universe sets the universe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under Harris CX/UX, ucb or att
runs a command under the specified universe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under Convex/OS, warp prints or
sets the universe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The VENDOR, OSTYPE and MACHTYPE
environment variables indicate respectively the vendor,
operating system and machine type (microprocessor class or
machine model) of the system on <br>
which the shell thinks it is running. These are particularly
useful when sharing one&rsquo;s home directory between
several types of machines; one can, for example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set path = (~/bin.$MACHTYPE
/usr/ucb /bin /usr/bin .)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in one&rsquo;s ~/.login and put
executables compiled for each machine in the appropriate
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The version shell variable
indicates what options were chosen when the shell was
compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note also the newgrp builtin,
the afsuser and echo_style shell variables and the
system-dependent locations of the shell&rsquo;s input files
(see FILES).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Signal handling <br>
Login shells ignore interrupts when reading the file
~/.logout. The shell ignores quit signals unless started
with -q. Login shells catch the terminate signal, but
non-login <br>
shells inherit the terminate behavior from their parents.
Other signals have the values which the shell inherited from
its parent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In shell scripts, the
shell&rsquo;s handling of interrupt and terminate signals
can be controlled with onintr, and its handling of hangups
can be controlled with hup and nohup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shell exits on a hangup (see
also the logout shell variable). By default, the
shell&rsquo;s children do too, but the shell does not send
them a hangup when it exits. hup arranges <br>
for the shell to send a hangup to a child when it exits, and
nohup sets a child to ignore hangups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Terminal management (+) <br>
The shell uses three different sets of terminal
(&lsquo;&lsquo;tty&rsquo;&rsquo;) modes: &lsquo;edit&rsquo;,
used when editing, &lsquo;quote&rsquo;, used when quoting
literal characters, and &lsquo;execute&rsquo;, used when
executing com&acirc; <br>
mands. The shell holds some settings in each mode constant,
so commands which leave the tty in a confused state do not
interfere with the shell. The shell also matches changes
<br>
in the speed and padding of the tty. The list of tty modes
that are kept constant can be examined and modified with the
setty builtin. Note that although the editor uses CBREAK
<br>
mode (or its equivalent), it takes typed-ahead characters
anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The echotc, settc and telltc
commands can be used to manipulate and debug terminal
capabilities from the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems that support SIGWINCH
or SIGWINDOW, the shell adapts to window resizing
automatically and adjusts the environment variables LINES
and COLUMNS if set. If the environ&acirc; <br>
ment variable TERMCAP contains li# and co# fields, the shell
adjusts them to reflect the new window size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REFERENCE <br>
The next sections of this manual describe all of the
available Builtin commands, Special aliases and Special
shell variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Builtin commands <br>
%job A synonym for the fg builtin command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%job &amp; A synonym for the bg
builtin command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">: Does nothing,
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@ <br>
@ name = expr <br>
@ name[index] = expr <br>
@ name++|-- <br>
@ name[index]++|-- <br>
The first form prints the values of all shell variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second form assigns the
value of expr to name. The third form assigns the value of
expr to the index&rsquo;th component of name; both name and
its index&rsquo;th component must <br>
already exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr may contain the operators
&lsquo;*&rsquo;, &lsquo;+&rsquo;, etc., as in C. If expr
contains &lsquo;&lt;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&gt;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; or &lsquo;&rsquo; then at least that
part of expr must be placed within &lsquo;()&rsquo;. Note
that the <br>
syntax of expr has nothing to do with that described under
Expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fourth and fifth forms
increment (&lsquo;++&rsquo;) or decrement (&lsquo;--&rsquo;)
name or its index&rsquo;th component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The space between
&lsquo;@&rsquo; and name is required. The spaces between
name and &lsquo;=&rsquo; and between &lsquo;=&rsquo; and
expr are optional. Components of expr must be separated by
spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias [name [wordlist]] <br>
Without arguments, prints all aliases. With name, prints the
alias for name. With name and wordlist, assigns wordlist as
the alias of name. wordlist is command and <br>
filename substituted. name may not be &lsquo;alias&rsquo; or
&lsquo;unalias&rsquo;. See also the unalias builtin
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alloc Shows the amount of
dynamic memory acquired, broken down into used and free
memory. With an argument shows the number of free and used
blocks in each size category. The <br>
categories start at size 8 and double at each step. This
command&rsquo;s output may vary across system types, because
systems other than the VAX may use a different memory <br>
allocator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bg [%job ...] <br>
Puts the specified jobs (or, without arguments, the current
job) into the background, continuing each if it is stopped.
job may be a number, a string, &lsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;%&rsquo;, &lsquo;+&rsquo; or <br>
&lsquo;-&rsquo; as described under Jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bindkey [-l|-d|-e|-v|-u] (+)
<br>
bindkey [-a] [-b] [-k] [-r] [--] key (+) <br>
bindkey [-a] [-b] [-k] [-c|-s] [--] key command (+) <br>
Without options, the first form lists all bound keys and the
editor command to which each is bound, the second form lists
the editor command to which key is bound and the <br>
third form binds the editor command command to key. Options
include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Lists all editor commands and
a short description of each. <br>
-d Binds all keys to the standard bindings for the default
editor. <br>
-e Binds all keys to the standard GNU Emacs-like bindings.
<br>
-v Binds all keys to the standard vi(1)-like bindings. <br>
-a Lists or changes key-bindings in the alternative key map.
This is the key map used in vi command mode. <br>
-b key is interpreted as a control character written
^character (e.g., &lsquo;^A&rsquo;) or C-character (e.g.,
&lsquo;C-A&rsquo;), a meta character written M-character
(e.g., &lsquo;M-A&rsquo;), a function <br>
key written F-string (e.g., &lsquo;F-string&rsquo;), or an
extended prefix key written X-character (e.g.,
&lsquo;X-A&rsquo;). <br>
-k key is interpreted as a symbolic arrow key name, which
may be one of &lsquo;down&rsquo;, &lsquo;up&rsquo;,
&lsquo;left&rsquo; or &lsquo;right&rsquo;. <br>
-r Removes key&rsquo;s binding. Be careful: &lsquo;bindkey
-r&rsquo; does not bind key to self-insert-command (q.v.),
it unbinds key completely. <br>
-c command is interpreted as a builtin or external command
instead of an editor command. <br>
-s command is taken as a literal string and treated as
terminal input when key is typed. Bound keys in command are
themselves reinterpreted, and this continues for ten <br>
levels of interpretation. <br>
-- Forces a break from option processing, so the next word
is taken as key even if it begins with &rsquo;-&rsquo;. <br>
-u (or any invalid option) <br>
Prints a usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key may be a single character or
a string. If a command is bound to a string, the first
character of the string is bound to sequence-lead-in and the
entire string is <br>
bound to the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control characters in key can be
literal (they can be typed by preceding them with the editor
command quoted-insert, normally bound to &lsquo;^V&rsquo;)
or written caret-character <br>
style, e.g., &lsquo;^A&rsquo;. Delete is written
&lsquo;^?&rsquo; (caret-question mark). key and command can

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bs2cmd bs2000-command (+) <br>
Passes bs2000-command to the BS2000 command interpreter for
execution. Only non-interactive commands can be executed,
and it is not possible to execute any command that <br>
would overlay the image of the current process, like
/EXECUTE or /CALL-PROCEDURE. (BS2000 only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">break Causes execution to resume
after the end of the nearest enclosing foreach or while. The
remaining commands on the current line are executed.
Multi-level breaks are thus <br>
possible by writing them all on one line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">breaksw Causes a break from a
switch, resuming after the endsw.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">builtins (+) <br>
Prints the names of all builtin commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bye (+) A synonym for the logout
builtin command. Available only if the shell was so
compiled; see the version shell variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">case label: <br>
A label in a switch statement as discussed below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd [-p] [-l] [-n|-v] [I--]
[name] <br>
If a directory name is given, changes the shell&rsquo;s
working directory to name. If not, changes to home. If name
is &lsquo;-&rsquo; it is interpreted as the previous working
directory <br>
(see Other substitutions). (+) If name is not a subdirectory
of the current directory (and does not begin with
&lsquo;/&rsquo;, &lsquo;./&rsquo; or &lsquo;../&rsquo;),
each component of the variable cdpath <br>
is checked to see if it has a subdirectory name. Finally, if
all else fails but name is a shell variable whose value
begins with &lsquo;/&rsquo;, then this is tried to see if it
is <br>
a directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -p, prints the final
directory stack, just like dirs. The -l, -n and -v flags
have the same effect on cd as on dirs, and they imply -p.
(+) Using -- forces a break <br>
from option processing so the next word is taken as the
directory name even if it begins with &rsquo;-&rsquo;.
(+)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the implicitcd shell
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chdir A synonym for the cd
builtin command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">complete [command
[word/pattern/list[:select]/[[suffix]/] ...]] (+) <br>
Without arguments, lists all completions. With command,
lists completions for command. With command and word etc.,
defines completions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command may be a full command
name or a glob-pattern (see Filename substitution). It can
begin with &lsquo;-&rsquo; to indicate that completion
should be used only when command is <br>
ambiguous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">word specifies which word
relative to the current word is to be completed, and may be
one of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Current-word completion.
pattern is a glob-pattern which must match the beginning of
the current word on the command line. pattern is ignored
when completing <br>
the current word. <br>
C Like c, but includes pattern when completing the current
word. <br>
n Next-word completion. pattern is a glob-pattern which must
match the beginning of the previous word on the command
line. <br>
N Like n, but must match the beginning of the word two
before the current word. <br>
p Position-dependent completion. pattern is a numeric range,
with the same syntax used to index shell variables, which
must include the current word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list, the list of possible
completions, may be one of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a Aliases <br>
b Bindings (editor commands) <br>
c Commands (builtin or external commands) <br>
C External commands which begin with the supplied path
prefix <br>
d Directories <br>
D Directories which begin with the supplied path prefix <br>
e Environment variables <br>
f Filenames <br>
F Filenames which begin with the supplied path prefix <br>

S Signals <br>
t Plain (&lsquo;&lsquo;text&rsquo;&rsquo;) files <br>
T Plain (&lsquo;&lsquo;text&rsquo;&rsquo;) files which begin

v Any variables <br>
u Usernames <br>
x Like n, but prints select when list-choices is used. <br>
X Completions <br>
$var Words from the variable var <br>
(...) Words from the given list <br>
&lsquo;...&lsquo; Words from the output of command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select is an optional
glob-pattern. If given, words from only list that match
select are considered and the fignore shell variable is
ignored. The last three types of <br>
completion may not have a select pattern, and x uses select
as an explanatory message when the list-choices editor
command is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">suffix is a single character to
be appended to a successful completion. If null, no
character is appended. If omitted (in which case the fourth
delimiter can also be <br>
omitted), a slash is appended to directories and a space to
other words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command invoked from
&lsquo;...&lsquo; version has additional environment
variable set, the variable name is COMMAND_LINE and contains
(as its name indicates) contents of the current <br>
(already typed in) command line. One can examine and use
contents of the COMMAND_LINE variable in her custom script
to build more sophisticated completions (see comple&acirc;
<br>
tion for svn(1) included in this package).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now for some examples. Some
commands take only directories as arguments, so
there&rsquo;s no point completing plain files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; complete cd
&rsquo;p/1/d/&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">completes only the first word
following &lsquo;cd&rsquo; (&lsquo;p/1&rsquo;) with a
directory. p-type completion can also be used to narrow down
command completion:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; co[^D] <br>
complete compress <br>
&gt; complete -co* &rsquo;p/0/(compress)/&rsquo; <br>
&gt; co[^D] <br>
&gt; compress</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This completion completes
commands (words in position 0, &lsquo;p/0&rsquo;) which
begin with &lsquo;co&rsquo; (thus matching
&lsquo;co*&rsquo;) to &lsquo;compress&rsquo; (the only word
in the list). The leading &lsquo;-&rsquo; <br>
indicates that this completion is to be used with only
ambiguous commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; complete find
&rsquo;n/-user/u/&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is an example of n-type
completion. Any word following &lsquo;find&rsquo; and
immediately following &lsquo;-user&rsquo; is completed from
the list of users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; complete cc
&rsquo;c/-I/d/&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">demonstrates c-type completion.
Any word following &lsquo;cc&rsquo; and beginning with
&lsquo;-I&rsquo; is completed as a directory.
&lsquo;-I&rsquo; is not taken as part of the directory
because we used <br>
lowercase c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Different lists are useful with
different commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; complete alias
&rsquo;p/1/a/&rsquo; <br>
&gt; complete man &rsquo;p/*/c/&rsquo; <br>
&gt; complete set &rsquo;p/1/s/&rsquo; <br>
&gt; complete true &rsquo;p/1/x:Truth has no
options./&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These complete words following
&lsquo;alias&rsquo; with aliases, &lsquo;man&rsquo; with
commands, and &lsquo;set&rsquo; with shell variables.
&lsquo;true&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t have any options, so x does
nothing when comple&acirc; <br>
tion is attempted and prints &lsquo;Truth has no
options.&rsquo; when completion choices are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the man example, and
several other examples below, could just as well have used
&rsquo;c/*&rsquo; or &rsquo;n/*&rsquo; as
&rsquo;p/*&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Words can be completed from a
variable evaluated at completion time,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; complete ftp
&rsquo;p/1/$hostnames/&rsquo; <br>
&gt; set hostnames = (rtfm.mit.edu tesla.ee.cornell.edu)
<br>
&gt; ftp [^D] <br>
rtfm.mit.edu tesla.ee.cornell.edu <br>
&gt; ftp [^C] <br>
&gt; set hostnames = (rtfm.mit.edu tesla.ee.cornell.edu
uunet.uu.net) <br>
&gt; ftp [^D] <br>
rtfm.mit.edu tesla.ee.cornell.edu uunet.uu.net</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or from a command run at
completion time:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; complete kill
&rsquo;p/*/&lsquo;ps | awk print&nbsp;&lsquo;/&rsquo; <br>
&gt; kill -9 [^D] <br>
23113 23377 23380 23406 23429 23529 23530 PID</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the complete command
does not itself quote its arguments, so the braces, space
and &lsquo;$&rsquo; in &lsquo;{print $1}&rsquo; must be
quoted explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One command can have multiple
completions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; complete dbx
&rsquo;p/2/(core)/&rsquo; &rsquo;p/*/c/&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">completes the second argument to
&lsquo;dbx&rsquo; with the word &lsquo;core&rsquo; and all
other arguments with commands. Note that the positional
completion is specified before the next-word <br>
completion. Because completions are evaluated from left to
right, if the next-word completion were specified first it
would always match and the positional completion <br>
would never be executed. This is a common mistake when
defining a completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The select pattern is useful
when a command takes files with only particular forms as
arguments. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; complete cc
&rsquo;p/*/f:*.[cao]/&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">completes &lsquo;cc&rsquo;
arguments to files ending in only &lsquo;.c&rsquo;,
&lsquo;.a&rsquo;, or &lsquo;.o&rsquo;. select can also
exclude files, using negation of a glob-pattern as described
under Filename substi&acirc; <br>
tution. One might use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; complete rm
&rsquo;p/*/f:^*.{c,h,cc,C,tex,1,man,l,y}/&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to exclude precious source code
from &lsquo;rm&rsquo; completion. Of course, one could still
type excluded names manually or override the completion
mechanism using the complete- <br>
word-raw or list-choices-raw editor commands (q.v.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lsquo;C&rsquo;,
&lsquo;D&rsquo;, &lsquo;F&rsquo; and &lsquo;T&rsquo; lists
are like &lsquo;c&rsquo;, &lsquo;d&rsquo;, &lsquo;f&rsquo;
and &lsquo;t&rsquo; respectively, but they use the select
argument in a different way: to restrict completion to files
begin&acirc; <br>
ning with a particular path prefix. For example, the Elm
mail program uses &lsquo;=&rsquo; as an abbreviation for
one&rsquo;s mail directory. One might use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; complete elm
c@=@F:$HOME/Mail/@</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to complete &lsquo;elm -f
=&rsquo; as if it were &lsquo;elm -f ~/Mail/&rsquo;. Note
that we used &lsquo;@&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;/&rsquo; to
avoid confusion with the select argument, and we used
&lsquo;$HOME&rsquo; instead of <br>
&lsquo;~&rsquo; because home directory substitution works at
only the beginning of a word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">suffix is used to add a
nonstandard suffix (not space or &lsquo;/&rsquo; for
directories) to completed words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; complete finger
&rsquo;c/*@/$hostnames/&rsquo; &rsquo;p/1/u/@&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">completes arguments to
&lsquo;finger&rsquo; from the list of users, appends an
&lsquo;@&rsquo;, and then completes after the
&lsquo;@&rsquo; from the &lsquo;hostnames&rsquo; variable.
Note again the order in which the <br>
completions are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, here&rsquo;s a complex
example for inspiration:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; complete find
&rsquo;n/-name/f/&rsquo; &rsquo;n/-newer/f/&rsquo;
&rsquo;n/-{,n}cpio/f/&rsquo; &Acirc;&acute;n/-exec/c/&rsquo;
&rsquo;n/-ok/c/&rsquo; &rsquo;n/-user/u/&rsquo;
&rsquo;n/-group/g/&rsquo; &rsquo;n/-fstype/(nfs 4.2)/&rsquo;
&rsquo;n/-type/(b c d f l p s)/&rsquo;
&Acirc;&acute;c/-/(name newer cpio ncpio exec ok user group
fstype type atime ctime depth inum ls mtime nogroup nouser
perm print prune size xdev)/&rsquo; &rsquo;p/*/d/&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This completes words following
&lsquo;-name&rsquo;, &lsquo;-newer&rsquo;,
&lsquo;-cpio&rsquo; or &lsquo;ncpio&rsquo; (note the pattern
which matches both) to files, words following
&lsquo;-exec&rsquo; or &lsquo;-ok&rsquo; to commands, words
<br>
following &lsquo;user&rsquo; and &lsquo;group&rsquo; to
users and groups respectively and words following
&lsquo;-fstype&rsquo; or &lsquo;-type&rsquo; to members of
the given lists. It also completes the switches <br>
themselves from the given list (note the use of c-type
completion) and completes anything not otherwise completed
to a directory. Whew.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remember that programmed
completions are ignored if the word being completed is a
tilde substitution (beginning with &lsquo;~&rsquo;) or a
variable (beginning with &lsquo;$&rsquo;). complete is <br>
an experimental feature, and the syntax may change in future
versions of the shell. See also the uncomplete builtin
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">continue <br>
Continues execution of the nearest enclosing while or
foreach. The rest of the commands on the current line are
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default: <br>
Labels the default case in a switch statement. It should
come after all case labels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dirs [-l] [-n|-v] <br>
dirs -S|-L [filename] (+) <br>
dirs -c (+) <br>
The first form prints the directory stack. The top of the
stack is at the left and the first directory in the stack is
the current directory. With -l, &lsquo;~&rsquo; or
&lsquo;~name&rsquo; in <br>
the output is expanded explicitly to home or the pathname of
the home directory for user name. (+) With -n, entries are
wrapped before they reach the edge of the screen. <br>
(+) With -v, entries are printed one per line, preceded by
their stack positions. (+) If more than one of -n or -v is
given, -v takes precedence. -p is accepted but <br>
does nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -S, the second form saves
the directory stack to filename as a series of cd and pushd
commands. With -L, the shell sources filename, which is
presumably a directory <br>
stack file saved by the -S option or the savedirs mechanism.
In either case, dirsfile is used if filename is not given
and ~/.cshdirs is used if dirsfile is unset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that login shells do the
equivalent of &lsquo;dirs -L&rsquo; on startup and, if
savedirs is set, &lsquo;dirs -S&rsquo; before exiting.
Because only ~/.tcshrc is normally sourced before <br>
~/.cshdirs, dirsfile should be set in ~/.tcshrc rather than
~/.login.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last form clears the
directory stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo [-n] word ... <br>
Writes each word to the shell&rsquo;s standard output,
separated by spaces and terminated with a newline. The
echo_style shell variable may be set to emulate (or not) the
<br>
flags and escape sequences of the BSD and/or System V
versions of echo; see echo(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echotc [-sv] arg ... (+) <br>
Exercises the terminal capabilities (see termcap(5)) in
args. For example, &rsquo;echotc home&rsquo; sends the
cursor to the home position, &rsquo;echotc cm 3 10&rsquo;
sends it to column 3 and <br>
row 10, and &rsquo;echotc ts 0; echo &quot;This is a
test.&quot;; echotc fs&rsquo; prints &quot;This is a
test.&quot; in the status line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If arg is &rsquo;baud&rsquo;,
&rsquo;cols&rsquo;, &rsquo;lines&rsquo;, &rsquo;meta&rsquo;
or &rsquo;tabs&rsquo;, prints the value of that capability
(&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; indicating that the
terminal does or does not have that capabil&acirc; <br>
ity). One might use this to make the output from a shell
script less verbose on slow terminals, or limit command
output to the number of lines on the screen:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; set history=&lsquo;echotc
lines&lsquo; <br>
&gt; @ history--</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Termcap strings may contain
wildcards which will not echo correctly. One should use
double quotes when setting a shell variable to a terminal
capability string, as in <br>
the following example that places the date in the status
line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; set
tosl=&quot;&lsquo;echotc ts 0&lsquo;&quot; <br>
&gt; set frsl=&quot;&lsquo;echotc fs&lsquo;&quot; <br>
&gt; echo -n &quot;$tosl&quot;;date; echo -n
&quot;$frsl&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -s, nonexistent
capabilities return the empty string rather than causing an
error. With -v, messages are verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">else <br>
end <br>
endif <br>
endsw See the description of the foreach, if, switch, and
while statements below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval arg ... <br>
Treats the arguments as input to the shell and executes the
resulting command(s) in the context of the current shell.
This is usually used to execute commands generated <br>
as the result of command or variable substitution, because
parsing occurs before these substitutions. See tset(1) for a
sample use of eval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec command <br>
Executes the specified command in place of the current
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exit [expr] <br>
The shell exits either with the value of the specified expr
(an expression, as described under Expressions) or, without
expr, with the value 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fg [%job ...] <br>
Brings the specified jobs (or, without arguments, the
current job) into the foreground, continuing each if it is
stopped. job may be a number, a string, &lsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;%&rsquo;, &lsquo;+&rsquo; or <br>
&lsquo;-&rsquo; as described under Jobs. See also the
run-fg-editor editor command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filetest -op file ... (+) <br>
Applies op (which is a file inquiry operator as described
under File inquiry operators) to each file and returns the
results as a space-separated list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foreach name (wordlist) <br>
... <br>
end Successively sets the variable name to each member of
wordlist and executes the sequence of commands between this
command and the matching end. (Both foreach and end <br>
must appear alone on separate lines.) The builtin command
continue may be used to continue the loop prematurely and
the builtin command break to terminate it prema&acirc; <br>
turely. When this command is read from the terminal, the
loop is read once prompting with &lsquo;foreach? &rsquo; (or
prompt2) before any statements in the loop are executed. If
<br>
you make a mistake typing in a loop at the terminal you can
rub it out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getspath (+) <br>
Prints the system execution path. (TCF only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getxvers (+) <br>
Prints the experimental version prefix. (TCF only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">glob wordlist <br>
Like echo, but the &lsquo;-n&rsquo; parameter is not
recognized and words are delimited by null characters in the
output. Useful for programs which wish to use the shell to
filename <br>
expand a list of words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">goto word <br>
word is filename and command-substituted to yield a string
of the form &lsquo;label&rsquo;. The shell rewinds its input
as much as possible, searches for a line of the form <br>
&lsquo;label:&rsquo;, possibly preceded by blanks or tabs,
and continues execution after that line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hashstat <br>
Prints a statistics line indicating how effective the
internal hash table has been at locating commands (and
avoiding exec&rsquo;s). An exec is attempted for each
component of <br>
the path where the hash function indicates a possible hit,
and in each component which does not begin with a
&lsquo;/&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On machines without vfork(2),
prints only the number and size of hash buckets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">history [-hTr] [n] <br>
history -S|-L|-M [filename] (+) <br>
history -c (+) <br>
The first form prints the history event list. If n is given
only the n most recent events are printed or saved. With -h,
the history list is printed without leading <br>
numbers. If -T is specified, timestamps are printed also in
comment form. (This can be used to produce files suitable
for loading with &rsquo;history -L&rsquo; or &rsquo;source
-h&rsquo;.) <br>
With -r, the order of printing is most recent first rather
than oldest first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -S, the second form saves
the history list to filename. If the first word of the
savehist shell variable is set to a number, at most that
many lines are saved. If <br>
the second word of savehist is set to &lsquo;merge&rsquo;,
the history list is merged with the existing history file
instead of replacing it (if there is one) and sorted by time
<br>
stamp. (+) Merging is intended for an environment like the X
Window System with several shells in simultaneous use.
Currently it succeeds only when the shells quit <br>
nicely one after another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -L, the shell appends
filename, which is presumably a history list saved by the -S
option or the savehist mechanism, to the history list. -M is
like -L, but the <br>
contents of filename are merged into the history list and
sorted by timestamp. In either case, histfile is used if
filename is not given and ~/.history is used if hist&acirc;
<br>
file is unset. &lsquo;history -L&rsquo; is exactly like
&rsquo;source -h&rsquo; except that it does not require a
filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that login shells do the
equivalent of &lsquo;history -L&rsquo; on startup and, if
savehist is set, &lsquo;history -S&rsquo; before exiting.
Because only ~/.tcshrc is normally sourced <br>
before ~/.history, histfile should be set in ~/.tcshrc
rather than ~/.login.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If histlit is set, the first and
second forms print and save the literal (unexpanded) form of
the history list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last form clears the history
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hup [command] (+) <br>
With command, runs command such that it will exit on a
hangup signal and arranges for the shell to send it a hangup
signal when the shell exits. Note that commands may <br>
set their own response to hangups, overriding hup. Without
an argument, causes the non-interactive shell only to exit
on a hangup for the remainder of the script. See <br>
also Signal handling and the nohup builtin command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (expr) command <br>
If expr (an expression, as described under Expressions)
evaluates true, then command is executed. Variable
substitution on command happens early, at the same time it
<br>
does for the rest of the if command. command must be a
simple command, not an alias, a pipeline, a command list or
a parenthesized command list, but it may have argu&acirc;
<br>
ments. Input/output redirection occurs even if expr is false
and command is thus not executed; this is a bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (expr) then <br>
... <br>
else if (expr2) then <br>
... <br>
else <br>
... <br>
endif If the specified expr is true then the commands to the
first else are executed; otherwise if expr2 is true then the
commands to the second else are executed, etc. Any <br>
number of else-if pairs are possible; only one endif is
needed. The else part is likewise optional. (The words else
and endif must appear at the beginning of input <br>
lines; the if must appear alone on its input line or after
an else.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inlib shared-library ... (+)
<br>
Adds each shared-library to the current environment. There
is no way to remove a shared library. (Domain/OS only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jobs [-l] <br>
Lists the active jobs. With -l, lists process IDs in
addition to the normal information. On TCF systems, prints
the site on which each job is executing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill [-s signal] %job|pid ...
<br>
kill -l The first and second forms sends the specified
signal (or, if none is given, the TERM (terminate) signal)
to the specified jobs or processes. job may be a number, a
<br>
string, &lsquo;&rsquo;, &lsquo;%&rsquo;, &lsquo;+&rsquo; or
&lsquo;-&rsquo; as described under Jobs. Signals are either
given by number or by name (as given in
/usr/include/signal.h, stripped of the prefix
&lsquo;SIG&rsquo;). <br>
There is no default job; saying just &lsquo;kill&rsquo; does
not send a signal to the current job. If the signal being
sent is TERM (terminate) or HUP (hangup), then the job or
<br>
process is sent a CONT (continue) signal as well. The third
form lists the signal names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">limit [-h] [resource
[maximum-use]] <br>
Limits the consumption by the current process and each
process it creates to not individually exceed maximum-use on
the specified resource. If no maximum-use is given, <br>
then the current limit is printed; if no resource is given,
then all limitations are given. If the -h flag is given, the
hard limits are used instead of the current lim&acirc; <br>
its. The hard limits impose a ceiling on the values of the
current limits. Only the super-user may raise the hard
limits, but a user may lower or raise the current lim&acirc;
<br>
its within the legal range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controllable resources currently
include (if supported by the OS):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cputime <br>
the maximum number of cpu-seconds to be used by each
process</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filesize <br>
the largest single file which can be created</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">datasize <br>
the maximum growth of the data+stack region via sbrk(2)
beyond the end of the program text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stacksize <br>
the maximum size of the automatically-extended stack
region</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">coredumpsize <br>
the size of the largest core dump that will be created</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">memoryuse <br>
the maximum amount of physical memory a process may have
allocated to it at a given time (this is not implemented in
the 2.6+ kernel, so there is no effect intro&acirc; <br>
duced by changing this value)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vmemoryuse <br>
the maximum amount of virtual memory a process may have
allocated to it at a given time (address space)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vmemoryuse <br>
the maximum amount of virtual memory a process may have
allocated to it at a given time</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">heapsize <br>
the maximum amount of memory a process may allocate per
brk() system call</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">descriptors or openfiles <br>
the maximum number of open files for this process</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">concurrency <br>
the maximum number of threads for this process</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">memorylocked <br>
the maximum size which a process may lock into memory using
mlock(2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxproc <br>
the maximum number of simultaneous processes for this user
id</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sbsize the maximum size of
socket buffer usage for this user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">swapsize <br>
the maximum amount of swap space reserved or used for this
user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxlocks <br>
the maximum number of locks for this user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxsignal <br>
the maximum number of pending signals for this user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxmessage <br>
the maximum number of bytes in POSIX mqueues for this
user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxnice <br>
the maximum nice priority the user is allowed to raise
mapped from [19...-20] to [0...39] for this user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxrtprio <br>
the maximum realtime priority for this user maxrttime the
timeout for RT tasks in microseconds for this user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maximum-use may be given as a
(floating point or integer) number followed by a scale
factor. For all limits other than cputime the default scale
is &lsquo;k&rsquo; or &lsquo;kilobytes&rsquo; <br>
(1024 bytes); a scale factor of &lsquo;m&rsquo; or
&lsquo;megabytes&rsquo; or &lsquo;g&rsquo; or
&lsquo;gigabytes&rsquo; may also be used. For cputime the
default scaling is &lsquo;seconds&rsquo;, while
&lsquo;m&rsquo; for minutes or &lsquo;h&rsquo; for <br>
hours, or a time of the form &lsquo;mm:ss&rsquo; giving
minutes and seconds may be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If maximum-use is
&lsquo;unlimited&rsquo;, then the limitation on the
specified resource is removed (this is equivalent to the
unlimit builtin command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For both resource names and
scale factors, unambiguous prefixes of the names
suffice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log (+) Prints the watch shell
variable and reports on each user indicated in watch who is
logged in, regardless of when they last logged in. See also
watchlog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">login Terminates a login shell,
replacing it with an instance of /bin/login. This is one way
to log off, included for compatibility with sh(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logout Terminates a login shell.
Especially useful if ignoreeof is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ls-F [-switch ...] [file ...]
(+) <br>
Lists files like &lsquo;ls -F&rsquo;, but much faster. It
identifies each type of special file in the listing with a
special character:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/ Directory <br>
* Executable <br>
# Block device <br>
% Character device <br>
| Named pipe (systems with named pipes only) <br>
= Socket (systems with sockets only) <br>
@ Symbolic link (systems with symbolic links only) <br>
+ Hidden directory (AIX only) or context dependent (HP/UX
only) <br>
: Network special (HP/UX only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the listlinks shell variable
is set, symbolic links are identified in more detail (on
only systems that have them, of course):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@ Symbolic link to a
non-directory <br>
&gt; Symbolic link to a directory <br>
&amp; Symbolic link to nowhere</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">listlinks also slows down ls-F
and causes partitions holding files pointed to by symbolic
links to be mounted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the listflags shell variable
is set to &lsquo;x&rsquo;, &lsquo;a&rsquo; or
&lsquo;A&rsquo;, or any combination thereof (e.g.,
&lsquo;xA&rsquo;), they are used as flags to ls-F, making it
act like &lsquo;ls -xF&rsquo;, &lsquo;ls -Fa&rsquo;, <br>
&lsquo;ls -FA&rsquo; or a combination (e.g., &lsquo;ls
-FxA&rsquo;). On machines where &lsquo;ls -C&rsquo; is not
the default, ls-F acts like &lsquo;ls -CF&rsquo;, unless
listflags contains an &lsquo;x&rsquo;, in which case it <br>
acts like &lsquo;ls -xF&rsquo;. ls-F passes its arguments to
ls(1) if it is given any switches, so &lsquo;alias ls
ls-F&rsquo; generally does the right thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ls-F builtin can list files
using different colors depending on the filetype or
extension. See the color shell variable and the LS_COLORS
environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">migrate [-site] pid|%jobid ...
(+) <br>
migrate -site (+) <br>
The first form migrates the process or job to the site
specified or the default site determined by the system path.
The second form is equivalent to &lsquo;migrate -site
$$&rsquo;: <br>
it migrates the current process to the specified site.
Migrating the shell itself can cause unexpected behavior,
because the shell does not like to lose its tty. (TCF <br>
only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newgrp [-] [group] (+) <br>
Equivalent to &lsquo;exec newgrp&rsquo;; see newgrp(1).
Available only if the shell was so compiled; see the version
shell variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nice [+number] [command] <br>
Sets the scheduling priority for the shell to number, or,
without number, to 4. With command, runs command at the
appropriate priority. The greater the number, the less <br>
cpu the process gets. The super-user may specify negative
priority by using &lsquo;nice -number ...&rsquo;. Command is
always executed in a sub-shell, and the restrictions placed
<br>
on commands in simple if statements apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nohup [command] <br>
With command, runs command such that it will ignore hangup
signals. Note that commands may set their own response to
hangups, overriding nohup. Without an argument, <br>
causes the non-interactive shell only to ignore hangups for
the remainder of the script. See also Signal handling and
the hup builtin command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notify [%job ...] <br>
Causes the shell to notify the user asynchronously when the
status of any of the specified jobs (or, without %job, the
current job) changes, instead of waiting until the <br>
next prompt as is usual. job may be a number, a string,
&lsquo;&rsquo;, &lsquo;%&rsquo;, &lsquo;+&rsquo; or
&lsquo;-&rsquo; as described under Jobs. See also the notify
shell variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">onintr [-|label] <br>
Controls the action of the shell on interrupts. Without
arguments, restores the default action of the shell on
interrupts, which is to terminate shell scripts or to <br>
return to the terminal command input level. With
&lsquo;-&rsquo;, causes all interrupts to be ignored. With
label, causes the shell to execute a &lsquo;goto
label&rsquo; when an interrupt is <br>
received or a child process terminates because it was
interrupted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">onintr is ignored if the shell
is running detached and in system startup files (see FILES),
where interrupts are disabled anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">popd [-p] [-l] [-n|-v] [+n] <br>
Without arguments, pops the directory stack and returns to
the new top directory. With a number &lsquo;+n&rsquo;,
discards the n&rsquo;th entry in the stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, all forms of popd print
the final directory stack, just like dirs. The pushdsilent
shell variable can be set to prevent this and the -p flag
can be given to <br>
override pushdsilent. The -l, -n and -v flags have the same
effect on popd as on dirs. (+)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printenv [name] (+) <br>
Prints the names and values of all environment variables or,
with name, the value of the environment variable name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pushd [-p] [-l] [-n|-v]
[name|+n] <br>
Without arguments, exchanges the top two elements of the
directory stack. If pushdtohome is set, pushd without
arguments does &lsquo;pushd ~&rsquo;, like cd. (+) With
name, pushes <br>
the current working directory onto the directory stack and
changes to name. If name is &lsquo;-&rsquo; it is
interpreted as the previous working directory (see Filename
substitu&acirc; <br>
tion). (+) If dunique is set, pushd removes any instances of
name from the stack before pushing it onto the stack. (+)
With a number &lsquo;+n&rsquo;, rotates the nth element of
<br>
the directory stack around to be the top element and changes
to it. If dextract is set, however, &lsquo;pushd +n&rsquo;
extracts the nth directory, pushes it onto the top of the
<br>
stack and changes to it. (+)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, all forms of pushd
print the final directory stack, just like dirs. The
pushdsilent shell variable can be set to prevent this and
the -p flag can be given to <br>
override pushdsilent. The -l, -n and -v flags have the same
effect on pushd as on dirs. (+)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rehash Causes the internal hash
table of the contents of the directories in the path
variable to be recomputed. This is needed if the autorehash
shell variable is not set and <br>
new commands are added to directories in path while you are
logged in. With autorehash, a new command will be found
automatically, except in the special case where <br>
another command of the same name which is located in a
different directory already exists in the hash table. Also
flushes the cache of home directories built by tilde <br>
expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">repeat count command <br>
The specified command, which is subject to the same
restrictions as the command in the one line if statement
above, is executed count times. I/O redirections occur <br>
exactly once, even if count is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rootnode //nodename (+) <br>
Changes the rootnode to //nodename, so that &lsquo;/&rsquo;
will be interpreted as &lsquo;//nodename&rsquo;. (Domain/OS
only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sched (+) <br>
sched [+]hh:mm command (+) <br>
sched -n (+) <br>
The first form prints the scheduled-event list. The sched
shell variable may be set to define the format in which the
scheduled-event list is printed. The second form <br>
adds command to the scheduled-event list. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; sched 11:00 echo It&acute;s
eleven o&acute;clock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">causes the shell to echo
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s eleven o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo; at 11 AM. The
time may be in 12-hour AM/PM format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; sched 5pm set
prompt=&rsquo;[%h] It&acute;s after 5; go home:
&gt;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or may be relative to the
current time:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; sched +2:15
/usr/lib/uucp/uucico -r1 -sother</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A relative time specification
may not use AM/PM format. The third form removes item n from
the event list:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; sched <br>
1 Wed Apr 4 15:42 /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -r1 -sother <br>
2 Wed Apr 4 17:00 set prompt=[%h] It&rsquo;s after 5; go
home: &gt; <br>
&gt; sched -2 <br>
&gt; sched <br>
1 Wed Apr 4 15:42 /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -r1 -sother</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A command in the scheduled-event
list is executed just before the first prompt is printed
after the time when the command is scheduled. It is possible
to miss the exact <br>
time when the command is to be run, but an overdue command
will execute at the next prompt. A command which comes due
while the shell is waiting for user input is exe&acirc; <br>
cuted immediately. However, normal operation of an
already-running command will not be interrupted so that a
scheduled-event list element may be run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This mechanism is similar to,
but not the same as, the at(1) command on some Unix systems.
Its major disadvantage is that it may not run a command at
exactly the speci&acirc; <br>
fied time. Its major advantage is that because sched runs
directly from the shell, it has access to shell variables
and other structures. This provides a mechanism for <br>
changing one&rsquo;s working environment based on the time
of day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set <br>
set name ... <br>
set name=word ... <br>
set [-r] [-f|-l] name=(wordlist) ... (+) <br>
set name[index]=word ... <br>
set -r (+) <br>
set -r name ... (+) <br>
set -r name=word ... (+) <br>
The first form of the command prints the value of all shell
variables. Variables which contain more than a single word
print as a parenthesized word list. The second <br>
form sets name to the null string. The third form sets name
to the single word. The fourth form sets name to the list of
words in wordlist. In all cases the value is <br>
command and filename expanded. If -r is specified, the value
is set read-only. If -f or -l are specified, set only unique
words keeping their order. -f prefers the <br>
first occurrence of a word, and -l the last. The fifth form
sets the index&rsquo;th component of name to word; this
component must already exist. The sixth form lists only <br>
the names of all shell variables that are read-only. The
seventh form makes name read-only, whether or not it has a
value. The eighth form is the same as the third <br>
form, but make name read-only at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These arguments can be repeated
to set and/or make read-only multiple variables in a single
set command. Note, however, that variable expansion happens
for all arguments <br>
before any setting occurs. Note also that &lsquo;=&rsquo;
can be adjacent to both name and word or separated from both
by whitespace, but cannot be adjacent to only one or the
<br>
other. See also the unset builtin command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setenv [name [value]] <br>
Without arguments, prints the names and values of all
environment variables. Given name, sets the environment
variable name to value or, without value, to the null <br>
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setpath path (+) <br>
Equivalent to setpath(1). (Mach only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setspath LOCAL|site|cpu ... (+)
<br>
Sets the system execution path. (TCF only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">settc cap value (+) <br>
Tells the shell to believe that the terminal capability cap
(as defined in termcap(5)) has the value value. No sanity
checking is done. Concept terminal users may have <br>
to &lsquo;settc xn no&rsquo; to get proper wrapping at the
rightmost column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setty [-d|-q|-x] [-a]
[[+|-]mode] (+) <br>
Controls which tty modes (see Terminal management) the shell
does not allow to change. -d, -q or -x tells setty to act on
the &lsquo;edit&rsquo;, &lsquo;quote&rsquo; or
&lsquo;execute&rsquo; set of tty <br>
modes respectively; without -d, -q or -x,
&lsquo;execute&rsquo; is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without other arguments, setty
lists the modes in the chosen set which are fixed on
(&lsquo;+mode&rsquo;) or off (&lsquo;-mode&rsquo;). The
available modes, and thus the display, vary from sys&acirc;
<br>
tem to system. With -a, lists all tty modes in the chosen
set whether or not they are fixed. With +mode, -mode or
mode, fixes mode on or off or removes control from <br>
mode in the chosen set. For example, &lsquo;setty +echok
echoe&rsquo; fixes &lsquo;echok&rsquo; mode on and allows
commands to turn &lsquo;echoe&rsquo; mode on or off, both
when the shell is executing com&acirc; <br>
mands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setxvers [string] (+) <br>
Set the experimental version prefix to string, or removes it
if string is omitted. (TCF only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shift [variable] <br>
Without arguments, discards argv[1] and shifts the members
of argv to the left. It is an error for argv not to be set
or to have less than one word as value. With vari&acirc;
<br>
able, performs the same function on variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source [-h] name [args ...] <br>
The shell reads and executes commands from name. The
commands are not placed on the history list. If any args are
given, they are placed in argv. (+) source commands <br>
may be nested; if they are nested too deeply the shell may
run out of file descriptors. An error in a source at any
level terminates all nested source commands. With <br>
-h, commands are placed on the history list instead of being
executed, much like &lsquo;history -L&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop %job|pid ... <br>
Stops the specified jobs or processes which are executing in
the background. job may be a number, a string,
&lsquo;&rsquo;, &lsquo;%&rsquo;, &lsquo;+&rsquo; or
&lsquo;-&rsquo; as described under Jobs. There is no <br>
default job; saying just &lsquo;stop&rsquo; does not stop
the current job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">suspend Causes the shell to stop
in its tracks, much as if it had been sent a stop signal
with ^Z. This is most often used to stop shells started by
su(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">switch (string) <br>
case str1: <br>
... <br>
breaksw <br>
... <br>
default: <br>
... <br>
breaksw <br>
endsw Each case label is successively matched, against the
specified string which is first command and filename
expanded. The file metacharacters &lsquo;*&rsquo;,
&lsquo;?&rsquo; and &lsquo;[...]&rsquo; may be <br>
used in the case labels, which are variable expanded. If
none of the labels match before a &lsquo;default&rsquo;
label is found, then the execution begins after the default
label. <br>
Each case label and the default label must appear at the
beginning of a line. The command breaksw causes execution to
continue after the endsw. Otherwise control may <br>
fall through case labels and default labels as in C. If no
label matches and there is no default, execution continues
after the endsw.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">telltc (+) <br>
Lists the values of all terminal capabilities (see
termcap(5)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">termname [terminal type] (+)
<br>
Tests if terminal type (or the current value of TERM if no
terminal type is given) has an entry in the hosts termcap(5)
or terminfo(5) database. Prints the terminal type <br>
to stdout and returns 0 if an entry is present otherwise
returns 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time [command] <br>
Executes command (which must be a simple command, not an
alias, a pipeline, a command list or a parenthesized command
list) and prints a time summary as described under <br>
the time variable. If necessary, an extra shell is created
to print the time statistic when the command completes.
Without command, prints a time summary for the cur&acirc;
<br>
rent shell and its children.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">umask [value] <br>
Sets the file creation mask to value, which is given in
octal. Common values for the mask are 002, giving all access
to the group and read and execute access to others, <br>
and 022, giving read and execute access to the group and
others. Without value, prints the current file creation
mask.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unalias pattern <br>
Removes all aliases whose names match pattern.
&lsquo;unalias *&rsquo; thus removes all aliases. It is not
an error for nothing to be unaliased.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uncomplete pattern (+) <br>
Removes all completions whose names match pattern.
&lsquo;uncomplete *&rsquo; thus removes all completions. It
is not an error for nothing to be uncompleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unhash Disables use of the
internal hash table to speed location of executed
programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">universe universe (+) <br>
Sets the universe to universe. (Masscomp/RTU only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unlimit [-hf] [resource] <br>
Removes the limitation on resource or, if no resource is
specified, all resource limitations. With -h, the
corresponding hard limits are removed. Only the super-user
<br>
may do this. Note that unlimit may not exit successful,
since most systems do not allow descriptors to be unlimited.
With -f errors are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unset pattern <br>
Removes all variables whose names match pattern, unless they
are read-only. &lsquo;unset *&rsquo; thus removes all
variables unless they are read-only; this is a bad idea. It
is <br>
not an error for nothing to be unset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unsetenv pattern <br>
Removes all environment variables whose names match pattern.
&lsquo;unsetenv *&rsquo; thus removes all environment
variables; this is a bad idea. It is not an error for
nothing to <br>
be unsetenved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ver [systype [command]] (+) <br>
Without arguments, prints SYSTYPE. With systype, sets
SYSTYPE to systype. With systype and command, executes
command under systype. systype may be &lsquo;bsd4.3&rsquo;
or <br>
&lsquo;sys5.3&rsquo;. (Domain/OS only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wait The shell waits for all
background jobs. If the shell is interactive, an interrupt
will disrupt the wait and cause the shell to print the names
and job numbers of all <br>
outstanding jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warp universe (+) <br>
Sets the universe to universe. (Convex/OS only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watchlog (+) <br>
An alternate name for the log builtin command (q.v.).
Available only if the shell was so compiled; see the version
shell variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where command (+) <br>
Reports all known instances of command, including aliases,
builtins and executables in path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which command (+) <br>
Displays the command that will be executed by the shell
after substitutions, path searching, etc. The builtin
command is just like which(1), but it correctly reports <br>
tcsh aliases and builtins and is 10 to 100 times faster. See
also the which-command editor command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while (expr) <br>
... <br>
end Executes the commands between the while and the matching
end while expr (an expression, as described under
Expressions) evaluates non-zero. while and end must appear
<br>
alone on their input lines. break and continue may be used
to terminate or continue the loop prematurely. If the input
is a terminal, the user is prompted the first <br>
time through the loop as with foreach.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special aliases (+) <br>
If set, each of these aliases executes automatically at the
indicated time. They are all initially undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beepcmd Runs when the shell
wants to ring the terminal bell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cwdcmd Runs after every change
of working directory. For example, if the user is working on
an X window system using xterm(1) and a re-parenting window
manager that supports <br>
title bars such as twm(1) and does</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; alias cwdcmd &rsquo;echo -n
&quot;^[]2;${HOST}:$cwd ^G&quot;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then the shell will change the
title of the running xterm(1) to be the name of the host, a
colon, and the full current working directory. A fancier way
to do that is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; alias cwdcmd &rsquo;echo -n
&quot;^[]2;${HOST}:$cwd^G^[]1;${HOST}^G&quot;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will put the hostname and
working directory on the title bar but only the hostname in
the icon manager menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that putting a cd, pushd or
popd in cwdcmd may cause an infinite loop. It is the
author&rsquo;s opinion that anyone doing so will get what
they deserve.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jobcmd Runs before each command
gets executed, or when the command changes state. This is
similar to postcmd, but it does not print builtins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; alias jobcmd &rsquo;echo -n
&quot;^[]2;#:q^G&quot;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then executing vi foo.c will put
the command string in the xterm title bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">helpcommand <br>
Invoked by the run-help editor command. The command name for
which help is sought is passed as sole argument. For
example, if one does</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; alias helpcommand &rsquo;:1
--help&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then the help display of the
command itself will be invoked, using the GNU help calling
convention. Currently there is no easy way to account for
various calling conven&acirc; <br>
tions (e.g., the customary Unix &lsquo;-h&rsquo;), except by
using a table of many commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">periodic <br>
Runs every tperiod minutes. This provides a convenient means
for checking on common but infrequent changes such as new
mail. For example, if one does</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; set tperiod = 30 <br>
&gt; alias periodic checknews</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then the checknews(1) program
runs every 30 minutes. If periodic is set but tperiod is
unset or set to 0, periodic behaves like precmd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">precmd Runs just before each
prompt is printed. For example, if one does</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; alias precmd date</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then date(1) runs just before
the shell prompts for each command. There are no limits on
what precmd can be set to do, but discretion should be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">postcmd Runs before each command
gets executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; alias postcmd &rsquo;echo
-n &quot;^[]2;#:q^G&quot;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then executing vi foo.c will put
the command string in the xterm title bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell Specifies the interpreter
for executable scripts which do not themselves specify an
interpreter. The first word should be a full path name to
the desired interpreter <br>
(e.g., &lsquo;/bin/csh&rsquo; or
&lsquo;/usr/local/bin/tcsh&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special shell variables <br>
The variables described in this section have special meaning
to the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shell sets addsuffix, argv,
autologout, csubstnonl, command, echo_style, edit, gid,
group, home, loginsh, oid, path, prompt, prompt2, prompt3,
shell, shlvl, tcsh, term, tty, <br>
uid, user and version at startup; they do not change
thereafter unless changed by the user. The shell updates
cwd, dirstack, owd and status when necessary, and sets
logout on <br>
logout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shell synchronizes group,
home, path, shlvl, term and user with the environment
variables of the same names: whenever the environment
variable changes the shell changes the <br>
corresponding shell variable to match (unless the shell
variable is read-only) and vice versa. Note that although
cwd and PWD have identical meanings, they are not
synchronized <br>
in this manner, and that the shell automatically converts
between the different formats of path and PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">addsuffix (+) <br>
If set, filename completion adds &lsquo;/&rsquo; to the end
of directories and a space to the end of normal files when
they are matched exactly. Set by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">afsuser (+) <br>
If set, autologout&rsquo;s autolock feature uses its value
instead of the local username for kerberos
authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ampm (+) <br>
If set, all times are shown in 12-hour AM/PM format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">argv The arguments to the shell.
Positional parameters are taken from argv, i.e.,
&lsquo;$1&rsquo; is replaced by &lsquo;$argv[1]&rsquo;, etc.
Set by default, but usually empty in interactive <br>
shells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autocorrect (+) <br>
If set, the spell-word editor command is invoked
automatically before each completion attempt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoexpand (+) <br>
If set, the expand-history editor command is invoked
automatically before each completion attempt. If this is set
to onlyhistory, then only history will be expanded and a
<br>
second completion will expand filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autolist (+) <br>
If set, possibilities are listed after an ambiguous
completion. If set to &lsquo;ambiguous&rsquo;, possibilities
are listed only when no new characters are added by
completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autologout (+) <br>
The first word is the number of minutes of inactivity before
automatic logout. The optional second word is the number of
minutes of inactivity before automatic locking. <br>
When the shell automatically logs out, it prints
&lsquo;auto-logout&rsquo;, sets the variable logout to
&lsquo;automatic&rsquo; and exits. When the shell
automatically locks, the user is <br>
required to enter his password to continue working. Five
incorrect attempts result in automatic logout. Set to
&lsquo;60&rsquo; (automatic logout after 60 minutes, and no
locking) <br>
by default in login and superuser shells, but not if the
shell thinks it is running under a window system (i.e., the
DISPLAY environment variable is set), the tty is a <br>
pseudo-tty (pty) or the shell was not so compiled (see the
version shell variable). See also the afsuser and logout
shell variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autorehash (+) <br>
If set, the internal hash table of the contents of the
directories in the path variable will be recomputed if a
command is not found in the hash table. In addition, the
<br>
list of available commands will be rebuilt for each command
completion or spelling correction attempt if set to
&lsquo;complete&rsquo; or &lsquo;correct&rsquo;
respectively; if set to &lsquo;always&rsquo;, <br>
this will be done for both cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">backslash_quote (+) <br>
If set, backslashes (&lsquo;&acute;) always quote
&lsquo;&acute;, &lsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;&quot;&rsquo;. This may make complex quoting tasks
easier, but it can cause syntax errors in csh(1)
scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">catalog The file name of the
message catalog. If set, tcsh use
&lsquo;tcsh.${catalog}&rsquo; as a message catalog instead
of default &lsquo;tcsh&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cdpath A list of directories in
which cd should search for subdirectories if they
aren&rsquo;t found in the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">color If set, it enables color
display for the builtin ls-F and it passes --color=auto to
ls. Alternatively, it can be set to only ls-F or only ls to
enable color to only one <br>
command. Setting it to nothing is equivalent to setting it
to (ls-F ls).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">colorcat <br>
If set, it enables color escape sequence for NLS message
files. And display colorful NLS messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command (+) <br>
If set, the command which was passed to the shell with the
-c flag (q.v.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compat_expr (+) <br>
If set, the shell will evaluate expressions right to left,
like the original csh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">complete (+) <br>
If set to &lsquo;igncase&rsquo;, the completion becomes case
insensitive. If set to &lsquo;enhance&rsquo;, completion
ignores case and considers hyphens and underscores to be
equivalent; it <br>
will also treat periods, hyphens and underscores
(&lsquo;.&rsquo;, &lsquo;-&rsquo; and &lsquo;_&rsquo;) as
word separators. If set to &lsquo;Enhance&rsquo;, completion
matches uppercase and underscore characters <br>
explicitly and matches lowercase and hyphens in a
case-insensivite manner; it will treat periods, hypens and
underscores as word separators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">continue (+) <br>
If set to a list of commands, the shell will continue the
listed commands, instead of starting a new one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">continue_args (+) <br>
Same as continue, but the shell will execute:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo &lsquo;pwd&lsquo; $argv
&gt; ~/.&lt;cmd&gt;_pause; %&lt;cmd&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">correct (+) <br>
If set to &lsquo;cmd&rsquo;, commands are automatically
spelling-corrected. If set to &lsquo;complete&rsquo;,
commands are automatically completed. If set to
&lsquo;all&rsquo;, the entire command line is <br>
corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">csubstnonl (+) <br>
If set, newlines and carriage returns in command
substitution are replaced by spaces. Set by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cwd The full pathname of the
current directory. See also the dirstack and owd shell
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dextract (+) <br>
If set, &lsquo;pushd +n&rsquo; extracts the nth directory
from the directory stack rather than rotating it to the
top.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dirsfile (+) <br>
The default location in which &lsquo;dirs -S&rsquo; and
&lsquo;dirs -L&rsquo; look for a history file. If unset,
~/.cshdirs is used. Because only ~/.tcshrc is normally
sourced before <br>
~/.cshdirs, dirsfile should be set in ~/.tcshrc rather than
~/.login.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dirstack (+) <br>
An array of all the directories on the directory stack.
&lsquo;$dirstack[1]&rsquo; is the current working directory,
&lsquo;$dirstack[2]&rsquo; the first directory on the stack,
etc. Note that <br>
the current working directory is &lsquo;$dirstack[1]&rsquo;
but &lsquo;=0&rsquo; in directory stack substitutions, etc.
One can change the stack arbitrarily by setting dirstack,
but the first <br>
element (the current working directory) is always correct.
See also the cwd and owd shell variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dspmbyte (+) <br>
Has an effect iff &rsquo;dspm&rsquo; is listed as part of
the version shell variable. If set to &lsquo;euc&rsquo;, it
enables display and editing EUC-kanji(Japanese) code. If set
to &lsquo;sjis&rsquo;, it <br>
enables display and editing Shift-JIS(Japanese) code. If set
to &lsquo;big5&rsquo;, it enables display and editing
Big5(Chinese) code. If set to &lsquo;utf8&rsquo;, it enables
display and <br>
editing Utf8(Unicode) code. If set to the following format,
it enables display and editing of original multi-byte code
format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; set dspmbyte = 0000....(256
bytes)....0000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The table requires just 256
bytes. Each character of 256 characters corresponds (from
left to right) to the ASCII codes 0x00, 0x01, ... 0xff. Each
character is set to <br>
number 0,1,2 and 3. Each number has the following meaning:
<br>
0 ... not used for multi-byte characters. <br>
1 ... used for the first byte of a multi-byte character.
<br>
2 ... used for the second byte of a multi-byte character.
<br>
3 ... used for both the first byte and second byte of a
multi-byte character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: <br>
If set to &lsquo;001322&rsquo;, the first character (means
0x00 of the ASCII code) and second character (means 0x01 of
ASCII code) are set to &lsquo;0&rsquo;. Then, it is not used
for multi- <br>
byte characters. The 3rd character (0x02) is set to
&rsquo;1&rsquo;, indicating that it is used for the first
byte of a multi-byte character. The 4th character(0x03) is
set &rsquo;3&rsquo;. <br>
It is used for both the first byte and the second byte of a
multi-byte character. The 5th and 6th characters (0x04,0x05)
are set to &rsquo;2&rsquo;, indicating that they are used
<br>
for the second byte of a multi-byte character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GNU fileutils version of ls
cannot display multi-byte filenames without the -N (
--literal ) option. If you are using this version, set the
second word of dspmbyte <br>
to &quot;ls&quot;. If not, for example, &quot;ls-F -l&quot;
cannot display multi-byte filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: <br>
This variable can only be used if KANJI and DSPMBYTE has
been defined at compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dunique (+) <br>
If set, pushd removes any instances of name from the stack
before pushing it onto the stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo If set, each command with
its arguments is echoed just before it is executed. For
non-builtin commands all expansions occur before echoing.
Builtin commands are echoed <br>
before command and filename substitution, because these
substitutions are then done selectively. Set by the -x
command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo_style (+) <br>
The style of the echo builtin. May be set to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bsd Don&rsquo;t echo a newline
if the first argument is &lsquo;-n&rsquo;. <br>
sysv Recognize backslashed escape sequences in echo strings.
<br>
both Recognize both the &lsquo;-n&rsquo; flag and
backslashed escape sequences; the default. <br>
none Recognize neither.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set by default to the local
system default. The BSD and System V options are described
in the echo(1) man pages on the appropriate systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">edit (+) <br>
If set, the command-line editor is used. Set by default in
interactive shells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ellipsis (+) <br>
If set, the &lsquo;%c&rsquo;/&lsquo;%.&rsquo; and
&lsquo;%C&rsquo; prompt sequences (see the prompt shell
variable) indicate skipped directories with an ellipsis
(&lsquo;...&rsquo;) instead of
&lsquo;/&lt;skipped&gt;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">euid (+) <br>
The user&rsquo;s effective user ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">euser (+) <br>
The first matching passwd entry name corresponding to the
effective user ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fignore (+) <br>
Lists file name suffixes to be ignored by completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filec In tcsh, completion is
always used and this variable is ignored by default. If edit
is unset, then the traditional csh completion is used. If
set in csh, filename com&acirc; <br>
pletion is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gid (+) The user&rsquo;s real
group ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">globdot (+) <br>
If set, wild-card glob patterns will match files and
directories beginning with &lsquo;.&rsquo; except for
&lsquo;.&rsquo; and &lsquo;..&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">globstar (+) <br>
If set, the &lsquo;**&rsquo; and &lsquo;***&rsquo; file glob
patterns will match any string of characters including
&lsquo;/&rsquo; traversing any existing sub-directories.
(e.g. &lsquo;ls **.c&rsquo; will list all <br>
the .c files in the current directory tree). If used by
itself, it will match zero or more sub-directories (e.g.
&lsquo;ls /usr/include/**/time.h&rsquo; will list any file
named <br>
&lsquo;time.h&rsquo; in the /usr/include directory tree;
whereas &lsquo;ls /usr/include/**time.h&rsquo; will match
any file in the /usr/include directory tree ending in
&lsquo;time.h&rsquo;). To prevent <br>
problems with recursion, the &lsquo;**&rsquo; glob-pattern
will not descend into a symbolic link containing a
directory. To override this, use &lsquo;***&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">group (+) <br>
The user&rsquo;s group name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">highlight <br>
If set, the incremental search match (in i-search-back and
i-search-fwd) and the region between the mark and the cursor
are highlighted in reverse video.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Highlighting requires more
frequent terminal writes, which introduces extra overhead.
If you care about terminal performance, you may want to
leave this unset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">histchars <br>
A string value determining the characters used in History
substitution (q.v.). The first character of its value is
used as the history substitution character, replacing <br>
the default character &lsquo;!&rsquo;. The second character
of its value replaces the character &lsquo;^&rsquo; in quick
substitutions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">histdup (+) <br>
Controls handling of duplicate entries in the history list.
If set to &lsquo;all&rsquo; only unique history events are
entered in the history list. If set to &lsquo;prev&rsquo;
and the last <br>
history event is the same as the current command, then the
current command is not entered in the history. If set to
&lsquo;erase&rsquo; and the same event is found in the
history <br>
list, that old event gets erased and the current one gets
inserted. Note that the &lsquo;prev&rsquo; and
&lsquo;all&rsquo; options renumber history events so there
are no gaps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">histfile (+) <br>
The default location in which &lsquo;history -S&rsquo; and
&lsquo;history -L&rsquo; look for a history file. If unset,
~/.history is used. histfile is useful when sharing the same
home direc&acirc; <br>
tory between different machines, or when saving separate
histories on different terminals. Because only ~/.tcshrc is
normally sourced before ~/.history, histfile should <br>
be set in ~/.tcshrc rather than ~/.login.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">histlit (+) <br>
If set, builtin and editor commands and the savehist
mechanism use the literal (unexpanded) form of lines in the
history list. See also the toggle-literal-history editor
<br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">history The first word indicates
the number of history events to save. The optional second
word (+) indicates the format in which history is printed;
if not given, <br>
&lsquo;%h%T%R0 is used. The format sequences are described
below under prompt; note the variable meaning of
&lsquo;%R&rsquo;. Set to &lsquo;100&rsquo; by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">home Initialized to the home
directory of the invoker. The filename expansion of
&lsquo;~&rsquo; refers to this variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignoreeof <br>
If set to the empty string or &lsquo;0&rsquo; and the input
device is a terminal, the end-of-file command (usually
generated by the user by typing &lsquo;^D&rsquo; on an empty
line) causes the <br>
shell to print &lsquo;Use &quot;exit&quot; to leave
tcsh.&rsquo; instead of exiting. This prevents the shell
from accidentally being killed. Historically this setting
exited after 26 succes&acirc; <br>
sive EOF&rsquo;s to avoid infinite loops. If set to a number
n, the shell ignores n - 1 consecutive end-of-files and
exits on the nth. (+) If unset, &lsquo;1&rsquo; is used,
i.e., the <br>
shell exits on a single &lsquo;^D&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">implicitcd (+) <br>
If set, the shell treats a directory name typed as a command
as though it were a request to change to that directory. If
set to verbose, the change of directory is <br>
echoed to the standard output. This behavior is inhibited in
non-interactive shell scripts, or for command strings with
more than one word. Changing directory takes <br>
precedence over executing a like-named command, but it is
done after alias substitutions. Tilde and variable
expansions work as expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inputmode (+) <br>
If set to &lsquo;insert&rsquo; or &lsquo;overwrite&rsquo;,
puts the editor into that input mode at the beginning of
each line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">killdup (+) <br>
Controls handling of duplicate entries in the kill ring. If
set to &lsquo;all&rsquo; only unique strings are entered in
the kill ring. If set to &lsquo;prev&rsquo; and the last
killed string <br>
is the same as the current killed string, then the current
string is not entered in the ring. If set to
&lsquo;erase&rsquo; and the same string is found in the kill
ring, the old <br>
string is erased and the current one is inserted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">killring (+) <br>
Indicates the number of killed strings to keep in memory.
Set to &lsquo;30&rsquo; by default. If unset or set to less
than &lsquo;2&rsquo;, the shell will only keep the most
recently killed <br>
string. Strings are put in the killring by the editor
commands that delete (kill) strings of text, e.g.
backward-delete-word, kill-line, etc, as well as the
copy-region- <br>
as-kill command. The yank editor command will yank the most
recently killed string into the command-line, while yank-pop
(see Editor commands) can be used to yank ear&acirc; <br>
lier killed strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">listflags (+) <br>
If set to &lsquo;x&rsquo;, &lsquo;a&rsquo; or
&lsquo;A&rsquo;, or any combination thereof (e.g.,
&lsquo;xA&rsquo;), they are used as flags to ls-F, making it
act like &lsquo;ls -xF&rsquo;, &lsquo;ls -Fa&rsquo;,
&lsquo;ls -FA&rsquo; or a combination <br>
(e.g., &lsquo;ls -FxA&rsquo;): &lsquo;a&rsquo; shows all
files (even if they start with a &lsquo;.&rsquo;),
&lsquo;A&rsquo; shows all files but &lsquo;.&rsquo; and
&lsquo;..&rsquo;, and &lsquo;x&rsquo; sorts across instead
of down. If the second word of <br>
listflags is set, it is used as the path to
&lsquo;ls(1)&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">listjobs (+) <br>
If set, all jobs are listed when a job is suspended. If set
to &lsquo;long&rsquo;, the listing is in long format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">listlinks (+) <br>
If set, the ls-F builtin command shows the type of file to
which each symbolic link points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">listmax (+) <br>
The maximum number of items which the list-choices editor
command will list without asking first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">listmaxrows (+) <br>
The maximum number of rows of items which the list-choices
editor command will list without asking first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loginsh (+) <br>
Set by the shell if it is a login shell. Setting or
unsetting it within a shell has no effect. See also
shlvl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logout (+) <br>
Set by the shell to &lsquo;normal&rsquo; before a normal
logout, &lsquo;automatic&rsquo; before an automatic logout,
and &lsquo;hangup&rsquo; if the shell was killed by a hangup
signal (see Signal han&acirc; <br>
dling). See also the autologout shell variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mail A list of files and
directories to check for incoming mail, optionally preceded
by a numeric word. Before each prompt, if 10 minutes have
passed since the last check, <br>
the shell checks each file and says &lsquo;You have new
mail.&rsquo; (or, if mail contains multiple files,
&lsquo;You have new mail in name.&rsquo;) if the filesize is
greater than zero in size <br>
and has a modification time greater than its access
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are in a login shell,
then no mail file is reported unless it has been modified
after the time the shell has started up, to prevent
redundant notifications. Most <br>
login programs will tell you whether or not you have mail
when you log in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a file specified in mail is a
directory, the shell will count each file within that
directory as a separate message, and will report &lsquo;You
have n mails.&rsquo; or &lsquo;You have n <br>
mails in name.&rsquo; as appropriate. This functionality is
provided primarily for those systems which store mail in
this manner, such as the Andrew Mail System.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the first word of mail is
numeric it is taken as a different mail checking interval,
in seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under very rare circumstances,
the shell may report &lsquo;You have mail.&rsquo; instead of
&lsquo;You have new mail.&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">matchbeep (+) <br>
If set to &lsquo;never&rsquo;, completion never beeps. If
set to &lsquo;nomatch&rsquo;, it beeps only when there is no
match. If set to &lsquo;ambiguous&rsquo;, it beeps when
there are multiple matches. <br>
If set to &lsquo;notunique&rsquo;, it beeps when there is
one exact and other longer matches. If unset,
&lsquo;ambiguous&rsquo; is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nobeep (+) <br>
If set, beeping is completely disabled. See also
visiblebell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noclobber <br>
If set, restrictions are placed on output redirection to
insure that files are not accidentally destroyed and that
&lsquo;&gt;&gt;&rsquo; redirections refer to existing files,
as described <br>
in the Input/output section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noding If set, disable the
printing of &lsquo;DING!&rsquo; in the prompt time
specifiers at the change of hour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noglob If set, Filename
substitution and Directory stack substitution (q.v.) are
inhibited. This is most useful in shell scripts which do not
deal with filenames, or after a <br>
list of filenames has been obtained and further expansions
are not desirable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nokanji (+) <br>
If set and the shell supports Kanji (see the version shell
variable), it is disabled so that the meta key can be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nonomatch <br>
If set, a Filename substitution or Directory stack
substitution (q.v.) which does not match any existing files
is left untouched rather than causing an error. It is <br>
still an error for the substitution to be malformed, e.g.,
&lsquo;echo [&rsquo; still gives an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nostat (+) <br>
A list of directories (or glob-patterns which match
directories; see Filename substitution) that should not be
stat(2)ed during a completion operation. This is usually
<br>
used to exclude directories which take too much time to
stat(2), for example /afs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notify If set, the shell
announces job completions asynchronously. The default is to
present job completions just before printing a prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">oid (+) The user&rsquo;s real
organization ID. (Domain/OS only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">owd (+) The old working
directory, equivalent to the &lsquo;-&rsquo; used by cd and
pushd. See also the cwd and dirstack shell variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">padhour If set, enable the
printing of padding &rsquo;0&rsquo; for hours, in 24 and 12
hour formats. E.G.: 07:45:42 vs. 7:45:42.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">parseoctal <br>
To retain compatibily with older versions numeric variables
starting with 0 are not interpreted as octal. Setting this
variable enables proper octal parsing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path A list of directories in
which to look for executable commands. A null word specifies
the current directory. If there is no path variable then
only full path names will <br>
execute. path is set by the shell at startup from the PATH
environment variable or, if PATH does not exist, to a
system-dependent default something like
&lsquo;(/usr/local/bin <br>
/usr/bsd /bin /usr/bin .)&rsquo;. The shell may put
&lsquo;.&rsquo; first or last in path or omit it entirely
depending on how it was compiled; see the version shell
variable. A shell <br>
which is given neither the -c nor the -t option hashes the
contents of the directories in path after reading ~/.tcshrc
and each time path is reset. If one adds a new <br>
command to a directory in path while the shell is active,
one may need to do a rehash for the shell to find it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printexitvalue (+) <br>
If set and an interactive program exits with a non-zero
status, the shell prints &lsquo;Exit status&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prompt The string which is
printed before reading each command from the terminal.
prompt may include any of the following formatting sequences
(+), which are replaced by the <br>
given information:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%/ The current working
directory. <br>
%~ The current working directory, but with one&rsquo;s home
directory represented by &lsquo;~&rsquo; and other
users&rsquo; home directories represented by
&lsquo;~user&rsquo; as per Filename substitution. <br>
&lsquo;~user&rsquo; substitution happens only if the shell
has already used &lsquo;~user&rsquo; in a pathname in the
current session. <br>
%c[[0]n], %.[[0]n] <br>
The trailing component of the current working directory, or
n trailing components if a digit n is given. If n begins
with &lsquo;0&rsquo;, the number of skipped components
pre&acirc; <br>
cede the trailing component(s) in the format
&lsquo;/&lt;skipped&gt;trailing&rsquo;. If the ellipsis
shell variable is set, skipped components are represented by
an ellipsis so the <br>
whole becomes &lsquo;...trailing&rsquo;. &lsquo;~&rsquo;
substitution is done as in &lsquo;%~&rsquo; above, but the
&lsquo;~&rsquo; component is ignored when counting trailing
components. <br>
%C Like %c, but without &lsquo;~&rsquo; substitution. <br>
%h, %!, ! <br>
The current history event number. <br>
%M The full hostname. <br>
%m The hostname up to the first &lsquo;.&rsquo;. <br>
%S (%s) <br>
Start (stop) standout mode. <br>
%B (%b) <br>
Start (stop) boldfacing mode. <br>
%U (%u) <br>
Start (stop) underline mode. <br>
%t, %@ <br>
The time of day in 12-hour AM/PM format. <br>
%T Like &lsquo;%t&rsquo;, but in 24-hour format (but see the
ampm shell variable). <br>
%p The &lsquo;precise&rsquo; time of day in 12-hour AM/PM
format, with seconds. <br>
%P Like &lsquo;%p&rsquo;, but in 24-hour format (but see the
ampm shell variable). <br>
^c c is parsed as in bindkey. <br>
%% A single &lsquo;%&rsquo;. <br>
%n The user name. <br>
%N The effective user name. <br>
%j The number of jobs. <br>
%d The weekday in &lsquo;Day&rsquo; format. <br>
%D The day in &lsquo;dd&rsquo; format. <br>
%w The month in &lsquo;Mon&rsquo; format. <br>
%W The month in &lsquo;mm&rsquo; format. <br>
%y The year in &lsquo;yy&rsquo; format. <br>
%Y The year in &lsquo;yyyy&rsquo; format. <br>
%l The shell&rsquo;s tty. <br>
%L Clears from the end of the prompt to end of the display
or the end of the line. <br>
%$ Expands the shell or environment variable name
immediately after the &lsquo;$&rsquo;. <br>
%# &lsquo;&gt;&rsquo; (or the first character of the
promptchars shell variable) for normal users,
&lsquo;#&rsquo; (or the second character of promptchars) for
the superuser. <br>
%{string%} <br>
Includes string as a literal escape sequence. It should be
used only to change terminal attributes and should not move
the cursor location. This cannot be the last <br>
sequence in prompt. <br>
%? The return code of the command executed just before the
prompt. <br>
%R In prompt2, the status of the parser. In prompt3, the
corrected string. In history, the history string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;%B&rsquo;,
&lsquo;%S&rsquo;, &lsquo;%U&rsquo; and
&lsquo;%{string%}&rsquo; are available in only
eight-bit-clean shells; see the version shell variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bold, standout and underline
sequences are often used to distinguish a superuser shell.
For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; set prompt = &quot;%m [%h]
%B[%@]%b [%/] you rang? &quot; <br>
tut [37] [2:54pm] [/usr/accts/sys] you rang? _</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &lsquo;%t&rsquo;,
&lsquo;%@&rsquo;, &lsquo;%T&rsquo;, &lsquo;%p&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;%P&rsquo; is used, and noding is not set, then print
&lsquo;DING!&rsquo; on the change of hour (i.e,
&lsquo;:00&rsquo; minutes) instead of the actual time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set by default to &lsquo;%#
&rsquo; in interactive shells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prompt2 (+) <br>
The string with which to prompt in while and foreach loops
and after lines ending in &lsquo;&acute;. The same format
sequences may be used as in prompt (q.v.); note the variable
<br>
meaning of &lsquo;%R&rsquo;. Set by default to &lsquo;%R?
&rsquo; in interactive shells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prompt3 (+) <br>
The string with which to prompt when confirming automatic
spelling correction. The same format sequences may be used
as in prompt (q.v.); note the variable meaning of <br>
&lsquo;%R&rsquo;. Set by default to &lsquo;CORRECT&gt;%R
(y|n|e|a)? &rsquo; in interactive shells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">promptchars (+) <br>
If set (to a two-character string), the &lsquo;%#&rsquo;
formatting sequence in the prompt shell variable is replaced
with the first character for normal users and the second
charac&acirc; <br>
ter for the superuser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pushdtohome (+) <br>
If set, pushd without arguments does &lsquo;pushd ~&rsquo;,
like cd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pushdsilent (+) <br>
If set, pushd and popd do not print the directory stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recexact (+) <br>
If set, completion completes on an exact match even if a
longer match is possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recognize_only_executables (+)
<br>
If set, command listing displays only files in the path that
are executable. Slow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rmstar (+) <br>
If set, the user is prompted before &lsquo;rm *&rsquo; is
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rprompt (+) <br>
The string to print on the right-hand side of the screen
(after the command input) when the prompt is being displayed
on the left. It recognizes the same formatting <br>
characters as prompt. It will automatically disappear and
reappear as necessary, to ensure that command input
isn&rsquo;t obscured, and will appear only if the prompt,
command <br>
input, and itself will fit together on the first line. If
edit isn&rsquo;t set, then rprompt will be printed after the
prompt and before the command input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">savedirs (+) <br>
If set, the shell does &lsquo;dirs -S&rsquo; before exiting.
If the first word is set to a number, at most that many
directory stack entries are saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">savehist <br>
If set, the shell does &lsquo;history -S&rsquo; before
exiting. If the first word is set to a number, at most that
many lines are saved. (The number must be less than or equal
to <br>
history.) If the second word is set to &lsquo;merge&rsquo;,
the history list is merged with the existing history file
instead of replacing it (if there is one) and sorted by time
<br>
stamp and the most recent events are retained. (+)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sched (+) <br>
The format in which the sched builtin command prints
scheduled events; if not given, &lsquo;%h%T%R0 is used. The
format sequences are described above under prompt; note <br>
the variable meaning of &lsquo;%R&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell The file in which the
shell resides. This is used in forking shells to interpret
files which have execute bits set, but which are not
executable by the system. (See the <br>
description of Builtin and non-builtin command execution.)
Initialized to the (system-dependent) home of the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shlvl (+) <br>
The number of nested shells. Reset to 1 in login shells. See
also loginsh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status The exit status from the
last command or backquote expansion, or any command in a
pipeline is propagated to status. (This is also the default
csh behavior.) This <br>
default does not match what POSIX mandates (to return the
status of the last command only). To match the POSIX
behavior, you need to unset anyerror.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the anyerror variable is
unset, the exit status of a pipeline is determined only from
the last command in the pipeline, and the exit status of a
backquote expansion is <br>
not propagated to status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a command terminated
abnormally, then 0200 is added to the status. Builtin
commands which fail return exit status &lsquo;1&rsquo;, all
other builtin commands return status &lsquo;0&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">symlinks (+) <br>
Can be set to several different values to control symbolic
link (&lsquo;symlink&rsquo;) resolution:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If set to &lsquo;chase&rsquo;,
whenever the current directory changes to a directory
containing a symbolic link, it is expanded to the real name
of the directory to which the link <br>
points. This does not work for the user&rsquo;s home
directory; this is a bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If set to &lsquo;ignore&rsquo;,
the shell tries to construct a current directory relative to
the current directory before the link was crossed. This
means that cding through a sym&acirc; <br>
bolic link and then &lsquo;cd ..&rsquo;ing returns one to
the original directory. This affects only builtin commands
and filename completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If set to &lsquo;expand&rsquo;,
the shell tries to fix symbolic links by actually expanding
arguments which look like path names. This affects any
command, not just builtins. <br>
Unfortunately, this does not work for hard-to-recognize
filenames, such as those embedded in command options.
Expansion may be prevented by quoting. While this setting
<br>
is usually the most convenient, it is sometimes misleading
and sometimes confusing when it fails to recognize an
argument which should be expanded. A compromise is to <br>
use &lsquo;ignore&rsquo; and use the editor command
normalize-path (bound by default to ^X-n) when
necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some examples are in order.
First, let&rsquo;s set up some play directories:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; cd /tmp <br>
&gt; mkdir from from/src to <br>
&gt; ln -s from/src to/dst</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s the behavior with
symlinks unset,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd
<br>
/tmp/to/dst <br>
&gt; cd ..; echo $cwd <br>
/tmp/from</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">here&rsquo;s the behavior with
symlinks set to &lsquo;chase&rsquo;,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd
<br>
/tmp/from/src <br>
&gt; cd ..; echo $cwd <br>
/tmp/from</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">here&rsquo;s the behavior with
symlinks set to &lsquo;ignore&rsquo;,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd
<br>
/tmp/to/dst <br>
&gt; cd ..; echo $cwd <br>
/tmp/to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and here&rsquo;s the behavior
with symlinks set to &lsquo;expand&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd
<br>
/tmp/to/dst <br>
&gt; cd ..; echo $cwd <br>
/tmp/to <br>
&gt; cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd <br>
/tmp/to/dst <br>
&gt; cd &quot;..&quot;; echo $cwd <br>
/tmp/from <br>
&gt; /bin/echo .. <br>
/tmp/to <br>
&gt; /bin/echo &quot;..&quot; <br>
..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that &lsquo;expand&rsquo;
expansion 1) works just like &lsquo;ignore&rsquo; for
builtins like cd, 2) is prevented by quoting, and 3) happens
before filenames are passed to non-builtin com&acirc; <br>
mands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcsh (+) <br>
The version number of the shell in the format
&lsquo;R.VV.PP&rsquo;, where &lsquo;R&rsquo; is the major
release number, &lsquo;VV&rsquo; the current version and
&lsquo;PP&rsquo; the patchlevel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">term The terminal type. Usually
set in ~/.login as described under Startup and shutdown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time If set to a number, then
the time builtin (q.v.) executes automatically after each
command which takes more than that many CPU seconds. If
there is a second word, it is <br>
used as a format string for the output of the time builtin.
(u) The following sequences may be used in the format
string:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%U The time the process spent in
user mode in cpu seconds. <br>
%S The time the process spent in kernel mode in cpu seconds.
<br>
%E The elapsed (wall clock) time in seconds. <br>
%P The CPU percentage computed as (%U + %S) / %E. <br>
%W Number of times the process was swapped. <br>
%X The average amount in (shared) text space used in Kbytes.
<br>
%D The average amount in (unshared) data/stack space used in
Kbytes. <br>
%K The total space used (%X + %D) in Kbytes. <br>
%M The maximum memory the process had in use at any time in
Kbytes. <br>
%F The number of major page faults (page needed to be
brought from disk). <br>
%R The number of minor page faults. <br>
%I The number of input operations. <br>
%O The number of output operations. <br>
%r The number of socket messages received. <br>
%s The number of socket messages sent. <br>
%k The number of signals received. <br>
%w The number of voluntary context switches (waits). <br>
%c The number of involuntary context switches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the first four sequences
are supported on systems without BSD resource limit
functions. The default time format is &lsquo;%Uu %Ss %E %P
%X+%Dk %I+%Oio %Fpf+%Ww&rsquo; for sys&acirc; <br>
tems that support resource usage reporting and &lsquo;%Uu
%Ss %E %P&rsquo; for systems that do not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under Sequent&rsquo;s DYNIX/ptx,
%X, %D, %K, %r and %s are not available, but the following
additional sequences are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%Y The number of system calls
performed. <br>
%Z The number of pages which are zero-filled on demand. <br>
%i The number of times a process&rsquo;s resident set size
was increased by the kernel. <br>
%d The number of times a process&rsquo;s resident set size
was decreased by the kernel. <br>
%l The number of read system calls performed. <br>
%m The number of write system calls performed. <br>
%p The number of reads from raw disk devices. <br>
%q The number of writes to raw disk devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and the default time format is
&lsquo;%Uu %Ss %E %P %I+%Oio %Fpf+%Ww&rsquo;. Note that the
CPU percentage can be higher than 100% on
multi-processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tperiod (+) <br>
The period, in minutes, between executions of the periodic
special alias.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tty (+) The name of the tty, or
empty if not attached to one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uid (+) The user&rsquo;s real
user ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user The user&rsquo;s login
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbose If set, causes the words
of each command to be printed, after history substitution
(if any). Set by the -v command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version (+) <br>
The version ID stamp. It contains the shell&rsquo;s version
number (see tcsh), origin, release date, vendor, operating
system and machine (see VENDOR, OSTYPE and MACHTYPE) and
<br>
a comma-separated list of options which were set at compile
time. Options which are set by default in the distribution
are noted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8b The shell is eight bit clean;
default <br>
7b The shell is not eight bit clean <br>
wide The shell is multibyte encoding clean (like UTF-8) <br>
nls The system&rsquo;s NLS is used; default for systems with
NLS <br>
lf Login shells execute /etc/csh.login before instead of
after /etc/csh.cshrc and ~/.login before instead of after
~/.tcshrc and ~/.history. <br>
dl &lsquo;.&rsquo; is put last in path for security; default
<br>
nd &lsquo;.&rsquo; is omitted from path for security <br>
vi vi-style editing is the default rather than emacs <br>
dtr Login shells drop DTR when exiting <br>
bye bye is a synonym for logout and log is an alternate name
for watchlog <br>
al autologout is enabled; default <br>
kan Kanji is used if appropriate according to locale
settings, unless the nokanji shell variable is set <br>
sm The system&rsquo;s malloc(3) is used <br>
hb The &lsquo;#!&lt;program&gt; &lt;args&gt;&rsquo;
convention is emulated when executing shell scripts <br>
ng The newgrp builtin is available <br>
rh The shell attempts to set the REMOTEHOST environment
variable <br>
afs The shell verifies your password with the kerberos
server if local authentication fails. The afsuser shell
variable or the AFSUSER environment variable override <br>
your local username if set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An administrator may enter
additional strings to indicate differences in the local
version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">visiblebell (+) <br>
If set, a screen flash is used rather than the audible bell.
See also nobeep.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watch (+) <br>
A list of user/terminal pairs to watch for logins and
logouts. If either the user is &lsquo;any&rsquo; all
terminals are watched for the given user and vice versa.
Setting watch to <br>
&lsquo;(any any)&rsquo; watches all users and terminals. For
example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set watch = (george ttyd1 any
console $user any)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reports activity of the user
&lsquo;george&rsquo; on ttyd1, any user on the console, and
oneself (or a trespasser) on any terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logins and logouts are checked
every 10 minutes by default, but the first word of watch can
be set to a number to check every so many minutes. For
example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set watch = (1 any any)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reports any login/logout once
every minute. For the impatient, the log builtin command
triggers a watch report at any time. All current logins are
reported (as with the <br>
log builtin) when watch is first set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The who shell variable controls
the format of watch reports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">who (+) The format string for
watch messages. The following sequences are replaced by the
given information:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%n The name of the user who
logged in/out. <br>
%a The observed action, i.e., &lsquo;logged on&rsquo;,
&lsquo;logged off&rsquo; or &lsquo;replaced olduser
on&rsquo;. <br>
%l The terminal (tty) on which the user logged in/out. <br>
%M The full hostname of the remote host, or
&lsquo;local&rsquo; if the login/logout was from the local
host. <br>
%m The hostname of the remote host up to the first
&lsquo;.&rsquo;. The full name is printed if it is an IP
address or an X Window System display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%M and %m are available on only
systems that store the remote hostname in /etc/utmp. If
unset, &lsquo;%n has %a %l from %m.&rsquo; is used, or
&lsquo;%n has %a %l.&rsquo; on systems which don&rsquo;t
<br>
store the remote hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wordchars (+) <br>
A list of non-alphanumeric characters to be considered part
of a word by the forward-word, backward-word etc., editor
commands. If unset, &lsquo;*?_-.[]~=&rsquo; is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
AFSUSER (+) <br>
Equivalent to the afsuser shell variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLUMNS The number of columns in
the terminal. See Terminal management.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAY Used by X Window System
(see X(1)). If set, the shell does not set autologout
(q.v.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EDITOR The pathname to a default
editor. See also the VISUAL environment variable and the
run-fg-editor editor command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GROUP (+) <br>
Equivalent to the group shell variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME Equivalent to the home
shell variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOST (+) <br>
Initialized to the name of the machine on which the shell is
running, as determined by the gethostname(2) system
call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTTYPE (+) <br>
Initialized to the type of machine on which the shell is
running, as determined at compile time. This variable is
obsolete and will be removed in a future version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HPATH (+) <br>
A colon-separated list of directories in which the run-help
editor command looks for command documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Gives the preferred
character environment. See Native Language System
support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
If set, only ctype character handling is changed. See Native
Language System support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LINES The number of lines in the
terminal. See Terminal management.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LS_COLORS <br>
The format of this variable is reminiscent of the termcap(5)
file format; a colon-separated list of expressions of the
form &quot;xx=string&quot;, where &quot;xx&quot; is a
two-character <br>
variable name. The variables with their associated defaults
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no 0 Normal (non-filename) text
<br>
fi 0 Regular file <br>
di 01;34 Directory <br>
ln 01;36 Symbolic link <br>
pi 33 Named pipe (FIFO) <br>
so 01;35 Socket <br>
do 01;35 Door <br>
bd 01;33 Block device <br>
cd 01;32 Character device <br>
ex 01;32 Executable file <br>
mi (none) Missing file (defaults to fi) <br>
or (none) Orphaned symbolic link (defaults to ln) <br>
lc ^[[ Left code <br>
rc m Right code <br>
ec (none) End code (replaces lc+no+rc)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You need to include only the
variables you want to change from the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File names can also be colorized
based on filename extension. This is specified in the
LS_COLORS variable using the syntax &quot;*ext=string&quot;.
For example, using ISO 6429 <br>
codes, to color all C-language source files blue you would
specify &quot;*.c=34&quot;. This would color all files
ending in .c in blue (34) color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control characters can be
written either in C-style-escaped notation, or in stty-like
^-notation. The C-style notation adds ^[ for Escape, _ for a
normal space charac&acirc; <br>
ter, and ? for Delete. In addition, the ^[ escape character
can be used to override the default interpretation of ^[, ^,
: and =.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each file will be written as
&lt;lc&gt; &lt;color-code&gt; &lt;rc&gt; &lt;filename&gt;
&lt;ec&gt;. If the &lt;ec&gt; code is undefined, the
sequence &lt;lc&gt; &lt;no&gt; &lt;rc&gt; will be used
instead. This is generally <br>
more convenient to use, but less general. The left, right
and end codes are provided so you don&rsquo;t have to type
common parts over and over again and to support weird
ter&acirc; <br>
minals; you will generally not need to change them at all
unless your terminal does not use ISO 6429 color sequences
but a different system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your terminal does use ISO
6429 color codes, you can compose the type codes (i.e., all
except the lc, rc, and ec codes) from numerical commands
separated by semi&acirc; <br>
colons. The most common commands are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 to restore default color <br>
1 for brighter colors <br>
4 for underlined text <br>
5 for flashing text <br>
30 for black foreground <br>
31 for red foreground <br>
32 for green foreground <br>
33 for yellow (or brown) foreground <br>
34 for blue foreground <br>
35 for purple foreground <br>
36 for cyan foreground <br>
37 for white (or gray) foreground <br>
40 for black background <br>
41 for red background <br>
42 for green background <br>
43 for yellow (or brown) background <br>
44 for blue background <br>
45 for purple background <br>
46 for cyan background <br>
47 for white (or gray) background</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not all commands will work on
all systems or display devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A few terminal programs do not
recognize the default end code properly. If all text gets
colorized after you do a directory listing, try changing the
no and fi codes <br>
from 0 to the numerical codes for your standard fore- and
background colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MACHTYPE (+) <br>
The machine type (microprocessor class or machine model), as
determined at compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOREBIND (+) <br>
If set, printable characters are not rebound to
self-insert-command. See Native Language System support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OSTYPE (+) <br>
The operating system, as determined at compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH A colon-separated list of
directories in which to look for executables. Equivalent to
the path shell variable, but in a different format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PWD (+) Equivalent to the cwd
shell variable, but not synchronized to it; updated only
after an actual directory change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMOTEHOST (+) <br>
The host from which the user has logged in remotely, if this
is the case and the shell is able to determine it. Set only
if the shell was so compiled; see the version <br>
shell variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHLVL (+) <br>
Equivalent to the shlvl shell variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSTYPE (+) <br>
The current system type. (Domain/OS only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERM Equivalent to the term
shell variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERMCAP The terminal capability
string. See Terminal management.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER Equivalent to the user
shell variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VENDOR (+) <br>
The vendor, as determined at compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VISUAL The pathname to a default
full-screen editor. See also the EDITOR environment variable
and the run-fg-editor editor command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/csh.cshrc Read first by every shell. ConvexOS, Stellix
and Intel use /etc/cshrc and NeXTs use /etc/cshrc.std. A/UX,
AMIX, Cray and IRIX have no equivalent in csh(1), but <br>
read this file in tcsh anyway. Solaris 2.x does not have it
either, but tcsh reads /etc/.cshrc. (+) <br>
/etc/csh.login Read by login shells after /etc/csh.cshrc.
ConvexOS, Stellix and Intel use /etc/login, NeXTs use
/etc/login.std, Solaris 2.x uses /etc/.login and A/UX, AMIX,
<br>
Cray and IRIX use /etc/cshrc. <br>
~/.tcshrc (+) Read by every shell after /etc/csh.cshrc or
its equivalent. <br>
~/.cshrc Read by every shell, if ~/.tcshrc doesn&rsquo;t
exist, after /etc/csh.cshrc or its equivalent. This manual
uses &lsquo;~/.tcshrc&rsquo; to mean &lsquo;~/.tcshrc or, if
~/.tcshrc is not <br>
found, ~/.cshrc&rsquo;. <br>
~/.history Read by login shells after ~/.tcshrc if savehist
is set, but see also histfile. <br>
~/.login Read by login shells after ~/.tcshrc or ~/.history.
The shell may be compiled to read ~/.login before instead of
after ~/.tcshrc and ~/.history; see the version <br>
shell variable. <br>
~/.cshdirs (+) Read by login shells after ~/.login if
savedirs is set, but see also dirsfile. <br>
/etc/csh.logout Read by login shells at logout. ConvexOS,
Stellix and Intel use /etc/logout and NeXTs use
/etc/logout.std. A/UX, AMIX, Cray and IRIX have no
equivalent in <br>
csh(1), but read this file in tcsh anyway. Solaris 2.x does
not have it either, but tcsh reads /etc/.logout. (+) <br>
~/.logout Read by login shells at logout after
/etc/csh.logout or its equivalent. <br>
/bin/sh Used to interpret shell scripts not starting with a
&lsquo;#&rsquo;. <br>
/tmp/sh* Temporary file for &lsquo;&lt;&lt;&rsquo;. <br>
/etc/passwd Source of home directories for
&lsquo;~name&rsquo; substitutions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The order in which startup files
are read may differ if the shell was so compiled; see
Startup and shutdown and the version shell variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NEW FEATURES (+) <br>
This manual describes tcsh as a single entity, but
experienced csh(1) users will want to pay special attention
to tcsh&rsquo;s new features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A command-line editor, which
supports GNU Emacs or vi(1)-style key bindings. See The
command-line editor and Editor commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Programmable, interactive word
completion and listing. See Completion and listing and the
complete and uncomplete builtin commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spelling correction (q.v.) of
filenames, commands and variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Editor commands (q.v.) which
perform other useful functions in the middle of typed
commands, including documentation lookup (run-help), quick
editor restarting (run-fg-editor) <br>
and command resolution (which-command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An enhanced history mechanism.
Events in the history list are time-stamped. See also the
history command and its associated shell variables, the
previously undocumented &lsquo;#&rsquo; <br>
event specifier and new modifiers under History
substitution, the *-history, history-search-*, i-search-*,
vi-search-* and toggle-literal-history editor commands and
the histlit <br>
shell variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enhanced directory parsing and
directory stack handling. See the cd, pushd, popd and dirs
commands and their associated shell variables, the
description of Directory stack sub&acirc; <br>
stitution, the dirstack, owd and symlinks shell variables
and the normalize-command and normalize-path editor
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Negation in glob-patterns. See
Filename substitution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New File inquiry operators
(q.v.) and a filetest builtin which uses them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A variety of Automatic, periodic
and timed events (q.v.) including scheduled events, special
aliases, automatic logout and terminal locking, command
timing and watching for <br>
logins and logouts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for the Native Language
System (see Native Language System support), OS variant
features (see OS variant support and the echo_style shell
variable) and system-dependent <br>
file locations (see FILES).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extensive terminal-management
capabilities. See Terminal management.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New builtin commands including
builtins, hup, ls-F, newgrp, printenv, which and where
(q.v.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New variables that make useful
information easily available to the shell. See the gid,
loginsh, oid, shlvl, tcsh, tty, uid and version shell
variables and the HOST, REMOTEHOST, <br>
VENDOR, OSTYPE and MACHTYPE environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A new syntax for including
useful information in the prompt string (see prompt), and
special prompts for loops and spelling correction (see
prompt2 and prompt3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Read-only variables. See
Variable substitution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
When a suspended command is restarted, the shell prints the
directory it started in if this is different from the
current directory. This can be misleading (i.e., wrong) as
the <br>
job may have changed directories internally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shell builtin functions are not
stoppable/restartable. Command sequences of the form
&lsquo;a ; b ; c&rsquo; are also not handled gracefully when
stopping is attempted. If you suspend &lsquo;b&rsquo;, <br>
the shell will then immediately execute &lsquo;c&rsquo;.
This is especially noticeable if this expansion results from
an alias. It suffices to place the sequence of commands in
()&rsquo;s to <br>
force it to a subshell, i.e., &lsquo;( a ; b ; c
)&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control over tty output after
processes are started is primitive; perhaps this will
inspire someone to work on a good virtual terminal
interface. In a virtual terminal interface <br>
much more interesting things could be done with output
control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alias substitution is most often
used to clumsily simulate shell procedures; shell procedures
should be provided rather than aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control structures should be
parsed rather than being recognized as built-in commands.
This would allow control commands to be placed anywhere, to
be combined with &lsquo;|&rsquo;, and to <br>
be used with &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; and &lsquo;;&rsquo;
metasyntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foreach doesn&rsquo;t ignore
here documents when looking for its end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It should be possible to use the
&lsquo;:&rsquo; modifiers on the output of command
substitutions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The screen update for lines
longer than the screen width is very poor if the terminal
cannot move the cursor up (i.e., terminal type
&lsquo;dumb&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HPATH and NOREBIND don&rsquo;t
need to be environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Glob-patterns which do not use
&lsquo;?&rsquo;, &lsquo;*&rsquo; or &lsquo;[]&rsquo; or
which use &lsquo;{}&rsquo; or &lsquo;~&rsquo; are not
negated correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The single-command form of if
does output redirection even if the expression is false and
the command is not executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ls-F includes file
identification characters when sorting filenames and does
not handle control characters in filenames well. It cannot
be interrupted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command substitution supports
multiple commands and conditions, but not cycles or backward
gotos.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Report bugs at
http://bugs.gw.com/, preferably with fixes. If you want to
help maintain and test tcsh, send mail to
tcsh-request@mx.gw.com with the text &lsquo;subscribe
tcsh&rsquo; on a <br>
line by itself in the body.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE T IN TCSH <br>
In 1964, DEC produced the PDP-6. The PDP-10 was a later
re-implementation. It was re-christened the DECsystem-10 in
1970 or so when DEC brought out the second model, the
KI10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TENEX was created at Bolt,
Beranek &amp; Newman (a Cambridge, Massachusetts think tank)
in 1972 as an experiment in demand-paged virtual memory
operating systems. They built a new <br>
pager for the DEC PDP-10 and created the OS to go with it.
It was extremely successful in academia.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In 1975, DEC brought out a new
model of the PDP-10, the KL10; they intended to have only a
version of TENEX, which they had licensed from BBN, for the
new box. They called their <br>
version TOPS-20 (their capitalization is trademarked). A lot
of TOPS-10 users (&lsquo;The OPerating System for
PDP-10&rsquo;) objected; thus DEC found themselves
supporting two incompatible <br>
systems on the same hardware--but then there were 6 on the
PDP-11!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TENEX, and TOPS-20 to version 3,
had command completion via a user-code-level subroutine
library called ULTCMD. With version 3, DEC moved all that
capability and more into the <br>
monitor (&lsquo;kernel&rsquo; for you Unix types), accessed
by the COMND% JSYS (&lsquo;Jump to SYStem&rsquo;
instruction, the supervisor call mechanism [are my IBM roots
also showing?]).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The creator of tcsh was
impressed by this feature and several others of TENEX and
TOPS-20, and created a version of csh which mimicked
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
The system limits argument lists to ARG_MAX characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of arguments to a
command which involves filename expansion is limited to
1/6th the number of characters allowed in an argument
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command substitutions may
substitute no more characters than are allowed in an
argument list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To detect looping, the shell
restricts the number of alias substitutions on a single line
to 20.</p>
