<p>SEEDD(1) General Commands Manual SEEDD(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
seedd - read entropy from BitBabbler hardware RNG
devices</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
seedd [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The seedd program can be run as a foreground process or as a
daemon to collect entropy from one or more BitBabbler
devices, either streaming it to stdout for general purpose
use, <br>
making it available on a UDP socket, or directly seeding the
kernel entropy pool with it on demand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
The number of configurable options for seedd has now
outgrown what most people will care about or want to use,
which would normally be less than ideal for something like
this, <br>
but it does have a rather diverse range of user needs, and
it is important that we support those well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless you fall into the special
use category, then the following examples are probably about
all (or still more than) you might ever need:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show all available BitBabbler
devices, in detail:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">seedd -sv (or --scan
--verbose)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output 1 million bytes to a
file, drawn from all available devices:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">seedd -b 1000000 &gt;
random-bytes.out</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stream entropy continuously to
stdout (with no control socket):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">seedd -o -c none |
your-thing-reading-stdin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run as a daemon, feeding entropy
to the OS kernel pool:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">seedd -k -d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To read from only specific
devices, add the --device-id option too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --scan <br>
Scan the system for available BitBabbler devices, reporting
them in a human readable format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--shell-mr <br>
Scan the system for available BitBabbler devices, reporting
them in a machine readable format that is suitable for
importing into shell scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --device-id=id <br>
Select a BitBabbler device to read from by its unique ID. If
no devices are explicitly specified then the default is to
use all of them (including any devices that may be <br>
plugged in at a later time).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option may be passed
multiple times to attach to multiple devices. It is not an
error to specify a device that is not currently present on
the system. If hotplug <br>
support was enabled at compile time and available on the
system at runtime, then such devices will be added to the
pool at runtime if they are later plugged in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The id may be the device serial
number, or its logical address in the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[busnum:]devnum</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or on systems where knowing the
USB topology is supported, its physical address in the
form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">busnum-port[.port ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a logical address the busnum
part is optional, but if devnum is not unique across all
buses, then exactly which device will be selected if it is
not fully specified <br>
becomes a matter of chance. All of the available IDs which
can be used to refer to a device will be reported by the
--scan option. Bus, device, and port numbers are <br>
expected to be decimal integers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The logical address isn&rsquo;t
usually very useful to use when hotplug activity is
expected, since it is allocated dynamically and is
&rsquo;unpredictable&rsquo; for most purposes here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --daemon <br>
Fork to the background and run as a daemon process. If this
option is not specified then seedd will remain in the
foreground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --bytes=n <br>
Send n bytes of entropy to stdout. The process will exit
when that is completed. This option will be ignored if
either the --kernel or --udp-out options are used. A <br>
suffix of &rsquo;k&rsquo;, &rsquo;M&rsquo;, or
&rsquo;G&rsquo; will multiply n by the respective power of
two. If this option is not used, then entropy will be output
until the process is explicitly termi&acirc; <br>
nated (or receives SIGPIPE). Passing this option implies
--stdout, and also --control-socket=none unless the control
socket option is explicitly passed to enable it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --kernel <br>
Feed entropy directly to the kernel /dev/random pool on
demand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --udp-out=host:port <br>
Bind a UDP socket to the given address, which clients can
use to request blocks of entropy directly from the internal
pool. The host part can be a DNS hostname or address <br>
literal. If an IPv6 address literal is used it should be
enclosed in square brackets (e.g. [::1]:2020 to bind to port
2020 on the local IPv6 interface). The port can be <br>
a port number or a service name (as defined in /etc/services
or other system name-service databases which are queried by
getaddrinfo(3)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To obtain entropy from this
port, write the desired number of bytes to it as a two-octet
network-order short integer. It will reply with a datagram
containing the <br>
requested number of bytes of entropy. Requests for 1 to
32768 bytes will be honored as soon as there is sufficient
entropy in the internal pool to do so. Requests out&acirc;
<br>
side of that range are invalid and will simply be ignored.
Note that no access control is placed on the socket, so if
it uses a publicly accessible address anyone will be <br>
able to read entropy from it (and potentially to use it as a
traffic amplifier if requests use a forged source
address).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This facility is mainly provided
for use on operating systems like Windows, where the native
interfaces may be of questionable usefulness or quality and
cannot be audited <br>
- but it is generic and so can be used on any system where
obtaining entropy directly from the BitBabbler devices might
be desirable. On Linux systems we do recommend <br>
using the system /dev/(u)random interfaces though, since
that will mix in other entropy and transparently benefit all
existing applications. They aren&rsquo;t mutually
exclu&acirc; <br>
sive though, you can use both this and the --kernel option
together too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --stdout <br>
Stream entropy directly to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --pool-size=n <br>
Specify the size of the internal entropy pool. Entropy read
from a BitBabbler will gather in that pool after health and
sanity checking. When multiple BitBabbler devices <br>
are in use, entropy from each group of devices will be mixed
into it. Entropy read from stdout, or the UDP socket, or
delivered to the kernel will be drawn from this <br>
pool. Fresh entropy will continue to be mixed into it while
it is not being drained faster than it can be filled. The
default pool size is 64kB, which provides a reason&acirc;
<br>
able balance between what a single BitBabbler running at
1Mbps can fill completely about twice per second, and what
most reasonable consumers might ever want to draw from <br>
it &rsquo;instantly&rsquo;. There probably aren&rsquo;t many
good reasons to make it much larger, but making it smaller
will increase the number of input bits mixed into each
output bit if <br>
the pool is not being drained completely faster than it can
fill. We do not rely on this mixing to obtain good quality
entropy from each BitBabbler device but it doesn&rsquo;t
<br>
hurt to be mixing more good entropy into it while the demand
is exceeded by supply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G,
--group-size=group_number:size <br>
Set the size of a single pool group. When multiple
BitBabbler devices are available, there is a choice of
whether to optimise for throughput or for redundancy. For
exam&acirc; <br>
ple a pair of devices both running at 1Mbps can together
produce an effective throughput of 2Mbps of entropy if their
streams are output independently of each other, but <br>
they can also be mixed together in parallel to provide a
stronger guarantee of entropy at 1Mbps with the stream being
at least as unpredictable as the most unpredictable <br>
device. With more than two devices a combination of both
strategies may be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Devices that are placed in the
same group will not add entropy to the pool until every
device in that group has contributed at least size bytes to
it. If the devices are <br>
not running at the same bit rate, the faster device(s) will
continue to mix entropy into the group until every device
has contributed. This option enables configuration <br>
of that block size. The group_number is an arbitrary integer
identifier (which will be passed to the --group option for
the device(s) to add to it). The size may be fol&acirc; <br>
lowed by a suffix of &rsquo;k&rsquo;, &rsquo;M&rsquo;, or
&rsquo;G&rsquo; to multiply it by the respective power of
two. The group size will be rounded up to the nearest power
of two. Default is for groups <br>
to be the same size as the pool, but they may be set either
smaller or larger than it if desired. The two values are
separated by a colon with no other space between <br>
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --control-socket=path <br>
Set the filesystem path for the query and control socket
that may be used to obtain information and statistics about
the performance of the BitBabbler devices and control <br>
some aspects of the running process. The special value of
&rsquo;none&rsquo; may be passed to disable the creation of
a control socket. Mostly this option is useful if you have
more <br>
than one seedd process running which are each controlling
different sets of devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems where unix domain
sockets are not available, or if you wish to make the
control socket visible to other machines on the network, you
can instead use a string of <br>
the form tcp:host:port, where the host and port parts are as
described in the --udp-out option above. Note that there is
no access control when a TCP socket is used, so <br>
any user on any machine that is able to connect to this port
will be able to do anything the control socket allows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--socket-group=group <br>
Permit access to the control socket by members of the named
group. If this option is not specified, then only the owner
of the seedd process will be able to connect to <br>
that socket. The adm group may be a reasonable choice to set
this to on many systems (it is the default used by the
Debian package init scripts), but you are free to use <br>
any group for this which best suits local access
policies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option has no effect if a
TCP port is used for the control socket instead of a unix
domain socket path.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--watch=path:delay:block_size:bytes
<br>
Monitor an external device. This option does not directly
effect the operation of collecting entropy from BitBabbler
devices, or contribute in any way to the entropy that <br>
is output, either to stderr or the kernel. What it does do
is leverage the quality assurance and health checking
algorithms, and the trend monitoring functionality that <br>
this software provides, to also permit continuous
supervision of other sources which are expected to be
statistically random.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example it can be used to
regularly sample from /dev/urandom or even from /dev/random
to ensure the quality of their output is really what you
expect it to be. <br>
There&rsquo;s little point to putting the most awesome
entropy that the universe can conjure in, if what&rsquo;s
coming out and feeding the applications that are consuming
it is <br>
totally predictable garbage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this is used to monitor a
limited source of blocking entropy, such as /dev/random then
you&rsquo;ll want to be judicious in selecting the rate of
reading from it, so as not <br>
to consume all the available entropy that you were aiming to
gain by feeding it from a BitBabbler in the first. If
it&rsquo;s reading from an &rsquo;unlimited&rsquo; source
backed by a <br>
PRNG, such as /dev/urandom, then the only real consideration
is how much of the other system resources do you want to
consume in drinking from the firehose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The path is the filesystem path
to read from, it can be anything which can be opened and
read from like a normal unix file. The delay is the amount
of time, in millisec&acirc; <br>
onds, to wait between reading blocks of data from it. The
block_size is the number of bytes to read in a single block
each time the watch process wakes up to read more. <br>
The total amount of data to read can by limited to bytes,
once that limit is reached, the watch process for path will
end (but all other processing will continue as per <br>
normal).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All qualifiers except the path
are optional, and separated by colons with no other space
between them, but all options must be explicitly set up to
the last one that is <br>
provided. The delay may be followed by a suffix of
&rsquo;k&rsquo;, &rsquo;M&rsquo;, or &rsquo;G&rsquo; to
multiply it by the respective power of 10, or by
&rsquo;ki&rsquo;, &rsquo;Mi&rsquo;, or &rsquo;Gi&rsquo; for
powers of two if you&rsquo;re <br>
into that kind of thing. The block_size and bytes options
may be similarly suffixed, but like all good sizes on
computers are always a power of two if so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--kernel-refill=sec <br>
Set the maximum time in seconds before fresh entropy will be
added to the OS kernel pool, even when it has not been
drained below its usual refill threshold. This option <br>
has no effect unless the --kernel option is being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When feeding the OS pool, seedd
will be woken to immediately add more entropy to it any time
that it falls below the configured minimum watermark (which
on Linux is set by <br>
/proc/sys/kernel/random/write_wakeup_threshold and can be
configured persistently in
/etc/sysctl.d/bit-babbler-sysctl.conf).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to that, it will
also wake up periodically to mix fresh entropy into the OS
pool even if it is not being consumed (testing that the
output of the device is <br>
still passing all the QA testing in the process). This
option configures how long it will wait since the last time
fresh entropy was added before doing that. If set to <br>
0, then we will never add more entropy unless explicitly
woken by the OS pool falling below its watermark. The
default is 60 seconds, and there probably aren&rsquo;t many
rea&acirc; <br>
sons to reduce that, but you may want to increase or disable
it on low power systems which you don&rsquo;t want to be
waking up just to do this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main downside to increasing
it is that on relatively quiet systems it may take
(significantly) longer for the long term QA tests (in
particular the 16 bit tests) to <br>
accumulate enough results for analysis, and you lose some of
the confidence that comes with a higher rate of continual
sampling from the device. This option lets you <br>
choose the right balance for your own use. If unsure,
leaving it at its default setting is probably the right
answer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Make more noise about what is going on internally. If used
(once) with the --scan option this will show more
information about each device, but otherwise it&rsquo;s
mostly only <br>
information useful for debugging. It may be passed multiple
times to get swamped with even more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Show a shorter version of all of this, which may fit on a
single page, FSVO of page size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Report the seedd release version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Per device options <br>
The following options may be used multiple times to
individually configure each device when more than one
BitBabbler is available. If passed before any --device-id
option, then <br>
they set new default values which will apply to every
device. If passed after one of those options they will only
be applied to the immediately preceding device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --bitrate=Hz <br>
Select the device bitrate in bits per second. The available
bitrates are determined by an integer clock divider, so not
every rate is exactly achievable. An unsupported <br>
rate will be rounded up to the next higher rate. For
convenience the rate may be followed by an SI multiplier
(eg. 2.5M for 2500000).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--latency=ms <br>
Override the calculated value for the USB latency timer.
This controls the maximum amount of time that the device
will wait if there is any data in its internal buffer <br>
(but less than a full packet), before sending it to the
host. If this timer expires before a packet can be filled,
then a short packet will be sent to the host. The <br>
default value is chosen to ensure that we do not send more
short packets than necessary for the selected bitrate, since
that will increase the number of packets sent and <br>
the amount of CPU time which must be spent processing them,
to transfer the same amount of data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless you are experimenting
with changes to the low level code, there is probably no
reason to ever use this option to override the latency
manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --fold=n <br>
Set the number of times to fold the BitBabbler output before
adding it to the pool. Each fold will take the first half of
the block that was read and XOR it with the bits <br>
in the second half. This will halve the throughput, but
concentrate the available entropy more densely into the bits
that remain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two main things this
is expected to do based on the BitBabbler design. It will
better mix the low-frequency noise that is captured with
that of the higher fre&acirc; <br>
quencies, allowing it to sample at higher bitrates without
narrowing the noise bandwidth available to influence
adjacent bits. It will help to break up any transient <br>
local correlations that might occur in the physical
processes from which ambient environmental noise is
collected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Folding should never reduce the
real entropy of each sample, but when all is working exactly
as it should, it may not do anything to increase it either.
Mathematically, <br>
an XOR summation is expected to exponentially smooth any
bias in a stream of independent bits, with the result having
at least as much entropy as the least predictable of <br>
either of the two inputs (in the same way that a one time
pad is no less secure despite the plaintext having much less
entropy than the pad does).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --group=n <br>
The entropy pooling group to add this device to. See the
--group-size option for a discussion of pool groups. You do
not need to declare or define a group in any way <br>
before using this option, devices that have the same group
number specified will be simply be grouped together. By
default, all devices are placed in group 0 if this is <br>
not set explicitly for them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The group 0 is special in that
its size can be set explicitly, but it does not wait for all
devices in it to have contributed entropy before mixing into
the common pool, <br>
which is functionally equivalent to all of those devices
being placed into separate groups that are the same
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally if a single device in a
group fails QA testing, then the entire group will stop
contributing to the pool until it is removed or further
extended testing confirms <br>
that failure to be an anomaly and not a persistent
condition. For group 0 (and devices in other separate
groups), a failed device will not prevent the remaining
devices <br>
from continuing to contribute entropy if their own output is
still passing the QA testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable=mask <br>
Select a subset of the generators on BitBabbler devices with
multiple entropy sources. The argument is a bitmask packed
from the LSB, with each bit position controlling <br>
an individual source, enabling it when set to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--idle-sleep=initial:max <br>
This option permits tuning how the devices back off from
generating entropy at the maximum rate, when it is not being
consumed from the output pool. When the output pool <br>
is not full, entropy will be read from the devices as
quickly as possible to try to refill it. Once it is full,
they will begin to be throttled according to the following
<br>
algorithm:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The initial value is the number
of milliseconds to sleep when the output pool first becomes
full again. If this value is 0, then the device will
immediately remain idle <br>
until the output pool is no longer full. Otherwise, reading
from the device will pause for either this number of
milliseconds, or until the pool is no longer full,
which&acirc; <br>
ever comes first. If that timeout expires and the pool is
still full, another block of entropy will be generated and
mixed into the pool, then the timeout will be dou&acirc;
<br>
bled. This process will continue until the timeout reaches
the max value (which is also in milliseconds), at which
point it will not increase any further. The device <br>
will always be woken immediately any time the output pool is
not full, and the timeout cycle will begin again from the
initial value each time that occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special case, if the max
value is set to 0, with an initial value that is not zero,
the exponential back off will occur as above until the
timeout reaches or exceeds <br>
512 ms, at which point further activity will again be
suspended indefinitely until the output pool is no longer
full. This allows for a mode of operation where the device
<br>
will still go into a hard suspend when no entropy is being
consumed from the output pool, but only after mixing several
blocks of entropy from each device that is config&acirc;
<br>
ured this way into it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default configuration used
if this is not set explicitly is initial=100 and max=60000.
Usually the only reason to change this is if you are trying
to minimise the <br>
power usage on a low power system which you don&rsquo;t want
continually waking up to generate entropy that nothing is
using. For that use, if you are feeding the OS kernel <br>
pool, you will probably also want to set the --kernel-refill
option to a suitable value, since it will cause the devices
to wake up independently of what is set here (by <br>
reading from the output pool, making it be no longer full).
Dialling the verbosity up to level 6 (with -vvvvvv) while
tweaking this will let you watch how the reads from <br>
the devices are actually throttled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When setting this, either of
initial or max may be omitted (in which case they will
retain their default value), but the &rsquo;:&rsquo; must
always be included. It probably doesn&rsquo;t <br>
make a lot of sense to set this differently for each device
(especially not for devices which are grouped together), but
that is permitted if you really have some reason <br>
to want to do that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--suspend-after=ms <br>
Set the minimum expected device idle time for which we
should allow the device to be suspended. On Linux, USB
devices that are idle can automatically be suspended into a
<br>
low power state, but in order to qualify as being
&rsquo;idle&rsquo; for that purpose, we need to release our
claim on the device. Full details of the OS part of that can
be found <br>
here:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/usb/power-management.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is 0, which means
seedd will never release a device it has claimed. The
benefit of this is that no other process can claim it while
it is released (acciden&acirc; <br>
tally or otherwise), which would prevent us from being able
to use it again when we do require entropy from it. It also
ensures there is minimal latency when we are woken <br>
up to read entropy from it again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting this to a value greater
than zero means that when the output pool is full, and we
are expecting to sleep for at least that amount of time
before reading from the <br>
device again, then the claim on the device will be released,
and the OS will be able to suspend it until we need it
again. If the pool is drained and requires more en&acirc;
<br>
tropy before that time, then we will still reclaim the
device immediately and begin reading from it again, but
there will be a small amount of additional latency while it
<br>
wakes up and is reinitialised for use. This option should
usually be set in conjunction with --idle-sleep and
--kernel-refill which control how often the device will be
<br>
woken again to refresh the entropy pools when it might
otherwise have remained idle. If they never allow it to
sleep for longer than this time, then this option will have
<br>
no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It probably doesn&rsquo;t make
much sense to set this below about 10000 (10 seconds)
otherwise the overhead of releasing, reclaiming, and
reinitialising the device might actual&acirc; <br>
ly use more power than suspending it saves. And it
definitely doesn&rsquo;t make much sense to set it to a
value less than what is configured for the
autosuspend_delay_ms op&acirc; <br>
tion in the kernel, since while we will release the device
any time that we expect to sleep for this long (regardless
of whether we actually do or not), the kernel will <br>
not actually suspend it until the autosuspend_delay_ms time
has elapsed after we have released it. So if it
doesn&rsquo;t get to actually suspend it, we would just be
chewing <br>
extra CPU cycles, and adding extra latency to obtaining
entropy when it is needed, for no net gain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--low-power <br>
This is a convenience option, which is equivalent to
setting:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--kernel-refill=3600
--idle-sleep=100:0 --suspend-after=10000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And which in turn means:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We will wake up to mix more
entropy into the kernel pool at least once an hour (though
it is likely that most systems will already drain it below
its threshold and so wake <br>
us to refill it before that time expires anyway).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We will mix at least 6 blocks of
fresh entropy into the seedd output pool each time we are
woken, before suspending indefinitely again (until either we
are woken by the <br>
kernel needing entropy or by the timeout above expiring, or
until something else consumes entropy from the output pool -
such as from the UDP socket if that is enabled). <br>
This is based on doubling the initial --idle-sleep timeout
each time the output pool remains full, until we exceed the
minimum amount of time that really will perform a <br>
sleep (512ms), and then sleeping until explicitly woken
again after that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We will release the device,
giving the OS the opportunity to suspend it, each time it
does become fully idle (since an indefinite sleep is
considered to be longer than any <br>
fixed amount of time).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any or all of those options may
still be customised by passing them explicitly after this
option on the command line (in the same way that passing
them twice would also <br>
override the first instance).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This isn&rsquo;t necessarily the
configuration offering the lowest possible power
consumption, but it&rsquo;s intended to strike a reasonable
balance for systems where keeping idle <br>
power consumption low is more a important concern than
continually mixing in additional fresh entropy or minimising
the latency if demand for entropy suddenly surges <br>
(which is what the normal defaults are more oriented
toward). At the very least it should be a reasonable
starting point to begin experimenting from on low power
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-qa <br>
Disable gating entropy output on the result of quality and
health checking. You pretty much never want to use this
unless you are generating streams to stdout for no
oth&acirc; <br>
er reason than to analyse their quality with some other
tool, such as dieharder(1) or the NIST test suite or
similar. For that type of use we definitely don&rsquo;t want
to be <br>
filtering out blocks which have already failed our own
internal quality analysis, otherwise the value of such
testing will be almost as tainted as that of the people who
<br>
say &quot;after whitening our RNG with SHA-1 it now passes
all of the statistical tests perfectly!&quot;, and
there&rsquo;s already more than enough fossils in that
tarpit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not possible to disable
this for data which is passed directly to the kernel entropy
pool, there is absolutely no reason to ever want to do that,
and this does not <br>
actually disable the QA checks from being performed (so the
results of them will still be seen in the monitoring output
and can generate external alerts if this mode was <br>
entered &rsquo;by accident&rsquo;). It just permits any
failing blocks to still pass through to stdout, so other
tools can heap all the scorn on the output that it deserves
if it is <br>
failing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTINUOUS MONITORING <br>
The query and control socket enables device performance and
QA statistics to be examined in real-time. The bbctl(1) tool
can be used to produce human readable reports on demand <br>
from the information it provides, but it can also be queried
directly by other tools that want that information in a more
machine readable form (see the json_protocol document <br>
for a full description of that). For users of munin, a
plugin is provided which will continuously graph the status
of each device, and which can be used to trigger an alert if
<br>
an abnormal condition occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The munin plugin requires the
perl JSON::XS module (provided by the libjson-xs-perl
package on Debian systems), and it must be explicitly
enabled on each system where it is de&acirc; <br>
sired to run. Typically that will require doing something
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># munin-node-configure --shell
<br>
# ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/bit_babbler
/etc/munin/plugins/bit_babbler <br>
# service munin-node restart</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If munin-node-configure does not
report that plugin autoconfiguration succeeded, the most
likely reason is that JSON::XS is not available. There are a
few options to configure <br>
the plugin&rsquo;s behaviour, these are all documented in
/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/bit-babbler (where they should be
set if desired). The munin-node service needs to be
restarted for <br>
changes to its plugins to take effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/default/seedd <br>
The optional configuration overrides for the init script,

time.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/run/bit-babbler/seedd.socket

The default udev(7) rules granting direct device access to
users in the group bit-babbler, enabling USB autosuspend
when the device is idle, and invoking bbvirt to handle <br>
device hotplug for virtual machines. These can be overridden
by creating /etc/udev/rules.d/60-bit-babbler.rules and
populating it with your own rules.</p>
