<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAILTOE(1) MAILTOE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mailtoe - a train-on-error simulator for use with dbacl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mailtoe command [ command_arguments ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mailtoe automates the task of testing email filtering and
classification programs such as dbacl(1). Given a set of
categorized documents, mailtoe initiates test runs to
estimate <br>
the classification errors and thereby permit fine tuning of
the parameters of the classifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Train-on-error (TOE) is a
learning method which is sometimes advocated for email
classifiers. Given an incoming email stream, the method
consists in reusing a fixed set of cate&acirc; <br>
gory databases until the first misclassification occurs. At
that point, the offending email is used to relearn the
relevant category, until the next misclassification. In this
<br>
way, categories are only updated when errors occur. This
directly models the way that some email classifiers are used
in practice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TOE&rsquo;s error rates depend
directly on the order in which emails are seen. A small
change in ordering, as might happen due to networking
delays, can have a large impact on the <br>
number of misclassifications. Consequently, mailtoe does not
give meaningful results, unless the sample emails are chosen
carefully. However, as this method is commonly used by <br>
spam filters, it is still worth computing to foster
comparisons. Other methods (see mailcross(1),mailfoot(1))
attempt to capture the behaviour of classification errors in
other <br>
ways.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To improve and stabilize the
error rate calculation, mailtoe performs the TOE simulations
several times on slightly reordered email streams, and
averages the results. The <br>
reorderings occur by multiplexing the emails from each
category mailbox in random order. Thus if there are three
categories, the first email classified is chosen randomly
from <br>
the front of the sample email streams of each type. The
second email is also chosen randomly among the three types,
from the front of the <br>
streams after the first email was removed. Simulation stops
when all sample streams are exhausted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mailtoe uses the environment
variable MAILTOE_FILTER when executing, which permits the
simulation of arbitrary filters, provided these satisfy the
compatibility conditions stated <br>
in the ENVIRONMENT section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For convenience, mailtoe
implements a testsuite framework with predefined wrappers
for several open source classifiers. This permits the direct
comparison of dbacl(1) with com&acirc; <br>
peting classifiers on the same set of email samples. See the
USAGE section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During preparation, mailtoe
builds a subdirectory named mailtoe.d in the current working
directory. All needed calculations are performed inside this
subdirectory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
mailtoe returns 0 on success, 1 if a problem occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
prepare size <br>
Prepares a subdirectory named mailtoe.d in the current
working directory, and populates it with empty
subdirectories for exactly size subsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add category [ FILE ]... <br>
Takes a set of emails from either FILE if specified, or
STDIN, and associates them with category. The ordering of
emails within FILE is preserved, and subsequent FILEs <br>
are appended to the first in each category. This command can
be repeated several times, but should be executed at least
once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clean Deletes the directory
mailtoe.d and all its contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">run Multiplexes randomly from
the email streams added earlier, and relearns categories
only when a misclassification occurs. The simulation is
repeated size times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">summarize <br>
Prints average error rates for the simulations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plot [ ps | logscale ]... <br>
Plots the number of errors over simulation time. The
&quot;ps&quot; option, if present, writes the plot to a
postscript file in the directory mailtoe/plots, instead of
being shown <br>
on-screen. The &quot;logscale&quot; option, if present,
causes the plot to be on the log scale for both
ordinates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">review truecat predcat <br>
Scans the last run statistics and extracts all the messages
which belong to category truecat but have been classified
into category predcat. The extracted messages are <br>
copied to the directory mailtoe.d/review for perusal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">testsuite list <br>
Shows a list of available filters/wrapper scripts which can
be selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">testsuite select [ FILTER ]...
<br>
Prepares the filter(s) named FILTER to be used for
simulation. The filter name is the name of a wrapper script
located in the directory /usr/share/dbacl/testsuite. Each
<br>
filter has a rigid interface documented below, and the act
of selecting it copies it to the mailtoe.d/filters
directory. Only filters located there are used in the
simula&acirc; <br>
tions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">testsuite deselect [ FILTER ]...
<br>
Removes the named filter(s) from the directory
mailtoe.d/filters so that they are not used in the
simulation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">testsuite run [ plots ] <br>
Invokes every selected filter on the datasets added
previously, and calculates misclassification rates. If the
&quot;plots&quot; option is present, each filter simulation
is plotted <br>
as a postscript file in the directory mailtoe.d/plots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">testsuite status <br>
Describes the scheduled simulations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">testsuite summarize <br>
Shows the cross validation results for all filters. Only
makes sense after the run command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
The normal usage pattern is the following: first, you should
separate your email collection into several categories
(manually or otherwise). Each category should be associated
<br>
with one or more folders, but each folder should not contain
more than one category. Next, you should decide how many
runs to use, say 10. The more runs you use, the better the
<br>
predicted error rates. However, more runs take more time.
Now you can type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% mailtoe prepare 10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next, for every category, you
must add every folder associated with this category. Suppose
you have three categories named spam, work, and play, which
are associated with the <br>
mbox files spam.mbox, work.mbox, and play.mbox respectively.
You would type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% mailtoe add spam spam.mbox
<br>
% mailtoe add work work.mbox <br>
% mailtoe add play play.mbox</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should aim for a similar
number of emails in each category, as the random
multiplexing will be unbalanced otherwise. The ordering of
the email messages in each *.mbox file is <br>
important, and is preserved during each simulation. If you
repeatedly add to the same category, the later mailboxes
will be appended to the first, preserving the implied
order&acirc; <br>
ing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can now perform as many TOE
simulations as desired. The multiplexed emails are
classified and learned one at a time, by executing the
command given in the environment vari&acirc; <br>
able MAILTOE_FILTER. If not set, a default value is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% mailtoe run <br>
% mailtoe summarize</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The testsuite commands are
designed to simplify the above steps and allow comparison of
a wide range of email classifiers, including but not limited
to dbacl. Classifiers are <br>
supported through wrapper scripts, which are located in the
/usr/share/dbacl/testsuite directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first stage when using the
testsuite is deciding which classifiers to compare. You can
view a list of available wrappers by typing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% mailtoe testsuite list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the wrapper scripts
are NOT the actual email classifiers, which must be
installed separately by your system administrator or
otherwise. Once this is done, you can <br>
select one or more wrappers for the simulation by typing,
for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% mailtoe testsuite select
dbaclA ifile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If some of the selected
classifiers cannot be found on the system, they are not
selected. Note also that some wrappers can have hard-coded
category names, e.g. if the classifier <br>
only supports binary classification. Heed the warning
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It remains only to run the
simulation. Beware, this can take a long time (several hours
depending on the classifier).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% mailtoe testsuite run <br>
% mailtoe testsuite summarize</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you are all done, you can
delete the working files, log files etc. by typing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% mailtoe clean</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCRIPT INTERFACE <br>
mailtoe testsuite takes care of learning and classifying
your prepared email corpora for each selected classifier.
Since classifiers have widely varying interfaces, this is
only <br>
possible by wrapping those interfaces individually into a
standard form which can be used by mailtoe testsuite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each wrapper script is a command
line tool which accepts a single command followed by zero or
more optional arguments, in the standard form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wrapper command
[argument]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each wrapper script also makes
use of STDIN and STDOUT in a well defined way. If no
behaviour is described, then no output or input should be
used. The possible commands are <br>
described below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filter In this case, a single
email is expected on STDIN, and a list of category filenames
is expected in $2, $3, etc. The script writes the category
name corresponding to the <br>
input email on STDOUT. No trailing newline is required or
expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">learn In this case, a standard
mbox stream is expected on STDIN, while a suitable category
file name is expected in $2. No output is written to
STDOUT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clean In this case, a directory
is expected in $2, which is examined for old database
information. If any old databases are found, they are purged
or reset. No output is written <br>
to STDOUT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">describe <br>
IN this case, a single line of text is written to STDOUT,
describing the filter&rsquo;s functionality. The line should
be kept short to prevent line wrapping on a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bootstrap <br>
In this case, a directory is expected in $2. The wrapper
script first checks for the existence of its associated
classifier, and other prerequisites. If the check is
suc&acirc; <br>
cessful, then the wrapper is cloned into the supplied
directory. A courtesy notification should be given on STDOUT
to express success or failure. It is also permissible <br>
to give longer descriptions caveats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">toe In this case, a list of
categories is expected in $3, $4, etc. Every possible
category must be listed. Preceding this list, the true
category is given in $2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foot Used by mailfoot(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Right after loading, mailtoe reads the hidden file
.mailtoerc in the $HOME directory, if it exists, so this
would be a good place to define custom values for
environment vari&acirc; <br>
ables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAILTOE_FILTER <br>
This variable contains a shell command to be executed
repeatedly during the running stage. The command should
accept an email message on STDIN and output a resulting
cat&acirc; <br>
egory name. On the command line, it should also accept first
the true category name, then a list of all possible category
file names. If the output category does not <br>
match the true category, then the relevant categories are
assumed to have been silently updated/relearned. If
MAILTOE_FILTER is undefined, mailtoe uses a default
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEMPDIR <br>
This directory is exported for the benefit of wrapper
scripts. Scripts which need to create temporary files should
place them a the location given in TEMPDIR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The subdirectory mailtoe.d can grow quite large. It contains
a full copy of the training corpora, as well as learning
files for size times all the added categories, and various
<br>
log files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While TOE simulations for
dbacl(1) can be used to compare with other classifiers, TOE
should not be used for real world classifications. This is
because, unlike many other fil&acirc; <br>
ters, dbacl(1) learns evidence weights in a nonlinear way,
and does not preserve relative weights between tokens, even
if those tokens aren&rsquo;t seen in new emails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
Because the ordering of emails within the added mailboxes
matters, the estimated error rates are not well defined or
even meaningful in an objective sense. However, if the
sam&acirc; <br>
ple emails represent an actual snapshot of a user&rsquo;s
incoming email, then the error rates are somewhat
meaningful. The simulations can then be interpreted as
alternate realities <br>
where a given classifier would have intercepted the incoming
mail.</p>
