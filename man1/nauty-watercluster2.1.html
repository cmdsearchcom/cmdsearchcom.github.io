  <dd class="It-tag">a big difference in case of restricted in- and outdegrees,
      because all that is done extra is that edges are directed instead of just
      keeping track of in- and out-degrees. This option is intended only for
      testing purposes to test also routines that are normally not used when
      counting. Things that would speed up the counting also in some cases of
      restricted in- and out-degrees <b>--</b> like multiplying the
      possibilities of assigning directions to edges that can be assigned
      directions independent of each other (depending on the degrees of the
      endvertices and overlaps) <b>--</b> are not included. In case of not
      restrictive bounds on the in- and out-degree it not really constructing
      the graphs can be considerably faster. In cases of restricted in- and
      out-degrees the only difference is that the graph isn't modified... The
      fact that in case of no output the graph is not modified is mainly to save
      time for the one case of waterclusters, where large numbers were
      determined. If large numbers (without output) for other cases shall be
      determined, one should think about adding the multiplication
    routines.</dd>
