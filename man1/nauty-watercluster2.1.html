<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
nauty-watercluster2 - generate small digraphs with given
underlying graph (faster alternative to directg)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
watercluster2 [ix] [oy] [S] [T] [B] [C] [m]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Reads graphs in g6 code or multicode (optional) from stdin
and directs them</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ix : the indegree of every
vertex may be at most x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default maximum indegree is
unlimited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">oy : the outdegree of every
vertex may be at most y.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default maximum outdegree is
unlimited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S : allow that for every pair of
vertices x,y at most one of the edges x--&gt;y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and y--&gt;x may be present. By
default both of them may be present in the same graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T : Output directed graphs in
T-code. This is a simple ASCII output format. Every line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">contains one graph. First the
number of vertices, then the number of directed edges and
then the list of directed edges with the start first and the
end then. E.g.: 3 2 0 <br>
1 2 1 means 3 vertices, 2 directed edges: 0--&gt;1 and
2--&gt;1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B : Output the directed graphs
in a binary code. Every item of the code is an unsigned</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">char. The first unsigned char is
the number nv of vertices. The vertices are numbered 1..nv
Then the list of vertices x for which there is a directed
edge 1-&gt;x follow. <br>
This list is ended by a 0. Then the list of outgoing
neighbours of 2 follows -- again ended with a 0, etc. The
code is complete with the 0 ending the list of outgoing <br>
neighbours of nv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C : Do really construct all the
directed graphs in memory, but don&rsquo;t output them. This
is not</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a big difference in case of
restricted in- and outdegrees, because all that is done
extra is that edges are directed instead of just keeping
track of in- and out-degrees. <br>
This option is intended only for testing purposes to test
also routines that are normally not used when counting.
Things that would speed up the counting also in some <br>
cases of restricted in- and out-degrees -- like multiplying
the possibilities of assigning directions to edges that can
be assigned directions independent of each other <br>
(depending on the degrees of the endvertices and overlaps)
-- are not included. In case of not restrictive bounds on
the in- and out-degree it not really constructing the <br>
graphs can be considerably faster. In cases of restricted
in- and out-degrees the only difference is that the graph
isn&rsquo;t modified... The fact that in case of no output
<br>
the graph is not modified is mainly to save time for the one
case of waterclusters, where large numbers were determined.
If large numbers (without output) for other cases <br>
shall be determined, one should think about adding the
multiplication routines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m : read multicode instead of g6
code</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program uses different
labelling routines -- all based on the ideas of</p>
