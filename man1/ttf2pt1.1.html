<p>TTF2PT1(1) TTF2PT1 Font Converter TTF2PT1(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
TTF2PT1 - A True Type to PostScript Type 1 Font
Converter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
&quot;ttf2pt1 [-options] ttffont.ttf [Fontname]&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ttf2pt1 [-options]
ttffont.ttf -&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ttf2pt1 is a font converter from the True Type format (and
some other formats supported by the FreeType library as
well) to the Adobe Type1 format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The versions 3.0 and later got
rather extensive post-processing algorithm that brings the
converted fonts to the requirements of the Type1 standard,
tries to correct the rounding <br>
errors introduced during conversions and some simple kinds
of bugs that are typical for the public domain TTF fonts. It
also generates the hints that enable much better rendering
<br>
of fonts in small sizes that are typical for the computer
displays. But everything has its price, and some of the
optimizations may not work well for certain fonts.
That&rsquo;s why <br>
the options were added to the converter, to control the
performed optimizations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The first variant creates the file &quot;Fontname.pfa&quot;
(or &quot;Fontname.pfb&quot; if the option &rsquo;-b&rsquo;
was used) with the converted font and
&quot;Fontname.afm&quot; with the font metrics, the second
one <br>
prints the font or another file (if the option
&rsquo;-G&rsquo; was used) on the standard output from where
it can be immediately piped through some filter. If no
&quot;Fontname&quot; is specified for <br>
the first variant, the name is generated from
&quot;ttffont&quot; by replacing the &quot;.ttf&quot;
filename suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of the time no options are
neccessary (with a possible exception of &rsquo;-e&rsquo;).
But if there are some troubles with the resulting font, they
may be used to control the <br>
conversion. The options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;-a&quot; -
Include all the glyphs from the source file into the
converted file. If this option is not specified then only
the glyphs that have been assigned some encoding are <br>
included, because the rest of glyphs would be inaccessible
anyway and would only consume the disk space. But some
applications are clever enough to change the encoding on the
<br>
fly and thus use the other glyphs, in this case they could
benefit from using this option. But there is a catch: the
X11 library has rather low limit for the font size. <br>
Including more glyphs increases the file size and thus
increases the chance of hitting this limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;-b&quot; -
Encode the resulting font to produce a ready
&quot;.pfb&quot; file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;-d
suboptions&quot; - Debugging options. The suboptions
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;a&quot; - Print out the
absolute coordinates of dots in outlines. Such a font can
not be used by any program (that&rsquo;s why this option is
incompatible with &rsquo;-e&rsquo;) but it has proven to
<br>
be a valuable debuging information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;r&quot; - Do not reverse
the direction of outlines. The TTF fonts have the standard
direction of outlines opposite to the Type1 fonts. So they
should be reversed during proper <br>
conversion. This option may be used for debugging or to
handle a TTF font with wrong direction of outlines
(possibly, converted in a broken way from a Type1 font). The
first <br>
signs of the wrong direction are the letters like
&quot;P&quot; or &quot;B&quot; without the unpainted
&quot;holes&quot; inside.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;-e&quot; -
Assemble the resulting font to produce a ready
&quot;.pfa&quot; file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ S.B.: Personally I don&rsquo;t
think that this option is particularly useful. The same
result may be achieved by piping the unassembled data
through t1asm, the Type 1 assembler. <br>
And, anyways, it&rsquo;s good to have the t1utils package
handy. But Mark and many users think that this functionality
is good and it took not much time to add this option. ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;-F&quot; -
Force the Unicode encoding: any type of MS encoding
specified in the font is ignored and the font is treated
like it has Unicode encoding. WARNING: this option is <br>
intended for buggy fonts which actually are in Unicode but
are marked as something else. The effect on the other fonts
is unpredictable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;-G
suboptions&quot; - File generation options. The suboptions
may be lowercase or uppercase, the lowercase ones disable
the generation of particular files, the corresponding <br>
uppercase suboptions enable the generation of the same kind
of files. If the result of ttf2pt1 is requested to be
printed on the standard output, the last enabling suboption
of <br>
-G determines which file will be written to the standard
output and the rest of files will be discarded. For example,
-G A will request the AFM file. The suboptions to <br>
disable/enable the generation of the files are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;f/F&quot; - The font file.
Depending on the other options this file will have one of
the suffixes &quot;.t1a&quot;, &quot;.pfa&quot; or
&quot;.pfb&quot;. If the conversion result is requested on
the standard <br>
output (&rsquo;&quot;-&quot;&rsquo; is used as the output
file name) then the font file will also be written there by
default, if not overwritten by another suboption of -G.
Default: enabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;a/A&quot; - The Adobe font
metrics file (&quot;.afm&quot;). Default: enabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;e/E&quot; - The dvips
encoding file (&quot;.enc&quot;). Default: disabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;-l
language[+argument]&quot; - Extract the fonts for the
specified language from a multi-language Unicode font. If
this option is not used the converter tries to guess the
language <br>
by the values of the shell variable LANG. If it is not able
to guess the language by LANG it tries all the languages in
the order they are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the plus sign an optional
argument for the language extractor may be specified. The
format of the argument is absolutely up to the particular
language converter. The <br>
primary purpose of the argument is to support selection of
planes for the multi-plane Eastern encodings but it can also
be used in any other way. The language extractor may <br>
decide to add the plane name in some form to the name of the
resulting font. None of the currently supported languages
make any use of the argument yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of now the following
languages are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;latin1&quot; - for all the
languages using the Latin-1 encoding</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;latin2&quot; - for the
Central European languages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;latin4&quot; - for the
Baltic languages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;latin5&quot; - for the
Turkish language</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;cyrillic&quot; - for the
languages with Cyrillic alphabet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;russian&quot; - historic
synonym for cyrillic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;bulgarian&quot; - historic
synonym for cyrillic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;adobestd&quot; - for the
AdobeStandard encoding used by TeX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;plane+argument&quot; - to
select one plane from a multi-byte encoding</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument of the
&quot;&quot;plane&quot;&quot; language may be in one of
three forms:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;plane+pid=&lt;pid&gt;,eid=&lt;eid&gt;&quot;</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;plane+pid=&lt;pid&gt;,eid=&lt;eid&gt;,&lt;plane_number&gt;&quot;</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;plane+&lt;plane_number&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pid (TTF platform id) and eid
(TTF encoding id) select a particular TTF encoding table in
the original font. They are specified as decimal numbers. If
this particular encoding <br>
table is not present in the font file then the conversion
fails. The native (&quot;ttf&quot;) front-end parser
supports only pid=3 (Windows platform), the FreeType-based
(&quot;ft&quot;) front-end <br>
supports any platform. If pid/eid is not specified then the
TTF encoding table is determined as usual: Unicode encoding
if it&rsquo;s first or an 8-bit encoding if not (and for an
<br>
8-bit encoding the plane number is silently ignored). To
prevent the converter from falling back to an 8-bit
encoding, specify the Unicode pid/eid value explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Plane_number is a hexadecimal
(if starts with &quot;0x&quot;) or decimal number. It gives
the values of upper bytes for which 256 characters will be
selected. If not specified, defaults <br>
to 0. It is also used as a font name suffix (the leading
&quot;0x&quot; is not included into the suffix).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: You may notice that the
language names are not uniform: some are the names of
particular languages and some are names of encodings. This
is because of the different <br>
approaches. The original idea was to implement a conversion
from Unicode to the appropriate Windows encoding for a given
language. And then use the translation tables to <br>
generate the fonts in whatever final encodings are needed.
This would allow to pile together the Unicode fonts and the
non-Unicode Windows fonts for that language and let the <br>
program to sort them out automatically. And then generate
fonts in all the possible encodings for that language. An
example of this approach is the Russian language support.
<br>
But if there is no multiplicity of encodings used for some
languages and if the non-Unicode fonts are not considered
important by the users, another way would be simpler to <br>
implement: just provide only one table for extraction of the
target encoding from Unicode and don&rsquo;t bother with the
translation tables. The latin* &quot;languages&quot; are
examples of <br>
this approach. If somebody feels that he needs the Type1
fonts both in Latin-* and Windows encodings he or she is
absolutely welcome to submit the code to implement it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: Some of the glyphs
included into the AdobeStandard encoding are not included
into the Unicode standard. The most typical examples of such
glyphs are ligatures like <br>
&rsquo;fi&rsquo;, &rsquo;fl&rsquo; etc. Because of this the
font designers may place them at various places. The
converter tries to do its best, if the glyphs have honest
Adobe names and/or are placed <br>
at the same codes as in the Microsoft fonts they will be
picked up. Otherwise a possible solution is to use the
option &rsquo;-L&rsquo; with an external map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;-L
file[+[pid=&lt;pid&gt;,eid=&lt;eid&gt;,][plane]]&quot; -
Extract the fonts for the specified language from a
multi-language font using the map from this file. This is
rather like the option <br>
&rsquo;-l&rsquo; but the encoding map is not compiled into
the program, it&rsquo;s taken from that file, so it&rsquo;s
easy to edit. Examples of such files are provided in <br>
&quot;maps/adobe-standard-encoding.map&quot;,
&quot;CP1250.map&quot;. (NOTE: the &rsquo;standard
encoding&rsquo; map does not include all the glyphs of the
AdobeStandard encoding, it&rsquo;s provided only as an <br>
example.) The description of the supported map formats is in
the file &quot;maps/unicode-sample.map&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Likewise to &rsquo;-l&rsquo;, an
argument may be specified after the map file name. But in
this case the argument has fixed meaning: it selects the
original TTF encoding table (the syntax <br>
is the same as in &rsquo;-l plane&rsquo;) and/or a plane of
the map file. The plane name also gets added after dash to
the font name. The plane is a concept used in the Eastern
fonts with <br>
big number of glyphs: one TTF font gets divided into
multiple Type1 fonts, each containing one plane of up to 256
glyphs. But with a little creativity this concept may be
used <br>
for other purposes of combining multiple translation maps
into one file. To extract multiple planes from a TTF font
&quot;ttf2pt1&quot; must be run multiple times, each time
with a <br>
different plane name specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default original TTF
encoding table used for the option &rsquo;-L&rsquo; is
Unicode. The map files may include directives to specify
different original TTF encodings. However if the <br>
pid/eid pair is specified with it overrides any original
encoding specified in the map file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;-m
type=value&quot; - Set maximal or minimal limits of
resources. These limits control the the font generation by
limiting the resources that the font is permitted to require
from <br>
the PostScript interpreter. The currently supported types of
limits are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;h&quot; - the maximal hint
stack depth for the substituted hints. The default value is
128, according to the limitation in X11. This seems to be
the lowest (and thus the safest) <br>
widespread value. To display the hint stack depth required
by each glyph in a &quot;.t1a&quot; file use the script
&quot;ttf2pt1_cntstems&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;-O
suboptions&quot; - Outline processing options. The
suboptions may be lowercase or uppercase, the lowercase ones
disable the features, the corresponding uppercase suboptions
<br>
enable the same features. The suboptions to disable/enable
features are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;b/B&quot; - Guessing of
the ForceBold parameter. This parameter helps the Type1
engine to rasterize the bold fonts properly at small sizes.
But the algorithm used to guess the <br>
proper value of this flag makes that guess based solely on
the font name. In rare cases that may cause errors, in these
cases you may want to disable this guessing. Default: <br>
enabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;h/H&quot; - Autogeneration
of hints. The really complex outlines may confuse the
algorithm, so theoretically it may be useful sometimes to
disable them. Although up to now it seems <br>
that even bad hints are better than no hints at all.
Default: enabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;u/U&quot; - Hint
substitution. Hint substitution is a technique permitting
generation of more detailed hints for the rasterizer. It
allows to use different sets of hints for <br>
different parts of a glyph and change these sets as
neccessary during rasterization (that&rsquo;s why
&quot;substituted&quot;). So it should improve the quality
of the fonts rendered at small <br>
sizes. But there are two catches: First, the X11 library has
rather low limit for the font size. More detailed hints
increase the file size and thus increase the chance of <br>
hitting this limit (that does not mean that you shall hit it
but you may if your fonts are particularly big). This is
especially probable for Unicode fonts converted with <br>
option &rsquo;-a&rsquo;, so you may want to use
&rsquo;-a&rsquo; together with &rsquo;-Ou&rsquo;. Second,
some rasterizers (again, X11 is the typical example) have a
limitation for total number of hints used <br>
when drawing a glyph (also known as the hint stack depth).
If that stack overflows the glyph is ignored. Starting from
version 3.22 &quot;ttf2pt1&quot; uses algorithms to
minimizing this <br>
depth, with the trade-off of slightly bigger font files. The
glyphs which still exceed the limit set by option
&rsquo;-mh&rsquo; have all the substituted hints removed and
only base hints <br>
left. The algorithms seem to have been refined far enough to
make the fonts with substituted hints look better than the
fonts without them or at least the same. Still if the <br>
original fonts are not well-designed the detailed hinting
may emphasize the defects of the design, such as non-even
thickness of lines. So provided that you are not afraid of
<br>
the X11 bug the best idea would be to generate a font with
this feature and without it, then compare the results using
the program &quot;ttf2pt1_cmpf&quot; (see the description in
<br>
&quot;other/README&quot;) and decide which one looks better.
Default: enabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;o/O&quot; - Space
optimization of the outlines&rsquo; code. This kind of
optimization never hurts, and the only reason to disable
this feature is for comparison of the generated fonts <br>
with the fonts generated by the previous versions of
converter. Well, it _almost_ never hurts. As it turned out
there exist some brain-damaged printers which don&rsquo;t
understand <br>
it. Actually this feature does not change the outlines at
all. The Type 1 font manual provides a set of redundant
operators that make font description shorter, such as
&rsquo;10 <br>
hlineto&rsquo; instead of &rsquo;0 10 rlineto&rsquo; to
describe a horizontal line. This feature enables use of
these operators. Default: enabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;s/S&quot; - Smoothing of
outlines. If the font is broken in some way (even the ones
that are not easily noticeable), such smoothing may break it
further. So disabling this feature <br>
is the first thing to be tried if some font looks odd. But
with smoothing off the hint generation algorithms may not
work properly too. Default: enabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;t/T&quot; - Auto-scaling
to the 1000x1000 Type1 standard matrix. The TTF fonts are
described in terms of an arbitrary matrix up to 4000x4000.
The converted fonts must be scaled to <br>
conform to the Type1 standard. But the scaling introduces
additional rounding errors, so it may be curious sometimes
to look at the font in its original scale. Default: <br>
enabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;v/V&quot; - Do
vectorization on the bitmap fonts. Functionally
&quot;vectorization&quot; is the same thing as
&quot;autotracing&quot;, a different word is used purely to
differentiate it from the <br>
Autotrace library. It tries to produce nice smooth outlines
from bitmaps. This feature is still a work in progress
though the results are already mostly decent. Default: <br>
disabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;w/W&quot; - Glyphs&rsquo;
width corection. This option is designed to be used on
broken fonts which specify too narrow widths for the
letters. You can tell that a font can benefit from <br>
this option if you see that the characters are smashed
together without any whitespace between them. This option
causes the converter to set the character widths to the
actual <br>
width of this character plus the width of a typical vertical
stem. But on the other hand the well-designed fonts may have
characters that look better if their widths are set <br>
slightly narrower. Such well-designed fonts will benefit
from disabling this feature. You may want to convert a font
with and without this feature, compare the results and <br>
select the better one. This feature may be used only on
proportional fonts, it has no effect on the fixed-width
fonts. Default: disabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;z/Z&quot; - Use the
Autotrace library on the bitmap fonts. The results are
horrible and the use of this option is not recommended. This
option is present for experimental purposes. <br>
It may change or be removed in the future. The working
tracing can be achieved with option &quot;-OV&quot;.
Default: disabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;-p
parser_name&quot; - Use the specified front-end parser to
read the font file. If this option is not used, ttf2pt1
selects the parser automatically based on the suffix of the
<br>
font file name, it uses the first parser in its list that
supports this font type. Now two parsers are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ttf&quot; - built-in
parser for the ttf files (suffix &quot;.ttf&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;bdf&quot; - built-in
parser for the BDF files (suffix &quot;.bdf&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ft&quot; - parser based on
the FreeType-2 library (suffixes &quot;.ttf&quot;,
&quot;.otf&quot;, &quot;.pfa&quot;, &quot;.pfb&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parser &quot;ft&quot; is NOT
linked in by default. See &quot;Makefile&quot; for
instructions how to enable it. We do no support this parser
on Windows: probably it will work but nobody tried <br>
and nobody knows how to build it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The conversion of the bitmap
fonts (such as BDF) is simplistic yet, producing jagged
outlines. When converting such fonts, it might be a good
idea to turn off the hint <br>
substitution (using option -Ou) because the hints produced
will be huge but not adding much to the quality of the
fonts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;-u
number&quot; - Mark the font with this value as its
UniqueID. The UniqueID is used by the printers with the hard
disks to cache the rasterized characters and thus
significantly <br>
speed-up the printing. Some of those printers just
can&rsquo;t store the fonts without UniqueID on their
disk.The problem is that the ID is supposed to be unique, as
it name says. <br>
And there is no easy way to create a guaranteed unique ID.
Adobe specifies the range 4000000-4999999 for private IDs
but still it&rsquo;s difficult to guarantee the uniqueness
within <br>
it. So if you don&rsquo;t really need the UniqueID
don&rsquo;t use it, it&rsquo;s optional. Luckily there are a
few millions of possible IDs, so the chances of collision
are rather low. If <br>
instead of the number a special value
&rsquo;&quot;A&quot;&rsquo; is given then the converter
generates the value of UniqueID automatically, as a hash of
the font name. (NOTE: in the version 3.22 <br>
the algorithm for autogeneration of UniqueID was changed to
fit the values into the Adobe-spacified range. This means
that if UniqueIDs were used then the printer&rsquo;s cache
may <br>
need to be flushed before replacing the fonts converted by
an old version with fonts converted by a newer version). A
simple way to find if any of the fonts in a given <br>
directory have duplicated UniqueIDs is to use the
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot; cat *.pf[ab] | grep
UniqueID | sort | uniq -c | grep -v &rsquo; 1
&rsquo;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or if you use
&quot;ttf2pt1_convert&quot; it will do that for you
automatically plus it will also give the exact list of files
with duplicate UIDs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;-v
size&quot; - Re-scale the font to get the size of a typical
uppercase letter somewhere around the specified size.
Actually, it re-scales the whole font to get the size of one
<br>
language-dependent letter to be at least of the specified
size. Now this letter is &quot;A&quot; in all the supported
languages. The size is specified in the points of the Type 1
<br>
coordinate grids, the maximal value is 1000. This is an
experimental option and should be used with caution. It
tries to increase the visible font size for a given point
size <br>
and thus make the font more readable. But if overused it may
cause the fonts to look out of scale. As of now the
interesting values of size for this option seem to be
located <br>
mostly between 600 and 850. This re-scaling may be quite
useful but needs more experience to understand the balance
of its effects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;-W
level&quot; - Select the verbosity level of the warnings.
Currently the levels from 0 to 4 are supported. Level 0
means no warnings at all, level 4 means all the possible
<br>
warnings. The default level is 3. Other levels may be added
in the future, so using the level number 99 is recommended
to get all the possible warnings. Going below level 2 is
<br>
not generally recommended because you may miss valuable
information about the problems with the fonts being
converted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Obsolete option:
&quot;-A&quot; - Print the font metrics (.afm file) instead
of the font on STDOUT. Use -GA instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Very obsolete
option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The algorithm that implemented
the forced fixed width had major flaws, so it was disabled.
The code is still in the program and some day it will be
refined and returned back. <br>
Meanwhile the option name &rsquo;-f&rsquo; was reused for
another option. The old version was:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;-f&quot; - Don&rsquo;t try
to force the fixed width of font. Normally the converter
considers the fonts in which the glyph width deviates by not
more than 5% as buggy fixed width fonts <br>
and forces them to have really fixed width. If this is
undesirable, it can be disabled by this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;.pfa&quot; font format
supposes that the description of the characters is binary
encoded and encrypted. This converter does not encode or
encrypt the data by default, you have to <br>
specify the option &rsquo;-e&rsquo; or use the
&quot;t1asm&quot; program to assemble (that means, encode
and encrypt) the font program. The &quot;t1asm&quot; program
that is included with the converter is <br>
actually a part of the &quot;t1utils&quot; package, rather
old version of which may be obtained from</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://ttf2pt1.sourceforge.net/t1utils.tar.gz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that &quot;t1asm&quot; from
the old version of that package won&rsquo;t work properly

So, the following command lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ttf2pt1 -e ttffont.ttf
t1font&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ttf2pt1 ttffont.ttf - |
t1asm &gt;t1font.pfa&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">represent two ways to get a
working font. The benefit of the second form is that other
filters may be applied to the font between the converter and
assembler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
It seems that many Eastern fonts use features of the TTF
format that are not supported by the ttf2pt1&rsquo;s
built-in front-end parser. Because of this for now we
recommend using the <br>
FreeType-based parser (option &rsquo;-p ft&rsquo;) with the
&quot;&quot;plane&quot;&quot; language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Troubleshooting and bug reports
<br>
Have problems with conversion of some font ? The converter
dumps core ? Or your printer refuses to understand the
converted fonts ? Or some characters are missing ? Or some
<br>
characters look strange ?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send the bug reports to the
ttf2pt1 development mailing list at
ttf2pt1-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Try to collect more information
about the problem and include it into the bug report. (Of
course, even better if you would provide a ready fix, but
just a detailed bug report is <br>
also good). Provide detailed information about your problem,
this will speed up the response greatly. Don&rsquo;t just
write &quot;this font looks strange after conversion&quot;
but describe <br>
what&rsquo;s exactly wrong with it: for example, what
characters look wrong and what exactly is wrong about their
look. Providing a link to the original font file would be
also a good <br>
idea. Try to do a little troublehooting and report its
result. This not only would help with the fix but may also
give you a temporary work-around for the bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, enable full warnings with
option &rsquo;-W99&rsquo;, save them to a file and read
carefully. Sometimes the prolem is with a not implemented
feature which is reported in the warnings. <br>
Still, reporting about such problems may be a good idea:
some features were missed to cut corners, in hope that no
real font is using them. So a report about a font using such
a <br>
feature may motivate someone to implement it. Of course, you
may be the most motivated person: after all, you are the one
wishing to convert that font. ;-) Seriously, the <br>
philosophy &quot;scrath your own itch&quot; seems to be the
strongest moving force behind the Open Source software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next step is playing with
the options. This serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it
helps to localize the bug, on the other hand you may be able
to get a working version of <br>
the font for the meantime while the bug is being fixed. The
typical options to try out are: first &rsquo;-Ou&rsquo;, if
it does not help then &rsquo;-Os&rsquo;, then
&rsquo;-Oh&rsquo;, then &rsquo;-Oo&rsquo;. They are <br>
described in a bit more detail above. Try them one by one
and in combinations. See if with them the resulting fonts
look better.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some fonts ttf2pt1 just
crashes. Commonly that happens because the font being
converted is highly defective (although sometimes the bug is
in ttf2pt1 itself). In any case it <br>
should not crash, so the reports about such cases will help
to handle these defects properly in future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We try to respond to the bug
reports in a timely fashion but alas, this may not always be
possible, especially if the problem is complex. This is a
volunteer project and its <br>
resources are limited. Because of this we would appreciate
bug reports as detailed as possible, and we would appreciate
the ready fixes and contributions even more.</p>
