Ttf2pt1 is a font converter from the True Type format (and some other formats
  supported by the FreeType library as well) to the Adobe Type1 format.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The versions 3.0 and later got rather extensive post-processing algorithm that
  brings the converted fonts to the requirements of the Type1 standard, tries to
  correct the rounding errors introduced during conversions and some simple
  kinds of bugs that are typical for the public domain TTF fonts. It also
  generates the hints that enable much better rendering of fonts in small sizes
  that are typical for the computer displays. But everything has its price, and
  some of the optimizations may not work well for certain fonts. That's why the
  options were added to the converter, to control the performed optimizations.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The first variant creates the file &quot;Fontname.pfa&quot; (or
  &quot;Fontname.pfb&quot; if the option ' <b>-b</b>' was used) with the
  converted font and &quot;Fontname.afm&quot; with the font metrics, the second
  one prints the font or another file (if the option ' <b>-G</b>' was used) on
  the standard output from where it can be immediately piped through some
  filter. If no &quot;Fontname&quot; is specified for the first variant, the
  name is generated from &quot;ttffont&quot; by replacing the &quot;.ttf&quot;
  filename suffix.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most of the time no options are neccessary (with a possible exception of '
  <b>-e</b>'). But if there are some troubles with the resulting font, they may
  be used to control the conversion. The <b>options</b> are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;<b>-a</b>&quot; - Include all the glyphs from the
      source file into the converted file. If this option is not specified then
      only the glyphs that have been assigned some encoding are included,
      because the rest of glyphs would be inaccessible anyway and would only
      consume the disk space. But some applications are clever enough to change
      the encoding on the fly and thus use the other glyphs, in this case they
      could benefit from using this option. But there is a catch: the X11
      library has rather low limit for the font size. Including more glyphs
      increases the file size and thus increases the chance of hitting this
      limit.</dd>

    &quot; <b>r</b>&quot; - Do not reverse the direction of outlines. The TTF
      fonts have the standard direction of outlines opposite to the Type1 fonts.
      So they should be reversed during proper conversion. This option may be
      used for debugging or to handle a TTF font with wrong direction of
      outlines (possibly, converted in a broken way from a Type1 font). The
      first signs of the wrong direction are the letters like &quot;P&quot; or

      The same result may be achieved by piping the unassembled data through
      t1asm, the Type 1 assembler. And, anyways, it's good to have the t1utils

    After the plus sign an optional argument for the language extractor may be
      specified. The format of the argument is absolutely up to the particular
      language converter. The primary purpose of the argument is to support
      selection of planes for the multi-plane Eastern encodings but it can also
      be used in any other way. The language extractor may decide to add the
      plane name in some form to the name of the resulting font. None of the

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&quot;latin5&quot; - for the Turkish language
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&quot;cyrillic&quot; - for the languages with Cyrillic

      from a multi-byte encoding
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The argument of the &quot;&quot;plane&quot;&quot; language may be in one of
      three forms:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&quot;plane+
      <b>pid=</b><i>&lt;pid&gt;</i><b>,eid=</b><i>&lt;eid&gt;</i>&quot;

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Pid (TTF platform id) and eid (TTF encoding id) select a particular TTF
      encoding table in the original font. They are specified as decimal
      numbers. If this particular encoding table is not present in the font file
      then the conversion fails. The native (&quot;ttf&quot;) front-end parser
      supports only pid=3 (Windows platform), the FreeType-based
      (&quot;ft&quot;) front-end supports any platform. If pid/eid is not
      specified then the TTF encoding table is determined as usual: Unicode
      encoding if it's first or an 8-bit encoding if not (and for an 8-bit
      encoding the plane number is silently ignored). To prevent the converter
      from falling back to an 8-bit encoding, specify the Unicode pid/eid value
      explicitly.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Plane_number is a hexadecimal (if starts with &quot; <b>0x</b>&quot;) or
      decimal number. It gives the values of upper bytes for which 256
      characters will be selected. If not specified, defaults to 0. It is also
      used as a font name suffix (the leading &quot;0x&quot; is not included
      into the suffix).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>NOTE:</b> You may notice that the language names are not uniform: some
      are the names of particular languages and some are names of encodings.
      This is because of the different approaches. The original idea was to
      implement a conversion from Unicode to the appropriate Windows encoding
      for a given language. And then use the translation tables to generate the
      fonts in whatever final encodings are needed. This would allow to pile
      together the Unicode fonts and the non-Unicode Windows fonts for that
      language and let the program to sort them out automatically. And then
      generate fonts in all the possible encodings for that language. An example
      of this approach is the Russian language support. But if there is no
      multiplicity of encodings used for some languages and if the non-Unicode
      fonts are not considered important by the users, another way would be
      simpler to implement: just provide only one table for extraction of the
      target encoding from Unicode and don't bother with the translation tables.
      The latin* &quot;languages&quot; are examples of this approach. If
      somebody feels that he needs the Type1 fonts both in Latin-* and Windows
      encodings he or she is absolutely welcome to submit the code to implement
      it.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>WARNING:</b> Some of the glyphs included into the AdobeStandard encoding
      are not included into the Unicode standard. The most typical examples of
      such glyphs are ligatures like 'fi', 'fl' etc. Because of this the font
      designers may place them at various places. The converter tries to do its
      best, if the glyphs have honest Adobe names and/or are placed at the same
      codes as in the Microsoft fonts they will be picked up. Otherwise a
      possible solution is to use the option ' <b>-L</b>' with an external
    map.</dd>

      </b><b>file</b><b>[+[pid=</b><b>&lt;pid&gt;</b><b>,eid=</b><b>&lt;eid&gt;</b><b>,][</b><b>plane</b><b>]]</b>&quot;
      - Extract the fonts for the specified language from a multi-language font
      using the map from this file. This is rather like the option ' <b>-l</b>'
      but the encoding map is not compiled into the program, it's taken from
      that file, so it's easy to edit. Examples of such files are provided in
      &quot;maps/adobe-standard-encoding.map&quot;, &quot;CP1250.map&quot;. (
      <b>NOTE:</b> the 'standard encoding' map does not include all the glyphs
      of the AdobeStandard encoding, it's provided only as an example.) The
      description of the supported map formats is in the file
      &quot;maps/unicode-sample.map&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Likewise to ' <b>-l</b>', an argument may be specified after the map file
      name. But in this case the argument has fixed meaning: it selects the
      original TTF encoding table (the syntax is the same as in ' <b>-l
      plane</b>') and/or a plane of the map file. The plane name also gets added
      after dash to the font name. The plane is a concept used in the Eastern
      fonts with big number of glyphs: one TTF font gets divided into multiple
      Type1 fonts, each containing one plane of up to 256 glyphs. But with a
      little creativity this concept may be used for other purposes of combining
      multiple translation maps into one file. To extract multiple planes from a
      TTF font &quot;ttf2pt1&quot; must be run multiple times, each time with a
      different plane name specified.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The default original TTF encoding table used for the option ' <b>-L</b>' is
      Unicode. The map files may include directives to specify different
      original TTF encodings. However if the pid/eid pair is specified with it
      overrides any original encoding specified in the map file.</dd>

      processing options. The suboptions may be lowercase or uppercase, the

      suboptions enable the same features. The suboptions to disable/enable
      features are:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot; <b>b/B</b>&quot; - Guessing of the ForceBold parameter. This
      parameter helps the Type1 engine to rasterize the bold fonts properly at
      small sizes. But the algorithm used to guess the proper value of this flag
      makes that guess based solely on the font name. In rare cases that may
      cause errors, in these cases you may want to disable this guessing.
      <b>Default: enabled</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot; <b>h/H</b>&quot; - Autogeneration of hints. The really complex
      outlines may confuse the algorithm, so theoretically it may be useful
      sometimes to disable them. Although up to now it seems that even bad hints
      are better than no hints at all. <b>Default: enabled</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot; <b>u/U</b>&quot; - Hint substitution. Hint substitution is a
      technique permitting generation of more detailed hints for the rasterizer.
      It allows to use different sets of hints for different parts of a glyph
      and change these sets as neccessary during rasterization (that's why
      &quot;substituted&quot;). So it should improve the quality of the fonts
      rendered at small sizes. But there are two catches: First, the X11 library
      has rather low limit for the font size. More detailed hints increase the
      file size and thus increase the chance of hitting this limit (that does
      not mean that you shall hit it but you may if your fonts are particularly
      big). This is especially probable for Unicode fonts converted with option
      ' <b>-a</b>', so you may want to use ' <b>-a</b>' together with
      '<b>-Ou</b>'. Second, some rasterizers (again, X11 is the typical example)
      have a limitation for total number of hints used when drawing a glyph
      (also known as the hint stack depth). If that stack overflows the glyph is
      ignored. Starting from version 3.22 &quot;ttf2pt1&quot; uses algorithms to
      minimizing this depth, with the trade-off of slightly bigger font files.
      The glyphs which still exceed the limit set by option ' <b>-mh</b>' have
      all the substituted hints removed and only base hints left. The algorithms
      seem to have been refined far enough to make the fonts with substituted
      hints look better than the fonts without them or at least the same. Still
      if the original fonts are not well-designed the detailed hinting may
      emphasize the defects of the design, such as non-even thickness of lines.
      So provided that you are not afraid of the X11 bug the best idea would be
      to generate a font with this feature and without it, then compare the
      results using the program &quot;ttf2pt1_cmpf&quot; (see the description in
      &quot;other/README&quot;) and decide which one looks better. <b>Default:
      enabled</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot; <b>o/O</b>&quot; - Space optimization of the outlines' code. This
      kind of optimization never hurts, and the only reason to disable this
      feature is for comparison of the generated fonts with the fonts generated
      by the previous versions of converter. Well, it _almost_ never hurts. As
      it turned out there exist some brain-damaged printers which don't
      understand it. Actually this feature does not change the outlines at all.
      The Type 1 font manual provides a set of redundant operators that make
      font description shorter, such as '10 hlineto' instead of '0 10 rlineto'
      to describe a horizontal line. This feature enables use of these
      operators. <b>Default: enabled</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot; <b>s/S</b>&quot; - Smoothing of outlines. If the font is broken in
      some way (even the ones that are not easily noticeable), such smoothing
      may break it further. So disabling this feature is the first thing to be
      tried if some font looks odd. But with smoothing off the hint generation
      algorithms may not work properly too. <b>Default: enabled</b>

    &quot; <b>t/T</b>&quot; - Auto-scaling to the 1000x1000 Type1 standard
      matrix. The TTF fonts are described in terms of an arbitrary matrix up to
      4000x4000. The converted fonts must be scaled to conform to the Type1
      standard. But the scaling introduces additional rounding errors, so it may
      be curious sometimes to look at the font in its original scale.

    &quot; <b>v/V</b>&quot; - Do vectorization on the bitmap fonts. Functionally
      &quot;vectorization&quot; is the same thing as &quot;autotracing&quot;, a
      different word is used purely to differentiate it from the Autotrace
      library. It tries to produce nice smooth outlines from bitmaps. This
      feature is still a work in progress though the results are already mostly
      decent. <b>Default: disabled</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot; <b>w/W</b>&quot; - Glyphs' width corection. This option is designed
      to be used on broken fonts which specify too narrow widths for the
      letters. You can tell that a font can benefit from this option if you see
      that the characters are smashed together without any whitespace between
      them. This option causes the converter to set the character widths to the
      actual width of this character plus the width of a typical vertical stem.
      But on the other hand the well-designed fonts may have characters that
      look better if their widths are set slightly narrower. Such well-designed
      fonts will benefit from disabling this feature. You may want to convert a
      font with and without this feature, compare the results and select the
      better one. This feature may be used only on proportional fonts, it has no

    &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&quot;ttf&quot; - built-in parser for the ttf files (suffix
      &quot;.ttf&quot;)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&quot;bdf&quot; - built-in parser for the BDF files (suffix
      &quot;.bdf&quot;)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&quot;ft&quot; - parser based on the FreeType-2 library
      (suffixes &quot;.ttf&quot;, &quot;.otf&quot;, &quot;.pfa&quot;,
      &quot;.pfb&quot;)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The parser &quot;ft&quot; is <b>NOT</b> linked in by default. See
      &quot;Makefile&quot; for instructions how to enable it. We do no support
      this parser on Windows: probably it will work but nobody tried and nobody
      knows how to build it.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The conversion of the bitmap fonts (such as BDF) is simplistic yet,
      producing jagged outlines. When converting such fonts, it might be a good
      idea to turn off the hint substitution (using option <b>-Ou</b>) because
      the hints produced will be huge but not adding much to the quality of the
      fonts.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;<b>-u </b><b>number</b><b></b>&quot; - Mark the font
      with this value as its UniqueID. The UniqueID is used by the printers with
      the hard disks to cache the rasterized characters and thus significantly
      speed-up the printing. Some of those printers just can't store the fonts
      without UniqueID on their disk.The problem is that the ID is supposed to
      be unique, as it name says. And there is no easy way to create a
      guaranteed unique ID. Adobe specifies the range 4000000-4999999 for
      private IDs but still it's difficult to guarantee the uniqueness within
      it. So if you don't really need the UniqueID don't use it, it's optional.
      Luckily there are a few millions of possible IDs, so the chances of
      collision are rather low. If instead of the number a special value '&quot;
      <b>A</b>&quot;' is given then the converter generates the value of
      UniqueID automatically, as a hash of the font name. ( <b>NOTE:</b> in the
      version 3.22 the algorithm for autogeneration of UniqueID was changed to
      fit the values into the Adobe-spacified range. This means that if
      UniqueIDs were used then the printer's cache may need to be flushed before
      replacing the fonts converted by an old version with fonts converted by a
      newer version). A simple way to find if any of the fonts in a given
      directory have duplicated UniqueIDs is to use the command:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;cat *.pf[ab] | grep UniqueID | sort | uniq -c | grep
      -v ' 1 '&quot;
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Or if you use &quot;ttf2pt1_convert&quot; it will do that for you
      automatically plus it will also give the exact list of files with
      duplicate UIDs.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;<b>-v </b><b>size</b><b></b>&quot; - Re-scale the
      font to get the size of a typical uppercase letter somewhere around the
      specified size. Actually, it re-scales the whole font to get the size of
      one language-dependent letter to be at least of the specified size. Now
      this letter is &quot;A&quot; in all the supported languages. The size is
      specified in the points of the Type 1 coordinate grids, the maximal value
      is 1000. This is an experimental option and should be used with caution.
      It tries to increase the visible font size for a given point size and thus
      make the font more readable. But if overused it may cause the fonts to
      look out of scale. As of now the interesting values of size for this
      option seem to be located mostly between 600 and 850. This re-scaling may
      be quite useful but needs more experience to understand the balance of its

    The algorithm that implemented the forced fixed width had major flaws, so it
      was disabled. The code is still in the program and some day it will be
      refined and returned back. Meanwhile the option name ' <b>-f</b>' was
      reused for another option. The old version was:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot; <b>-f</b>&quot; - Don't try to force the fixed width of font.
      Normally the converter considers the fonts in which the glyph width
      deviates by not more than 5% as buggy fixed width fonts and forces them to
      have really fixed width. If this is undesirable, it can be disabled by
      this option.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;.pfa&quot; font format supposes that the description of the characters
  is binary encoded and encrypted. This converter does not encode or encrypt the
  data by default, you have to specify the option ' <b>-e</b>' or use the
  &quot;t1asm&quot; program to assemble (that means, encode and encrypt) the
  font program. The &quot;t1asm&quot; program that is included with the
  converter is actually a part of the &quot;t1utils&quot; package, rather old
  version of which may be obtained from
<div class="Pp"></div>
http://ttf2pt1.sourceforge.net/t1utils.tar.gz
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that &quot;t1asm&quot; from the old version of that package won't work
  properly with the files generated by &quot;ttf2pt1&quot; version 3.20 and
  later. Please use &quot;t1asm&quot; packaged with &quot;ttf2pt1&quot; or from
  the new version &quot;t1utils&quot; instead. For a newer version of
  &quot;t1utils&quot; please look at

So, the following command lines:

&quot;ttf2pt1 -e ttffont.ttf t1font&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;ttf2pt1 ttffont.ttf - | t1asm &gt;t1font.pfa&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
represent two ways to get a working font. The benefit of the second form is that
  other filters may be applied to the font between the converter and assembler.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
It seems that many Eastern fonts use features of the TTF format that are not
  supported by the ttf2pt1's built-in front-end parser. Because of this for now
  we recommend using the FreeType-based parser (option ' <b>-p ft</b>') with the
  &quot;&quot;plane&quot;&quot; language.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Troubleshooting_and_bug_reports"><a class="selflink" href="#Troubleshooting_and_bug_reports">Troubleshooting
  and bug reports</a></h2>
Have problems with conversion of some font ? The converter dumps core ? Or your
  printer refuses to understand the converted fonts ? Or some characters are
  missing ? Or some characters look strange ?
<div class="Pp"></div>
Send the bug reports to the ttf2pt1 development mailing list at
  ttf2pt1-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Try to collect more information about the problem and include it into the bug
  report. (Of course, even better if you would provide a ready fix, but just a
  detailed bug report is also good). Provide detailed information about your
  problem, this will speed up the response greatly. Don't just write &quot;this
  font looks strange after conversion&quot; but describe what's exactly wrong
  with it: for example, what characters look wrong and what exactly is wrong
  about their look. Providing a link to the original font file would be also a
  good idea. Try to do a little troublehooting and report its result. This not
  only would help with the fix but may also give you a temporary work-around for
  the bug.
<div class="Pp"></div>
First, enable full warnings with option ' <b>-W99</b>', save them to a file and
  read carefully. Sometimes the prolem is with a not implemented feature which
  is reported in the warnings. Still, reporting about such problems may be a
  good idea: some features were missed to cut corners, in hope that no real font
  is using them. So a report about a font using such a feature may motivate
  someone to implement it. Of course, you may be the most motivated person:
  after all, you are the one wishing to convert that font. ;-) Seriously, the
  philosophy &quot;scrath your own itch&quot; seems to be the strongest moving
  force behind the Open Source software.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The next step is playing with the options. This serves a dual purpose: on one
  hand, it helps to localize the bug, on the other hand you may be able to get a
  working version of the font for the meantime while the bug is being fixed. The
  typical options to try out are: first ' <b>-Ou</b>', if it does not help then
  ' <b>-Os</b>', then '<b>-Oh</b>', then '<b>-Oo</b>'. They are described in a
  bit more detail above. Try them one by one and in combinations. See if with
  them the resulting fonts look better.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On some fonts ttf2pt1 just crashes. Commonly that happens because the font being
  converted is highly defective (although sometimes the bug is in ttf2pt1
  itself). In any case it should not crash, so the reports about such cases will
  help to handle these defects properly in future.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We try to respond to the bug reports in a timely fashion but alas, this may not
  always be possible, especially if the problem is complex. This is a volunteer
  project and its resources are limited. Because of this we would appreciate bug
  reports as detailed as possible, and we would appreciate the ready fixes and
  contributions even more.
