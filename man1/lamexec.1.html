<p>LAMEXEC(1) LAM COMMANDS LAMEXEC(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lamexec - Run non-MPI programs on LAM nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lamexec [-fhvD] [-c # | -np #] [-nw | -w] [-pty] [-s node]
[-x VAR1[=VALUE1][,VAR2[=VALUE2],...]] [where] program [--
args]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c # Synonym for -np (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Use the executable program
location as the current working directory for created
processes. The current working directory of the created
processes will be set before <br>
the user&rsquo;s program is invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Do not configure standard I/O
file descriptors - use defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print useful information on
this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-np # (see below). Run this many
copies of the program on the given nodes. This option
indicates that the specified file is an executable program
and not an application <br>
schema. If no nodes are specified, all LAM nodes are
considered for scheduling; LAM will schedule the programs in
a round-robin fashion, &quot;wrapping around&quot; (and
sched&acirc; <br>
uling multiple copies on a single node) if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nw Do not wait for all
processes to complete before exiting lamexec. This option is
mutually exclusive with -w.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pty Enable pseudo-tty support.
Among other things, this enabled line-buffered output (which
is probably what you want). The only reason that this
feature is not enabled <br>
by default is because it is so new and has not been
extensively tested yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s node Load the program from
this node. This option is not valid on the command line if
an application schema is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Be verbose; report on
important steps as they are done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Wait for all applications to
exit before lamexec exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Export the specified
environment variables to the remote nodes before executing
the program. Existing environment variables can be specified
(see the Examples section, <br>
below), or new variable names specified with corresponding
values. The parser for the -x option is not very
sophisticated; it does not even understand quoted values.
<br>
Users are advised to set variables in the environment, and
then use -x to export (not define) them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where A set of node and/or CPU
identifiers indicating where to start</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- args Pass these runtime
arguments to every new process. This must always be the last
argument to lamexec. This option is not valid on the command
line if an application <br>
schema is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
lamexec is essentially a clone of the mpirun(1), but is
intended for non-MPI programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One invocation of lamexec starts
a non-MPI application running under LAM. To start the same
program on all LAM nodes, the application can be specified
on the lamexec command <br>
line. To start multiple applications on the LAM nodes, an
application schema is required in a separate file. See
appschema(5) for a description of the application schema
syn&acirc; <br>
tax, but it essentially contains multiple lamexec command
lines, less the command name itself. The ability to specify
different options for different instantiations of a program
<br>
is another reason to use an application schema.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Location Nomenclature <br>
The location nomenclature that is used for the where clause
mention in the SYNOPSIS section, above, is identical to
mpirun(1)&rsquo;s nomenclature. See the mpirun(1) man page
for a <br>
lengthy discussion of the location nomenclature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the by-CPU syntax,
while valid for lamexec, is not quite as meaningful because
process rank ordering in MPI_COMM_WORLD is irrelevant. As
such, the by-node nomenclature <br>
is typically the preferred syntax for lamexec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Application Schema or Executable
Program? <br>
To distinguish the two different forms, lamexec looks on the
command line for nodes or the -c option. If neither is
specified, then the file named on the command line is
assumed <br>
to be an application schema. If either one or both are
specified, then the file is assumed to be an executable
program. If nodes and -c both are specified, then copies of
the <br>
program are started on the specified nodes according to an
internal LAM scheduling policy. Specifying just one node
effectively forces LAM to run all copies of the program in
<br>
one place. If -c is given, but not nodes, then all LAM nodes
are used. If nodes is given, but not -c, then one copy of
the program is run on each node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Program Transfer <br>
By default, LAM searches for executable programs on the
target node where a particular instantiation will run. If
the file system is not shared, the target nodes are
homoge&acirc; <br>
neous, and the program is frequently recompiled, it can be
convenient to have LAM transfer the program from a source
node (usually the local node) to each target node. The -s
<br>
option specifies this behavior and identifies the single
source node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Locating Files <br>
LAM looks for an executable program by searching the
directories in the user&rsquo;s PATH environment variable as
defined on the source node(s). This behavior is consistent
with log&acirc; <br>
ging into the source node and executing the program from the
shell. On remote nodes, the &quot;.&quot; path is the home
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LAM looks for an application
schema in three directories: the local directory, the value
of the LAMAPPLDIR environment variable, and
laminstalldir/boot, where &quot;laminstalldir&quot; is <br>
the directory where LAM/MPI was installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard I/O <br>
LAM directs UNIX standard input to /dev/null on all remote
nodes. On the local node that invoked lamexec, standard
input is inherited from lamexec. The default is what used to
<br>
be the -w option to prevent conflicting access to the
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LAM directs UNIX standard output
and error to the LAM daemon on all remote nodes. LAM ships
all captured output/error to the node that invoked lamexec
and prints it on the stan&acirc; <br>
dard output/error of lamexec. Local processes inherit the
standard output/error of lamexec and transfer to it
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus it is possible to redirect
standard I/O for LAM applications by using the typical shell
redirection procedure on lamexec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% lamexec N my_app my_input
my_output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -f option avoids all the
setup required to support standard I/O described above.
Remote processes are completely directed to /dev/null and
local processes inherit file de&acirc; <br>
scriptors from lamboot(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pseudo-tty support <br>
The -pty option enabled pseudo-tty support for process
output. This allows, among other things, for line buffered
output from remote nodes (which is probably what you
want).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is not currently the
default for lamexec because it has not been thoroughly
tested on a variety of different Unixes. Users are
encouraged to use -pty and report any <br>
problems back to the LAM Team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Current Working Directory <br>
The current working directory for new processes created on
the local node is inherited from lamexec. The current
working directory for new processes created on remote nodes
is <br>
the remote user&rsquo;s home directory. This default
behavior is overridden by the -D option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -D option will change the
current working directory of new processes to the directory
where the executable resides before the new user&rsquo;s
program is invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alternative to the -D option
is the -wd option. -wd allows the user to specify an
arbitrary current working directory (vs. the location of the
executable). Note that the -wd <br>
option can be used in application schema files (see
appschema(5)) as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Process Environment <br>
Processes in the application inherit their environment from
the LAM daemon upon the node on which they are running. The
environment of a LAM daemon is fixed upon booting of the
<br>
LAM with lamboot(1) and is inherited from the user&rsquo;s
shell. On the origin node this will be the shell from which
lamboot(1) was invoked and on remote nodes this will be the
<br>
shell started by rsh(1). When running dynamically linked
applications which require the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable to be set, care must be taken to ensure that it is
<br>
correctly set when booting the LAM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exported Environment Variables
<br>
The -x option to lamexec can be used to export specific
environment variables to the new processes. While the syntax
of the -x option allows the definition of new variables,
<br>
note that the parser for this option is currently not very
sophisticated - it does not even understand quoted values.
Users are advised to set variables in the environment and
<br>
use -x to export them; not to define them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
lamexec N prog1 <br>
Load and execute prog1 on all nodes. Search for the
executable file on each node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lamexec -c 8 prog1 <br>
Run 8 copies of prog1 wherever LAM wants to run them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lamexec n8-10 -v -nw -s n3 prog1
-- -q <br>
Load and execute prog1 on nodes 8, 9, and 10. Search for
prog1 on node 3 and transfer it to the three target nodes.
Report as each process is created. Give &quot;-q&quot; as a
com&acirc; <br>
mand line to each new process. Do not wait for the processes
to complete before exiting lamexec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lamexec -v myapp <br>
Parse the application schema, myapp, and start all processes
specified in it. Report as each process is created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lamexec N N -pty -wd
/workstuff/output -x DISPLAY run_app.csh <br>
Run the application &quot;run_app.csh&quot; (assumedly a C
shell script) twice on each node in the system (ideal for
2-way SMPs). Also enable pseudo-tty support, change
directory to <br>
/workstuff/output, and export the DISPLAY variable to the
new processes (perhaps the shell script will invoke an X
application such as xv to display output).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lamexec -np 5 -D
&lsquo;pwd&lsquo;/my_application <br>
A common usage of lamexec in environments where a filesystem
is shared between all nodes in the multicomputer, using the
shell-escaped &quot;pwd&quot; command specifies the full
name <br>
of the executable to run. This prevents the need for putting
the directory in the path; the remote notes will have an
absolute filename to execute (and change directory to <br>
it upon invocation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
lamexec: Exec format error <br>
A non-ASCII character was detected in the application
schema. This is usually a command line usage error where
lamexec is expecting an application schema and an executable
<br>
file was given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lamexec: syntax error in
application schema, line XXX <br>
The application schema cannot be parsed because of a usage
or syntax error on the given line in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename: No such file or
directory <br>
This error can occur in two cases. Either the named file
cannot be located or it has been found but the user does not
have sufficient permissions to execute the program or <br>
read the application schema.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUE <br>
lamexec returns 0 if all processes started by lamexec exit
normally. A non-zero value is returned if an internal error
occurred in lamexec, or one or more processes exited
ab&acirc; <br>
normally. If an internal error occurred in lamexec, the
corresponding error code is returned. In the event that one
or more processes exit with non-zero exit code, the return
<br>
value of the process that lamexec first notices died
abnormally will be returned. Note that, in general, this
will be the first process that died but is not guaranteed to
be so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, note that if the -nw
switch is used, the return value from lamexec does not
indicate the exit status of the processes started by it.</p>
