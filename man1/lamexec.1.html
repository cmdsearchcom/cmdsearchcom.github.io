<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<i>lamexec</i> is essentially a clone of the <i>mpirun</i>(1), but is intended
  for non-MPI programs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One invocation of <i>lamexec</i> starts a non-MPI application running under LAM.
  To start the same program on all LAM nodes, the application can be specified
  on the <i>lamexec</i> command line. To start multiple applications on the LAM
  nodes, an application schema is required in a separate file. See appschema(5)
  for a description of the application schema syntax, but it essentially
  contains multiple <i>lamexec</i> command lines, less the command name itself.
  The ability to specify different options for different instantiations of a
  program is another reason to use an application schema.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Location_Nomenclature"><a class="selflink" href="#Location_Nomenclature">Location
  Nomenclature</a></h2>
The location nomenclature that is used for the where clause mention in the
  SYNOPSIS section, above, is identical to mpirun(1)'s nomenclature. See the
  mpirun(1) man page for a lengthy discussion of the location nomenclature.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the by-CPU syntax, while valid for <i>lamexec</i>, is not quite as
  meaningful because process rank ordering in MPI_COMM_WORLD is irrelevant. As
  such, the by-node nomenclature is typically the preferred syntax for
  <i>lamexec</i>.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Application_Schema_or_Executable_Program?"><a class="selflink" href="#Application_Schema_or_Executable_Program?">Application
  Schema or Executable Program?</a></h2>
To distinguish the two different forms, <i>lamexec</i> looks on the command line
  for nodes or the <i>-c</i> option. If neither is specified, then the file
  named on the command line is assumed to be an application schema. If either
  one or both are specified, then the file is assumed to be an executable
  program. If nodes and <i>-c</i> both are specified, then copies of the program
  are started on the specified nodes according to an internal LAM scheduling
  policy. Specifying just one node effectively forces LAM to run all copies of
  the program in one place. If <i>-c</i> is given, but not nodes, then all LAM
  nodes are used. If nodes is given, but not <i>-c</i>, then one copy of the
  program is run on each node.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Program_Transfer"><a class="selflink" href="#Program_Transfer">Program
  Transfer</a></h2>
By default, LAM searches for executable programs on the target node where a
  particular instantiation will run. If the file system is not shared, the
  target nodes are homogeneous, and the program is frequently recompiled, it can
  be convenient to have LAM transfer the program from a source node (usually the
  local node) to each target node. The <i>-s</i> option specifies this behavior
  and identifies the single source node.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Locating_Files"><a class="selflink" href="#Locating_Files">Locating
  Files</a></h2>
LAM looks for an executable program by searching the directories in the user's
  PATH environment variable as defined on the source node(s). This behavior is
  consistent with logging into the source node and executing the program from
  the shell. On remote nodes, the &quot;.&quot; path is the home directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
LAM looks for an application schema in three directories: the local directory,
  the value of the LAMAPPLDIR environment variable, and laminstalldir/boot,
  where &quot;laminstalldir&quot; is the directory where LAM/MPI was installed.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Standard_I/O"><a class="selflink" href="#Standard_I/O">Standard
  I/O</a></h2>
LAM directs UNIX standard input to /dev/null on all remote nodes. On the local
  node that invoked <i>lamexec</i>, standard input is inherited from
  <i>lamexec</i>. The default is what used to be the -w option to prevent
  conflicting access to the terminal.
<div class="Pp"></div>
LAM directs UNIX standard output and error to the LAM daemon on all remote
  nodes. LAM ships all captured output/error to the node that invoked
  <i>lamexec</i> and prints it on the standard output/error of <i>lamexec</i>.
  Local processes inherit the standard output/error of <i>lamexec</i> and
  transfer to it directly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Thus it is possible to redirect standard I/O for LAM applications by using the
  typical shell redirection procedure on <i>lamexec</i>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">% lamexec N my_app my_input my_output</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>-f</i> option avoids all the setup required to support standard I/O
  described above. Remote processes are completely directed to /dev/null and
  local processes inherit file descriptors from lamboot(1).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Pseudo-tty_support"><a class="selflink" href="#Pseudo-tty_support">Pseudo-tty
  support</a></h2>
The <i>-pty</i> option enabled pseudo-tty support for process output. This
  allows, among other things, for line buffered output from remote nodes (which
  is probably what you want).
<div class="Pp"></div>
This option is not currently the default for <i>lamexec</i> because it has not
  been thoroughly tested on a variety of different Unixes. Users are encouraged
  to use <i>-pty</i> and report any problems back to the LAM Team.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Current_Working_Directory"><a class="selflink" href="#Current_Working_Directory">Current
  Working Directory</a></h2>
The current working directory for new processes created on the local node is
  inherited from <i>lamexec</i>. The current working directory for new processes
  created on remote nodes is the remote user's home directory. This default
  behavior is overridden by the <i>-D</i> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>-D</i> option will change the current working directory of new processes
  to the directory where the executable resides before the new user's program is
  invoked.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An alternative to the <i>-D</i> option is the <i>-wd</i> option. <i>-wd</i>
  allows the user to specify an arbitrary current working directory (vs. the
  location of the executable). Note that the <i>-wd</i> option can be used in
  application schema files (see appschema(5)) as well.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Process_Environment"><a class="selflink" href="#Process_Environment">Process
  Environment</a></h2>
Processes in the application inherit their environment from the LAM daemon upon
  the node on which they are running. The environment of a LAM daemon is fixed
  upon booting of the LAM with lamboot(1) and is inherited from the user's
  shell. On the origin node this will be the shell from which lamboot(1) was
  invoked and on remote nodes this will be the shell started by rsh(1). When
  running dynamically linked applications which require the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  environment variable to be set, care must be taken to ensure that it is
  correctly set when booting the LAM.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Exported_Environment_Variables"><a class="selflink" href="#Exported_Environment_Variables">Exported
  Environment Variables</a></h2>
The <i>-x</i> option to <i>lamexec</i> can be used to export specific
  environment variables to the new processes. While the syntax of the <i>-x</i>
  option allows the definition of new variables, note that the parser for this
  option is currently not very sophisticated - it does not even understand
  quoted values. Users are advised to set variables in the environment and use
  <i>-x</i> to export them; not to define them.

<i>lamexec</i> returns 0 if all processes started by <i>lamexec</i> exit
  normally. A non-zero value is returned if an internal error occurred in
  lamexec, or one or more processes exited abnormally. If an internal error
  occurred in lamexec, the corresponding error code is returned. In the event
  that one or more processes exit with non-zero exit code, the return value of
  the process that <i>lamexec</i> first notices died abnormally will be
  returned. Note that, in general, this will be the first process that died but
  is not guaranteed to be so.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, note that if the <i>-nw</i> switch is used, the return value from
  lamexec does not indicate the exit status of the processes started by it.
