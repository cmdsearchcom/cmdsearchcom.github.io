<p>DAR_XFORM(1) General Commands Manual DAR_XFORM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dar_xform - disk archive &quot;re-slicer&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dar_xform [options] [&lt;path&gt;/]source
[&lt;path&gt;/]destination</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dar_xform -h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dar_xform -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dar_xform changes the size of slices of an existing
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Source is the basename of the
existing archive, destination is the basename of the archive
to be created. If source basename is &quot;-&quot;, the
archive is read from standard input. If <br>
the destination basename is &quot;-&quot;, the archive is
written to standard output and -s option is not
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h displays help usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V displays version
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b make the terminal ring when
user interaction is required (like for example the creation
of a new slice when using the -p option)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s &lt;number&gt; Size of the
slices in bytes. If the number is followed by k (or K), M,
G, T or P the size is in kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes,
terabytes or petabytes <br>
respectively. Example: by default &quot;20M&quot; means 20
megabytes it is the same as giving 20971520 as argument (see
also -aSI and -abinary options). If -s is not <br>
present the backup will be written to a single slice
whatever the size of the backup may be (there is probably
some filesystem limitation, thus you might <br>
expect problems with file size over 2 gigabytes, depending
on your filesystem).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S &lt;number&gt; -S gives the
size of the first slice which may be chosen independently of
the size of following slices. This option needs -s and by
default, the size of the <br>
first slice is the same as the one of the following
slices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p [&lt;integer&gt;] pauses
before writing to a new slice (this requires -s). By default
there is no pause, all slices are output in the same
directory, up to the end of the <br>
backup or until the filesystem is full. In this later case,
the user is informed of the lack of disk space and dar stops
for user interaction. As soon as some <br>
disk space is available, the user can continue the backup.
The optional integer that this option can receive tells dar
to only pause very &rsquo;n&rsquo; slice. Giving 3 <br>
for &rsquo;n&rsquo; will make dar pause only after slices 3,
6, 9 and so on. If this integer is not specified, the
behavior is as if &rsquo;1&rsquo; was given as argument
which makes <br>
dar pause after each slice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Do not allow overwriting of
any slice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Do not warn before
overwriting slice. By default (no -n and no -w) overwriting
is allowed but a warning is issued before proceeding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E &lt;string&gt; the string is
a command-line to be launched between the slices of the
destination archive. See dar(1) man page (same option) for
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F &lt;string&gt; the string is
a command-line to be launched between the slices of the
source archive. See dar(1) man page (same option) for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-aSI[-unit[s]] when using k M G
T E Z Y prefixes to define a size, use the SI meaning:
multiple of 10^3 (a Mega is 1,000,000).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-abinary[-unit[s]] when using k
M G T E Z Y prefixes to define a size, use the historical
computer science meaning: multiple of 2^10 (a Mega is
1,048,576).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-aSI and -abinary can be used
several times, they affect all prefix which follow even
those found in file included by -B option up to the next
-a... occurrence. Note that if in a <br>
file included by -B option an -abinary or -aSI is met, it
affects all the following prefix even those outside the
included files (for example in the following &quot;-B
some.dcf -s 1K&quot; <br>
1K may be equal to 1000 or 1024 depending on the presence of
an -aSI or -abinary in the file some.dcf. By default (before
any -aSI/binary argument has been reached), binary <br>
interpretation of suffix is done (for compatibility with
older versions).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Do not display any message on
stderr when not launched from a terminal (for example when
launched from an at job or crontab). Remains that any
question to the <br>
user will be assumed a &rsquo;no&rsquo; answer, which most
of the time will abort the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-^ perm[:user[:group]] <br>
defines the permission and ownership to use for created
slices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-3 &lt;algo&gt; Beside each
created slice is generated an on-fly hash file using the
specified algorithm. Available algorithm are &quot;md5&quot;
and &quot;sha1&quot;, by default no hash file is <br>
generated. This option description is more detailed in dar
man page (where it has the same designation as here).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-9
&lt;src_num&gt;[,&lt;dst_num&gt;] <br>
Defines the minimum number of digit to use for the source
archive and eventually for the destination archive. If the
source has not been defined with a mini&acirc; <br>
mum number of digits and you want to specify a number of
digits for the destination archive, use zero (or one) as
value for src_num. If dst_num is not pro&acirc; <br>
vided, it defaults to 1. See the same option in dar man page
for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Dar_xform is not concerned by encryption or compression. It
does not need to be aware of it to be able to change the
slice scheme. Thus, it is not able to uncompress or uncipher
<br>
an archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODES <br>
dar_xform uses the same exit status as dar does, see dar(1)
man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
Any signal sent to dar_xform will abort the program
immediately, there is no way to have a proper termination
before the end of the process</p>
