<p>PERLCOMMUNITY(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLCOMMUNITY(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlcommunity - a brief overview of the Perl community</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document aims to provide an overview of the vast perl
community, which is far too large and diverse to provide a
detailed listing. If any specific niche has been forgotten,
<br>
it is not meant as an insult but an omission for the sake of
brevity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Perl community is as diverse
as Perl, and there is a large amount of evidence that the
Perl users apply TMTOWTDI to all endeavors, not just
programming. From websites, to <br>
IRC, to mailing lists, there is more than one way to get
involved in the community.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where to Find the Community <br>
There is a central directory for the Perl community:
&lt;http://perl.org&gt; maintained by the Perl Foundation
(&lt;http://www.perlfoundation.org/&gt;), which tracks and
provides services <br>
for a variety of other community sites.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mailing Lists and Newsgroups
<br>
Perl runs on e-mail; there is no doubt about it. The Camel
book was originally written mostly over e-mail and today
Perl&rsquo;s development is co-ordinated through mailing
lists. The <br>
largest repository of Perl mailing lists is located at
&lt;http://lists.perl.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most Perl-related projects set
up mailing lists for both users and contributors. If you
don&rsquo;t see a certain project listed at
&lt;http://lists.perl.org&gt;, check the particular <br>
website for that project. Most mailing lists are archived at
&lt;http://nntp.perl.org/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are also plenty of Perl
related newsgroups located under
&quot;comp.lang.perl.*&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IRC <br>
The Perl community has a rather large IRC presence. For
starters, it has its own IRC network,
&lt;irc://irc.perl.org&gt;. General (not help-oriented) chat
can be found at <br>
&lt;irc://irc.perl.org/#perl&gt;. Many other more specific
chats are also hosted on the network. Information about
irc.perl.org is located on the network&rsquo;s website: <br>
&lt;http://www.irc.perl.org&gt;. For a more help-oriented
#perl, check out &lt;irc://irc.freenode.net/#perl&gt;. Perl
6 development also has a presence in
&lt;irc://irc.freenode.net/#perl6&gt;. <br>
Most Perl-related channels will be kind enough to point you
in the right direction if you ask nicely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any large IRC network (Dalnet,
EFnet) is also likely to have a #perl channel, with varying
activity levels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Websites <br>
Perl websites come in a variety of forms, but they fit into
two large categories: forums and news websites. There are
many Perl-related websites, so only a few of the
community&rsquo;s <br>
largest are mentioned here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">News sites</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;http://perl.com/&gt; <br>
Run by O&rsquo;Reilly Media (the publisher of the Camel
Book, among other Perl-related literature), perl.com
provides current Perl news, articles, and resources for Perl
developers <br>
as well as a directory of other useful websites.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;http://use.perl.org/&gt;
<br>
use Perl; provides a slashdot-style Perl news website
covering all things Perl, from minutes of the meetings of
the Perl 6 Design team to conference announcements with <br>
(ir)relevant discussion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forums</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;http://www.perlmonks.org/&gt;
<br>
PerlMonks is one of the largest Perl forums, and describes
itself as &quot;A place for individuals to polish, improve,
and showcase their Perl skills.&quot; and &quot;A community
which <br>
allows everyone to grow and learn from each other.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User Groups <br>
Many cities around the world have local Perl Mongers
chapters. A Perl Mongers chapter is a local user group which
typically holds regular in-person meetings, both social and
<br>
technical; helps organize local conferences, workshops, and
hackathons; and provides a mailing list or other continual
contact method for its members to keep in touch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To find your local Perl Mongers
(or PM as they&rsquo;re commonly abbreviated) group check
the international Perl Mongers directory at
&lt;http://www.pm.org/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Workshops <br>
Perl workshops are, as the name might suggest, workshops
where Perl is taught in a variety of ways. At the workshops,
subjects range from a beginner&rsquo;s introduction (such as
the <br>
Pittsburgh Perl Workshop&rsquo;s &quot;Zero To Perl&quot;)
to much more advanced subjects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several great
resources for locating workshops: the websites mentioned
above, the calendar mentioned below, and the YAPC Europe
website, &lt;http://www.yapceurope.org/&gt;, <br>
which is probably the best resource for European Perl
events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hackathons <br>
Hackathons are a very different kind of gathering where Perl
hackers gather to do just that, hack nonstop for an extended
(several day) period on a specific project or projects. <br>
Information about hackathons can be located in the same
place as information about workshops as well as in
&lt;irc://irc.perl.org/#perl&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have never been to a
hackathon, here are a few basic things you need to know
before attending: have a working laptop and know how to use
it; check out the involved <br>
projects beforehand; have the necessary version control
client; and bring backup equipment (an extra LAN cable,
additional power strips, etc.) because someone will
forget.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conventions <br>
Perl has two major annual conventions: The Perl Conference
(now part of OSCON), put on by O&rsquo;Reilly, and Yet
Another Perl Conference or YAPC (pronounced yap-see), which
is <br>
localized into several regional YAPCs (North America,
Europe, Asia) in a stunning grassroots display by the Perl
community. For more information about either conference,
check <br>
out their respective web pages: OSCON
&lt;http://conferences.oreillynet.com/&gt;; YAPC
&lt;http://www.yapc.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A relatively new conference
franchise with a large Perl portion is the Open Source
Developers Conference or OSDC. First held in Australia it
has recently also spread to Israel <br>
and France. More information can be found at:
&lt;http://www.osdc.com.au/&gt; for Australia,
&lt;http://www.osdc.org.il&gt; for Israel, and
&lt;http://www.osdc.fr/&gt; for France.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Calendar of Perl Events <br>
The Perl Review, &lt;http://www.theperlreview.com&gt;
maintains a website and Google calendar
(&lt;http://www.theperlreview.com/community_calendar&gt;)
for tracking workshops, hackathons, <br>
Perl Mongers meetings, and other events. Views of this
calendar are at &lt;http://www.perl.org/events.html&gt; and
&lt;http://www.yapc.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not every event or Perl Mongers
group is on that calendar, so don&rsquo;t lose heart if you
don&rsquo;t see yours posted. To have your event or group
listed, contact brian d foy <br>
(brian@theperlreview.com).</p>
