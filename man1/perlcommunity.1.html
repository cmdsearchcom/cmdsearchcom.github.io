perlcommunity - a brief overview of the Perl community
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document aims to provide an overview of the vast perl community, which is
  far too large and diverse to provide a detailed listing. If any specific niche
  has been forgotten, it is not meant as an insult but an omission for the sake
  of brevity.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Perl community is as diverse as Perl, and there is a large amount of
  evidence that the Perl users apply TMTOWTDI to all endeavors, not just
  programming. From websites, to IRC, to mailing lists, there is more than one
  way to get involved in the community.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Where_to_Find_the_Community"><a class="selflink" href="#Where_to_Find_the_Community">Where
  to Find the Community</a></h2>
There is a central directory for the Perl community: &lt;http://perl.org&gt;
  maintained by the Perl Foundation (&lt;http://www.perlfoundation.org/&gt;),
  which tracks and provides services for a variety of other community sites.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Mailing_Lists_and_Newsgroups"><a class="selflink" href="#Mailing_Lists_and_Newsgroups">Mailing
  Lists and Newsgroups</a></h2>
Perl runs on e-mail; there is no doubt about it. The Camel book was originally
  written mostly over e-mail and today Perl's development is co-ordinated
  through mailing lists. The largest repository of Perl mailing lists is located
  at &lt;http://lists.perl.org&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most Perl-related projects set up mailing lists for both users and contributors.
  If you don't see a certain project listed at &lt;http://lists.perl.org&gt;,
  check the particular website for that project. Most mailing lists are archived
  at &lt;http://nntp.perl.org/&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are also plenty of Perl related newsgroups located under
  &quot;comp.lang.perl.*&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="IRC"><a class="selflink" href="#IRC">IRC</a></h2>
The Perl community has a rather large IRC presence. For starters, it has its own
  IRC network, &lt;irc://irc.perl.org&gt;. General (not help-oriented) chat can
  be found at &lt;irc://irc.perl.org/#perl&gt;. Many other more specific chats
  are also hosted on the network. Information about irc.perl.org is located on
  the network's website: &lt;http://www.irc.perl.org&gt;. For a more
  help-oriented #perl, check out &lt;irc://irc.freenode.net/#perl&gt;. Perl 6
  development also has a presence in &lt;irc://irc.freenode.net/#perl6&gt;. Most
  Perl-related channels will be kind enough to point you in the right direction
  if you ask nicely.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any large IRC network (Dalnet, EFnet) is also likely to have a #perl channel,
  with varying activity levels.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Websites"><a class="selflink" href="#Websites">Websites</a></h2>
Perl websites come in a variety of forms, but they fit into two large
  categories: forums and news websites. There are many Perl-related websites, so
  only a few of the community's largest are mentioned here.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>News sites</i>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&lt;http://perl.com/&gt;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Run by O'Reilly Media (the publisher of the Camel Book,
      among other Perl-related literature), perl.com provides current Perl news,
      articles, and resources for Perl developers as well as a directory of
      other useful websites.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&lt;http://use.perl.org/&gt;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">use Perl; provides a slashdot-style Perl news website
      covering all things Perl, from minutes of the meetings of the Perl 6
      Design team to conference announcements with (ir)relevant discussion.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Forums</i>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&lt;http://www.perlmonks.org/&gt;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">PerlMonks is one of the largest Perl forums, and describes
      itself as &quot;A place for individuals to polish, improve, and showcase
      their Perl skills.&quot; and &quot;A community which allows everyone to
      grow and learn from each other.&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="User_Groups"><a class="selflink" href="#User_Groups">User
  Groups</a></h2>
Many cities around the world have local Perl Mongers chapters. A Perl Mongers
  chapter is a local user group which typically holds regular in-person
  meetings, both social and technical; helps organize local conferences,
  workshops, and hackathons; and provides a mailing list or other continual
  contact method for its members to keep in touch.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To find your local Perl Mongers (or PM as they're commonly abbreviated) group
  check the international Perl Mongers directory at &lt;http://www.pm.org/&gt;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Workshops"><a class="selflink" href="#Workshops">Workshops</a></h2>
Perl workshops are, as the name might suggest, workshops where Perl is taught in
  a variety of ways. At the workshops, subjects range from a beginner's
  introduction (such as the Pittsburgh Perl Workshop's &quot;Zero To Perl&quot;)
  to much more advanced subjects.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are several great resources for locating workshops: the websites mentioned
  above, the calendar mentioned below, and the YAPC Europe website,
  &lt;http://www.yapceurope.org/&gt;, which is probably the best resource for
  European Perl events.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Hackathons"><a class="selflink" href="#Hackathons">Hackathons</a></h2>
Hackathons are a very different kind of gathering where Perl hackers gather to
  do just that, hack nonstop for an extended (several day) period on a specific
  project or projects. Information about hackathons can be located in the same
  place as information about workshops as well as in
  &lt;irc://irc.perl.org/#perl&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have never been to a hackathon, here are a few basic things you need to
  know before attending: have a working laptop and know how to use it; check out
  the involved projects beforehand; have the necessary version control client;
  and bring backup equipment (an extra LAN cable, additional power strips, etc.)
  because someone will forget.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Conventions"><a class="selflink" href="#Conventions">Conventions</a></h2>
Perl has two major annual conventions: The Perl Conference (now part of OSCON),
  put on by O'Reilly, and Yet Another Perl Conference or YAPC (pronounced
  yap-see), which is localized into several regional YAPCs (North America,
  Europe, Asia) in a stunning grassroots display by the Perl community. For more
  information about either conference, check out their respective web pages:
  OSCON &lt;http://conferences.oreillynet.com/&gt;; YAPC
  &lt;http://www.yapc.org&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A relatively new conference franchise with a large Perl portion is the Open
  Source Developers Conference or OSDC. First held in Australia it has recently
  also spread to Israel and France. More information can be found at:
  &lt;http://www.osdc.com.au/&gt; for Australia, &lt;http://www.osdc.org.il&gt;
  for Israel, and &lt;http://www.osdc.fr/&gt; for France.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Calendar_of_Perl_Events"><a class="selflink" href="#Calendar_of_Perl_Events">Calendar
  of Perl Events</a></h2>
The Perl Review, &lt;http://www.theperlreview.com&gt; maintains a website and
  Google calendar (&lt;http://www.theperlreview.com/community_calendar&gt;) for
  tracking workshops, hackathons, Perl Mongers meetings, and other events. Views
  of this calendar are at &lt;http://www.perl.org/events.html&gt; and
  &lt;http://www.yapc.org&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Not every event or Perl Mongers group is on that calendar, so don't lose heart
  if you don't see yours posted. To have your event or group listed, contact
  brian d foy (brian@theperlreview.com).
