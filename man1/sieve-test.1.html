<p>SIEVE-TEST(1) Pigeonhole SIEVE-TEST(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sieve-test - Pigeonhole&rsquo;s Sieve script tester</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sieve-test [options] script-file mail-file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The sieve-test command is part of the Pigeonhole Project
(pigeonhole(7)), which adds Sieve (RFC 5228) support to the
Dovecot secure IMAP and POP3 server (dovecot(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the sieve-test command,
the execution of Sieve scripts can be tested. This evaluates
the script for the provided message, yielding a set of Sieve
actions. Unless the -e <br>
option is specified, it does not actually execute these
actions, meaning that it does not store or forward the
message anywere. In stead, it prints a detailed list of what
<br>
actions would normally take place. Note that, even when -e
is specified, no messages are ever transmitted to remote
SMTP recipients. The outgoing messages are always printed to
<br>
stdout in stead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a very useful tool to
debug the execution of Sieve scripts. It can be used to
verify newly installed scripts for the intended behaviour
and it can provide more detailed <br>
information about script execution problems that are
reported by the Sieve plugin, for example by tracing the
execution and evaluation of commands and tests
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a orig-recipient-address <br>
The original envelope recipient address. This is what
Sieve&rsquo;s envelope test will compare to when the
&quot;to&quot; envelope part is requested. Some tests and
actions will also use <br>
this as the script owner&rsquo;s e-mail address. If this
option is omitted, the recipient address is retrieved from
the &quot;Envelope-To:&quot;, or &quot;To:&quot; message
headers. If none of <br>
these headers is present either, the recipient address
defaults to recipient@example.com.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c config-file <br>
Alternative Dovecot configuration file path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Force compilation. By
default, the compiled binary is stored on disk. When this
binary is found during the next execution of sieve-test and
its modification time is more <br>
recent than the script file, it is used and the script is
not compiled again. This option forces the script to be
compiled, thus ignoring any present binary. Refer to <br>
sievec(1) for more information about Sieve compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Enable Sieve debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d dump-file <br>
Causes a dump of the generated code to be written to the
specified file. This is identical to the dump produced by
sieve-dump(1). Using &rsquo;-&rsquo; as filename causes the
dump to <br>
be written to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Enables true execution of the
set of actions that results from running the script. In
combination with the -l parameter, the actual delivery of
messages can be tested. <br>
Note that this will not transmit any messages to remote SMTP
recipients. Such actions only print the outgoing message to
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f envelope-sender <br>
The envelope sender address (return path). This is what
Sieve&rsquo;s envelope test will compare to when the
&quot;from&quot; envelope part is requested. Also, this is
where response mes&acirc; <br>
sages are &rsquo;sent&rsquo; to. If this option is omitted,
the sender address is retrieved from the
&quot;Return-Path:&quot;, &quot;Sender:&quot; or
&quot;From:&quot; message headers. If none of these headers
is <br>
present either, the sender envelope address defaults to
sender@example.com.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l mail-location <br>
The location of the user&rsquo;s mail store. The syntax of
this option&rsquo;s mail-location parameter is identical to
what is used for the mail_location setting in the Dovecot
config <br>
file. This parameter is typically used in combination with
-e to test the actual delivery of messages. If -l is omitted
when -e is specified, mail store actions like <br>
fileinto and keep are skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m default-mailbox <br>
The mailbox where the keep action stores the message. This
is &quot;INBOX&quot; by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r recipient-address <br>
The final envelope recipient address. Some tests and actions
will use this as the script owner&rsquo;s e-mail address.
For example, this is what is used by the vacation action
<br>
to check whether a reply is appropriate. If the -r option is
omitted, the orignal envelope recipient address will be used
in stead (see -a option for more info).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s script-file <br>
Specify additional scripts to be executed before the main
script. Multiple -s arguments are allowed and the specified
scripts are executed sequentially in the order speci&acirc;
<br>
fied at the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t trace-file <br>
Enables runtime trace debugging. Trace debugging provides
detailed insight in the operations performed by the Sieve
script. Refer to the runtime trace debugging section <br>
below. The trace information is written to the specified
file. Using &rsquo;-&rsquo; as filename causes the trace
data to be written to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T trace-option <br>
Configures runtime trace debugging, which is enabled with
the -t option. Refer to the runtime trace debugging section
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x extensions <br>
Set the available extensions. The parameter is a
space-separated list of the active extensions. By prepending
the extension identifiers with + or -, extensions can be
<br>
included or excluded relative to the configured set of
active extensions. If no extensions have a + or - prefix,
only those extensions that are explicitly listed will be
<br>
enabled. Unknown extensions are ignored and a warning is
produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example -x &quot;+imapflags
-enotify&quot; will enable the deprecated imapflags
extension and disable the enotify extension. The rest of the
active extensions depends on the <br>
sieve_extensions and sieve_global_extensions settings. By
default, i.e. when sieve_extensions and
sieve_global_extensions remain unconfigured, all supported
extensions <br>
are available, except for deprecated extensions or those
that are still under development.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
script-file <br>
Specifies the script to (compile and) execute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this tool looks for a
pre-compiled binary file with a .svbin extension and with
basename and path identical to the specified script. Use the
-C option to disable <br>
this behavior by forcing the script to be compiled into a
new binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mail-file <br>
Specifies the file containing the e-mail message to test
with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
RUNTIME TRACE DEBUGGING <br>
Using the -t option, the sieve-test tool can be configured
to print detailed trace information on the Sieve script
execution to a file or standard output. For example, the
<br>
encountered commands, the performed tests and the matched
values can be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The runtime trace can be
configured using the -T option, which can be specified
multiple times. It can be used as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Tlevel=... <br>
Set the detail level of the trace debugging. One of the
following values can be supplied:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">actions (default) <br>
Only print executed action commands, like keep, fileinto,
reject and redirect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">commands <br>
Print any executed command, excluding test commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tests <br>
Print all executed commands and performed tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">matching <br>
Print all executed commands, performed tests and the values
matched in those tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Tdebug <br>
Print debug messages as well. This is usually only useful
for developers and is likely to produce messy output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Taddresses <br>
Print byte code addresses for the current trace output.
Normally, only the current Sieve source code position (line
number) is printed. The byte code addresses are equal to
<br>
those listed in a binary dump produced using the -d option
or by the sieve-dump(1) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUG SIEVE EXTENSION <br>
To improve script debugging, this Sieve implementation
supports a custom Sieve language extension called
&rsquo;vnd.dovecot.debug&rsquo;. It adds the debug_log
command that allows logging <br>
debug messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require
&quot;vnd.dovecot.debug&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if header :contains
&quot;subject&quot; &quot;hello&quot; {</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug_log &quot;Subject header
contains hello!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tools such as sieve-test, sievec
and sieve-dump have support for the vnd.dovecot.debug
extension enabled by default and it is not necessary to
enable nor possible to disable the <br>
availability of the debug extension with the -x option. The
logged messages are written to stdout in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In contrast, for the actual
Sieve plugin for the Dovecot LDA (dovecot-lda(1)) the
vnd.dovecot.debug extension needs to be enabled explicitly
using the sieve_extensions setting. <br>
The messages are then logged to the user&rsquo;s private
script log file. If used in a global script, the messages
are logged through the default Dovecot logging facility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
sieve-test will exit with one of the following values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Execution was successful.
(EX_OK, EXIT_SUCCESS)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Operation failed. This is
returned for almost all failures. (EXIT_FAILURE)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">64 Invalid parameter given.
(EX_USAGE)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf <br>
Dovecot&rsquo;s main configuration file.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/dovecot/conf.d/90-sieve.conf
<br>
Sieve interpreter settings (included from Dovecot&rsquo;s
main configuration file)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORTING BUGS <br>
Report bugs, including doveconf -n output, to the Dovecot
Mailing List &lt;dovecot@dovecot.org&gt;. Information about
reporting Dovecot and Pigeonhole bugs is available at: <br>
