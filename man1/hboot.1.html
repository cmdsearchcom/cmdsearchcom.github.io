<p>HBOOT(1) LAM TOOLS HBOOT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hboot - Start LAM on the local node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
hboot [-dhstvNV] [-c conf] [-I inet_topo] [-R rtr_topo]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d Turn on debugging. This implies -v.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print the command help
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Close stdio of child
processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Terminate (tkill(1)) any
previous LAM session before starting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Be verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Go through the motions but do
not actually take any action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Format and print the process
schema.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c conf Use conf as the process
schema.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I inet_topo Set the $inet_topo
variable in the process schema.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R rtr_topo Set the $rtr_topo
variable in the process schema.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Most MPI users will probably not need to use the hboot
command; see lamboot(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hboot tool can be understood
as a generic utility that starts multiple processes on the
local node, based on information in a process schema. It is
not restricted to start&acirc; <br>
ing LAM. It is part of the startup sequence preformed by
lamboot(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A process schema is a
description of the processes which constitute the operating
system on a given node. Naturally, the process schema used
by hboot should be the one that de&acirc; <br>
scribes LAM on a node. The grammar of the process schema is
described in conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When starting LAM on a remote
machine using rsh(1), the open file descriptors of the
processes started by hboot must be closed in order for
rsh(1) to exit. This is done by using <br>
the -s option. The -t option can be used to force a tkill(1)
on the machine before attempting to start LAM. This feature
is used by lamboot(1) to handle the case where a user <br>
might start a machine a second time without using lamwipe(1)
to terminate the previous LAM session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -I and -R options set their
respective variables to the given values. The $inet_topo
variable is typically used by the LAM Internet datalinks
that communicate with other <br>
nodes. The $rtr_topo variable is passed to the LAM router
that handles network and topology information. The variables
can also be set in the process schema file (see conf(5))
<br>
but their values are overridden by the command line
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When LAM is started, the kernel
records all processes that attach to it, including all the
processes in the process schema. It is the job of tkill(1)
to use this information to <br>
remove these processes from the node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
hboot -v <br>
Start LAM on the local node with the default process schema.
Report about every step as it is done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hboot -c myconfig <br>
Boot the local node with the custom process schema,
myconfig.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
laminstalldir/etc/lam-conf.lamd <br>
default node process schema, where &quot;laminstalldir&quot;
is the directory where LAM/MPI was installed</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">laminstalldir/etc/lam7.1.4helpfile
<br>
Default location for help file for diagnostic messages that
hboot may generate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/tmp/lam-$USER@hostname kill
file for the LAM session on machine hostname, where $USER is
the userid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Using ps(1) after hboot will display, among others, the LAM
processes that have been started. They may be killed one by
one with kill(1), or all at once by killing the LAM
ker&acirc; <br>
nel process with a HUP signal. The preferred method is to
use the LAM tool tkill(1) which should kill them all at
once, and also remove the kill file. New users should make
<br>
liberal use of ps(1) to gain confidence that the system is
working properly. In a disaster, ps(1) and kill(1) are your
only hope of recovery.</p>
