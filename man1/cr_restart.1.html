<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cr_restart - restarts a process, process group, or session
from a checkpoint file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cr_restart [options] [checkpoint_file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cr_restart restarts a process (or set of processes) from a
checkpoint file created with cr_checkpoint(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A restarted process has all of
the attributes they had at checkpoint time, including its
process id. If any needed resources cannot be attained for
the processes in a checkpoint <br>
file (ex: a pid is in use), cr_restart will fail. If a
process group or session is restarted, all parent/child
relations and pipes, etc., between the processes in the
checkpoint <br>
will be correctly restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the stdin/stdout/stderr of
any restarted process was directed to a terminal at
checkpoint time, it is redirected to the controlling
terminal of the cr_restart program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current working directory of
a restarted process is the same as when it was checkpointed,
regardless of where the context file is located, or where
cr_restart is invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The cr_restart process becomes
the parent of the &rsquo;eldest&rsquo; process in any
restarted job. This means that getppid(2) may return a
different value to the eldest process after <br>
restart. When the eldest restarted process exits (or dies
from a signal), cr_restart will exit with the same error
code (or kill itself with the same signal), so it is largely
<br>
invisible (it is necessary to keep cr_restart
&lsquo;in-between&rsquo; your shell and restarted processes,
however, as most Unix shells get quite confused if they
observe their children <br>
changing process ids).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Signals <br>
By default restarted processes begin to run after the
restart is complete. Alternatively, you may specify that
they be stopped (via --stop), or terminated/aborted/killed
(via <br>
--term, --abort, or --kill). This is done by sending the
appropriate signal to every process that is part of the
restart. If the processes were stopped at the time the
check&acirc; <br>
point was requested, then --cont may be used to send SIGCONT
to all processes after the restart is completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Error handling <br>
By default cr_restart will block until the restarted process
has completed, and will exit with the same exit value as the
restarted process (even if the restarted process died <br>
with a fatal signal). This can make it nearly impossible to
determine if a non-zero exit from cr_restart is due to a
failure to restart, or is the exit code of a correctly <br>
restarted process. The simple approach of looking for
&rsquo;Restart failed:&rsquo; is not reliable. Therefore,
the --run-on-* family of flags are available to supply
alternative (or sup&acirc; <br>
plementary) error handling. When any of the --run-on-* flags
is passed, a hook is installed for the given category of
failure (or success), as defined below. When an error (or
<br>
success) is detected and a corresponding hook is installed,
the hook is run via the system(3) function. If the exit code
of the hook is non-zero, then cr_restart returns this <br>
value, suppressing any error message that would otherwise be
generated. If no hook is installed, the hook is an empty
string, or if the hook returns an exit code of zero, then
<br>
an explanatory error message is printed and an exit code
related to the errno value at the time of failure is
returned.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--run-on-success=&rsquo;cmd&rsquo;
<br>
Runs the given command as soon as the restarted process(es)
are known to be running. If the return value of
&rsquo;cmd&rsquo; is non-zero, this also results in
cr_restart terminating <br>
without waiting on termination of the restarted
process(es).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--run-on-fail-args=&rsquo;cmd&rsquo;
<br>
Runs the given command if the arguments are invalid. This
includes the case in which the given context file is missing
or unreadable.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--run-on-fail-temp=&rsquo;cmd&rsquo;
<br>
Runs the given command if a &quot;temporary&quot; failure is
detected. This includes the case of a required pid being in
use.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--run-on-fail-perm=&rsquo;cmd&rsquo;
<br>
Runs the given command if a &quot;permanent&quot; failure is
detected. This is most commonly due to a corrupted context
file.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--run-on-fail-env=&rsquo;cmd&rsquo;
<br>
Runs the given command if an &quot;environmental&quot;
failure is detected. This includes when files required for
restarting are missing or inaccessible.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--run-on-failure=&rsquo;cmd&rsquo;
<br>
This installs the given command for all of the
--run-on-fail-* hooks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File relocation <br>
By default, files and directories are saved &lsquo;by
reference&rsquo;, storing their full pathname in the context
file. This includes files associated with a process via
open(2) and/or <br>
mmap(2) and directories associated via opendir(3) or as the
current working directory. Use of --relocate oldpath=newpath
allows remapping of such paths to new locations at <br>
restart-time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When parsing the --relocate
argument the sequences &lsquo;=&rsquo; and &lsquo;\&rsquo;
are interpreted as &lsquo;=&rsquo; and &lsquo;&acute;,
respectively, to allow for paths that contain the
&lsquo;=&rsquo; character. The &lsquo;&acute; charac&acirc;
<br>
ter is not special in any other context. (Note that command
shells also have special treatment of &lsquo;&acute; and you
may therefore need quotes or additional &lsquo;&acute;
characters to pass the <br>
argument you intend.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When file or directory
associations are restored, the oldpath is compared to the
saved fullpath of each file or directory. If it matches the
leading components of the path, the <br>
matching portion is replaced by the value of newpath. Note
that oldpath must match entire path components, and only
leading components. Therefore an oldpath of /tmp/foo will
<br>
match /tmp/foo or /tmp/foo/1, but will not match to
/tmp/fooz (not matching the full component fooz) or to
/var/tmp/foo (not matching the leading component /var.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important to be aware the
the saved fullpaths in a context file are the canonical
paths. Therefore the oldpath you provide must also be a
canonical path, though the new&acirc; <br>
path doesn&rsquo;t need to be. For instance, if /tmp is a
symbolic link to /var/tmp, then if your application opens
the file /tmp/work/1234 the path stored in the context file
will be <br>
/var/tmp/work/1234. Therefore, <br>
--relocate /tmp/work=/tmp/play <br>
would not work as desired, but either of the following
would: <br>
--relocate /var/tmp/work=/tmp/play <br>
--relocate /var/tmp/work=/var/tmp/play</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the --relocate option is
passed multiple times, all are applied to restored file or
directory associations, but only the first match is applied
to any given path. Currently a <br>
maximum of 16 relocations is supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PID and related identifiers <br>
By default, processes are restarted with the same pid and
thread id (as returned by getpid(2), and gettid(2)
respectively). This default ensures that processes and
threads that <br>
signal each other and processes that wait on children will
continue to function correctly. However, this prevents
restarting concurrent instances of the same context
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the process group
and session (as returned by getpgrp(2), and getsid(2)) are
set to those of the cr_restart program. This ensures that
job control via the <br>
requester&rsquo;s session leader (typically a login shell)
will continue to function correctly. However, this
interferes with any job control or process group signaling
that may be <br>
take place among the restarted processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are options to
individually control whether the pid, process group and
session are restored to their saved values or assume new
values (the process group and session inher&acirc; <br>
ited from cr_restart and a fresh pid obtained from fork(2)).
There is no separate control for the thread ids, as they
must always follow the same policy as the pid. The
follow&acirc; <br>
ing describes each option, along with outlining some of the
risks associated with the non-default ones:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--restore-pid <br>
(default) This causes pid and thread ids to be restored to
their saved values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-restore-pid <br>
This causes pid and thread ids to assume new values. Any
multi-threaded process has the possibility of using
functions like tkill(2) which will not behave as desired if
<br>
the thread ids are not restored. Similarly, any
multi-process application may make use of kill(2) or
waitpid(2), among others, that require restored pids for
correct <br>
operation. It is also worth noting that many versions of
glibc will cache the result of getpid(), which may result in
calls after restore returning the original value, <br>
even though the pid was changed by the restart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--restore-pgid <br>
This causes the process group ids to be restored to their
saved values. This is required for correct operation of any
multi-process application that may perform signal or <br>
wait operations on process groups (as by passing a negative
pid value to kill(2) or waitpid(2), among others), or which
uses process groups for POSIX job control opera&acirc; <br>
tions. This is NOT the default behavior because restoring
the process group ids will prevent job control by the
requester&rsquo;s shell (or other controlling process).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-restore-pgid <br>
(default) This causes the restarted processes to join the
process group of the cr_restart process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--restore-sid <br>
This causes the session ids to be restored to their saved
values. This is required, for instance, for systems that are
performing batch accounting based on the session <br>
id.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-restore-sid <br>
(default) This causes the restarted processes to join the
session of the cr_restart process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that use of --restore-pgid
or --restore-sid will produce an error in the case that the
required identifiers are in use in the system. This includes
the possibility that <br>
they conflict the the process group or session of
cr_restart.</p>
