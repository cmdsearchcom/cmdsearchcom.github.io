<p>JNOISEMETER(1) General Commands Manual
JNOISEMETER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
jnoisemeter - Jnoisemeter is a small app which measure audio
test signals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
jnoisemeter [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents briefly the jnoisemeter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manual page was written for
the Debian distribution because the original program does
not have a manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jnoisemeter is a small app
designed to measure audio test signals and in particular
noise signals through Jack Audio Connection Kit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The simplest use is to measure
the S/N ratio of your sound card. If you can calibrate the
input levels of your soundcard it can also be used (with
some external hardware) to mea&acirc; <br>
sure noise levels of any type of audio equipment, including
preamps and microphones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jnoisemeter has the following
filters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FLAT <br>
No filtering at all, the signal is passed directly <br>
to the detector.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">20KHZ <br>
This is 4th order Chebyshev lowpass filter having <br>
a noise bandwidth of exactly 20 kHz. This means <br>
that if the input signal is white noise, the RMS <br>
output level is the same as for a &rsquo;perfect&rsquo; 20
kHz <br>
lowpass filter. This is the normal filter to use for <br>
&rsquo;unweighted&rsquo; measurements, as any noise
measurement <br>
should always use a well-defined bandwidth. <br>
Future version may use a higher order filter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IEC A and C <br>
The well-known standard noise weighting filters used <br>
to obtain dB(A) and dB(C) measurements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ITU-R468 <br>
This is a filter optimised for measuring low-level <br>
background noise. It rises 6 dB/oct at low frequencies, <br>
has a peak of around +12 dB at 6.3 kHz, and falls off <br>
radiply after that. It should be used together with the <br>
ITU-R468 detector described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ITU-R468 (Dolby variant) <br>
This is the same filter as the previous one with around <br>
5.6 dB less gain. See below for why this exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jnoisemeter also provides a DC
blocking filter (first order highpass, 5 Hz). This may be
necessary when using the FLAT and 20KHZ filters, the others
are DC-blocking anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jnoisemeter has three
detectors:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RMS <br>
Root-mean-square (i.e. &rsquo;power&rsquo;) meter. The time
constant <br>
is 125 ms as per IEC standard, or 1 second in slow mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVERAGE <br>
This measures the average of the absolute value. The one
<br>
used in jnoisemeter is actually a VU meter. A 10 times <br>
slower version is also provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ITU-R468 <br>
This is a &rsquo;pseudo-peak&rsquo; detector designed
specifically <br>
to measure noise and S/N ratios. For a peak meter it is <br>
quite slow, as it should be for noise measurements, but <br>
at the same time it is much more sensitive to short <br>
impulsive noise than its speed would suggest. <br>
The original rationale for this was the presence of <br>
impulsive noise (generated by the electromechanical <br>
telephone exchanges of those days) on long analog audio <br>
lines. Today long distance audio lines are all digital, <br>
but a detector such as this one is also ideal to reveal <br>
the typical short noise bursts and &rsquo;crackle&rsquo;
originating <br>
in computers and other digital equipment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All three detectors will show
0.0 dB for a &rsquo;digital full scale&rsquo; sine wave
(i.e. peaking +/- 1.0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ITU-R468 standard</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This uses both the ITU filter
and detector, and is probably the &rsquo;best&rsquo;
standardized way to measure noise. It is used by e.g. the
manufacturers of quality microphones, in particu&acirc; <br>
lar the European ones. It produces a result that is on
average about 10 dB higher than an A-weighted RMS
measurement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a
&rsquo;variation&rsquo; of this standard called
&rsquo;ITU-ARM&rsquo;. This was devised by Dolby Inc. at the
time they were selling noise reduction technology for
magnetic tape recorders. The <br>
traditional A-weighted measurements would show very little
S/N ratio improvement when using Dolby-B. For this reason
Dolby wanted to adopt the ITU-R468 method (which shows the
<br>
difference quite clearly) but without the apparent 10 dB
loss in S/N ratio as this was deemed bad for marketing. The
solution adopted was to lower the gain of the filter, and
use <br>
an average detector instead of the pseudo-peak one. Despite
the &rsquo;ITU-ARM&rsquo; name this is not an official
standard, and not approved by the ITU.</p>
