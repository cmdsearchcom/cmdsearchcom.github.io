This manual page documents briefly the <b>jnoisemeter</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original
  program does not have a manual page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>jnoisemeter</b> is a small app designed to measure audio test signals and in
  particular noise signals through Jack Audio Connection Kit.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The simplest use is to measure the S/N ratio of your sound card. If you can
  calibrate the input levels of your soundcard it can also be used (with some
  external hardware) to measure noise levels of any type of audio equipment,
  including preamps and microphones.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>jnoisemeter</b> has the following filters:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>&#x00A0;FLAT</b>
<br/>
 No filtering at all, the signal is passed directly
<br/>
 to the detector.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>&#x00A0;20KHZ</b>
<br/>
 This is 4th order Chebyshev lowpass filter having
<br/>
 a noise bandwidth of exactly 20 kHz. This means
<br/>
 that if the input signal is white noise, the RMS
<br/>
 output level is the same as for a 'perfect' 20 kHz
<br/>
 lowpass filter. This is the normal filter to use for
<br/>
 'unweighted' measurements, as any noise measurement
<br/>
 should always use a well-defined bandwidth.
<br/>
 Future version may use a higher order filter.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>&#x00A0;IEC A and C</b>
<br/>
 The well-known standard noise weighting filters used
<br/>
 to obtain dB(A) and dB(C) measurements.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>&#x00A0;ITU-R468</b>
<br/>
 This is a filter optimised for measuring low-level
<br/>
 background noise. It rises 6 dB/oct at low frequencies,
<br/>
 has a peak of around +12 dB at 6.3 kHz, and falls off
<br/>
 radiply after that. It should be used together with the
<br/>
 ITU-R468 detector described below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>&#x00A0;ITU-R468 (Dolby variant)</b>
<br/>
 This is the same filter as the previous one with around
<br/>
 5.6 dB less gain. See below for why this exists.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>jnoisemeter</b> also provides a DC blocking filter (first order highpass, 5
  Hz). This may be necessary when using the FLAT and 20KHZ filters, the others
  are DC-blocking anyway.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>jnoisemeter</b> has three detectors:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>&#x00A0;RMS</b>
<br/>
 Root-mean-square (i.e. 'power') meter. The time constant
<br/>
 is 125 ms as per IEC standard, or 1 second in slow mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>&#x00A0;AVERAGE</b>
<br/>
 This measures the average of the absolute value. The one
<br/>
 used in jnoisemeter is actually a VU meter. A 10 times
<br/>
 slower version is also provided.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>&#x00A0;ITU-R468</b>
<br/>
 This is a 'pseudo-peak' detector designed specifically
<br/>
 to measure noise and S/N ratios. For a peak meter it is
<br/>
 quite slow, as it should be for noise measurements, but
<br/>
 at the same time it is much more sensitive to short
<br/>
 impulsive noise than its speed would suggest.
<br/>
 The original rationale for this was the presence of
<br/>
 impulsive noise (generated by the electromechanical
<br/>
 telephone exchanges of those days) on long analog audio
<br/>
 lines. Today long distance audio lines are all digital,
<br/>
 but a detector such as this one is also ideal to reveal
<br/>
 the typical short noise bursts and 'crackle' originating
<br/>
 in computers and other digital equipment.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All three detectors will show 0.0 dB for a 'digital full scale' sine wave (i.e.
  peaking +/- 1.0).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>The ITU-R468 standard</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This uses both the ITU filter and detector, and is probably the 'best'
  standardized way to measure noise. It is used by e.g. the manufacturers of
  quality microphones, in particular the European ones. It produces a result
  that is on average about 10 dB higher than an A-weighted RMS measurement.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is a 'variation' of this standard called 'ITU-ARM'. This was devised by
  Dolby Inc. at the time they were selling noise reduction technology for
  magnetic tape recorders. The traditional A-weighted measurements would show
  very little S/N ratio improvement when using Dolby-B. For this reason Dolby
  wanted to adopt the ITU-R468 method (which shows the difference quite clearly)
  but without the apparent 10 dB loss in S/N ratio as this was deemed bad for
  marketing. The solution adopted was to lower the gain of the filter, and use
  an average detector instead of the pseudo-peak one. Despite the 'ITU-ARM' name
  this is not an official standard, and not approved by the ITU.
