<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pbmclean - despeckle a PBM image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pbmclean [-minneighbors=N] [-black|-white] [-extended]
[pbmfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTION USAGE <br>
You can use the minimum unique abbreviation of the options.
You can use two hyphens instead of one. You can separate an
option name from its value with white space instead of <br>
an equals sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbmclean cleans up a PBM image
of random specks. It reads a PBM image as input and outputs
a PBM that is the same as the input except with isolated
pixels inverted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use pbmclean to clean up
&rsquo;snow&rsquo; on bitmap images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two ways pbmclean can
define &rsquo;isolated&rsquo; pixels: simple and extended.
When you specify -extended, pbmclean uses extended;
otherwise it uses basic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In basic mode, pbmclean looks at
each pixel individually, and any <br>
pixel that doesn&rsquo;t have at least a minimum number of
pixels of the same color touching it is considered isolated
and pbmclean erases it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -minneighbors option
specifies the minimum number of neighboring pixels of the
same color for a pixel not to be considered isolated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if -minneighbors is
two and there are two contiguous black pixels in an
otherwise white field, each of those pixels is isolated, so
pbmclean erases them - turns both <br>
white.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default minimum 1 pixel
&amp;mdash; pbmclean flips only completely isolated
pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(A -minneighbors value greater
than 8 generates a completely inverted image (but use
pnminvert to do that) -- or a completely white or completely
black image with the -black or <br>
-white option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbmclean considers the area
beyond the edges of the image to be white. (This matters
when you consider pixels right on the edge of the
image).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pbmclean does not distinguish
between foreground and background; by default, it flips
isolated pixels of either color. But you can specify -black
or -white to have it flip only <br>
pixels of one color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In extended mode, pbmclean
erases all blobs which don&rsquo;t have the <br>
specified minimum number of pixels. A blob is a set of
contiguous pixels of the foreground color. The minimum
number of pixels is one plus the -minneighbors value. You
specify <br>
the foreground color with -black and -white (default is
black).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if -minneighbors is
2 and the foreground color is black, and the image contains
a straight line 4 pixels long, pbmclean erases that -- turns
all four pixels white. <br>
pbmclean also erases 4 pixels in a square or L-shape.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default -minneighbors is 4,
so a blob must have at least 5 pixels to escape
pbmclean&rsquo;s purge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extended mode was new in Netpbm
10.56 (September 2011).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-black</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-white Flip pixels of the
specified color. By default, if you specify neither -black
nor -white, pbmclean flips both black and white pixels which
do not have sufficient identi&acirc; <br>
cal neighbors. If you specify -black, pbmclean leaves the
white pixels alone and just erases isolated black pixels.
Vice versa for -white. You may specify both -black <br>
and -white to get the same as the default behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-minneighbors=N <br>
This determines how many pixels must be in a cluster in
order for pbmclean to consider them legitimate and not clean
them out of the image. See Description
&acirc;&uml;#description&acirc;&copy; <br>
.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before December 2001, pbmclean
accepted -N instead of -minneighbors. Before Netpbm 10.27
(March 2005), -minneighbors was -minneighbor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-extended <br>
pbmclean uses extended, as opposed to basic, isolated pixel
detection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.56 (September 2011).</p>
