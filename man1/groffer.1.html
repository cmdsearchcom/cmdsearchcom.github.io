<p>GROFFER(1) General Commands Manual GROFFER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
groffer - display groff files and man pages on X and tty</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
groffer [option ...] [--] [filespec ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">groffer -h|--help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">groffer -v|--version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The groffer program is the easiest way to use groff(1). It
can display arbitrary documents written in the groff
language, see groff(7), or other roff languages, see
roff(7), <br>
that are compatible to the original troff language. It finds
and runs all necessary groff preprocessors, such as
chem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The groffer program also
includes many of the features for finding and displaying the
Unix manual pages (man pages), such that it can be used as a
replacement for a man(1) pro&acirc; <br>
gram. Moreover, compressed files that can be handled by
gzip(1) or bzip2(1) are decompressed on-the-fly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The normal usage is quite simple
by supplying a file name or name of a man page without
further options. But the option handling has many
possibilities for creating special be&acirc; <br>
haviors. This can be done either in configuration files,
with the shell environment variable $GROFFER_OPT, or on the
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output can be generated and
viewed in several different ways available for groff. This
includes the groff native X Window viewer gxditview(1), each
Postcript, pdf, or dvi <br>
display program, a web browser by generating html in www
mode, or several text modes in text terminals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of the options that must be
named when running groff directly are determined
automatically for groffer, due to the internal usage of the
grog(1) program. But all parts can <br>
also be controlled manually by arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several file names can be
specified on the command line arguments. They are
transformed into a single document in the normal way of
groff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option handling is done in GNU
style. Options and file names can be mixed freely. The
option &lsquo;--&rsquo; closes the option handling, all
following arguments are treated as file names. <br>
Long options can be abbreviated in several ways.</p>

[--debug-tmpdir] [--do-nothing] [--print text] [-V]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filespec arguments</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filespec parameters are all
arguments that are neither an option nor an option argument.
They usually mean a file name or a man page searching
scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following, the term
section_extension is used. It means a word that consists of
a man section that is optionally followed by an extension.
The name of a man sec&acirc; <br>
tion is a single character from [1-9on], the extension is
some word. The extension is mostly lacking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No filespec parameters means
standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- stands for standard input (can
occur several times).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename the path name of an
existing file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">man:name(section_extension) <br>
man:name.section_extension <br>
name(section_extension) <br>
name.section_extension <br>
section_extension name <br>
search the man page name in the section with optional
extension section_extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">man:name man page in the lowest
man section that has name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name if name is not an existing
file search for the man page name in the lowest man
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTION DETAILS <br>
The groffer program can usually be run with very few
options. But for special purposes, it supports many options.
These can be classified in 5 option classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All short options of groffer are
compatible with the short options of groff(1). All long
options of groffer are compatible with the long options of
man(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments for long option names
can be abbreviated in several ways. First, the argument is
checked whether it can be prolonged as is. Furthermore, each
minus sign - is consid&acirc; <br>
ered as a starting point for a new abbreviation. This leads
to a set of multiple abbreviations for a single argument.
For example, --de-n-f can be used as an abbreviation for
<br>
--debug-not-func, but --de-n works as well. If the
abbreviation of the argument leads to several resulting
options an error is raised.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These abbreviations are only
allowed in the environment variable $GROFFER_OPT, but not in
the configuration files. In configuration, all long options
must be exact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">groffer breaking Options <br>
As soon as one of these options is found on the command line
it is executed, printed to standard output, and the running
groffer is terminated thereafter. All other arguments <br>
are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h | --help <br>
Print help information with a short explanation of options
to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v | --version <br>
Print version information to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">groffer Mode Options <br>
The display mode and the viewer programs are determined by
these options. If none of these mode and viewer options is
specified groffer tries to find a suitable display mode
au&acirc; <br>
tomatically. The default modes are mode pdf, mode ps, mode
html, mode x, and mode dvi in X Window with different
viewers and mode tty with device latin1 under less on a
termi&acirc; <br>
nal; other modes are tested if the programs for the main
default mode do not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In X Window, many programs
create their own window when called. groffer can run these
viewers as an independent program in the background. As this
does not work in text mode on <br>
a terminal (tty) there must be a way to know which viewers
are X Window graphical programs. The groffer script has a
small set of information on some viewer names. If a viewer
<br>
argument of the command-line chooses an element that is kept
as X Window program in this list it is treated as a viewer
that can run in the background. All other, unknown viewer
<br>
calls are not run in the background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each mode, you are free to
choose whatever viewer you want. That need not be some
graphical viewer suitable for this mode. There is a chance
to view the output source; for <br>
example, the combination of the options --mode=ps and
--ps-viewer=less shows the content of the Postscript output,
the source code, with the pager less.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--auto Equivalent to
--mode=auto.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default <br>
Reset all configuration from previously processed command
line options to the default values. This is useful to wipe
out all former options of the configuration, in <br>
$GROFFER_OPT, and restart option processing using only the
rest of the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default-modes mode1,mode2,...
<br>
Set the sequence of modes for auto mode to the comma
separated list given in the argument. See --mode for details
on modes. Display in the default manner; actually, this <br>
means to try the modes x, ps, and tty in this sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dvi Equivalent to
--mode=dvi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dvi-viewer prog <br>
Choose a viewer program for dvi mode. This can be a file
name or a program to be searched in $PATH. Known X Window
dvi viewers include xdvi(1) and dvilx(1). In each <br>
case, arguments can be provided additionally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--groff <br>
Equivalent to --mode=groff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--html Equivalent to
--mode=html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--html-viewer <br>
Choose a web browser program for viewing in html mode. It
can be the path name of an executable file or a program in
$PATH. In each case, arguments can be provided addi&acirc;
<br>
tionally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mode value <br>
Set the display mode. The following mode values are
recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto Select the automatic
determination of the display mode. The sequence of modes
that are tried can be set with the --default-modes option.
Useful for restoring the <br>
default mode when a different mode was specified before.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvi Display formatted input in a
dvi viewer program. By default, the formatted input is
displayed with the xdvi(1) program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">groff After the file
determination, switch groffer to process the input like
groff(1) would do. This disables the groffer viewing
features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">html Translate the input into
html format and display the result in a web browser program.
By default, the existence of a sequence of standard web
browsers is tested, <br>
starting with konqueror(1) and mozilla(1). The text html
viewer is lynx(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdf Display formatted input in a
PDF (Portable Document Format) viewer program. By default,
the input is formatted by groff using the Postscript device,
then it is <br>
transformed into the PDF file format using gs(1), or
ps2pdf(1). If that&rsquo;s not possible, the Postscript mode
(ps) is used instead. Finally it is displayed using <br>
different viewer programs. pdf has a big advantage because
the text is displayed graphically and is searchable as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ps Display formatted input in a
Postscript viewer program. By default, the formatted input
is displayed in one of many viewer programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">text Format in a groff text mode
and write the result to standard output without a pager or
viewer program. The text device, latin1 by default, can be
chosen with op&acirc; <br>
tion -T.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tty Format in a groff text mode
and write the result to standard output using a text pager
program, even when in X Window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">www Equivalent to
--mode=html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x Display the formatted input in
a native roff viewer. By default, the formatted input is
displayed with the gxditview(1) program being distributed
together with <br>
groff. But the standard X Window tool xditview(1) can also
be chosen with the option --x-viewer. The default resolution
is 75dpi, but 100dpi are also possible. <br>
The default groff device for the resolution of 75dpi is
X75-12, for 100dpi it is X100. The corresponding groff
intermediate output for the actual device is gener&acirc;
<br>
ated and the result is displayed. For a resolution of
100dpi, the default width of the geometry of the display
program is chosen to 850dpi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X Equivalent to --mode=x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following modes do not use
the groffer viewing features. They are only interesting for
advanced applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">groff Generate device output
with plain groff without using the special viewing features
of groffer. If no device was specified by option -T the
groff default ps is as&acirc; <br>
sumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source Output the roff source
code of the input files without further processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pdf Equivalent to
--mode=pdf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pdf-viewer prog <br>
Choose a viewer program for pdf mode. This can be a file
name or a program to be searched in $PATH; arguments can be
provided additionally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ps Equivalent to
--mode=ps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ps-viewer prog <br>
Choose a viewer program for ps mode. This can be a file name
or a program to be searched in $PATH. Common Postscript
viewers include gv(1), ghostview(1), and gs(1), In <br>
each case, arguments can be provided additionally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--source <br>
Equivalent to --mode=source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--text Equivalent to
--mode=text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--to-stdout <br>
The file for the chosen mode is generated and its content is
printed to standard output. It will not be displayed in
graphical mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tty Equivalent to
--mode=tty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tty-viewer prog <br>
Choose a text pager for mode tty. The standard pager is
less(1). This option is equivalent to man option
--pager=prog. The option argument can be a file name or a
pro&acirc; <br>
gram to be searched in $PATH; arguments can be provided
additionally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--www Equivalent to
--mode=html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--www-viewer prog <br>
Equivalent to --html-viewer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--X | --x <br>
Equivalent to --mode=x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--X-viewer | --x-viewer prog
<br>
Choose a viewer program for x mode. Suitable viewer programs
are gxditview(1) which is the default and xditview(1). The
argument can be any executable file or a program <br>
in $PATH; arguments can be provided additionally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- Signals the end of option
processing; all remaining arguments are interpreted as
filespec parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Besides these, groffer accepts
all short options that are valid for the groff(1) program.
All non-groffer options are sent unmodified via grog to
groff. So postprocessors, <br>
macro packages, compatibility with classical troff, and much
more can be manually specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options related to groff <br>
All short options of groffer are compatible with the short
options of groff(1). The following of groff options have
either an additional special meaning within groffer or make
<br>
sense for normal usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because of the special
outputting behavior of the groff option -Z groffer was
designed to be switched into groff mode; the groffer viewing
features are disabled there. The other <br>
groff options do not switch the mode, but allow to customize
the formatting process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--a This generates an ascii
approximation of output in the text modes. That could be
important when the text pager has problems with control
sequences in tty mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--m file <br>
Add file as a groff macro file. This is useful in case it
cannot be recognized automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--P opt_or_arg <br>
Send the argument opt_or_arg as an option or option argument
to the actual groff postprocessor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--T devname | --device devname
<br>
This option determines groff&rsquo;s output device. The most
important devices are the text output devices for referring
to the different character sets, such as ascii, utf8, <br>
latin1, and others. Each of these arguments switches groffer
into a text mode using this device, to mode tty if the
actual mode is not a text mode. The following devname <br>
arguments are mapped to the corresponding groffer
--mode=devname option: dvi, html, and ps. All X* arguments
are mapped to mode x. Each other devname argument switches
<br>
to mode groff using this device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--X is equivalent to groff -X.
It displays the groff intermediate output with gxditview. As
the quality is relatively bad this option is deprecated; use
--X instead because <br>
the x mode uses an X* device for a better display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z | --intermediate-output |
--ditroff <br>
Switch into groff mode and format the input with the groff
intermediate output without postprocessing; see
groff_out(5). This is equivalent to option --ditroff of man,
<br>
which can be used as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All other groff options are
supported by groffer, but they are just transparently
transferred to groff without any intervention. The options
that are not explicitly handled by <br>
groffer are transparently passed to groff. Therefore these
transparent options are not documented here, but in
groff(1). Due to the automatism in groffer, none of these
groff <br>
options should be needed, except for advanced usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for man pages <br>
--apropos <br>
Start the apropos(1) command or facility of man(1) for
searching the filespec arguments within all man page
descriptions. Each filespec argument is taken for search as
it <br>
is; section specific parts are not handled, such that 7
groff searches for the two arguments 7 and groff, with a
large result; for the filespec groff.7 nothing will be <br>
found. The language locale is handled only when the called
programs do support this; the GNU apropos and man -k do not.
The display differs from the apropos program by <br>
the following concepts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Construct a
groff frame similar to a man page to the output of
apropos,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; each filespec
argument is searched on its own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The restriction
by --sections is handled as well,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; wildcard
characters are allowed and handled without a further
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--apropos-data <br>
Show only the apropos descriptions for data documents, these
are the man(7) sections 4, 5, and 7. Direct section
declarations are ignored, wildcards are accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--apropos-devel <br>
Show only the apropos descriptions for development
documents, these are the man(7) sections 2, 3, and 9. Direct
section declarations are ignored, wildcards are
accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--apropos-progs <br>
Show only the apropos descriptions for documents on
programs, these are the man(7) sections 1, 6, and 8. Direct
section declarations are ignored, wildcards are
accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--whatis <br>
For each filespec argument search all man pages and display
their description &acirc; or say that it is not a man page.
This is written from anew, so it differs from man&rsquo;s
<br>
whatis output by the following concepts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; each retrieved
file name is added,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; local files are
handled as well,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the language and
system locale is supported,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the display is
framed by a groff output format similar to a man page,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; wildcard
characters are allowed without a further option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options were added
to groffer for choosing whether the file name arguments are
interpreted as names for local files or as a search pattern
for man pages. The de&acirc; <br>
fault is looking up for local files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--man Check the non-option
command line arguments (filespecs) first on being man pages,
then whether they represent an existing file. By default, a
filespec is first tested <br>
whether it is an existing file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-man | --local-file <br>
Do not check for man pages. --local-file is the
corresponding man option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-special <br>
Disable former calls of --all, --apropos*, and --whatis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Long options taken over from GNU
man <br>
The long options of groffer were synchronized with the long
options of GNU man. All long options of GNU man are
recognized, but not all of these options are important to
<br>
groffer, so most of them are just ignored. These ignored man
options are --catman, --troff, and --update.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following, the man
options that have a special meaning for groffer are
documented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your system has GNU man
installed the full set of long and short options of the GNU
man program can be passed via the environment variable
$MANOPT; see man(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--all In searching man pages,
retrieve all suitable documents instead of only one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-7 | --ascii <br>
In text modes, display ASCII translation of special
characters for critical environment. This is equivalent to
groff -mtty_char; see groff_tmac(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ditroff <br>
Produce groff intermediate output. This is equivalent to
groffer -Z.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--extension suffix <br>
Restrict man page search to file names that have suffix
appended to their section element. For example, in the file
name /usr/share/man/man3/terminfo.3ncurses.gz the <br>
man page extension is ncurses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--locale language <br>
Set the language for man pages. This has the same effect,
but overwrites $LANG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--location <br>
Print the location of the retrieved files to standard
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-location <br>
Do not display the location of retrieved files; this resets
a former call to --location. This was added by groffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--manpath
&rsquo;dir1:dir2:...&rsquo; <br>
Use the specified search path for retrieving man pages
instead of the program defaults. If the argument is set to
the empty string &quot;&quot; the search for man page is
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pager <br>
Set the pager program in tty mode; default is less. This is
equivalent to --tty-viewer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sections sec1:sec2:... <br>
Restrict searching for man pages to the given sections, a
colon-separated list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--systems sys1,sys2,... <br>
Search for man pages for the given operating systems; the
argument systems is a comma-separated list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--where <br>
Equivalent to --location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X Window Toolkit Options <br>
The following long options were adapted from the
corresponding X Window Toolkit options. groffer will pass
them to the actual viewer program if it is an X Window
program. Oth&acirc; <br>
erwise these options are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately these options use
the old style of a single minus for long options. For
groffer that was changed to the standard with using a double
minus for long options, for <br>
example, groffer uses the option --font for the X Window
option -font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See X(7) and the documentation
on the X Window Toolkit options for more details on these
options and their arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--background color <br>
Set the background color of the viewer window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bd pixels <br>
This is equivalent to --bordercolor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bg color <br>
This is equivalent to --background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bw pixels <br>
This is equivalent to --borderwidth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bordercolor pixels <br>
Specifies the color of the border surrounding the viewer
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--borderwidth pixels <br>
Specifies the width in pixels of the border surrounding the
viewer window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--display X-display <br>
Set the X Window display on which the viewer program shall
be started, see the X Window documentation for the syntax of
the argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--foreground color <br>
Set the foreground color of the viewer window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fg color <br>
This is equivalent to -foreground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fn font_name <br>
This is equivalent to --font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--font font_name <br>
Set the font used by the viewer window. The argument is an X
Window font name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ft font_name <br>
This is equivalent to --font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--geometry size_pos <br>
Set the geometry of the display window, that means its size
and its starting position. See X(7) for the syntax of the
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resolution value <br>
Set X Window resolution in dpi (dots per inch) in some
viewer programs. The only supported dpi values are 75 and
100. Actually, the default resolution for groffer is set
<br>
to 75dpi. The resolution also sets the default device in
mode x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rv Reverse foreground and
background color of the viewer window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--title &rsquo;some text&rsquo;
<br>
Set the title for the viewer window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--xrm &rsquo;resource&rsquo;
<br>
Set X Window resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for Development <br>
--debug <br>
Enable all debugging options --debug-type. The temporary
files are kept and not deleted, the grog output is printed,
the name of the temporary directory is printed, the <br>
displayed file names are printed, and the parameters are
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug-filenames <br>
Print the names of the files and man pages that are
displayed by groffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug-grog <br>
Print the output of all grog commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug-keep <br>
Enable two debugging informations. Print the name of the
temporary directory and keep the temporary files, do not
delete them during the run of groffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug-params <br>
Print the parameters, as obtained from the configuration
files, from GROFFER_OPT, and the command line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug-tmpdir <br>
Print the name of the temporary directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--do-nothing <br>
This is like --version, but without the output; no viewer is
started. This makes only sense in development.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--print=text <br>
Just print the argument to standard error. This is good for
parameter check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V This is an advanced option
for debugging only. Instead of displaying the formatted
input, a lot of groffer specific information is printed to
standard output:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the output file
name in the temporary directory,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the display mode
of the actual groffer run,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the display
program for viewing the output with its arguments,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the active
parameters from the config files, the arguments in
$GROFFER_OPT, and the arguments of the command line,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the pipeline
that would be run by the groff program, but without
executing it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other useful debugging options
are the groff option -Z and --mode=groff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filespec Arguments <br>
A filespec parameter is an argument that is not an option or
option argument. In groffer, filespec parameters are a file
name or a template for searching man pages. These input <br>
sources are collected and composed into a single output file
such as groff does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The strange POSIX behavior to
regard all arguments behind the first non-option argument as
filespec arguments is ignored. The GNU behavior to recognize
options even when mixed <br>
with filespec arguments is used throughout. But, as usual,
the double minus argument -- ends the option handling and
interprets all following arguments as filespec arguments; so
<br>
the POSIX behavior can be easily adopted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options --apropos* have a
special handling of filespec arguments. Each argument is
taken as a search scheme of its own. Also a regexp (regular
expression) can be used in <br>
the filespec. For example, groffer --apropos
&rsquo;^gro.f$&rsquo; searches groff in the man page name,
while groffer --apropos groff searches groff somewhere in
the name or description of <br>
the man pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All other parts of groffer, such
as the normal display or the output with --whatis have a
different scheme for filespecs. No regular expressions are
used for the arguments. The <br>
filespec arguments are handled by the following scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is necessary to know that on
each system the man pages are sorted according to their
content into several sections. The classical man sections
have a single-character name, <br>
either a digit from 1 to 9 or one of the characters n or
o.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can optionally be followed
by a string, the so-called extension. The extension allows
to store several man pages with the same name in the same
section. But the extension <br>
is only rarely used, usually it is omitted. Then the
extensions are searched automatically by alphabet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following, we use the
name section_extension for a word that consists of a single
character section name or a section character that is
followed by an extension. Each <br>
filespec parameter can have one of the following forms in
decreasing sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; No filespec
parameters means that groffer waits for standard input. The
minus option - always stands for standard input; it can
occur several times. If you want to look up a <br>
man page called - use the argument man:-.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Next a filespec
is tested whether it is the path name of an existing file.
Otherwise it is assumed to be a searching pattern for a man
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
man:name(section_extension), man:name.section_extension,
name(section_extension), or name.section_extension search
the man page name in man section and possibly extension of
<br>
section_extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Now man:name
searches for a man page in the lowest man section that has a
document called name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
section_extension name is a pattern of 2 arguments that
originates from a strange argument parsing of the man
program. Again, this searches the man page name with <br>
section_extension, a combination of a section character
optionally followed by an extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; We are left with
the argument name which is not an existing file. So this
searches for the man page called name in the lowest man
section that has a document for this name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several file name arguments can
be supplied. They are mixed by groff into a single document.
Note that the set of option arguments must fit to all of
these file arguments. So <br>
they should have at least the same style of the groff
language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT MODES <br>
By default, the groffer program collects all input into a
single file, formats it with the groff program for a certain
device, and then chooses a suitable viewer program. The <br>
device and viewer process in groffer is called a mode. The
mode and viewer of a running groffer program is selected
automatically, but the user can also choose it with options.
<br>
The modes are selected by option the arguments of
--mode=anymode. Additionally, each of this argument can be
specified as an option of its own, such as anymode. Most of
these <br>
modes have a viewer program, which can be chosen by an
option that is constructed like --anymode-viewer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several different modes are
offered, graphical modes for X Window, text modes, and some
direct groff modes for debugging and development.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, groffer first tries
whether x mode is possible, then ps mode, and finally tty
mode. This mode testing sequence for auto mode can be
changed by specifying a comma <br>
separated list of modes with the option --default-modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The searching for man pages and
the decompression of the input are active in every mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Graphical Display Modes <br>
The graphical display modes work mostly in the X Window
environment (or similar implementations within other
windowing environments). The environment variable $DISPLAY
and the <br>
option --display are used for specifying the X Window
display to be used. If this environment variable is empty
groffer assumes that no X Window is running and changes to a
<br>
text mode. You can change this automatic behavior by the
option --default-modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known viewers for the graphical
display modes and their standard X Window viewer programs
are</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; in a PDF viewer
(pdf mode)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; in a web browser
(html or www mode)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; in a Postscript
viewer (ps mode)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; X Window roff
viewers such as gxditview(1) or xditview(1) (in x mode)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; in a dvi viewer
program (dvi mode)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pdf mode has a major
advantage &acirc; it is the only graphical display mode that
allows to search for text within the viewer; this can be a
really important feature. Unfortunate&acirc; <br>
ly, it takes some time to transform the input into the PDF
format, so it was not chosen as the major mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These graphical viewers can be
customized by options of the X Window Toolkit. But the
groffer options use a leading double minus instead of the
single minus used by the <br>
X Window Toolkit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text modes <br>
There are two modes for text output, mode text for plain
output without a pager and mode tty for a text output on a
text terminal using some pager program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the variable $DISPLAY is not
set or empty, groffer assumes that it should use tty
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the actual implementation,
the groff output device latin1 is chosen for text modes.
This can be changed by specifying option -T or --device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pager to be used can be
specified by one of the options --pager and --tty-viewer, or
by the environment variable $PAGER. If all of this is not
used the less(1) program with <br>
the option -r for correctly displaying control sequences is
used as the default pager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special Modes for Debugging and
Development <br>
These modes use the groffer file determination and
decompression. This is combined into a single input file
that is fed directly into groff with different strategy
without the <br>
groffer viewing facilities. These modes are regarded as
advanced, they are useful for debugging and development
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The source mode with option
--source just displays the decompressed input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otion --to-stdout does not
display in a graphical mode. It just generates the file for
the chosen mode and then prints its content to standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The groff mode passes the input
to groff using only some suitable options provided to
groffer. This enables the user to save the generated output
into a file or pipe it into an&acirc; <br>
other program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In groff mode, the option -Z
disables post-processing, thus producing the groff
intermediate output. In this mode, the input is formatted,
but not postprocessed; see <br>
groff_out(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All groff short options are
supported by groffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAN PAGE SEARCHING <br>
The default behavior of groffer is to first test whether a
file parameter represents a local file; if it is not an
existing file name, it is assumed to represent the name of a
<br>
man page. The following options can be used to determine
whether the arguments should be handled as file name or man
page arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--man forces to interpret all
file parameters as filespecs for searching man pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-man <br>
--local-file <br>
disable the man searching; so only local files are
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither a local file nor a
man page was retrieved for some file parameter a warning is
issued on standard error, but processing is continued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Search Algorithm <br>
Let us now assume that a man page should be searched. The
groffer program provides a search facility for man pages.
All long options, all environment variables, and most of the
<br>
functionality of the GNU man(1) program were implemented.
The search algorithm shall determine which file is displayed
for a given man page. The process can be modified by
op&acirc; <br>
tions and environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only man action that is
omitted in groffer are the preformatted man pages, also
called cat pages. With the excellent performance of the
actual computers, the preformatted <br>
man pages aren&rsquo;t necessary any longer. Additionally,
groffer is a roff program; it wants to read roff source
files and format them itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The algorithm for retrieving the
file for a man page needs first a set of directories. This
set starts with the so-called man path that is modified
later on by adding names of <br>
operating system and language. This arising set is used for
adding the section directories which contain the man page
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The man path is a list of
directories that are separated by colon. It is generated by
the following methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The environment
variable $MANPATH can be set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It can be read
from the arguments of the environment variable $MANOPT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The man path can
be manually specified by using the option --manpath. An
empty argument disables the man page searching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When no man path
was set the manpath(1) program is tried to determine
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If this does not
work a reasonable default path from $PATH is determined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We now have a starting set of
directories. The first way to change this set is by adding
names of operating systems. This assumes that man pages for
several operating systems <br>
are installed. This is not always true. The names of such
operating systems can be provided by 3 methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The environment
variable $SYSTEM has the lowest precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; This can be
overridden by an option in $MANOPT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; This again is
overridden by the command line option --systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several names of operating
systems can be given by appending their names, separated by
a comma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The man path is changed by
appending each system name as subdirectory at the end of
each directory of the set. No directory of the man path set
is kept. But if no system name <br>
is specified the man path is left unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After this, the actual set of
directories can be changed by language information. This
assumes that there exist man pages in different languages.
The wanted language can be <br>
chosen by several methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Environment
variable $LANG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; This is
overridden by $LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; This is
overridden by $LC_ALL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; This can be
overridden by providing an option in $MANOPT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; All these
environment variables are overridden by the command line
option --locale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default language can be
specified by specifying one of the pseudo-language
parameters C or POSIX. This is like deleting a formerly
given language information. The man pages <br>
in the default language are usually in English.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course, the language name is
determined by man. In GNU man, it is specified in the POSIX
1003.1 based format:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;language&gt;[_&lt;territory&gt;[.&lt;character-set&gt;[,&lt;version&gt;]]],</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but the two-letter code in
&lt;language&gt; is sufficient for most purposes. If for a
complicated language formulation no man pages are found
groffer searches the country part con&acirc; <br>
sisting of these first two characters as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actual directory set is
copied thrice. The language name is appended as subdirectory
to each directory in the first copy of the actual directory
set (this is only done when <br>
a language information is given). Then the 2-letter
abbreviation of the language name is appended as
subdirectories to the second copy of the directory set (this
is only done <br>
when the given language name has more than 2 letters). The
third copy of the directory set is kept unchanged (if no
language information is given this is the kept directory
<br>
set). These maximally 3 copies are appended to get the new
directory set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We now have a complete set of
directories to work with. In each of these directories, the
man files are separated in sections. The name of a section
is represented by a single <br>
character, a digit between 1 and 9, or the character o or n,
in this order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each available section, a
subdirectory man&lt;section&gt; exists containing all man
files for this section, where &lt;section&gt; is a single
character as described before. Each man <br>
file in a section directory has the form
man&lt;section&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.&lt;section&gt;[&lt;extension&gt;][.&lt;compression&gt;],
where &lt;extension&gt; and &lt;compression&gt; are
optional. &lt;name&gt; is the name of the <br>
man page that is also specified as filespec argument on the
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The extension is an addition to
the section. This postfix acts like a subsection. An
extension occurs only in the file name, not in name of the
section subdirectory. It can be <br>
specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the other hand, the
compression is just an information on how the file is
compressed. This is not important for the user, such that it
cannot be specified on the command <br>
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are 4 methods to specify a
section on the command line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Environment
variable $MANSECT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Command line
option --sections</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Appendix to the
name argument in the form &lt;name&gt;.&lt;section&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Preargument
before the name argument in the form &lt;section&gt;
&lt;name&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also possible to specify
several sections by appending the single characters
separated by colons. One can imagine that this means to
restrict the man page search to only <br>
some sections. The multiple sections are only possible for
$MANSECT and --sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no section is specified all
sections are searched one after the other in the given
order, starting with section 1, until a suitable file is
found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are 4 methods to specify
an extension on the command line. But it is not necessary to
provide the whole extension name, some abbreviation is good
enough in most cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Environment
variable $EXTENSION</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Command line
option --extension</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Appendix to the
&lt;name&gt;.&lt;section&gt; argument in the form
&lt;name&gt;.&lt;section&gt;&lt;extension&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Preargument
before the name argument in the form
&lt;section&gt;&lt;extension&gt; &lt;name&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For further details on man page
searching, see man(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples of man files <br>
/usr/share/man/man1/groff.1 <br>
This is an uncompressed file for the man page groff in
section 1. It can be called by <br>
sh# groffer groff <br>
No section is specified here, so all sections should be
searched, but as section 1 is searched first this file will
be found first. The file name is composed of the fol&acirc;
<br>
lowing components. /usr/share/man must be part of the man
path; the subdirectory man1/ and the part .1 stand for the
section; groff is the name of the man page.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/local/share/man/man7/groff.7.gz
<br>
The file name is composed of the following components.
/usr/local/share/man must be part of the man path; the
subdirectory man7/ and the part .7 stand for the section;
<br>
groff is the name of the man page; the final part .gz stands
for a compression with gzip(1). As the section is not the
first one it must be specified as well. This can <br>
be done by one of the following commands. <br>
sh# groffer groff.7 <br>
sh# groffer 7 groff <br>
sh# groffer --sections=7 groff</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/local/man/man1/ctags.1emacs21.bz2
<br>
Here /usr/local/man must be in man path; the subdirectory
man1/ and the file name part .1 stand for section 1; the
name of the man page is ctags; the section has an
exten&acirc; <br>
sion emacs21; and the file is compressed as .bz2 with
bzip2(1). The file can be viewed with one of the following
commands <br>
sh# groffer ctags.1e <br>
sh# groffer 1e ctags <br>
sh# groffer --extension=e --sections=1 ctags <br>
where e works as an abbreviation for the extension
emacs21.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/man/linux/de/man7/man.7.Z
<br>
The directory /usr/man is now part of the man path; then
there is a subdirectory for an operating system name linux/;
next comes a subdirectory de/ for the German lan&acirc; <br>
guage; the section names man7 and .7 are known so far; man
is the name of the man page; and .Z signifies the
compression that can be handled by gzip(1). We want now show
<br>
how to provide several values for some options. That is
possible for sections and operating system names. So we use
as sections 5 and 7 and as system names linux and <br>
aix. The command is then</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh# groffer --locale=de
--sections=5:7 --systems=linux,aix man <br>
sh# LANG=de MANSECT=5:7 SYSTEM=linux,aix groffer man</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DECOMPRESSION <br>
The program has a decompression facility. If standard input
or a file that was retrieved from the command line
parameters is compressed with a format that is supported by
either <br>
gzip(1) or bzip2(1) it is decompressed on-the-fly. This
includes the GNU .gz, .bz2, and the traditional .Z
compression. The program displays the concatenation of all
decom&acirc; <br>
pressed input in the sequence that was specified on the
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The groffer program supports many system variables, most of
them by courtesy of other programs. All environment
variables of groff(1) and GNU man(1) and some standard
system <br>
variables are honored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Native groffer Variables <br>
$GROFFER_OPT <br>
Store options for a run of groffer. The options specified in
this variable are overridden by the options given on the
command line. The content of this variable is run <br>
through the shell builtin &lsquo;eval&rsquo;; so arguments
containing white-space or special shell characters should be
quoted. Do not forget to export this variable, otherwise it
<br>
does not exist during the run of groffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">System Variables <br>
The following variables have a special meaning for
groffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$DISPLAY <br>
If this variable is set this indicates that the X Window
system is running. Testing this variable decides on whether
graphical or text output is generated. This variable <br>
should not be changed by the user carelessly, but it can be
used to start the graphical groffer on a remote X Window
terminal. For example, depending on your system, <br>
groffer can be started on the second monitor by the
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh# DISPLAY=:0.1 groffer
what.ever &amp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$LC_ALL <br>
$LC_MESSAGES <br>
$LANG If one of these variables is set (in the above
sequence), its content is interpreted as the locale, the
language to be used, especially when retrieving man pages. A
lo&acirc; <br>
cale name is typically of the form
language[_territory[.codeset[@modifier]]], where language is
an ISO 639 language code, territory is an ISO 3166 country
code, and <br>
codeset is a character set or encoding identifier like
ISO-8859-1 or UTF-8; see setlocale(3). The locale values C
and POSIX stand for the default, i.e. the man page di&acirc;
<br>
rectories without a language prefix. This is the same
behavior as when all 3 variables are unset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PAGER This variable can be used
to set the pager for the tty output. For example, to disable
the use of a pager completely set this variable to the
cat(1) program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh# PAGER=cat groffer
anything</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$PATH All programs within the
groffer script are called without a fixed path. Thus this
environment variable determines the set of programs used
within the run of groffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Groff Variables <br>
The groffer program internally calls groff, so all
environment variables documented in groff(1) are internally
used within groffer as well. The following variable has a
direct <br>
meaning for the groffer program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$GROFF_TMPDIR <br>
If the value of this variable is an existing, writable
directory, groffer uses it for storing its temporary files,
just as groff does. See the groff(1) man page for more <br>
details on the location of temporary files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Man Variables <br>
Parts of the functionality of the man program were
implemented in groffer; support for all environment
variables documented in man(1) was added to groffer, but the
meaning was <br>
slightly modified due to the different approach in groffer;
but the user interface is the same. The man environment
variables can be overwritten by options provided with <br>
$MANOPT, which in turn is overwritten by the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$EXTENSION <br>
Restrict the search for man pages to files having this
extension. This is overridden by option --extension; see
there for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$MANOPT <br>
This variable contains options as a preset for man(1). As
not all of these are relevant for groffer only the essential
parts of its value are extracted. The options <br>
specified in this variable overwrite the values of the other
environment variables that are specific to man. All options
specified in this variable are overridden by the <br>
options given on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$MANPATH <br>
If set, this variable contains the directories in which the
man page trees are stored. This is overridden by option
--manpath.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$MANSECT <br>
If this is a colon separated list of section names, the
search for man pages is restricted to those manual sections
in that order. This is overridden by option --sec&acirc;
<br>
tions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYSTEM <br>
If this is set to a comma separated list of names these are
interpreted as man page trees for different operating
systems. This variable can be overwritten by option <br>
--systems; see there for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment variable
$MANROFFSEQ is ignored by groffer because the necessary
preprocessors are determined automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILES <br>
The groffer program can be preconfigured by two
configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/groff/groffer.conf <br>
System-wide configuration file for groffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.groff/groffer.conf <br>
User-specific configuration file for groffer, where $HOME
denotes the user&rsquo;s home directory. This file is called
after the system-wide configuration file to enable
over&acirc; <br>
riding by the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both files are handled for the
configuration, but the configuration file in /etc comes
first; it is overwritten by the configuration file in the
home directory; both configura&acirc; <br>
tion files are overwritten by the environment variable
$GROFFER_OPT; everything is overwritten by the command line
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration files contain
options that should be called as default for every groffer
run. These options are written in lines such that each
contains either a long option, <br>
a short option, or a short option cluster; each with or
without an argument. So each line with configuration
information starts with a minus character &lsquo;-&rsquo;; a
line with a long <br>
option starts with two minus characters &lsquo;--&rsquo;, a
line with a short option or short option cluster starts with
a single minus &lsquo;-&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option names in the
configuration files may not be abbreviated, they must be
exact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument for a long option
can be separated from the option name either by an equal
sign &lsquo;=&rsquo; or by whitespace, i.e. one or several
space or tab characters. An argument for a <br>
short option or short option cluster can be directly
appended to the option name or separated by whitespace. The
end of an argument is the end of the line. It is not allowed
to <br>
use a shell environment variable in an option name or
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not necessary to use
quotes in an option or argument, except for empty arguments.
An empty argument can be provided by appending a pair of
quotes to the separating equal <br>
sign or whitespace; with a short option, the separator can
be omitted as well. For a long option with a separating
equal sign &lsquo;=&rsquo;, the pair of quotes can be
omitted, thus ending <br>
the line with the separating equal sign. All other quote
characters are cancelled internally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the configuration files,
arbitrary whitespace is allowed at the beginning of each
line, it is just ignored. Each whitespace within a line is
replaced by a single space char&acirc; <br>
acter &lsquo; &rsquo; internally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All lines of the configuration
lines that do not start with a minus character are ignored,
such that comments starting with &lsquo;#&rsquo; are
possible. So there are no shell commands in <br>
the configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example, consider the
following configuration file that can be used either in
/etc/groff/groffer.conf or ~/.groff/groffer.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># groffer configuration file
<br>
# <br>
# groffer options that are used in each call of groffer <br>
--foreground=DarkBlue <br>
--resolution=100 <br>
--x-viewer=gxditview -geometry 900x1200 <br>
--pdf-viewer xpdf -Z 150</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The lines starting with # are
just ignored, so they act as command lines. This
configuration sets four groffer options (the lines starting
with &lsquo;-&rsquo;). This has the following ef&acirc; <br>
fects:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Use a text color
of DarkBlue in all viewers that support this, such as
gxditview.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Use a resolution
of 100dpi in all viewers that support this, such as
gxditview. By this, the default device in x mode is set to
X100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Force
gxditview(1) as the x-mode viewer using the geometry option
for setting the width to 900px and the height to 1200px.
This geometry is suitable for a resolution of <br>
100dpi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Use xpdf(1) as
the pdf-mode viewer with the argument -Z 150.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The usage of groffer is very easy. Usually, it is just
called with a file name or man page. The following examples,
however, show that groffer has much more fancy
capabilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh# groffer
/usr/local/share/doc/groff/meintro.ms.gz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Decompress, format and display
the compressed file meintro.ms.gz in the directory
/usr/local/share/doc/groff, using the standard viewer
gxditview as graphical viewer when in <br>
X Window, or the less(1) pager program when not in X
Window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh# groffer groff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file ./groff exists use
it as input. Otherwise interpret the argument as a search
for the man page named groff in the smallest possible man
section, being section 1 in <br>
this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh# groffer man:groff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">search for the man page of groff
even when the file ./groff exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh# groffer groff.7 <br>
sh# groffer 7 groff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">search the man page of groff in
man section 7. This section search works only for a digit or
a single character from a small set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh# groffer fb.modes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file ./fb.modes does not
exist interpret this as a search for the man page of
fb.modes. As the extension modes is not a single character
in classical section style the <br>
argument is not split to a search for fb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh# groffer groff
&acirc;troff(1)&acirc; man:roff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The arguments that are not
existing files are looked-up as the following man pages:
groff (automatic search, should be found in man section 1),
troff (in section 1), and roff (in <br>
the section with the lowest number, being 7 in this case).
The quotes around &acirc;troff(1)&acirc; are necessary
because the parentheses are special shell characters;
escaping them with a <br>
backslash character and would be possible, too. The
formatted files are concatenated and displayed in one
piece.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh# LANG=de groffer --man --www
--www-viewer=galeon ls</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Retrieve the German man page
(language de) for the ls program, decompress it, format it
to html format (www mode) and view the result in the web
browser galeon. The option --man <br>
guarantees that the man page is retrieved, even when a local
file ls exists in the actual directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh# groffer --source
&rsquo;man:roff(7)&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Get the man page called roff in
man section 7, decompress it, and print its unformatted
content, its source code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh# groffer --de-p --in --ap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a set of abbreviated
arguments, it is determined as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh# groffer --debug-params
--intermediate-output --apropos</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh# cat file.gz | groffer -Z
-mfoo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file file.gz is sent to
standard input, this is decompressed, and then this is
transported to the groff intermediate output mode without
post-processing (groff option -Z), <br>
using macro package foo (groff option -m).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh# echo
&rsquo;<tt><b>WOW!&rsquo; | <br>
&gt; groffer --x --bg red --fg yellow --geometry 200x100
-</b></tt></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><tt><b>Display the word WOW! in
a small window in constant-width <br>
bold font, using color yellow on red
background.</b></tt></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><tt><b>COMPATIBILITY <br>
The groffer program is written in Perl, the Perl version
during writing was v5.8.8.</b></tt></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><tt><b>groffer provides its own
parser for command line arguments that is compatible to both
POSIX getopts(1) and GNU getopt(1). It can handle option
arguments and file names <br>
containing white space and a large set of special
characters. The following standard types of options are
supported.</b></tt></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><tt><b>&Acirc;&middot; The
option consisting of a single minus - refers to standard
input.</b></tt></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><tt><b>&Acirc;&middot; A single
minus followed by characters refers to a single character
option or a combination thereof; for example, the groffer
short option combination -Qmfoo is equivalent to <br>
-Q -m foo.</b></tt></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><tt><b>&Acirc;&middot; Long
options are options with names longer than one character;
they are always preceded by a double minus. An option
argument can either go to the next command line argument
<br>
or be appended with an equal sign to the argument; for
example, --long=arg is equivalent to --long
arg.</b></tt></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><tt><b>&Acirc;&middot; An
argument of -- ends option parsing; all further command line
arguments are interpreted as filespec parameters, i.e. file
names or constructs for searching man pages).</b></tt></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><tt><b>&Acirc;&middot; All
command line arguments that are neither options nor option
arguments are interpreted as filespec parameters and stored
until option parsing has finished. For example, the <br>
command line</b></tt></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><tt><b>sh# groffer file1 -a -o
arg file2</b></tt></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><tt><b>is equivalent
to</b></tt></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><tt><b>sh# groffer -a -o arg --
file1 file2</b></tt></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><tt><b>The free mixing of
options and filespec parameters follows the GNU principle.
That does not fulfill the strange option behavior of POSIX
that ends option processing as soon as <br>
the first non-option argument has been reached. The end of
option processing can be forced by the option
&lsquo;--&rsquo; anyway.</b></tt></p>
