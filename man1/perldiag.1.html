<p>PERLDIAG(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLDIAG(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perldiag - various Perl diagnostics</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
These messages are classified as follows (listed in
increasing order of desperation):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(W) A warning (optional). <br>
(D) A deprecation (enabled by default). <br>
(S) A severe warning (enabled by default). <br>
(F) A fatal error (trappable). <br>
(P) An internal error you should never see (trappable). <br>
(X) A very fatal error (nontrappable). <br>
(A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The majority of messages from
the first three classifications above (W, D &amp; S) can be
controlled using the &quot;warnings&quot; pragma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a message can be controlled
by the &quot;warnings&quot; pragma, its warning category is
included with the classification letter in the description
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optional warnings are enabled by
using the &quot;warnings&quot; pragma or the -w and -W
switches. Warnings may be captured by setting $SIG{__WARN__}
to a reference to a routine that will <br>
be called on each warning instead of printing it. See
perlvar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Severe warnings are always
enabled, unless they are explicitly disabled with the
&quot;warnings&quot; pragma or the -X switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trappable errors may be trapped
using the eval operator. See &quot;eval&quot; in perlfunc.
In almost all cases, warnings may be selectively disabled or
promoted to fatal errors using the <br>
&quot;warnings&quot; pragma. See warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The messages are in alphabetical
order, without regard to upper or lower-case. Some of these
messages are generic. Spots that vary are denoted with a %s
or other printf-style <br>
escape. These escapes are ignored by the alphabetical order,
as are all characters other than letters. To look up your
message, just ignore anything that is not a letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">accept() on closed socket %s
<br>
(W closed) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket. Did
you forget to check the return value of your socket() call?
See &quot;accept&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allocation too large: %x <br>
(X) You can&rsquo;t allocate more than 64K on an MS-DOS
machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;%c&rsquo; allowed only
after types %s <br>
(F) The modifiers &rsquo;!&rsquo;, &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; and
&rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; are allowed in pack() or unpack() only
after certain types. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ambiguous call resolved as
CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp; <br>
(W ambiguous) A subroutine you have declared has the same
name as a Perl keyword, and you have used the name without
qualification for calling one or the other. Perl decided
<br>
to call the builtin because the subroutine is not
imported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To force interpretation as a
subroutine call, either put an ampersand before the
subroutine name, or qualify the name with its package.
Alternatively, you can import the <br>
subroutine (or pretend that it&rsquo;s imported with the
&quot;use subs&quot; pragma).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To silently interpret it as the
Perl operator, use the &quot;CORE::&quot; prefix on the
operator (e.g. &quot;CORE::log($x)&quot;) or declare the
subroutine to be an object method (see <br>
&quot;Subroutine Attributes&quot; in perlsub or
attributes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ambiguous range in
transliteration operator <br>
(F) You wrote something like &quot;tr/a-z-0//&quot; which
doesn&rsquo;t mean anything at all. To include a
&quot;-&quot; character in a transliteration, put it either
first or last. (In the past, <br>
&quot;tr/a-z-0//&quot; was synonymous with
&quot;tr/a-y//&quot;, which was probably not what you would
have expected.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ambiguous use of %s resolved as
%s <br>
(W ambiguous)(S) You said something that may not be
interpreted the way you thought. Normally it&rsquo;s pretty
easy to disambiguate it by supplying a missing quote,
operator, <br>
parenthesis pair or declaration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ambiguous use of %c resolved as
operator %c <br>
(W ambiguous) &quot;%&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;, and
&quot;*&quot; are both infix operators (modulus, bitwise
and, and multiplication) and initial special characters
(denoting hashes, subroutines and <br>
typeglobs), and you said something like &quot;*foo *
foo&quot; that might be interpreted as either of them. We
assumed you meant the infix operator, but please try to make
it more <br>
clear -- in the example given, you might write &quot;*foo *
foo()&quot; if you really meant to multiply a glob by the
result of calling a function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ambiguous use of %c{%s} resolved
to %c%s <br>
(W ambiguous) You wrote something like &quot;@{foo}&quot;,
which might be asking for the variable @foo, or it might be
calling a function named foo, and dereferencing it as an
array <br>
reference. If you wanted the variable, you can just write
@foo. If you wanted to call the function, write
&quot;@{foo()}&quot; ... or you could just not have a
variable and a <br>
function with the same name, and save yourself a lot of
trouble.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ambiguous use of %c{%s[...]}
resolved to %c%s[...] <br>
Ambiguous use of %c{%s{...}} resolved to %c%s{...} <br>
(W ambiguous) You wrote something like &quot;${foo[2]}&quot;
(where foo represents the name of a Perl keyword), which
might be looking for element number 2 of the array named
@foo, in <br>
which case please write $foo[2], or you might have meant to
pass an anonymous arrayref to the function named foo, and
then do a scalar deref on the value it returns. If you <br>
meant that, write &quot;${foo([2])}&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In regular expressions, the
&quot;${foo[2]}&quot; syntax is sometimes necessary to
disambiguate between array subscripts and character classes.
&quot;/$length[2345]/&quot;, for instance, will <br>
be interpreted as $length followed by the character class
&quot;[2345]&quot;. If an array subscript is what you want,
you can avoid the warning by changing
&quot;/${length[2345]}/&quot; to the <br>
unsightly &quot;/${ength[2345]}/&quot;, by renaming your
array to something that does not coincide with a built-in
keyword, or by simply turning off warnings with &quot;no
warnings <br>
&rsquo;ambiguous&rsquo;;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ambiguous use of -%s resolved as
-&amp;%s() <br>
(W ambiguous) You wrote something like &quot;-foo&quot;,
which might be the string &quot;-foo&quot;, or a call to the
function &quot;foo&quot;, negated. If you meant the string,
just write &quot;-foo&quot;. If <br>
you meant the function call, write &quot;-foo()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ambiguous use of
&rsquo;s//le...&rsquo; resolved as &rsquo;s// le...&rsquo;;
Rewrite as &rsquo;s//el&rsquo; if you meant &rsquo;use
locale rules and evaluate rhs as an expression&rsquo;. In
Perl 5.18, it will be resolved the <br>
other way <br>
(W deprecated, ambiguous) You wrote a pattern match with
substitution immediately followed by &quot;le&quot;. In Perl
5.16 and earlier, this is resolved as meaning to take the
result <br>
of the substitution, and see if it is stringwise
less-than-or-equal-to what follows in the expression. Having
the &quot;le&quot; immediately following a pattern is
deprecated <br>
behavior, so in Perl 5.18, this expression will be resolved
as meaning to do the pattern match using the rules of the
current locale, and evaluate the rhs as an expression <br>
when doing the substitution. In 5.14, and 5.16 if you want
the latter interpretation, you can simply write
&quot;el&quot; instead. But note that the &quot;/l&quot;
modifier should not be used <br>
explicitly anyway; you should use &quot;use locale&quot;
instead. See perllocale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;|&rsquo; and
&rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; may not both be specified on command line
<br>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line
redirection, and found that STDIN was a pipe, and that you
also tried to redirect STDIN using &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo;. Only
one <br>
STDIN stream to a customer, please.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;|&rsquo; and
&rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; may not both be specified on command line
<br>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line
redirection, and thinks you tried to redirect stdout both to
a file and into a pipe to another command. You <br>
need to choose one or the other, though nothing&rsquo;s
stopping you from piping into a program or Perl script which
&rsquo;splits&rsquo; output into two streams, such as</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(OUT,&quot;&gt;$ARGV[0]&quot;)
or die &quot;Can&rsquo;t write to $ARGV[0]: $!&quot;; <br>
while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) { <br>
print; <br>
print OUT; <br>
} <br>
close OUT;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Applying %s to %s will act on
scalar(%s) <br>
(W misc) The pattern match (&quot;//&quot;), substitution
(&quot;s///&quot;), and transliteration (&quot;tr///&quot;)
operators work on scalar values. If you apply one of them to
an array or a hash, it <br>
will convert the array or hash to a scalar value (the length
of an array, or the population info of a hash) and then work
on that scalar value. This is probably not what you <br>
meant to do. See &quot;grep&quot; in perlfunc and
&quot;map&quot; in perlfunc for alternatives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arg too short for msgsnd <br>
(F) msgsnd() requires a string at least as long as
sizeof(long).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s argument is not a HASH or
ARRAY element or a subroutine <br>
(F) The argument to exists() must be a hash or array element
or a subroutine with an ampersand, such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$foo{$bar} <br>
$ref-&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12] <br>
&amp;do_something</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s argument is not a HASH or
ARRAY element or slice <br>
(F) The argument to delete() must be either a hash or array
element, such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$foo{$bar} <br>
$ref-&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or a hash or array slice, such
as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@foo[$bar, $baz, $xyzzy] <br>
@{$ref-&gt;[12]}{&quot;susie&quot;, &quot;queue&quot;}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s argument is not a subroutine
name <br>
(F) The argument to exists() for &quot;exists &amp;sub&quot;
must be a subroutine name, and not a subroutine call.
&quot;exists &amp;sub()&quot; will generate this error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Argument &quot;%s&quot;
isn&rsquo;t numeric%s <br>
(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to
an operator that expected a numeric value instead. If
you&rsquo;re fortunate the message will identify which
operator <br>
was so unfortunate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Argument list not closed for
PerlIO layer &quot;%s&quot; <br>
(W layer) When pushing a layer with arguments onto the Perl
I/O system you forgot the ) that closes the argument list.
(Layers take care of transforming data between <br>
external and internal representations.) Perl stopped parsing
the layer list at this point and did not attempt to push
this layer. If your program didn&rsquo;t explicitly request
<br>
the failing operation, it may be the result of the value of
the environment variable PERLIO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Array @%s missing the @ in
argument %d of %s() <br>
(D deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the @ on array
names in some spots. This is now heavily deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">assertion botched: %s <br>
(X) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal
failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assertion failed: file
&quot;%s&quot; <br>
(X) A general assertion failed. The file in question must be
examined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assigning non-zero to $[ is no
longer possible <br>
(F) When the &quot;array_base&quot; feature is disabled
(e.g., under &quot;use v5.16;&quot;) the special variable
$[, which is deprecated, is now a fixed zero value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assignment to both a list and a
scalar <br>
(F) If you assign to a conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd
arguments must either both be scalars or both be lists.
Otherwise Perl won&rsquo;t know which context to supply to
the <br>
right side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A thread exited while %d threads
were running <br>
(W threads)(S) When using threaded Perl, a thread (not
necessarily the main thread) exited while there were still
other threads running. Usually it&rsquo;s a good idea first
to <br>
collect the return values of the created threads by joining
them, and only then to exit from the main thread. See
threads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attempt to access disallowed key
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; in a restricted hash <br>
(F) The failing code has attempted to get or set a key which
is not in the current set of allowed keys of a restricted
hash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attempt to bless into a
reference <br>
(F) The CLASSNAME argument to the bless() operator is
expected to be the name of the package to bless the
resulting object into. You&rsquo;ve supplied instead a
reference to <br>
something: perhaps you wrote</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bless $self, $proto;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">when you intended</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bless $self, ref($proto) ||
$proto;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you actually want to bless
into the stringified version of the reference supplied, you
need to stringify it yourself, for example by:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bless $self,
&quot;$proto&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attempt to clear deleted array
<br>
(S debugging) An array was assigned to when it was being
freed. Freed values are not supposed to be visible to Perl
code. This can also happen if XS code calls
&quot;av_clear&quot; <br>
from a custom magic callback on the array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attempt to delete disallowed key
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; from a restricted hash <br>
(F) The failing code attempted to delete from a restricted
hash a key which is not in its key set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attempt to delete readonly key
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; from a restricted hash <br>
(F) The failing code attempted to delete a key whose value
has been declared readonly from a restricted hash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attempt to free non-arena SV:
0x%x <br>
(S internal) All SV objects are supposed to be allocated
from arenas that will be garbage collected on exit. An SV
was discovered to be outside any of those arenas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attempt to free nonexistent
shared string &rsquo;%s&rsquo;%s <br>
(S internal) Perl maintains a reference-counted internal
table of strings to optimize the storage and access of hash
keys and other strings. This indicates someone tried to <br>
decrement the reference count of a string that can no longer
be found in the table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attempt to free temp
prematurely: SV 0x%x <br>
(S debugging) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by
the free_tmps() routine. This indicates that something else
is freeing the SV before the free_tmps() routine gets <br>
a chance, which means that the free_tmps() routine will be
freeing an unreferenced scalar when it does try to free
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attempt to free unreferenced
glob pointers <br>
(S internal) The reference counts got screwed up on symbol
aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attempt to free unreferenced
scalar: SV 0x%x <br>
(W internal) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a
scalar to see if it would go to 0, and discovered that it
had already gone to 0 earlier, and should have been <br>
freed, and in fact, probably was freed. This could indicate
that SvREFCNT_dec() was called too many times, or that
SvREFCNT_inc() was called too few times, or that the SV <br>
was mortalized when it shouldn&rsquo;t have been, or that
memory has been corrupted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attempt to join self <br>
(F) You tried to join a thread from within itself, which is
an impossible task. You may be joining the wrong thread, or
you may need to move the join() to some other thread.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attempt to pack pointer to
temporary value <br>
(W pack) You tried to pass a temporary value (like the
result of a function, or a computed expression) to the
&quot;p&quot; pack() template. This means the result
contains a pointer <br>
to a location that could become invalid anytime, even before
the end of the current statement. Use literals or global
values as arguments to the &quot;p&quot; pack() template to
avoid <br>
this warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attempt to reload %s aborted.
<br>
(F) You tried to load a file with &quot;use&quot; or
&quot;require&quot; that failed to compile once already.
Perl will not try to compile this file again unless you
delete its entry from %INC. <br>
See &quot;require&quot; in perlfunc and &quot;%INC&quot; in
perlvar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attempt to set length of freed
array <br>
(W) You tried to set the length of an array which has been
freed. You can do this by storing a reference to the scalar
representing the last index of an array and later <br>
assigning through that reference. For example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$r = do {my @a; a}; <br>
$$r = 503</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attempt to use reference as
lvalue in substr <br>
(W substr) You supplied a reference as the first argument to
substr() used as an lvalue, which is pretty strange. Perhaps
you forgot to dereference it first. See &quot;substr&quot;
<br>
in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attribute &quot;locked&quot; is
deprecated <br>
(D deprecated) You have used the attributes pragma to modify
the &quot;locked&quot; attribute on a code reference. The
:locked attribute is obsolete, has had no effect since 5005
<br>
threads were removed, and will be removed in a future
release of Perl 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attribute &quot;unique&quot; is
deprecated <br>
(D deprecated) You have used the attributes pragma to modify
the &quot;unique&quot; attribute on an array, hash or scalar
reference. The :unique attribute has had no effect since
Perl <br>
5.8.8, and will be removed in a future release of Perl
5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">av_reify called on tied array
<br>
(S debugging) This indicates that something went wrong and
Perl got very confused about @_ or @DB::args being tied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bad arg length for %s, is %u,
should be %d <br>
(F) You passed a buffer of the wrong size to one of
msgctl(), semctl() or shmctl(). In C parlance, the correct
sizes are, respectively, sizeof(struct msqid_ds *), <br>
sizeof(struct semid_ds *), and sizeof(struct shmid_ds
*).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bad evalled substitution pattern
<br>
(F) You&rsquo;ve used the &quot;/e&quot; switch to evaluate
the replacement for a substitution, but perl found a syntax
error in the code to evaluate, most likely an unexpected
right brace <br>
&rsquo;}&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bad filehandle: %s <br>
(F) A symbol was passed to something wanting a filehandle,
but the symbol has no filehandle associated with it. Perhaps
you didn&rsquo;t do an open(), or did it in another <br>
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bad free() ignored <br>
(S malloc) An internal routine called free() on something
that had never been malloc()ed in the first place.
Mandatory, but can be disabled by setting environment
variable <br>
&quot;PERL_BADFREE&quot; to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This message can be seen quite
often with DB_File on systems with &quot;hard&quot; dynamic
linking, like &quot;AIX&quot; and &quot;OS/2&quot;. It is a
bug of &quot;Berkeley DB&quot; which is left unnoticed if
&quot;DB&quot; <br>
uses forgiving system malloc().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bad hash <br>
(P) One of the internal hash routines was passed a null HV
pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Badly placed ()&rsquo;s <br>
(A) You&rsquo;ve accidentally run your script through csh
instead of Perl. Check the #! line, or manually feed your
script into Perl yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bad name after %s <br>
(F) You started to name a symbol by using a package prefix,
and then didn&rsquo;t finish the symbol. In particular, you
can&rsquo;t interpolate outside of quotes, so</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$var = &rsquo;myvar&rsquo;; <br>
$sym = mypack::$var;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is not the same as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$var = &rsquo;myvar&rsquo;; <br>
$sym = &quot;mypack::$var&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bad plugin affecting keyword
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; <br>
(F) An extension using the keyword plugin mechanism violated
the plugin API.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bad realloc() ignored <br>
(S malloc) An internal routine called realloc() on something
that had never been malloc()ed in the first place.
Mandatory, but can be disabled by setting the environment
<br>
variable &quot;PERL_BADFREE&quot; to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bad symbol for array <br>
(P) An internal request asked to add an array entry to
something that wasn&rsquo;t a symbol table entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bad symbol for dirhandle <br>
(P) An internal request asked to add a dirhandle entry to
something that wasn&rsquo;t a symbol table entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bad symbol for filehandle <br>
(P) An internal request asked to add a filehandle entry to
something that wasn&rsquo;t a symbol table entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bad symbol for hash <br>
(P) An internal request asked to add a hash entry to
something that wasn&rsquo;t a symbol table entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bareword found in conditional
<br>
(W bareword) The compiler found a bareword where it expected
a conditional, which often indicates that an || or
&amp;&amp; was parsed as part of the last argument of the
previous <br>
construct, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open FOO || die;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It may also indicate a
misspelled constant that has been interpreted as a
bareword:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use constant TYPO =&gt; 1; <br>
if (TYOP) { print &quot;foo&quot; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;strict&quot; pragma is
useful in avoiding such errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bareword &quot;%s&quot; not
allowed while &quot;strict subs&quot; in use <br>
(F) With &quot;strict subs&quot; in use, a bareword is only
allowed as a subroutine identifier, in curly brackets or to
the left of the &quot;=&gt;&quot; symbol. Perhaps you need
to predeclare a <br>
subroutine?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bareword &quot;%s&quot; refers
to nonexistent package <br>
(W bareword) You used a qualified bareword of the form
&quot;Foo::&quot;, but the compiler saw no other uses of
that namespace before that point. Perhaps you need to
predeclare a <br>
package?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEGIN failed--compilation
aborted <br>
(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a
BEGIN subroutine. Compilation stops immediately and the
interpreter is exited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEGIN not safe after
errors--compilation aborted <br>
(F) Perl found a &quot;BEGIN {}&quot; subroutine (or a
&quot;use&quot; directive, which implies a &quot;BEGIN
{}&quot;) after one or more compilation errors had already
occurred. Since the intended <br>
environment for the &quot;BEGIN {}&quot; could not be
guaranteed (due to the errors), and since subsequent code
likely depends on its correct operation, Perl just gave
up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 better written as $1 <br>
(W syntax) Outside of patterns, backreferences live on as
variables. The use of backslashes is grandfathered on the
right-hand side of a substitution, but stylistically
it&rsquo;s <br>
better to use the variable form because other Perl
programmers will expect it, and it works better if there are
more than 9 backreferences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Binary number &gt;
0b11111111111111111111111111111111 non-portable <br>
(W portable) The binary number you specified is larger than
2**32-1 (4294967295) and therefore non-portable between
systems. See perlport for more on portability concerns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind() on closed socket %s <br>
(W closed) You tried to do a bind on a closed socket. Did
you forget to check the return value of your socket() call?
See &quot;bind&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">binmode() on closed filehandle
%s <br>
(W unopened) You tried binmode() on a filehandle that was
never opened. Check your control flow and number of
arguments. &quot; i s d e p r e c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;a t e d ; u s e &quot;
<br>
&quot;0 <br>
(W deprecated, regexp) Use of an unescaped &quot;{&quot;o
immediately following a &quot;r0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bit vector size &gt; 32
non-portable <br>
(W portable) Using bit vector sizes larger than 32 is
non-portable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bizarre copy of %s <br>
(P) Perl detected an attempt to copy an internal value that
is not copiable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Buffer overflow in
prime_env_iter: %s <br>
(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS. While Perl was
preparing to iterate over %ENV, it encountered a logical
name or symbol definition which was too long, so it was <br>
truncated to the string shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bizarre SvTYPE [%d] <br>
(P) When starting a new thread or return values from a
thread, Perl encountered an invalid data type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Callback called exit <br>
(F) A subroutine invoked from an external package via
call_sv() exited by calling exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s() called too early to check
prototype <br>
(W prototype) You&rsquo;ve called a function that has a
prototype before the parser saw a definition or declaration
for it, and Perl could not check that the call conforms to
the <br>
prototype. You need to either add an early prototype
declaration for the subroutine in question, or move the
subroutine definition ahead of the call to get proper
prototype <br>
checking. Alternatively, if you are certain that
you&rsquo;re calling the function correctly, you may put an
ampersand before the name to avoid the warning. See
perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cannot compress integer in pack
<br>
(F) An argument to pack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was too large to
compress. The BER compressed integer format can only be used
with positive integers, and you attempted to compress
Infinity <br>
or a very large number (&gt; 1e308). See &quot;pack&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cannot compress negative numbers
in pack <br>
(F) An argument to pack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was negative. The
BER compressed integer format can only be used with positive
integers. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cannot convert a reference to %s
to typeglob <br>
(F) You manipulated Perl&rsquo;s symbol table directly,
stored a reference in it, then tried to access that symbol
via conventional Perl syntax. The access triggers Perl to
<br>
autovivify that typeglob, but it there is no legal
conversion from that type of reference to a typeglob.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cannot copy to %s <br>
(P) Perl detected an attempt to copy a value to an internal
type that cannot be directly assigned to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cannot find encoding
&quot;%s&quot; <br>
(S io) You tried to apply an encoding that did not exist to
a filehandle, either with open() or binmode().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cannot set tied @DB::args <br>
(F) &quot;caller&quot; tried to set @DB::args, but found it
tied. Tying @DB::args is not supported. (Before this error
was added, it used to crash.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cannot tie unreifiable array
<br>
(P) You somehow managed to call &quot;tie&quot; on an array
that does not keep a reference count on its arguments and
cannot be made to do so. Such arrays are not even supposed
to be <br>
accessible to Perl code, but are only used internally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can only compress unsigned
integers in pack <br>
(F) An argument to pack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was not an
integer. The BER compressed integer format can only be used
with positive integers, and you attempted to compress
something else. <br>
See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t bless non-reference
value <br>
(F) Only hard references may be blessed. This is how Perl
&quot;enforces&quot; encapsulation of objects. See
perlobj.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t &quot;break&quot; in
a loop topicalizer <br>
(F) You called &quot;break&quot;, but you&rsquo;re in a
&quot;foreach&quot; block rather than a &quot;given&quot;
block. You probably meant to use &quot;next&quot; or
&quot;last&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t &quot;break&quot;
outside a given block <br>
(F) You called &quot;break&quot;, but you&rsquo;re not
inside a &quot;given&quot; block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t call method
&quot;%s&quot; on an undefined value <br>
(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot
filled by the object reference or package name contains an
undefined value. Something like this will reproduce the <br>
error:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$BADREF = undef; <br>
process $BADREF 1,2,3; <br>
$BADREF-&gt;process(1,2,3);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t call method
&quot;%s&quot; on unblessed reference <br>
(F) A method call must know in what package it&rsquo;s
supposed to run. It ordinarily finds this out from the
object reference you supply, but you didn&rsquo;t supply an
object <br>
reference in this case. A reference isn&rsquo;t an object
reference until it has been blessed. See perlobj.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t call method
&quot;%s&quot; without a package or object reference <br>
(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot
filled by the object reference or package name contains an
expression that returns a defined value which is neither an
<br>
object reference nor a package name. Something like this
will reproduce the error:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$BADREF = 42; <br>
process $BADREF 1,2,3; <br>
$BADREF-&gt;process(1,2,3);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t chdir to %s <br>
(F) You called &quot;perl -x/foo/bar&quot;, but
&quot;/foo/bar&quot; is not a directory that you can chdir
to, possibly because it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t check filesystem of
script &quot;%s&quot; for nosuid <br>
(P) For some reason you can&rsquo;t check the filesystem of
the script for nosuid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t coerce %s to %s in
%s <br>
(F) Certain types of SVs, in particular real symbol table
entries (typeglobs), can&rsquo;t be forced to stop being
what they are. So you can&rsquo;t say things like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*foo += 1;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You CAN say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$foo = *foo; <br>
$foo += 1;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but then $foo no longer contains
a glob.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t &quot;continue&quot;
outside a when block <br>
(F) You called &quot;continue&quot;, but you&rsquo;re not
inside a &quot;when&quot; or &quot;default&quot; block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t create pipe mailbox
<br>
(P) An error peculiar to VMS. The process is suffering from
exhausted quotas or other plumbing problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t declare %s in
&quot;%s&quot; <br>
(F) Only scalar, array, and hash variables may be declared
as &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot; or &quot;state&quot;
variables. They must have ordinary identifiers as names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t &quot;default&quot;
outside a topicalizer <br>
(F) You have used a &quot;default&quot; block that is
neither inside a &quot;foreach&quot; loop nor a
&quot;given&quot; block. (Note that this error is issued on
exit from the &quot;default&quot; block, so you <br>
won&rsquo;t get the error if you use an explicit
&quot;continue&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t do inplace edit: %s
is not a regular file <br>
(S inplace) You tried to use the -i switch on a special
file, such as a file in /dev, or a FIFO. The file was
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t do inplace edit on
%s: %s <br>
(S inplace) The creation of the new file failed for the
indicated reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t do inplace edit
without backup <br>
(F) You&rsquo;re on a system such as MS-DOS that gets
confused if you try reading from a deleted (but still
opened) file. You have to say &quot;-i.bak&quot;, or some
such.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t do inplace edit: %s
would not be unique <br>
(S inplace) Your filesystem does not support filenames
longer than 14 characters and Perl was unable to create a
unique filename during inplace editing with the -i switch.
<br>
The file was ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t do {n,m} with n &gt;
m in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(F) Minima must be less than or equal to maxima. If you
really want your regexp to match something 0 times, just put
{0}. The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression about
<br>
where the problem was discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t do waitpid with
flags <br>
(F) This machine doesn&rsquo;t have either waitpid() or
wait4(), so only waitpid() without flags is emulated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t emulate -%s on #!
line <br>
(F) The #! line specifies a switch that doesn&rsquo;t make
sense at this point. For example, it&rsquo;d be kind of
silly to put a -x on the #! line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t %s %s-endian %ss on
this platform <br>
(F) Your platform&rsquo;s byte-order is neither big-endian
nor little-endian, or it has a very strange pointer size.
Packing and unpacking big- or little-endian floating point
<br>
values and pointers may not be possible. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t exec &quot;%s&quot;:
%s <br>
(W exec) A system(), exec(), or piped open call could not
execute the named program for the indicated reason. Typical
reasons include: the permissions were wrong on the <br>
file, the file wasn&rsquo;t found in $ENV{PATH}, the
executable in question was compiled for another
architecture, or the #! line in a script points to an
interpreter that can&rsquo;t be <br>
run for similar reasons. (Or maybe your system doesn&rsquo;t
support #! at all.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t exec %s <br>
(F) Perl was trying to execute the indicated program for you
because that&rsquo;s what the #! line said. If that&rsquo;s
not what you wanted, you may need to mention
&quot;perl&quot; on the #! <br>
line somewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t execute %s <br>
(F) You used the -S switch, but the copies of the script to
execute found in the PATH did not have correct
permissions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t find an opnumber for
&quot;%s&quot; <br>
(F) A string of a form &quot;CORE::word&quot; was given to
prototype(), but there is no builtin with the name
&quot;word&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t find %s character
property &quot;%s&quot; <br>
(F) You used &quot;{}&quot; or &quot;P{}&quot; but the
character property by that name could not be found. Maybe
you misspelled the name of the property? See
&quot;Properties accessible through <br>
{} and P{}&quot; in perluniprops for a complete list of
available properties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t find label %s <br>
(F) You said to goto a label that isn&rsquo;t mentioned
anywhere that it&rsquo;s possible for us to go to. See
&quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t find %s on PATH <br>
(F) You used the -S switch, but the script to execute could
not be found in the PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t find %s on PATH,
&rsquo;.&rsquo; not in PATH <br>
(F) You used the -S switch, but the script to execute could
not be found in the PATH, or at least not with the correct
permissions. The script exists in the current <br>
directory, but PATH prohibits running it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t find string
terminator %s anywhere before EOF <br>
(F) Perl strings can stretch over multiple lines. This
message means that the closing delimiter was omitted.
Because bracketed quotes count nesting levels, the following
is <br>
missing its final parenthesis:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print q(The character
&rsquo;(&rsquo; starts a side comment.);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re getting this
error from a here-document, you may have included unseen
whitespace before or after your closing tag or there may not
be a linebreak after it. A good <br>
programmer&rsquo;s editor will have a way to help you find
these characters (or lack of characters). See perlop for the
full details on here-documents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t find Unicode
property definition &quot;%s&quot; <br>
(F) You may have tried to use &quot;&quot; which means a
Unicode property (for example &quot;{Lu}&quot; matches all
uppercase letters). If you did mean to use a Unicode
property, see <br>
&quot;Properties accessible through {} and P{}&quot; in
perluniprops for a complete list of available properties. If
you didn&rsquo;t mean to use a Unicode property, escape the
&quot;&quot;, <br>
either by &quot;\p&quot; (just the &quot;&quot;) or by
&quot;Q&quot; (the rest of the string, or until &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t fork: %s <br>
(F) A fatal error occurred while trying to fork while
opening a pipeline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t fork, trying again
in 5 seconds <br>
(W pipe) A fork in a piped open failed with EAGAIN and will
be retried after five seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t get filespec - stale
stat buffer? <br>
(S) A warning peculiar to VMS. This arises because of the
difference between access checks under VMS and under the
Unix model Perl assumes. Under VMS, access checks are <br>
done by filename, rather than by bits in the stat buffer, so
that ACLs and other protections can be taken into account.
Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer <br>
contains all the necessary information, and passes it,
instead of the filespec, to the access-checking routine. It
will try to retrieve the filespec using the device name <br>
and FID present in the stat buffer, but this works only if
you haven&rsquo;t made a subsequent call to the CRTL stat()
routine, because the device name is overwritten with each
<br>
call. If this warning appears, the name lookup failed, and
the access-checking routine gave up and returned FALSE, just
to be conservative. (Note: The access-checking <br>
routine knows about the Perl &quot;stat&quot; operator and
file tests, so you shouldn&rsquo;t ever see this warning in
response to a Perl command; it arises only if some internal
code takes <br>
stat buffers lightly.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t get pipe mailbox
device name <br>
(P) An error peculiar to VMS. After creating a mailbox to
act as a pipe, Perl can&rsquo;t retrieve its name for later
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t get SYSGEN parameter
value for MAXBUF <br>
(P) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl asked $GETSYI how big you
want your mailbox buffers to be, and didn&rsquo;t get an
answer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t &quot;goto&quot;
into the middle of a foreach loop <br>
(F) A &quot;goto&quot; statement was executed to jump into
the middle of a foreach loop. You can&rsquo;t get there from
here. See &quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t &quot;goto&quot; out
of a pseudo block <br>
(F) A &quot;goto&quot; statement was executed to jump out of
what might look like a block, except that it isn&rsquo;t a
proper block. This usually occurs if you tried to jump out
of a <br>
sort() block or subroutine, which is a no-no. See
&quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t goto subroutine from
a sort sub (or similar callback) <br>
(F) The &quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can&rsquo;t be used
to jump out of the comparison sub for a sort(), or from a
similar callback (such as the reduce() function in
List::Util).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t goto subroutine from
an eval-%s <br>
(F) The &quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can&rsquo;t be used
to jump out of an eval &quot;string&quot; or block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t goto subroutine
outside a subroutine <br>
(F) The deeply magical &quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can
only replace one subroutine call for another. It can&rsquo;t
manufacture one out of whole cloth. In general you should be
<br>
calling it out of only an AUTOLOAD routine anyway. See
&quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t ignore signal CHLD,
forcing to default <br>
(W signal) Perl has detected that it is being run with the
SIGCHLD signal (sometimes known as SIGCLD) disabled. Since
disabling this signal will interfere with proper <br>
determination of exit status of child processes, Perl has
reset the signal to its default value. This situation
typically indicates that the parent program under which Perl
<br>
may be running (e.g. cron) is being very careless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t kill a non-numeric
process ID <br>
(F) Process identifiers must be (signed) integers. It is a
fatal error to attempt to kill() an undefined, empty-string
or otherwise non-numeric process identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t &quot;last&quot;
outside a loop block <br>
(F) A &quot;last&quot; statement was executed to break out
of the current block, except that there&rsquo;s this itty
bitty problem called there isn&rsquo;t a current block. Note
that an &quot;if&quot; or <br>
&quot;else&quot; block doesn&rsquo;t count as a
&quot;loopish&quot; block, as doesn&rsquo;t a block given to
sort(), map() or grep(). You can usually double the curlies
to get the same effect though, <br>
because the inner curlies will be considered a block that
loops once. See &quot;last&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t linearize anonymous
symbol table <br>
(F) Perl tried to calculate the method resolution order
(MRO) of a package, but failed because the package stash has
no name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t load
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; for module %s <br>
(F) The module you tried to load failed to load a dynamic
extension. This may either mean that you upgraded your
version of perl to one that is incompatible with your old
<br>
dynamic extensions (which is known to happen between major
versions of perl), or (more likely) that your dynamic
extension was built against an older version of the library
<br>
that is installed on your system. You may need to rebuild
your old dynamic extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t localize lexical
variable %s <br>
(F) You used local on a variable name that was previously
declared as a lexical variable using &quot;my&quot; or
&quot;state&quot;. This is not allowed. If you want to
localize a package <br>
variable of the same name, qualify it with the package
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t localize through a
reference <br>
(F) You said something like &quot;local $$ref&quot;, which
Perl can&rsquo;t currently handle, because when it goes to
restore the old value of whatever $ref pointed to after the
scope of the <br>
local() is finished, it can&rsquo;t be sure that $ref will
still be a reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t locate %s <br>
(F) You said to &quot;do&quot; (or &quot;require&quot;, or
&quot;use&quot;) a file that couldn&rsquo;t be found. Perl
looks for the file in all the locations mentioned in @INC,
unless the file name included <br>
the full path to the file. Perhaps you need to set the
PERL5LIB or PERL5OPT environment variable to say where the
extra library is, or maybe the script needs to add the <br>
library name to @INC. Or maybe you just misspelled the name
of the file. See &quot;require&quot; in perlfunc and
lib.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t locate auto/%s.al in
@INC <br>
(F) A function (or method) was called in a package which
allows autoload, but there is no function to autoload. Most
probable causes are a misprint in a function/method name
<br>
or a failure to &quot;AutoSplit&quot; the file, say, by
doing &quot;make install&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t locate loadable
object for module %s in @INC <br>
(F) The module you loaded is trying to load an external
library, like for example, foo.so or bar.dll, but the
DynaLoader module was unable to locate this library. See
<br>
DynaLoader.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t locate object method
&quot;%s&quot; via package &quot;%s&quot; <br>
(F) You called a method correctly, and it correctly
indicated a package functioning as a class, but that package
doesn&rsquo;t define that particular method, nor does any of
its <br>
base classes. See perlobj.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t locate package %s
for @%s::ISA <br>
(W syntax) The @ISA array contained the name of another
package that doesn&rsquo;t seem to exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t locate PerlIO%s <br>
(F) You tried to use in open() a PerlIO layer that does not
exist, e.g. open(FH, &quot;&gt;:nosuchlayer&quot;,
&quot;somefile&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t make list assignment
to %ENV on this system <br>
(F) List assignment to %ENV is not supported on some
systems, notably VMS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t modify %s in %s <br>
(F) You aren&rsquo;t allowed to assign to the item
indicated, or otherwise try to change it, such as with an
auto-increment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t modify nonexistent
substring <br>
(P) The internal routine that does assignment to a substr()
was handed a NULL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t modify non-lvalue
subroutine call <br>
(F) Subroutines meant to be used in lvalue context should be
declared as such. See &quot;Lvalue subroutines&quot; in
perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t msgrcv to read-only
var <br>
(F) The target of a msgrcv must be modifiable to be used as
a receive buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t &quot;next&quot;
outside a loop block <br>
(F) A &quot;next&quot; statement was executed to reiterate
the current block, but there isn&rsquo;t a current block.
Note that an &quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block
doesn&rsquo;t count as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as <br>
doesn&rsquo;t a block given to sort(), map() or grep(). You
can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block
that <br>
loops once. See &quot;next&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t open %s <br>
(F) You tried to run a perl built with MAD support with the
PERL_XMLDUMP environment variable set, but the file named by
that variable could not be opened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t open %s: %s <br>
(S inplace) The implicit opening of a file through use of
the &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; filehandle, either implicitly under
the &quot;-n&quot; or &quot;-p&quot; command-line switches,
or explicitly, failed for the <br>
indicated reason. Usually this is because you don&rsquo;t
have read permission for a file which you named on the
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(F) You tried to call perl with
the -e switch, but /dev/null (or your operating
system&rsquo;s equivalent) could not be opened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t open a reference
<br>
(W io) You tried to open a scalar reference for reading or
writing, using the 3-arg open() syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open FH, &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo;,
$ref;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but your version of perl is
compiled without perlio, and this form of open is not
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t open bidirectional
pipe <br>
(W pipe) You tried to say &quot;open(CMD,
&quot;|cmd|&quot;)&quot;, which is not supported. You can
try any of several modules in the Perl library to do this,
such as IPC::Open2. Alternately, <br>
direct the pipe&rsquo;s output to a file using
&quot;&gt;&quot;, and then read it in under a different file
handle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t open error file %s
as stderr <br>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn&rsquo;t open the file specified
after &rsquo;2&gt;&rsquo; or &rsquo;2&gt;&gt;&rsquo; on the
command line for writing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t open input file %s
as stdin <br>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn&rsquo;t open the file specified
after &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; on the command line for
reading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t open output file %s
as stdout <br>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn&rsquo;t open the file specified
after &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; or &rsquo;&gt;&gt;&rsquo; on the
command line for writing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t open output pipe
(name: %s) <br>
(P) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn&rsquo;t open the pipe into which to
send data destined for stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t open perl script
&quot;%s&quot;: %s <br>
(F) The script you specified can&rsquo;t be opened for the
indicated reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re debugging a
script that uses #!, and normally relies on the
shell&rsquo;s $PATH search, the -S option causes perl to do
that search, so you don&rsquo;t have to type the path or
<br>
&quot;&lsquo;which $scriptname&lsquo;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t read CRTL environ
<br>
(S) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl tried to read an element
of %ENV from the CRTL&rsquo;s internal environment array and
discovered the array was missing. You need to figure out
<br>
where your CRTL misplaced its environ or define
PERL_ENV_TABLES (see perlvms) so that environ is not
searched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t &quot;redo&quot;
outside a loop block <br>
(F) A &quot;redo&quot; statement was executed to restart the
current block, but there isn&rsquo;t a current block. Note
that an &quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block
doesn&rsquo;t count as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as <br>
doesn&rsquo;t a block given to sort(), map() or grep(). You
can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block
that <br>
loops once. See &quot;redo&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t remove %s: %s,
skipping file <br>
(S inplace) You requested an inplace edit without creating a
backup file. Perl was unable to remove the original file to
replace it with the modified file. The file was <br>
left unmodified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t rename %s to %s: %s,
skipping file <br>
(S inplace) The rename done by the -i switch failed for some
reason, probably because you don&rsquo;t have write
permission to the directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t reopen input pipe
(name: %s) in binary mode <br>
(P) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl thought stdin was a pipe,
and tried to reopen it to accept binary data. Alas, it
failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t reset %ENV on this
system <br>
(F) You called &quot;reset(&rsquo;E&rsquo;)&quot; or
similar, which tried to reset all variables in the current
package beginning with &quot;E&quot;. In the main package,
that includes %ENV. Resetting <br>
%ENV is not supported on some systems, notably VMS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t resolve method
&quot;%s&quot; overloading &quot;%s&quot; in package
&quot;%s&quot; <br>
(F)(P) Error resolving overloading specified by a method
name (as opposed to a subroutine reference): no such method
callable via the package. If the method name is
&quot;???&quot;, <br>
this is an internal error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t return %s from
lvalue subroutine <br>
(F) Perl detected an attempt to return illegal lvalues (such
as temporary or readonly values) from a subroutine used as
an lvalue. This is not allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t return outside a
subroutine <br>
(F) The return statement was executed in mainline code, that
is, where there was no subroutine call to return out of. See
perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t return %s to lvalue
scalar context <br>
(F) You tried to return a complete array or hash from an
lvalue subroutine, but you called the subroutine in a way
that made Perl think you meant to return only one value.
<br>
You probably meant to write parentheses around the call to
the subroutine, which tell Perl that the call should be in
list context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t stat script
&quot;%s&quot; <br>
(P) For some reason you can&rsquo;t fstat() the script even
though you have it open already. Bizarre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t take log of %g <br>
(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can&rsquo;t take the
logarithm of a negative number or zero. There&rsquo;s a
Math::Complex package that comes standard with Perl, though,
if you <br>
really want to do that for the negative numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t take sqrt of %g <br>
(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can&rsquo;t take the
square root of a negative number. There&rsquo;s a
Math::Complex package that comes standard with Perl, though,
if you really want <br>
to do that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t undef active
subroutine <br>
(F) You can&rsquo;t undefine a routine that&rsquo;s
currently running. You can, however, redefine it while
it&rsquo;s running, and you can even undef the redefined
subroutine while the old <br>
routine is running. Go figure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t upgrade %s (%d) to
%d <br>
(P) The internal sv_upgrade routine adds &quot;members&quot;
to an SV, making it into a more specialized kind of SV. The
top several SV types are so specialized, however, that they
<br>
cannot be interconverted. This message indicates that such a
conversion was attempted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t use &rsquo;%c&rsquo;
after -mname <br>
(F) You tried to call perl with the -m switch, but you put
something other than &quot;=&quot; after the module
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t use anonymous symbol
table for method lookup <br>
(F) The internal routine that does method lookup was handed
a symbol table that doesn&rsquo;t have a name. Symbol tables
can become anonymous for example by undefining stashes: <br>
&quot;undef %Some::Package::&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t use an undefined
value as %s reference <br>
(F) A value used as either a hard reference or a symbolic
reference must be a defined value. This helps to delurk some
insidious errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t use bareword
(&quot;%s&quot;) as %s ref while &quot;strict refs&quot; in
use <br>
(F) Only hard references are allowed by &quot;strict
refs&quot;. Symbolic references are disallowed. See
perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t use %! because
Errno.pm is not available <br>
(F) The first time the &quot;%!&quot; hash is used, perl
automatically loads the Errno.pm module. The Errno module is
expected to tie the %! hash to provide symbolic names for $!
<br>
errno values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t use both
&rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; and &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; after type
&rsquo;%c&rsquo; in %s <br>
(F) A type cannot be forced to have both big-endian and
little-endian byte-order at the same time, so this
combination of modifiers is not allowed. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t use %s for loop
variable <br>
(F) Only a simple scalar variable may be used as a loop
variable on a foreach.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t use global %s in
&quot;%s&quot; <br>
(F) You tried to declare a magical variable as a lexical
variable. This is not allowed, because the magic can be tied
to only one location (namely the global variable) and <br>
it would be incredibly confusing to have variables in your
program that looked like magical variables but
weren&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t use &rsquo;%c&rsquo;
in a group with different byte-order in %s <br>
(F) You attempted to force a different byte-order on a type
that is already inside a group with a byte-order modifier.
For example you cannot force little-endianness on a <br>
type that is inside a big-endian group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t use &quot;my
%s&quot; in sort comparison <br>
(F) The global variables $a and $b are reserved for sort
comparisons. You mentioned $a or $b in the same line as the
&lt;=&gt; or cmp operator, and the variable had earlier been
<br>
declared as a lexical variable. Either qualify the sort
variable with the package name, or rename the lexical
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t use %s ref as %s ref
<br>
(F) You&rsquo;ve mixed up your reference types. You have to
dereference a reference of the type needed. You can use the
ref() function to test the type of the reference, if need
<br>
be.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t use string
(&quot;%s&quot;) as %s ref while &quot;strict refs&quot; in
use <br>
(F) Only hard references are allowed by &quot;strict
refs&quot;. Symbolic references are disallowed. See
perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t use subscript on %s
<br>
(F) The compiler tried to interpret a bracketed expression
as a subscript. But to the left of the brackets was an
expression that didn&rsquo;t look like a hash or array
reference, <br>
or anything else subscriptable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t use c to mean $%c in
expression <br>
(W syntax) In an ordinary expression, backslash is a unary
operator that creates a reference to its argument. The use
of backslash to indicate a backreference to a matched <br>
substring is valid only as part of a regular expression
pattern. Trying to do this in ordinary Perl code produces a
value that prints out looking like SCALAR(0xdecaf). Use <br>
the $1 form instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t weaken a
nonreference <br>
(F) You attempted to weaken something that was not a
reference. Only references can be weakened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t &quot;when&quot;
outside a topicalizer <br>
(F) You have used a when() block that is neither inside a
&quot;foreach&quot; loop nor a &quot;given&quot; block.
(Note that this error is issued on exit from the
&quot;when&quot; block, so you won&rsquo;t get <br>
the error if the match fails, or if you use an explicit
&quot;continue&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t x= to read-only
value <br>
(F) You tried to repeat a constant value (often the
undefined value) with an assignment operator, which implies
modifying the value itself. Perhaps you need to copy the
<br>
value to a temporary, and repeat that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character following &quot; (F)(W
deprecated, syntax) In &quot; character this evaluates to is
derived by exclusive or&rsquo;ing the code point of this
character with 0x40.</p>

closure is created. This subroutine cannot be <br>
called.</p>

(W regexp) The regular expression engine uses recursion in

(W threads) Within a thread-enabled program, you tried to
call cond_broadcast() on a variable which wasn&rsquo;t

becomes true in several non-obvious circumstances, including
iterators, weak references, stash names, even <br>
remaining true after &quot;undef %hash&quot;. These things
make &quot;defined %hash&quot; fairly useless in
practice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a check for non-empty is what
you wanted then just put it in boolean context (see
&quot;Scalar values&quot; in perldata):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (%hash) { <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you had &quot;defined

etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(?(DEFINE)....) does not allow
branches in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(F) You used something like &quot;(?(DEFINE)...|..)&quot;
which is illegal. The most likely cause of this error is
that you left out a parenthesis inside of the
&quot;....&quot; part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;-- HERE shows in the

discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s defines neither package nor

(F) You said something like &quot;use Module 42&quot; but in
the Module file there are neither package declarations nor a
$VERSION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delimiter for here document is
too long <br>
(F) In a here document construct like
&quot;&lt;&lt;FOO&quot;, the label &quot;FOO&quot; is too
long for Perl to handle. You have to be seriously twisted to
write code that triggers this error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deprecated character in 
marked by &lt;-- HERE in &lt;-- HERE %s <br>
(D deprecated) Just about anything is legal for the
&quot;...&quot; in &quot; But starting in 5.12,
non-reasonable ones that don&rsquo;t look like names are
deprecated. A reasonable <br>
name begins with an alphabetic character and continues with
any combination of alphanumerics, dashes, spaces,
parentheses or colons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deprecated use of my() in false
conditional <br>
(D deprecated) You used a declaration similar to &quot;my $x
if 0&quot;. There has been a long-standing bug in Perl that
causes a lexical variable not to be cleared at scope exit
when <br>
its declaration includes a false conditional. Some people
have exploited this bug to achieve a kind of static
variable. Since we intend to fix this bug, we don&rsquo;t
want <br>
people relying on this behavior. You can achieve a similar
static effect by declaring the variable in a separate block
outside the function, eg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub f { my $x if 0; return $x++
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">becomes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ my $x; sub f { return $x++ }
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beginning with perl 5.9.4, you
can also use &quot;state&quot; variables to have lexicals
that are initialized only once (see feature):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub f { state $x; return $x++
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESTROY created new reference to
dead object &rsquo;%s&rsquo; <br>
(F) A DESTROY() method created a new reference to the object
which is just being DESTROYed. Perl is confused, and prefers
to abort rather than to create a dangling <br>
reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Did not produce a valid header
<br>
See Server error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s did not return a true value
<br>
(F) A required (or used) file must return a true value to
indicate that it compiled correctly and ran its
initialization code correctly. It&rsquo;s traditional to end
such a file <br>
with a &quot;1;&quot;, though any true value would do. See
&quot;require&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Did you mean &amp;%s instead?)
<br>
(W misc) You probably referred to an imported subroutine
&amp;FOO as $FOO or some such.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Did you mean &quot;local&quot;
instead of &quot;our&quot;?) <br>
(W misc) Remember that &quot;our&quot; does not localize the
declared global variable. You have declared it again in the
same lexical scope, which seems superfluous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Did you mean $ or @ instead of
%?) <br>
(W) You probably said %hash{$key} when you meant $hash{$key}
or @hash{@keys}. On the other hand, maybe you just meant
%hash and got carried away.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Died <br>
(F) You passed die() an empty string (the equivalent of
&quot;die &quot;&quot;&quot;) or you called it with no args
and $@ was empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Document contains no data <br>
See Server error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s does not define
%s::VERSION--version check failed <br>

the Module did not define a &quot;$VERSION.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;/&rsquo; does not take a

(F) You cannot put a repeat count of any kind right after
the &rsquo;/&rsquo; code. See &quot;pack&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t know how to handle
magic of type &rsquo;%s&rsquo; <br>
(P) The internal handling of magical variables has been
cursed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">do_study: out of memory <br>
(P) This should have been caught by safemalloc()
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Do you need to predeclare %s?)
<br>
(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction
with the message &quot;%s found where operator
expected&quot;. It often means a subroutine or module name
is being referenced <br>
that hasn&rsquo;t been declared yet. This may be because of
ordering problems in your file, or because of a missing
&quot;sub&quot;, &quot;package&quot;, &quot;require&quot;,
or &quot;use&quot; statement. If you&rsquo;re <br>
referencing something that isn&rsquo;t defined yet, you
don&rsquo;t actually have to define the subroutine or
package before the current location. You can use an empty
&quot;sub foo;&quot; or <br>
&quot;package FOO;&quot; to enter a &quot;forward&quot;
declaration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump() better written as
CORE::dump() <br>
(W misc) You used the obsolescent &quot;dump()&quot;
built-in function, without fully qualifying it as
&quot;CORE::dump()&quot;. Maybe it&rsquo;s a typo. See
&quot;dump&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump is not supported <br>
(F) Your machine doesn&rsquo;t support dump/undump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Duplicate free() ignored <br>
(S malloc) An internal routine called free() on something
that had already been freed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Duplicate modifier
&rsquo;%c&rsquo; after &rsquo;%c&rsquo; in %s <br>
(W) You have applied the same modifier more than once after
a type in a pack template. See &quot;pack&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">elseif should be elsif <br>
(S syntax) There is no keyword &quot;elseif&quot; in Perl
because Larry thinks it&rsquo;s ugly. Your code will be
interpreted as an attempt to call a method named
&quot;elseif&quot; for the class <br>
returned by the following block. This is unlikely to be what
you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Empty %s <br>
(F) &quot;&quot; and &quot;P&quot; are used to introduce a
named Unicode property, as described in perlunicode and
perlre. You used &quot;&quot; or &quot;P&quot; in a regular
expression without specifying <br>
the property name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">entering effective %s failed
<br>
(F) While under the &quot;use filetest&quot; pragma,
switching the real and effective uids or gids failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%ENV is aliased to %s <br>
(F) You&rsquo;re running under taint mode, and the %ENV
variable has been aliased to another hash, so it
doesn&rsquo;t reflect anymore the state of the
program&rsquo;s environment. This is <br>
potentially insecure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Error converting file
specification %s <br>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Because Perl may have to deal
with file specifications in either VMS or Unix syntax, it
converts them to a single form when it must operate on <br>
them directly. Either you&rsquo;ve passed an invalid file
specification to Perl, or you&rsquo;ve found a case the
conversion routines don&rsquo;t handle. Drat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s: Eval-group in insecure
regular expression <br>
(F) Perl detected tainted data when trying to compile a
regular expression that contains the &quot;(?{ ... })&quot;
zero-width assertion, which is unsafe. See &quot;(?{ code
})&quot; in perlre, <br>
and perlsec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s: Eval-group not allowed at
runtime, use re &rsquo;eval&rsquo; <br>
(F) Perl tried to compile a regular expression containing
the &quot;(?{ ... })&quot; zero-width assertion at run time,
as it would when the pattern contains interpolated values.
Since <br>
that is a security risk, it is not allowed. If you insist,
you may still do this by using the &quot;re
&rsquo;eval&rsquo;&quot; pragma or by explicitly building
the pattern from an interpolated <br>
string at run time and using that in an eval(). See
&quot;(?{ code })&quot; in perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s: Eval-group not allowed, use
re &rsquo;eval&rsquo; <br>
(F) A regular expression contained the &quot;(?{ ...
})&quot; zero-width assertion, but that construct is only
allowed when the &quot;use re &rsquo;eval&rsquo;&quot;
pragma is in effect. See &quot;(?{ code })&quot; <br>
in perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EVAL without pos change exceeded
limit in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(F) You used a pattern that nested too many EVAL calls
without consuming any text. Restructure the pattern so that
text is consumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;-- HERE shows in the
regular expression about where the problem was
discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Excessively long &lt;&gt;
operator <br>
(F) The contents of a &lt;&gt; operator may not exceed the
maximum size of a Perl identifier. If you&rsquo;re just
trying to glob a long list of filenames, try using the
glob() <br>
operator, or put the filenames into a variable and glob
that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec? I&rsquo;m not *that* kind
of operating system <br>
(F) The &quot;exec&quot; function is not implemented on some
systems, e.g., Symbian OS. See perlport.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Execution of %s aborted due to
compilation errors. <br>
(F) The final summary message when a Perl compilation
fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exiting eval via %s <br>
(W exiting) You are exiting an eval by unconventional means,
such as a goto, or a loop control statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exiting format via %s <br>
(W exiting) You are exiting a format by unconventional
means, such as a goto, or a loop control statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exiting pseudo-block via %s <br>
(W exiting) You are exiting a rather special block construct
(like a sort block or subroutine) by unconventional means,
such as a goto, or a loop control statement. See <br>
&quot;sort&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exiting subroutine via %s <br>
(W exiting) You are exiting a subroutine by unconventional
means, such as a goto, or a loop control statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exiting substitution via %s <br>
(W exiting) You are exiting a substitution by unconventional
means, such as a return, a goto, or a loop control
statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Explicit blessing to
&rsquo;&rsquo; (assuming package main) <br>
(W misc) You are blessing a reference to a zero length
string. This has the effect of blessing the reference into
the package main. This is usually not what you want. <br>
Consider providing a default target package, e.g.
bless($ref, $p || &rsquo;MyPackage&rsquo;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s: Expression syntax <br>
(A) You&rsquo;ve accidentally run your script through csh
instead of Perl. Check the #! line, or manually feed your
script into Perl yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s failed--call queue aborted
<br>
(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a
UNITCHECK, CHECK, INIT, or END subroutine. Processing of the
remainder of the queue of such routines has been <br>
prematurely ended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">False [] range &quot;%s&quot; in
regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(W regexp) A character class range must start and end at a
literal character, not another character class like
&quot;&quot; or &quot;[:alpha:]&quot;. The &quot;-&quot; in
your false range is <br>
interpreted as a literal &quot;-&quot;. Consider quoting the
&quot;-&quot;, &quot;&minus;&quot;. The &lt;-- HERE shows in
the regular expression about where the problem was
discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fatal VMS error (status=%d) at
%s, line %d <br>
(P) An error peculiar to VMS. Something untoward happened in
a VMS system service or RTL routine; Perl&rsquo;s exit
status should provide more details. The filename in &quot;at
%s&quot; <br>
and the line number in &quot;line %d&quot; tell you which
section of the Perl source code is distressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fcntl is not implemented <br>
(F) Your machine apparently doesn&rsquo;t implement fcntl().
What is this, a PDP-11 or something?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FETCHSIZE returned a negative
value <br>
(F) A tied array claimed to have a negative number of
elements, which is not possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Field too wide in
&rsquo;u&rsquo; format in pack <br>
(W pack) Each line in an uuencoded string start with a
length indicator which can&rsquo;t encode values above 63.
So there is no point in asking for a line length bigger than
<br>
that. Perl will behave as if you specified &quot;u63&quot;
as the format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filehandle %s opened only for
input <br>
(W io) You tried to write on a read-only filehandle. If you
intended it to be a read-write filehandle, you needed to
open it with &quot;+&lt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&quot; or
&quot;+&gt;&gt;&quot; instead of with &quot;&lt;&quot; <br>
or nothing. If you intended only to write the file, use
&quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;. See
&quot;open&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filehandle %s opened only for
output <br>
(W io) You tried to read from a filehandle opened only for
writing, If you intended it to be a read/write filehandle,
you needed to open it with &quot;+&lt;&quot; or
&quot;+&gt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&gt;&quot; instead <br>
of with &quot;&gt;&quot;. If you intended only to read from
the file, use &quot;&lt;&quot;. See &quot;open&quot; in
perlfunc. Another possibility is that you attempted to open
filedescriptor 0 (also known as <br>
STDIN) for output (maybe you closed STDIN earlier?).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filehandle %s reopened as %s
only for input <br>
(W io) You opened for reading a filehandle that got the same
filehandle id as STDOUT or STDERR. This occurred because you
closed STDOUT or STDERR previously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filehandle STDIN reopened as %s
only for output <br>
(W io) You opened for writing a filehandle that got the same
filehandle id as STDIN. This occurred because you closed
STDIN previously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Final $ should be or $name <br>
(F) You must now decide whether the final $ in a string was
meant to be a literal dollar sign, or was meant to introduce
a variable name that happens to be missing. So you <br>
have to put either the backslash or the name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flock() on closed filehandle %s
<br>
(W closed) The filehandle you&rsquo;re attempting to flock()
got itself closed some time before now. Check your control
flow. flock() operates on filehandles. Are you attempting
<br>
to call flock() on a dirhandle by the same name?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Format not terminated <br>
(F) A format must be terminated by a line with a solitary
dot. Perl got to the end of your file without finding such a
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Format %s redefined <br>
(W redefine) You redefined a format. To suppress this
warning, say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ <br>
no warnings &rsquo;redefine&rsquo;; <br>
eval &quot;format NAME =...&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Found = in conditional, should
be == <br>
(W syntax) You said</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ($foo = 123)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">when you meant</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ($foo == 123)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(or something like that).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s found where operator expected
<br>
(S syntax) The Perl lexer knows whether to expect a term or
an operator. If it sees what it knows to be a term when it
was expecting to see an operator, it gives you this <br>
warning. Usually it indicates that an operator or delimiter
was omitted, such as a semicolon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gdbm store returned %d, errno
%d, key &quot;%s&quot; <br>
(S) A warning from the GDBM_File extension that a store
failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gethostent not implemented <br>
(F) Your C library apparently doesn&rsquo;t implement
gethostent(), probably because if it did, it&rsquo;d feel
morally obligated to return every hostname on the
Internet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get%sname() on closed socket %s
<br>
(W closed) You tried to get a socket or peer socket name on
a closed socket. Did you forget to check the return value of
your socket() call?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getpwnam returned invalid UIC
%#o for user &quot;%s&quot; <br>
(S) A warning peculiar to VMS. The call to
&quot;sys$getuai&quot; underlying the &quot;getpwnam&quot;
operator returned an invalid UIC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getsockopt() on closed socket %s
<br>
(W closed) You tried to get a socket option on a closed
socket. Did you forget to check the return value of your
socket() call? See &quot;getsockopt&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Global symbol &quot;%s&quot;
requires explicit package name <br>
(F) You&rsquo;ve said &quot;use strict&quot; or &quot;use
strict vars&quot;, which indicates that all variables must
either be lexically scoped (using &quot;my&quot; or
&quot;state&quot;), declared beforehand using <br>
&quot;our&quot;, or explicitly qualified to say which
package the global variable is in (using
&quot;::&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">glob failed (%s) <br>
(S glob) Something went wrong with the external program(s)
used for &quot;glob&quot; and &quot;&lt;*.c&gt;&quot;.
Usually, this means that you supplied a &quot;glob&quot;
pattern that caused the external <br>
program to fail and exit with a nonzero status. If the
message indicates that the abnormal exit resulted in a
coredump, this may also mean that your csh (C shell) is
broken. <br>
If so, you should change all of the csh-related variables in
config.sh: If you have tcsh, make the variables refer to it
as if it were csh (e.g.
&quot;full_csh=&rsquo;/usr/bin/tcsh&rsquo;&quot;); <br>
otherwise, make them all empty (except that
&quot;d_csh&quot; should be &rsquo;undef&rsquo;) so that
Perl will think csh is missing. In either case, after
editing config.sh, run &quot;./Configure -S&quot; <br>
and rebuild Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Glob not terminated <br>
(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it
was expecting a term, so it&rsquo;s looking for the
corresponding right angle bracket, and not finding it.
Chances are <br>
you left some needed parentheses out earlier in the line,
and you really meant a &quot;less than&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmtime(%f) too large <br>
(W overflow) You called &quot;gmtime&quot; with a number
that was larger than it can reliably handle and
&quot;gmtime&quot; probably returned the wrong date. This
warning is also triggered with <br>
NaN (the special not-a-number value).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmtime(%f) too small <br>
(W overflow) You called &quot;gmtime&quot; with a number
that was smaller than it can reliably handle and
&quot;gmtime&quot; probably returned the wrong date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Got an error from DosAllocMem
<br>
(P) An error peculiar to OS/2. Most probably you&rsquo;re
using an obsolete version of Perl, and this should not
happen anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">goto must have label <br>
(F) Unlike with &quot;next&quot; or &quot;last&quot;,
you&rsquo;re not allowed to goto an unspecified destination.
See &quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Goto undefined subroutine%s <br>
(F) You tried to call a subroutine with &quot;goto
&amp;sub&quot; syntax, but the indicated subroutine
hasn&rsquo;t been defined, or if it was, it has since been
undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">()-group starts with a count
<br>
(F) A ()-group started with a count. A count is supposed to
follow something: a template character or a ()-group. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s had compilation errors. <br>
(F) The final summary message when a &quot;perl -c&quot;
fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Had to create %s unexpectedly
<br>
(S internal) A routine asked for a symbol from a symbol
table that ought to have existed already, but for some
reason it didn&rsquo;t, and had to be created on an
emergency basis <br>
to prevent a core dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hash %%s missing the % in
argument %d of %s() <br>
(D deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the % on hash
names in some spots. This is now heavily deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s has too many errors <br>
(F) The parser has given up trying to parse the program
after 10 errors. Further error messages would likely be
uninformative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Having no space between pattern
and following word is deprecated <br>
(D syntax)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You had a word that isn&rsquo;t
a regex modifier immediately following a pattern without an
intervening space. If you are trying to use the
&quot;/le&quot; flags on a substitution, use <br>
&quot;/el&quot; instead. Otherwise, add white space between
the pattern and following word to eliminate the warning. As
an example of the latter, the two constructs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$a =~ m/$foo/sand $bar <br>
$a =~ m/$foo/s and $bar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">both currently mean the same
thing, but it is planned to disallow the first form in Perl
5.18. And,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$a =~ m/$foo/and $bar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will be disallowed too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hexadecimal number &gt;
0xffffffff non-portable <br>
(W portable) The hexadecimal number you specified is larger
than 2**32-1 (4294967295) and therefore non-portable between
systems. See perlport for more on portability <br>
concerns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Identifier too long <br>
(F) Perl limits identifiers (names for variables, functions,
etc.) to about 250 characters for simple names, and somewhat
more for compound names (like $A::B). You&rsquo;ve <br>
exceeded Perl&rsquo;s limits. Future versions of Perl are
likely to eliminate these arbitrary limitations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ignoring zero length in
character class <br>
(W) Named Unicode character escapes &quot;( may
return a zero-length sequence. When such an escape is used
in a character class its behaviour is not well defined.
Check <br>
that the correct escape has been used, and the correct
charname handler is in scope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Illegal binary digit %s <br>
(F) You used a digit other than 0 or 1 in a binary
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Illegal binary digit %s ignored
<br>
(W digit) You may have tried to use a digit other than 0 or
1 in a binary number. Interpretation of the binary number
stopped before the offending digit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Illegal character after
&rsquo;_&rsquo; in prototype for %s : %s <br>
(W illegalproto) An illegal character was found in a
prototype declaration. Legal characters in prototypes are $,
@, %, *, ;, [, ], &amp;, and +.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Illegal character o (carriage
return) <br>
(F) Perl normally treats carriage returns in the program
text as it would any other whitespace, which means you
should never see this error when Perl was built using
standard <br>
options. For some reason, your version of Perl appears to
have been built without this support. Talk to your Perl
administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Illegal character in prototype

(W illegalproto) An illegal character was found in a
prototype declaration. Legal characters in prototypes are $,
@, %, *, ;, [, ], &amp;, and +.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Illegal declaration of anonymous
subroutine <br>
(F) When using the &quot;sub&quot; keyword to construct an
anonymous subroutine, you must always specify a block of
code. See perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Illegal declaration of
subroutine %s <br>
(F) A subroutine was not declared correctly. See
perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Illegal division by zero <br>
(F) You tried to divide a number by 0. Either something was
wrong in your logic, or you need to put a conditional in to
guard against meaningless input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Illegal hexadecimal digit %s
ignored <br>
(W digit) You may have tried to use a character other than 0
- 9 or A - F, a - f in a hexadecimal number. Interpretation
of the hexadecimal number stopped before the illegal <br>
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Illegal modulus zero <br>
(F) You tried to divide a number by 0 to get the remainder.
Most numbers don&rsquo;t take to this kindly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Illegal number of bits in vec
<br>
(F) The number of bits in vec() (the third argument) must be
a power of two from 1 to 32 (or 64, if your platform
supports that).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Illegal octal digit %s <br>
(F) You used an 8 or 9 in an octal number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Illegal octal digit %s ignored
<br>
(W digit) You may have tried to use an 8 or 9 in an octal
number. Interpretation of the octal number stopped before
the 8 or 9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Illegal switch in PERL5OPT: -%c
<br>
(X) The PERL5OPT environment variable may only be used to
set the following switches: -[CDIMUdmtw].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ill-formed CRTL environ value
&quot;%s&quot; <br>
(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl tried to read
the CRTL&rsquo;s internal environ array, and encountered an
element without the &quot;=&quot; delimiter used to separate
keys from <br>
values. The element is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ill-formed message in
prime_env_iter: |%s| <br>
(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl tried to read a
logical name or CLI symbol definition when preparing to
iterate over %ENV, and didn&rsquo;t see the expected
delimiter <br>
between key and value, so the line was ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(in cleanup) %s <br>
(W misc) This prefix usually indicates that a DESTROY()
method raised the indicated exception. Since destructors are
usually called by the system at arbitrary points during <br>
execution, and often a vast number of times, the warning is
issued only once for any number of failures that would
otherwise result in the same message being repeated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Failure of user callbacks
dispatched using the &quot;G_KEEPERR&quot; flag could also
result in this warning. See &quot;G_KEEPERR&quot; in
perlcall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inconsistent hierarchy during C3
merge of class &rsquo;%s&rsquo;: merging failed on parent
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; <br>
(F) The method resolution order (MRO) of the given class is
not C3-consistent, and you have enabled the C3 MRO for this
class. See the C3 documentation in mro for more <br>
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In EBCDIC the v-string
components cannot exceed 2147483647 <br>
(F) An error peculiar to EBCDIC. Internally, v-strings are
stored as Unicode code points, and encoded in EBCDIC as
UTF-EBCDIC. The UTF-EBCDIC encoding is limited to code <br>
points no larger than 2147483647 (0x7FFFFFFF).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Infinite recursion in regex;
marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(F) You used a pattern that references itself without
consuming any input text. You should check the pattern to
ensure that recursive patterns either consume text or
fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;-- HERE shows in the
regular expression about where the problem was
discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Initialization of state
variables in list context currently forbidden <br>
(F) Currently the implementation of &quot;state&quot; only
permits the initialization of scalar variables in scalar
context. Re-write &quot;state ($a) = 42&quot; as &quot;state
$a = 42&quot; to change <br>
from list to scalar context. Constructions such as
&quot;state (@a) = foo()&quot; will be supported in a future
perl release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Insecure dependency in %s <br>
(F) You tried to do something that the tainting mechanism
didn&rsquo;t like. The tainting mechanism is turned on when
you&rsquo;re running setuid or setgid, or when you specify
-T to <br>
turn it on explicitly. The tainting mechanism labels all
data that&rsquo;s derived directly or indirectly from the
user, who is considered to be unworthy of your trust. If any
<br>
such data is used in a &quot;dangerous&quot; operation, you
get this error. See perlsec for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Insecure directory in %s <br>
(F) You can&rsquo;t use system(), exec(), or a piped open in
a setuid or setgid script if $ENV{PATH} contains a directory
that is writable by the world. Also, the PATH must not <br>
contain any relative directory. See perlsec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Insecure $ENV{%s} while running
%s <br>
(F) You can&rsquo;t use system(), exec(), or a piped open in
a setuid or setgid script if any of $ENV{PATH}, $ENV{IFS},
$ENV{CDPATH}, $ENV{ENV}, $ENV{BASH_ENV} or $ENV{TERM} are
<br>
derived from data supplied (or potentially supplied) by the
user. The script must set the path to a known value, using
trustworthy data. See perlsec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Insecure user-defined property
%s <br>
(F) Perl detected tainted data when trying to compile a
regular expression that contains a call to a user-defined
character property function, i.e. &quot;{IsFoo}&quot; or
<br>
&quot;{InFoo}&quot;. See &quot;User-Defined Character
Properties&quot; in perlunicode and perlsec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Integer overflow in format
string for %s <br>
(F) The indexes and widths specified in the format string of
&quot;printf()&quot; or &quot;sprintf()&quot; are too large.
The numbers must not overflow the size of integers for your
<br>
architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Integer overflow in %s number
<br>
(W overflow) The hexadecimal, octal or binary number you
have specified either as a literal or as an argument to
hex() or oct() is too big for your architecture, and has
been <br>
converted to a floating point number. On a 32-bit
architecture the largest hexadecimal, octal or binary number
representable without overflow is 0xFFFFFFFF, 037777777777,
or <br>
0b11111111111111111111111111111111 respectively. Note that
Perl transparently promotes all numbers to a floating point
representation internally--subject to loss of <br>
precision errors in subsequent operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Integer overflow in version <br>
(F) Some portion of a version initialization is too large
for the size of integers for your architecture. This is not
a warning because there is no rational reason for a <br>
version to try and use a element larger than typically
2**32. This is usually caused by trying to use some odd
mathematical operation as a version, like 100/9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internal disaster in regex;
marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(P) Something went badly wrong in the regular expression
parser. The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression
about where the problem was discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internal inconsistency in
tracking vforks <br>
(S) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl keeps track of the
number of times you&rsquo;ve called &quot;fork&quot; and
&quot;exec&quot;, to determine whether the current call to
&quot;exec&quot; should affect the <br>
current script or a subprocess (see &quot;exec LIST&quot; in
perlvms). Somehow, this count has become scrambled, so Perl
is making a guess and treating this &quot;exec&quot; as a
request to <br>
terminate the Perl script and execute the specified
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internal urp in regex; marked by
&lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(P) Something went badly awry in the regular expression
parser. The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression
about where the problem was discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s (...) interpreted as function
<br>
(W syntax) You&rsquo;ve run afoul of the rule that says that
any list operator followed by parentheses turns into a
function, with all the list operators arguments found inside
the <br>
parentheses. See &quot;Terms and List Operators
(Leftward)&quot; in perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid %s attribute: %s <br>
(F) The indicated attribute for a subroutine or variable was
not recognized by Perl or by a user-supplied handler. See
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid %s attributes: %s <br>
(F) The indicated attributes for a subroutine or variable
were not recognized by Perl or by a user-supplied handler.
See attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid conversion in %s:
&quot;%s&quot; <br>
(W printf) Perl does not understand the given format
conversion. See &quot;sprintf&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid escape in the specified
encoding in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(W regexp) The numeric escape (for example &quot;&quot;) of
value &lt; 256 didn&rsquo;t correspond to a single character
through the conversion from the encoding specified by the
encoding <br>
pragma. The escape was replaced with REPLACEMENT CHARACTER
(U+FFFD) instead. The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular
expression about where the escape was discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid hexadecimal number in
+...} <br>
(F) The character constant represented by &quot;...&quot; is
not a valid hexadecimal number. Either it is empty, or you
tried to use a character other than 0 - 9 or A - F, a - f in
a <br>
hexadecimal number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid module name %s with -%c
option: contains single &rsquo;:&rsquo; <br>
(F) The module argument to perl&rsquo;s -m and -M
command-line options cannot contain single colons in the
module name, but only in the arguments after &quot;=&quot;.
In other words, <br>
-MFoo::Bar=:baz is ok, but -MFoo:Bar=baz is not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid mro name:
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; <br>
(F) You tried to &quot;mro::set_mro(&quot;classname&quot;,
&quot;foo&quot;)&quot; or &quot;use mro
&rsquo;foo&rsquo;&quot;, where &quot;foo&quot; is not a
valid method resolution order (MRO). Currently, the only
valid ones supported <br>
are &quot;dfs&quot; and &quot;c3&quot;, unless you have
loaded a module that is a MRO plugin. See mro and
perlmroapi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invalid option -D%c, use
-D&rsquo;&rsquo; to see choices <br>
(F) Perl was called with invalid debugger flags. Call perl
with the -D option with no flags to see the list of
acceptable values. See also &quot;-Dletters&quot; in
perlrun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid [] range &quot;%s&quot;
in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(F) The range specified in a character class had a minimum
character greater than the maximum character. One
possibility is that you forgot the &quot;{}&quot; from your
ending &quot;&quot; <br>
- &quot;ithout the curly braces can go only up to
&quot;ff&quot;. The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular
expression about where the problem was discovered. See
perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid range &quot;%s&quot; in
transliteration operator <br>
(F) The range specified in the tr/// or y/// operator had a
minimum character greater than the maximum character. See
perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid separator character %s
in attribute list <br>
(F) Something other than a colon or whitespace was seen
between the elements of an attribute list. If the previous
attribute had a parenthesised parameter list, perhaps that
<br>
list was terminated too soon. See attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid separator character %s
in PerlIO layer specification %s <br>
(W layer) When pushing layers onto the Perl I/O system,
something other than a colon or whitespace was seen between
the elements of a layer list. If the previous attribute <br>
had a parenthesised parameter list, perhaps that list was
terminated too soon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid strict version format
(%s) <br>
(F) A version number did not meet the &quot;strict&quot;
criteria for versions. A &quot;strict&quot; version number
is a positive decimal number (integer or decimal-fraction)
without <br>
exponentiation or else a dotted-decimal v-string with a
leading &rsquo;v&rsquo; character and at least three
components. The parenthesized text indicates which criteria
were not met. <br>
See the version module for more details on allowed version
formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid type &rsquo;%s&rsquo; in
%s <br>
(F) The given character is not a valid pack or unpack type.
See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(W) The given character is not a
valid pack or unpack type but used to be silently
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid version format (%s) <br>
(F) A version number did not meet the &quot;lax&quot;
criteria for versions. A &quot;lax&quot; version number is a
positive decimal number (integer or decimal-fraction)
without exponentiation <br>
or else a dotted-decimal v-string. If the v-string has fewer
than three components, it must have a leading
&rsquo;v&rsquo; character. Otherwise, the leading
&rsquo;v&rsquo; is optional. Both <br>
decimal and dotted-decimal versions may have a trailing
&quot;alpha&quot; component separated by an underscore
character after a fractional or dotted-decimal component.
The <br>
parenthesized text indicates which criteria were not met.
See the version module for more details on allowed version
formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid version object <br>
(F) The internal structure of the version object was
invalid. Perhaps the internals were modified directly in
some way or an arbitrary reference was blessed into the <br>
&quot;version&quot; class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ioctl is not implemented <br>
(F) Your machine apparently doesn&rsquo;t implement ioctl(),
which is pretty strange for a machine that supports C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ioctl() on unopened %s <br>
(W unopened) You tried ioctl() on a filehandle that was
never opened. Check your control flow and number of
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IO layers (like
&rsquo;%s&rsquo;) unavailable <br>
(F) Your Perl has not been configured to have PerlIO, and
therefore you cannot use IO layers. To have PerlIO, Perl
must be configured with &rsquo;useperlio&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IO::Socket::atmark not
implemented on this architecture <br>
(F) Your machine doesn&rsquo;t implement the sockatmark()
functionality, neither as a system call nor an ioctl call
(SIOCATMARK).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$* is no longer supported <br>
(D deprecated, syntax) The special variable $*, deprecated
in older perls, has been removed as of 5.9.0 and is no
longer supported. In previous versions of perl the use of
<br>
$* enabled or disabled multi-line matching within a
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of using $* you should
use the &quot;/m&quot; (and maybe &quot;/s&quot;) regexp
modifiers. You can enable &quot;/m&quot; for a lexical scope
(even a whole file) with &quot;use re
&rsquo;/m&rsquo;&quot;. (In older <br>
versions: when $* was set to a true value then all regular
expressions behaved as if they were written using
&quot;/m&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$# is no longer supported <br>
(D deprecated, syntax) The special variable $#, deprecated
in older perls, has been removed as of 5.9.3 and is no
longer supported. You should use the printf/sprintf <br>
functions instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;%s&rsquo; is not a code
reference <br>
(W overload) The second (fourth, sixth, ...) argument of
overload::constant needs to be a code reference. Either an
anonymous subroutine, or a reference to a subroutine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;%s&rsquo; is not an
overloadable type <br>
(W overload) You tried to overload a constant type the
overload package is unaware of.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">junk on end of regexp <br>
(P) The regular expression parser is confused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Label not found for &quot;last
%s&quot; <br>
(F) You named a loop to break out of, but you&rsquo;re not
currently in a loop of that name, not even if you count
where you were called from. See &quot;last&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Label not found for &quot;next
%s&quot; <br>
(F) You named a loop to continue, but you&rsquo;re not
currently in a loop of that name, not even if you count
where you were called from. See &quot;last&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Label not found for &quot;redo
%s&quot; <br>
(F) You named a loop to restart, but you&rsquo;re not
currently in a loop of that name, not even if you count
where you were called from. See &quot;last&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">leaving effective %s failed <br>
(F) While under the &quot;use filetest&quot; pragma,
switching the real and effective uids or gids failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">length/code after end of string
in unpack <br>
(F) While unpacking, the string buffer was already used up
when an unpack length/code combination tried to obtain more
data. This results in an undefined value for the <br>
length. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">length() used on %s <br>
(W syntax) You used length() on either an array or a hash
when you probably wanted a count of the items.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Array size can be obtained by
doing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scalar(@array);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of items in a hash
can be obtained by doing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scalar(keys %hash);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lexing code attempted to stuff
non-Latin-1 character into Latin-1 input <br>
(F) An extension is attempting to insert text into the
current parse (using lex_stuff_pvn or similar), but tried to
insert a character that couldn&rsquo;t be part of the
current <br>
input. This is an inherent pitfall of the stuffing
mechanism, and one of the reasons to avoid it. Where it is
necessary to stuff, stuffing only plain ASCII is
recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lexing code internal error (%s)
<br>
(F) Lexing code supplied by an extension violated the
lexer&rsquo;s API in a detectable way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">listen() on closed socket %s
<br>
(W closed) You tried to do a listen on a closed socket. Did
you forget to check the return value of your socket() call?
See &quot;listen&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List form of piped open not
implemented <br>
(F) On some platforms, notably Windows, the
three-or-more-arguments form of &quot;open&quot; does not
support pipes, such as &quot;open($pipe, &rsquo;|-&rsquo;,
@args)&quot;. Use the two-argument <br>
&quot;open($pipe, &rsquo;|prog arg1 arg2...&rsquo;)&quot;
form instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">localtime(%f) too large <br>
(W overflow) You called &quot;localtime&quot; with a number
that was larger than it can reliably handle and
&quot;localtime&quot; probably returned the wrong date. This
warning is also <br>
triggered with NaN (the special not-a-number value).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">localtime(%f) too small <br>
(W overflow) You called &quot;localtime&quot; with a number
that was smaller than it can reliably handle and
&quot;localtime&quot; probably returned the wrong date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lookbehind longer than %d not
implemented in regex m/%s/ <br>
(F) There is currently a limit on the length of string which
lookbehind can handle. This restriction may be eased in a
future release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lost precision when %s %f by 1
<br>
(W) The value you attempted to increment or decrement by one
is too large for the underlying floating point
representation to store accurately, hence the target of
&quot;++&quot; or <br>
&quot;--&quot; is unchanged. Perl issues this warning
because it has already switched from integers to floating
point when values are too large for integers, and now even
floating <br>
point is insufficient. You may wish to switch to using
Math::BigInt explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lstat() on filehandle%s <br>
(W io) You tried to do an lstat on a filehandle. What did
you mean by that? lstat() makes sense only on filenames.
(Perl did a fstat() instead on the filehandle.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lvalue attribute %s
already-defined subroutine <br>
(W misc) Although attributes.pm allows this, turning the
lvalue attribute on or off on a Perl subroutine that is
already defined does not always work properly. It may or may
<br>
not do what you want, depending on what code is inside the
subroutine, with exact details subject to change between
Perl versions. Only do this if you really know what you <br>
are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lvalue attribute ignored after
the subroutine has been defined <br>
(W misc) Using the &quot;:lvalue&quot; declarative syntax to
make a Perl subroutine an lvalue subroutine after it has
been defined is not permitted. To make the subroutine an
lvalue <br>
subroutine, add the lvalue attribute to the definition, or
put the &quot;sub foo :lvalue;&quot; declaration before the
definition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also attributes.pm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Malformed integer in [] in pack

perlos2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Malformed prototype for %s: %s
<br>
(F) You tried to use a function with a malformed prototype.
The syntax of function prototypes is given a brief
compile-time check for obvious errors like invalid
characters. <br>
A more rigorous check is run when the function is
called.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Malformed UTF-8 character (%s)
<br>
(S utf8)(F) Perl detected a string that didn&rsquo;t comply
with UTF-8 encoding rules, even though it had the UTF8 flag
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One possible cause is that you
set the UTF8 flag yourself for data that you thought to be
in UTF-8 but it wasn&rsquo;t (it was for example legacy
8-bit data). To guard against <br>
this, you can use Encode::decode_utf8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use the
&quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot; PerlIO layer for input, invalid
byte sequences are handled gracefully, but if you use
&quot;:utf8&quot;, the flag is set without validating the

possibly resulting in this error message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Malformed UTF-16 surrogate <br>
(F) Perl thought it was reading UTF-16 encoded character
data but while doing it Perl met a malformed Unicode
surrogate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s matches null string many

perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Maximal count of pending signals

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s&quot; may clash with
future reserved word <br>
(W) This warning may be due to running a perl5 script
through a perl4 interpreter, especially if the word that is
being warned about is &quot;use&quot; or &quot;my&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;%&rsquo; may not be used
in pack <br>
(F) You can&rsquo;t pack a string by supplying a checksum,
because the checksumming process loses information, and you
can&rsquo;t go the other way. See &quot;unpack&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Method for operation %s not
found in package %s during blessing <br>
(F) An attempt was made to specify an entry in an
overloading table that doesn&rsquo;t resolve to a valid
subroutine. See overload.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Method %s not permitted <br>
See Server error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Might be a runaway multi-line %s
string starting on line %d <br>
(S) An advisory indicating that the previous error may have
been caused by a missing delimiter on a string or pattern,
because it eventually ended earlier on the current <br>
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Misplaced _ in number <br>
(W syntax) An underscore (underbar) in a numeric constant
did not separate two digits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Missing argument in %s <br>
(W uninitialized) A printf-type format required more
arguments than were supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Missing argument to -%c <br>
(F) The argument to the indicated command line switch must
follow immediately after the switch, without intervening
spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Missing braces on <br>
(F) Wrong syntax of character name literal
&quot;harname}&quot; within double-quotish context. This can
also happen when there is a space (or comment) between the
&quot;nd the &quot;{&quot; <br>
in a regex with the &quot;/x&quot; modifier. This modifier
does not change the requirement that the brace immediately
follow the &quot; <br>
Missing braces on } <br>
(F) A &quot;a{&quot; in double-quotish context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Missing comma after first
argument to %s function <br>
(F) While certain functions allow you to specify a
filehandle or an &quot;indirect object&quot; before the
argument list, this ain&rsquo;t one of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Missing command in piped open
<br>
(W pipe) You used the &quot;open(FH, &quot;|
command&quot;)&quot; or &quot;open(FH, &quot;command
|&quot;)&quot; construction, but the command was missing or
blank.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Missing control char name in (F)
A double-quoted string ended with &quot; <br>
Missing name in &quot;my sub&quot; <br>
(F) The reserved syntax for lexically scoped subroutines
requires that they have a name with which they can be
found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Missing $ on loop variable <br>
(F) Apparently you&rsquo;ve been programming in csh too
much. Variables are always mentioned with the $ in Perl,
unlike in the shells, where it can vary from one line to the
next.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Missing operator before %s?)
<br>
(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction
with the message &quot;%s found where operator
expected&quot;. Often the missing operator is a comma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Missing right brace on %s <br>
(F) Missing right brace in &quot;.}&quot;,
&quot;{...}&quot;, &quot;P{...}&quot;, or
&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Missing right brace on or
unescaped left brace after (F) &quot;as two meanings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The traditional one has it
followed by a name enclosed in braces, meaning the character
(or sequence of characters) given by that name. Thus
&quot;STERISK}&quot; is another way of <br>
writing &quot;*&quot;, valid in both double-quoted strings
and regular expression patterns. In patterns, it
doesn&rsquo;t have the meaning an unescaped &quot;*&quot;
does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting in Perl 5.12.0,
&quot;lso can have an additional meaning (only) in patterns,
namely to match a non-newline character. (This is short for
&quot;[^0&quot;, and like &quot;.&quot; but <br>
is not affected by the &quot;/s&quot; regex modifier.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can lead to some
ambiguities. When &quot;s not followed immediately by a left
brace, Perl assumes the &quot;[^0&quot; meaning. Also, if
the braces form a valid quantifier such <br>
as &quot;&quot; or &quot;}&quot;, Perl assumes that this
means to match the given quantity of non-newlines (in these
examples, 3; and 5 or more, respectively). In all other
case, <br>
where there is a &quot; and a matching &quot;}&quot;, Perl
assumes that a character name is desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if there is no matching
&quot;}&quot;, Perl doesn&rsquo;t know if it was mistakenly
omitted, or if &quot;[^0{&quot; was desired, and raises this
error. If you meant the former, add the <br>
right brace; if you meant the latter, escape the brace with
a backslash, like so: &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Missing right curly or square
bracket <br>
(F) The lexer counted more opening curly or square brackets
than closing ones. As a general rule, you&rsquo;ll find
it&rsquo;s missing near the place you were last editing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Missing semicolon on previous
line?) <br>
(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction
with the message &quot;%s found where operator
expected&quot;. Don&rsquo;t automatically put a semicolon on
the previous line just <br>
because you saw this message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modification of a read-only
value attempted <br>
(F) You tried, directly or indirectly, to change the value
of a constant. You didn&rsquo;t, of course, try &quot;2 =
1&quot;, because the compiler catches that. But an easy way
to do the <br>
same thing is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub mod { $_[0] = 1 } <br>
mod(2);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another way is to assign to a
substr() that&rsquo;s off the end of the string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Yet another way is to assign to
a &quot;foreach&quot; loop VAR when VAR is aliased to a
constant in the look LIST:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$x = 1; <br>
foreach my $n ($x, 2) { <br>
$n *= 2; # modifies the $x, but fails on attempt to <br>
} # modify the 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modification of non-creatable
array value attempted, %s <br>
(F) You tried to make an array value spring into existence,
and the subscript was probably negative, even counting from
end of the array backwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modification of non-creatable
hash value attempted, %s <br>
(P) You tried to make a hash value spring into existence,
and it couldn&rsquo;t be created for some peculiar
reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module name must be constant
<br>
(F) Only a bare module name is allowed as the first argument
to a &quot;use&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module name required with -%c
option <br>
(F) The &quot;-M&quot; or &quot;-m&quot; options say that
Perl should load some module, but you omitted the name of
the module. Consult perlrun for full details about
&quot;-M&quot; and &quot;-m&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More than one argument to
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; open <br>
(F) The &quot;open&quot; function has been asked to open
multiple files. This can happen if you are trying to open a
pipe to a command that takes a list of arguments, but have
<br>
forgotten to specify a piped open mode. See &quot;open&quot;
in perlfunc for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msg%s not implemented <br>
(F) You don&rsquo;t have System V message IPC on your
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multidimensional syntax %s not
supported <br>
(W syntax) Multidimensional arrays aren&rsquo;t written like
$foo[1,2,3]. They&rsquo;re written like $foo[1][2][3], as in
C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;/&rsquo; must follow a
numeric type in unpack <br>
(F) You had an unpack template that contained a
&rsquo;/&rsquo;, but this did not follow some unpack
specification producing a numeric value. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;my sub&quot; not yet
implemented <br>
(F) Lexically scoped subroutines are not yet implemented.
Don&rsquo;t try that yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;my&quot; variable %s
can&rsquo;t be in a package <br>
(F) Lexically scoped variables aren&rsquo;t in a package, so
it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to try to declare one with a
package qualifier on the front. Use local() if you want to
localize <br>
a package variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name &quot;%s::%s&quot; used
only once: possible typo <br>
(W once) Typographical errors often show up as unique
variable names. If you had a good reason for having a unique
name, then just mention it again somehow to suppress the
<br>
message. The &quot;our&quot; declaration is provided for
this purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This warning detects
symbols that have been used only once so $c, @c, %c, *c,
&amp;c, sub c{}, c(), and c (the filehandle or format) are
considered the same; if a program <br>
uses $c only once but also uses any of the others it will
not trigger this warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in a character class must be a
named character:  <br>
(F) The new (5.12) meaning of &quot;s &quot;[^0&quot; is not
valid in a bracketed character class, for the same reason
that &quot;.&quot; in a character class loses its
specialness: it matches <br>
almost everything, which is probably not what you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AME} must be resolved by the
lexer <br>
(F) When compiling a regex pattern, an unresolved named
character or sequence was encountered. This can happen in
any of several ways that bypass the lexer, such as using
<br>
single-quotish context, or an extra backslash in
double-quotish:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$re = &rsquo;PACE}&rsquo;; #
Wrong! <br>
$re = &quot;\N{SPACE}&quot;; # Wrong! <br>
/$re/;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead, use double-quotes with
a single backslash:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$re = &quot;PACE}&quot;; # ok
<br>
/$re/;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The lexer can be bypassed as
well by creating the pattern from smaller components:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$re = &rsquo; <br>
/${re}{SPACE}/; # Wrong!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s not a good idea to
split a construct in the middle like this, and it
doesn&rsquo;t work here. Instead use the solution above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, the message also can
happen under the &quot;/x&quot; regex modifier when the
&quot;s separated by spaces from the &quot;{&quot;, in which
case, remove the spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/{SPACE}/x; # Wrong! <br>
/PACE}/x; # ok</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Negative &rsquo;/&rsquo; count
in unpack <br>
(F) The length count obtained from a length/code unpack
operation was negative. See &quot;pack&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Negative length <br>
(F) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv operation with a
buffer length that is less than 0. This is difficult to
imagine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Negative offset to vec in lvalue
context <br>
(F) When &quot;vec&quot; is called in an lvalue context, the
second argument must be greater than or equal to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nested quantifiers in regex;
marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(F) You can&rsquo;t quantify a quantifier without
intervening parentheses. So things like ** or +* or ?* are
illegal. The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression
about where the <br>
problem was discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the minimal matching
quantifiers, &quot;*?&quot;, &quot;+?&quot;, and
&quot;??&quot; appear to be nested quantifiers, but
aren&rsquo;t. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s never introduced <br>
(S internal) The symbol in question was declared but somehow
went out of scope before it could possibly have been
used.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">next::method/next::can/maybe::next::method
cannot find enclosing method <br>
(F) &quot;next::method&quot; needs to be called within the
context of a real method in a real package, and it could not
find such a context. See mro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No %s allowed while running
setuid <br>
(F) Certain operations are deemed to be too insecure for a
setuid or setgid script to even be allowed to attempt.
Generally speaking there will be another way to do what you
<br>
want that is, if not secure, at least securable. See
perlsec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No code specified for -%c <br>
(F) Perl&rsquo;s -e and -E command-line options require an
argument. If you want to run an empty program, pass the
empty string as a separate argument or run a program
consisting <br>
of a single 0 or 1:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -e &quot;&quot; <br>
perl -e0 <br>
perl -e1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No comma allowed after %s <br>
(F) A list operator that has a filehandle or &quot;indirect
object&quot; is not allowed to have a comma between that and
the following arguments. Otherwise it&rsquo;d be just
another one of <br>
the arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One possible cause for this is
that you expected to have imported a constant to your name
space with use or import while no such importing took place,
it may for example be <br>
that your operating system does not support that particular
constant. Hopefully you did use an explicit import list for
the constants you expect to see; please see &quot;use&quot;
in <br>
perlfunc and &quot;import&quot; in perlfunc. While an
explicit import list would probably have caught this error
earlier it naturally does not remedy the fact that your
operating <br>
system still does not support that constant. Maybe you have
a typo in the constants of the symbol import list of use or
import or in the constant name at the line where this <br>
error was triggered?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No command into which to pipe on
command line <br>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl handles its own command
line redirection, and found a &rsquo;|&rsquo; at the end of
the command line, so it doesn&rsquo;t know where you want to
pipe the <br>
output from this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No DB::DB routine defined <br>
(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the -d
switch, but for some reason the current debugger (e.g.
perl5db.pl or a &quot;Devel::&quot; module) didn&rsquo;t
define a routine to <br>
be called at the beginning of each statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No dbm on this machine <br>
(P) This is counted as an internal error, because every
machine should supply dbm nowadays, because Perl comes with
SDBM. See SDBM_File.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No DB::sub routine defined <br>
(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the -d
switch, but for some reason the current debugger (e.g.
perl5db.pl or a &quot;Devel::&quot; module) didn&rsquo;t
define a &quot;DB::sub&quot; <br>
routine to be called at the beginning of each ordinary
subroutine call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No directory specified for -I
<br>
(F) The -I command-line switch requires a directory name as
part of the same argument. Use -Ilib, for instance. -I lib
won&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No error file after 2&gt; or
2&gt;&gt; on command line <br>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl handles its own command
line redirection, and found a &rsquo;2&gt;&rsquo; or a
&rsquo;2&gt;&gt;&rsquo; on the command line, but can&rsquo;t
find the name of the file to which to <br>
write data destined for stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No group ending character
&rsquo;%c&rsquo; found in template <br>
(F) A pack or unpack template has an opening &rsquo;(&rsquo;
or &rsquo;[&rsquo; without its matching counterpart. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No input file after &lt; on
command line <br>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl handles its own command
line redirection, and found a &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; on the
command line, but can&rsquo;t find the name of the file from
which to read data <br>
for stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No next::method &rsquo;%s&rsquo;
found for %s <br>
(F) &quot;next::method&quot; found no further instances of
this method name in the remaining packages of the MRO of
this class. If you don&rsquo;t want it throwing an
exception, use <br>
&quot;maybe::next::method&quot; or &quot;next::can&quot;.
See mro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;no&quot; not allowed in
expression <br>
(F) The &quot;no&quot; keyword is recognized and executed at
compile time, and returns no useful value. See perlmod.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No output file after &gt; on
command line <br>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl handles its own command
line redirection, and found a lone &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; at the
end of the command line, so it doesn&rsquo;t know where you
wanted to <br>
redirect stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No output file after &gt; or
&gt;&gt; on command line <br>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl handles its own command
line redirection, and found a &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; or a
&rsquo;&gt;&gt;&rsquo; on the command line, but can&rsquo;t
find the name of the file to which to <br>
write data destined for stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No package name allowed for
variable %s in &quot;our&quot; <br>
(F) Fully qualified variable names are not allowed in
&quot;our&quot; declarations, because that doesn&rsquo;t
make much sense under existing semantics. Such syntax is
reserved for future <br>
extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No Perl script found in input
<br>
(F) You called &quot;perl -x&quot;, but no line was found in
the file beginning with #! and containing the word
&quot;perl&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No setregid available <br>
(F) Configure didn&rsquo;t find anything resembling the
setregid() call for your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No setreuid available <br>
(F) Configure didn&rsquo;t find anything resembling the
setreuid() call for your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No such class field
&quot;%s&quot; in variable %s of type %s <br>
(F) You tried to access a key from a hash through the
indicated typed variable but that key is not allowed by the
package of the same type. The indicated package has <br>
restricted the set of allowed keys using the fields
pragma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No such class %s <br>
(F) You provided a class qualifier in a &quot;my&quot;,
&quot;our&quot; or &quot;state&quot; declaration, but this
class doesn&rsquo;t exist at this point in your program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No such hook: %s <br>
(F) You specified a signal hook that was not recognized by
Perl. Currently, Perl accepts &quot;__DIE__&quot; and
&quot;__WARN__&quot; as valid signal hooks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No such pipe open <br>
(P) An error peculiar to VMS. The internal routine
my_pclose() tried to close a pipe which hadn&rsquo;t been
opened. This should have been caught earlier as an attempt
to close <br>
an unopened filehandle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No such signal: SIG%s <br>
(W signal) You specified a signal name as a subscript to
%SIG that was not recognized. Say &quot;kill -l&quot; in
your shell to see the valid signal names on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not a CODE reference <br>
(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a code value
(that is, a subroutine), but found a reference to something
else instead. You can use the ref() function to find <br>
out what kind of ref it really was. See also perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not a format reference <br>
(F) I&rsquo;m not sure how you managed to generate a
reference to an anonymous format, but this indicates you
did, and that it didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not a GLOB reference <br>
(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a
&quot;typeglob&quot; (that is, a symbol table entry that
looks like *foo), but found a reference to something else
instead. You can <br>
use the ref() function to find out what kind of ref it
really was. See perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not a HASH reference <br>
(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a hash value,
but found a reference to something else instead. You can use
the ref() function to find out what kind of ref it <br>
really was. See perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not an ARRAY reference <br>
(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to an array
value, but found a reference to something else instead. You
can use the ref() function to find out what kind of ref <br>
it really was. See perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not an unblessed ARRAY reference
<br>
(F) You passed a reference to a blessed array to
&quot;push&quot;, &quot;shift&quot; or another array
function. These only accept unblessed array references or
arrays beginning explicitly with <br>
&quot;@&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not a SCALAR reference <br>
(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a scalar
value, but found a reference to something else instead. You
can use the ref() function to find out what kind of ref <br>
it really was. See perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not a subroutine reference <br>
(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a code value
(that is, a subroutine), but found a reference to something
else instead. You can use the ref() function to find <br>
out what kind of ref it really was. See also perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not a subroutine reference in
overload table <br>
(F) An attempt was made to specify an entry in an
overloading table that doesn&rsquo;t somehow point to a
valid subroutine. See overload.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not enough arguments for %s <br>
(F) The function requires more arguments than you
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not enough format arguments <br>
(W syntax) A format specified more picture fields than the
next line supplied. See perlform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s: not found <br>
(A) You&rsquo;ve accidentally run your script through the
Bourne shell instead of Perl. Check the #! line, or manually
feed your script into Perl yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no UTC offset information;
assuming local time is UTC <br>
(S) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl was unable to find the
local timezone offset, so it&rsquo;s assuming that local
system time is equivalent to UTC. If it&rsquo;s not, define
the <br>
logical name SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL to translate to the
number of seconds which need to be added to UTC to get local
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-octal character
&rsquo;%c&rsquo;. Resolved as &quot;%s&quot; <br>
(W digit) In parsing an octal numeric constant, a character
was unexpectedly encountered that isn&rsquo;t octal. The
resulting value is as indicated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-string passed as bitmask
<br>
(W misc) A number has been passed as a bitmask argument to
select(). Use the vec() function to construct the file
descriptor bitmasks for select. See &quot;select&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Null filename used <br>
(F) You can&rsquo;t require the null filename, especially
because on many machines that means the current directory!
See &quot;require&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NULL OP IN RUN <br>
(S debugging) Some internal routine called run() with a null
opcode pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Null picture in formline <br>
(F) The first argument to formline must be a valid format
picture specification. It was found to be empty, which
probably means you supplied it an uninitialized value. See
<br>
perlform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Null realloc <br>
(P) An attempt was made to realloc NULL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NULL regexp argument <br>
(P) The internal pattern matching routines blew it big
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NULL regexp parameter <br>
(P) The internal pattern matching routines are out of their
gourd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Number too long <br>
(F) Perl limits the representation of decimal numbers in
programs to about 250 characters. You&rsquo;ve exceeded that
length. Future versions of Perl are likely to eliminate this
<br>
arbitrary limitation. In the meantime, try using scientific
notation (e.g. &quot;1e6&quot; instead of
&quot;1_000_000&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Number with no digits <br>
(F) Perl was looking for a number but found nothing that
looked like a number. This happens, for example with
&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Octal number &gt; 037777777777

(W portable) The octal number you specified is larger than

systems. See perlport for more on portability concerns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Odd number of arguments for

(W misc) You specified an odd number of elements to

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Offset outside string <br>
(F)(W layer) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv/seek
operation with an offset pointing outside the buffer. This
is difficult to imagine. The sole exceptions to this are

that zero padding will take place when going past the end of
the string when either &quot;sysread()&quot;ing a file, or

anticipation of future reads and to imitate the behaviour
with real files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s() on unopened %s <br>
(W unopened) An I/O operation was attempted on a filehandle

the FileHandle package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-%s on unopened filehandle %s

(F) An attempt was made to perform an overloaded operation

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operation &quot;%s&quot; returns
its argument for non-Unicode code point 0x%X <br>
(W utf8, non_unicode) You performed an operation requiring
Unicode semantics on a code point that is not in Unicode, so

have it do nothing, and warn you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the operation shown is

(W utf8, surrogate) You performed an operation requiring
Unicode semantics on a Unicode surrogate. Unicode frowns
upon the use of surrogates for anything but storing strings
<br>
in UTF-16, but semantics are (reluctantly) defined for the
surrogates, and they are to do nothing for this operation.
Because the use of surrogates can be dangerous, Perl <br>

(S ambiguous) You used a variable or subroutine call where
the parser was expecting an operator. The parser has assumed
you really meant to use an operator, but this is <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Out of memory during

(F) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was
insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy
the request. However, the request was judged large <br>
enough (compile-time default is 64K), so a possibility to
shut down by trapping this error is granted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Out of memory during request for

(X)(F) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there
was insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The request was judged to be
small, so the possibility to trap it depends on the way perl
was compiled. By default it is not trappable. However, if
compiled for this, Perl <br>
may use the contents of $^M as an emergency pool after

trappable once, and the error message will include the line

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Out of memory during
ridiculously large request <br>
(F) You can&rsquo;t allocate more than 2^31+&quot;small

by a typo in the Perl program. e.g., $arr[time] instead of
$arr[$time].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Out of memory for yacc stack

(F) The yacc parser wanted to grow its stack so it could

build your list the old-fashioned way, with quotes and
commas:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@list = ( <br>
&rsquo;a&rsquo;, # a comment <br>
&rsquo;b&rsquo;, # another comment <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possible attempt to separate
words with commas <br>
(W qw) qw() lists contain items separated by whitespace;
therefore commas aren&rsquo;t needed to separate the items.
(You may have used different delimiters than the parentheses
<br>
shown here; braces are also frequently used.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You probably wrote something
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qw! a, b, c !;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which puts literal commas into
some of the list items. Write it without commas if you
don&rsquo;t want them to appear in your data:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qw! a b c !;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possible memory corruption: %s
overflowed 3rd argument <br>
(F) An ioctl() or fcntl() returned more than Perl was
bargaining for. Perl guesses a reasonable buffer size, but
puts a sentinel byte at the end of the buffer just in case.
<br>
This sentinel byte got clobbered, and Perl assumes that
memory is now corrupted. See &quot;ioctl&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possible precedence problem on
bitwise %c operator <br>
(W precedence) Your program uses a bitwise logical operator
in conjunction with a numeric comparison operator, like this
:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ($x &amp; $y == 0) { ...
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This expression is actually
equivalent to &quot;$x &amp; ($y == 0)&quot;, due to the
higher precedence of &quot;==&quot;. This is probably not
what you want. (If you really meant to write this, <br>
disable the warning, or, better, put the parentheses
explicitly and write &quot;$x &amp; ($y == 0)&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possible unintended
interpolation of $&nbsp;in regex <br>
(W ambiguous) You said something like &quot;m/$&quot; in a
regex. The regex &quot;m/foo$r/m&quot; translates to: match
the word &rsquo;foo&rsquo;, the output record separator (see
&quot;$ <br>
and the letter &rsquo;s&rsquo; (one time or more) followed
by the word &rsquo;bar&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this is what you intended
then you can silence the warning by using &quot;m/${/&quot;
(for example: &quot;m/foo${s+bar/&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If instead you intended to match
the word &rsquo;foo&rsquo; at the end of the line followed
by whitespace and the word &rsquo;bar&rsquo; on the next
line then you can use &quot;m/$(?)&quot; (for example: <br>
&quot;m/foo$(?)r/&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possible unintended
interpolation of %s in string <br>
(W ambiguous) You said something like &rsquo;@foo&rsquo; in
a double-quoted string but there was no array @foo in scope
at the time. If you wanted a literal @foo, then write it as
<br>
@foo; otherwise find out what happened to the array you
apparently lost track of.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Precedence problem: open %s
should be open(%s) <br>
(S precedence) The old irregular construct</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open FOO || die;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is now misinterpreted as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(FOO || die);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">because of the strict
regularization of Perl 5&rsquo;s grammar into unary and list
operators. (The old open was a little of both.) You must put
parentheses around the filehandle, <br>
or use the new &quot;or&quot; operator instead of
&quot;||&quot;.</p>

(W closed) The filehandle you&rsquo;re printing on got

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Process terminated by SIG%s <br>
(W) This is a standard message issued by OS/2 applications,
while *nix applications die in silence. It is considered a
feature of the OS/2 port. One can easily disable this <br>
by appropriate sighandlers, see &quot;Signals&quot; in
perlipc. See also &quot;Process terminated by
SIGTERM/SIGINT&quot; in perlos2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prototype after &rsquo;%c&rsquo;
for %s : %s <br>
(W illegalproto) A character follows % or @ in a prototype.
This is useless, since % and @ gobble the rest of the
subroutine arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prototype mismatch: %s vs %s
<br>
(S prototype) The subroutine being declared or defined had
previously been declared or defined with a different
function prototype.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prototype not terminated <br>
(F) You&rsquo;ve omitted the closing parenthesis in a
function prototype definition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{} uses Unicode rules, not
locale rules <br>
(W) You compiled a regular expression that contained a
Unicode property match (&quot;&quot; or &quot;P&quot;), but
the regular expression is also being told to use the
run-time locale, not <br>
Unicode. Instead, use a POSIX character class, which should
know about the locale&rsquo;s rules. (See &quot;POSIX
Character Classes&quot; in perlrecharclass.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even if the run-time locale is
ISO 8859-1 (Latin1), which is a subset of Unicode, some
properties will give results that are not valid for that
subset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are a couple of examples to
help you see what&rsquo;s going on. If the locale is ISO
8859-7, the character at code point 0xD7 is the &quot;GREEK
CAPITAL LETTER CHI&quot;. But in <br>
Unicode that code point means the &quot;MULTIPLICATION
SIGN&quot; instead, and &quot;&quot; always uses the Unicode
meaning. That means that &quot;{Alpha}&quot; won&rsquo;t
match, but &quot;[[:alpha:]]&quot; should. <br>
Only in the Latin1 locale are all the characters in the same
positions as they are in Unicode. But, even here, some
properties give incorrect results. An example is <br>
&quot;{Changes_When_Uppercased}&quot; which is true for
&quot;LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS&quot;, but since
the upper case of that character is not in Latin1, in that
locale it doesn&rsquo;t <br>
change when upper cased.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quantifier follows nothing in
regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(F) You started a regular expression with a quantifier.
Backslash it if you meant it literally. The &lt;-- HERE
shows in the regular expression about where the problem was
<br>
discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quantifier in {,} bigger than %d
in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(F) There is currently a limit to the size of the min and
max values of the {min,max} construct. The &lt;-- HERE shows
in the regular expression about where the problem was <br>
discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quantifier unexpected on
zero-length expression; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(W regexp) You applied a regular expression quantifier in a
place where it makes no sense, such as on a zero-width
assertion. Try putting the quantifier inside the assertion
<br>
instead. For example, the way to match &quot;abc&quot;
provided that it is followed by three repetitions of
&quot;xyz&quot; is &quot;/abc(?=(?:xyz){3})/&quot;, not
&quot;/abc(?=xyz){3}/&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;-- HERE shows in the
regular expression about where the problem was

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Range iterator outside integer
range <br>
(F) One (or both) of the numeric arguments to the range
operator &quot;..&quot; are outside the range which can be
represented by integers internally. One possible workaround
is to <br>
force Perl to use magical string increment by prepending
&quot;0&quot; to your numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readdir() attempted on invalid

(W io) The dirhandle you&rsquo;re reading from is either
closed or not really a dirhandle. Check your control

<p style="margin-top: 1em">realloc() of freed memory

(S malloc) An internal routine called realloc() on something
that had already been freed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recompile perl with -DDEBUGGING

(F debugging) You can&rsquo;t use the -D option unless the
code to produce the desired output is compiled into Perl,
which entails some overhead, which is why it&rsquo;s
currently left <br>
out of your copy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recursive call to
Perl_load_module in PerlIO_find_layer <br>
(P) It is currently not permitted to load modules when
creating a filehandle inside an %INC hook. This can happen
with &quot;open my $fh, &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo;, calar&quot;,
which implicitly loads <br>
PerlIO::scalar. Try loading PerlIO::scalar explicitly
first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recursive inheritance detected
in package &rsquo;%s&rsquo; <br>
(F) While calculating the method resolution order (MRO) of a
package, Perl believes it found an infinite loop in the @ISA
hierarchy. This is a crude check that bails out <br>
after 100 levels of @ISA depth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">refcnt_dec: fd %d%s <br>
refcnt: fd %d%s <br>

(P) Perl&rsquo;s I/O implementation failed an internal
consistency check. If you see this message, something is
very wrong.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reference found where even-sized
list expected <br>
(W misc) You gave a single reference where Perl was
expecting a list with an even number of elements (for
assignment to a hash). This usually means that you used the
anon <br>
hash constructor when you meant to use parens. In any case,
a hash requires key/value pairs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%hash = { one =&gt; 1, two =&gt;
2, }; # WRONG <br>
%hash = [ qw/ an anon array / ]; # WRONG <br>
%hash = ( one =&gt; 1, two =&gt; 2, ); # right <br>
%hash = qw( one 1 two 2 ); # also fine</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reference is already weak <br>
(W misc) You have attempted to weaken a reference that is
already weak. Doing so has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reference to invalid group 0
<br>
(F) You used &quot;&quot; or similar in a regular
expression. You may refer to capturing parentheses only with
strictly positive integers (normal backreferences) or with
strictly <br>
negative integers (relative backreferences). Using 0 does
not make sense.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reference to nonexistent group
in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(F) You used something like &quot;7&quot; in your regular
expression, but there are not at least seven sets of
capturing parentheses in the expression. If you wanted to
have the <br>

expression, prepend zeroes to make it three digits long:

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reference to nonexistent named

(F) You used something like &quot;NAME&rsquo;&quot; or
&quot;NAME&gt;&quot; in your regular expression, but there
is no corresponding named capturing parentheses such as
&quot;(?&rsquo;NAME&rsquo;...)&quot; or <br>
&quot;(?&lt;NAME&gt;...)&quot;. Check if the name has been
spelled correctly both in the backreference and the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;-- HERE shows in the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reference to nonexistent or
unclosed group in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(F) You used something like &quot;-7}&quot; in your regular

capturing parentheses in the expression before where the
<br>
&quot;-7}&quot; was located.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;-- HERE shows in the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">regexp memory corruption <br>
(P) The regular expression engine got confused by what the
regular expression compiler gave it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regexp modifier &quot;/%c&quot;
may appear a maximum of twice <br>
Regexp modifier &quot;/%c&quot; may not appear twice <br>
(F syntax, regexp) The regular expression pattern had too
many occurrences of the specified modifier. Remove the
extraneous ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regexp modifier &quot;%c&quot;
may not appear after the &quot;-&quot; <br>
(F regexp) Turning off the given modifier has the side
effect of turning on another one. Perl currently
doesn&rsquo;t allow this. Reword the regular expression to
use the <br>
modifier you want to turn on (and place it before the
minus), instead of the one you want to turn off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regexp modifiers &quot;/%c&quot;
and &quot;/%c&quot; are mutually exclusive <br>
(F syntax, regexp) The regular expression pattern had more
than one of these mutually exclusive modifiers. Retain only
the modifier that is supposed to be there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regexp out of space <br>
(P) A &quot;can&rsquo;t happen&quot; error, because
safemalloc() should have caught it earlier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Repeated format line will never
terminate (~~ and @# incompatible) <br>
(F) Your format contains the ~~ repeat-until-blank sequence
and a numeric field that will never go blank so that the
repetition never terminates. You might use ^# instead. <br>
See perlform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replacement list is longer than
search list <br>
(W misc) You have used a replacement list that is longer
than the search list. So the additional elements in the
replacement list are meaningless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reversed %s= operator <br>
(W syntax) You wrote your assignment operator backwards. The
= must always come last, to avoid ambiguity with subsequent
unary operators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rewinddir() attempted on invalid
dirhandle %s <br>
(W io) The dirhandle you tried to do a rewinddir() on is
either closed or not really a dirhandle. Check your control
flow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scalars leaked: %d <br>
(P) Something went wrong in Perl&rsquo;s internal
bookkeeping of scalars: not all scalar variables were
deallocated by the time Perl exited. What this usually
indicates is a <br>
memory leak, which is of course bad, especially if the Perl
program is intended to be long-running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scalar value @%s[%s] better
written as $%s[%s] <br>
(W syntax) You&rsquo;ve used an array slice (indicated by @)
to select a single element of an array. Generally it&rsquo;s
better to ask for a scalar value (indicated by $). The <br>
difference is that $foo[&amp;bar] always behaves like a
scalar, both when assigning to it and when evaluating its
argument, while @foo[&amp;bar] behaves like a list when you
assign <br>
to it, and provides a list context to its subscript, which
can do weird things if you&rsquo;re expecting only one
subscript.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the other hand, if you were
actually hoping to treat the array element as a list, you
need to look into how references work, because Perl will not
magically convert <br>
between scalars and lists for you. See perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scalar value @%s{%s} better
written as $%s{%s} <br>
(W syntax) You&rsquo;ve used a hash slice (indicated by @)
to select a single element of a hash. Generally it&rsquo;s
better to ask for a scalar value (indicated by $). The
difference <br>
is that $foo{&amp;bar} always behaves like a scalar, both
when assigning to it and when evaluating its argument, while
@foo{&amp;bar} behaves like a list when you assign to it,
and <br>
provides a list context to its subscript, which can do weird
things if you&rsquo;re expecting only one subscript.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the other hand, if you were

magically convert between <br>
scalars and lists for you. See perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Search pattern not terminated
<br>
(F) The lexer couldn&rsquo;t find the final delimiter of a
// or m{} construct. Remember that bracketing delimiters
count nesting level. Missing the leading &quot;$&quot; from
a variable <br>
$m may cause this error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that since Perl 5.9.0 a //
can also be the defined-or construct, not just the empty
search pattern. Therefore code written in Perl 5.9.0 or
later that uses the // as <br>
the defined-or can be misparsed by pre-5.9.0 Perls as a
non-terminated search pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Search pattern not terminated or
ternary operator parsed as search pattern <br>
(F) The lexer couldn&rsquo;t find the final delimiter of a
&quot;?PATTERN?&quot; construct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The question mark is also used
as part of the ternary operator (as in &quot;foo ? 0 :
1&quot;) leading to some ambiguous constructions being
wrongly parsed. One way to disambiguate <br>
the parsing is to put parentheses around the conditional

(W io) The dirhandle you are doing a seekdir() on is either
closed or not really a dirhandle. Check your control

(F) This machine doesn&rsquo;t implement the select() system

(F) Self-ties are of arrays and hashes are not supported in

in fact, exist. Perhaps you put it into the wrong
package?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Smart matching a non-overloaded
object breaks encapsulation <br>
(F) You should not use the &quot;~~&quot; operator on an
object that does not overload it: Perl refuses to use the
object&rsquo;s underlying structure for the smart match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort is now a reserved word <br>
(F) An ancient error message that almost nobody ever runs
into anymore. But before sort was a keyword, people
sometimes used it as a filehandle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sort subroutine didn&rsquo;t
return single value <br>
(F) A sort comparison subroutine may not return a list value
with more or less than one element. See &quot;sort&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Source filters apply only to
byte streams <br>
(F) You tried to activate a source filter (usually by
loading a source filter module) within a string passed to
&quot;eval&quot;. This is not permitted under the
&quot;unicode_eval&quot; <br>
feature. Consider using &quot;evalbytes&quot; instead. See
feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splice() offset past end of
array <br>
(W misc) You attempted to specify an offset that was past
the end of the array passed to splice(). Splicing will
instead commence at the end of the array, rather than past
<br>
it. If this isn&rsquo;t what you want, try explicitly
pre-extending the array by assigning $#array = $offset. See
&quot;splice&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Split loop <br>
(P) The split was looping infinitely. (Obviously, a split
shouldn&rsquo;t iterate more times than there are characters
of input, which is what happened.) See &quot;split&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Statement unlikely to be reached
<br>
(W exec) You did an exec() with some statement after it
other than a die(). This is almost always an error, because
exec() never returns unless there was a failure. You <br>
probably wanted to use system() instead, which does return.
To suppress this warning, put the exec() in a block by
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;state&quot; variable %s
can&rsquo;t be in a package <br>
(F) Lexically scoped variables aren&rsquo;t in a package, so
it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to try to declare one with a
package qualifier on the front. Use local() if you want to
localize <br>
a package variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stat() on unopened filehandle %s
<br>
(W unopened) You tried to use the stat() function on a
filehandle that was either never opened or has since been
closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stub found while resolving
method &quot;%s&quot; overloading &quot;%s&quot; in package
&quot;%s&quot; <br>
(P) Overloading resolution over @ISA tree may be broken by
importation stubs. Stubs should never be implicitly created,
but explicit calls to &quot;can&quot; may break this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subroutine %s redefined <br>
(W redefine) You redefined a subroutine. To suppress this
warning, say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ <br>
no warnings &rsquo;redefine&rsquo;; <br>
eval &quot;sub name { ... }&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Substitution loop <br>
(P) The substitution was looping infinitely. (Obviously, a
substitution shouldn&rsquo;t iterate more times than there
are characters of input, which is what happened.) See the
<br>
discussion of substitution in &quot;Regexp Quote-Like
Operators&quot; in perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Substitution pattern not
terminated <br>
(F) The lexer couldn&rsquo;t find the interior delimiter of
an s/// or s{}{} construct. Remember that bracketing
delimiters count nesting level. Missing the leading
&quot;$&quot; from <br>
variable $s may cause this error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Substitution replacement not
terminated <br>
(F) The lexer couldn&rsquo;t find the final delimiter of an
s/// or s{}{} construct. Remember that bracketing delimiters
count nesting level. Missing the leading &quot;$&quot; from
<br>
variable $s may cause this error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">substr outside of string <br>
(W substr)(F) You tried to reference a substr() that pointed
outside of a string. That is, the absolute value of the
offset was larger than the length of the string. See <br>
&quot;substr&quot; in perlfunc. This warning is fatal if
substr is used in an lvalue context (as the left hand side
of an assignment or as a subroutine argument for
example).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sv_upgrade from type %d down to
type %d <br>
(P) Perl tried to force the upgrade of an SV to a type which
was actually inferior to its current type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switch (?(condition)... contains
too many branches in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/
<br>
(F) A (?(condition)if-clause|else-clause) construct can have
at most two branches (the if-clause and the else-clause). If
you want one or both to contain alternation, such <br>
as using &quot;this|that|other&quot;, enclose it in
clustering parentheses:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">(?(condition)(?:this|that|other)|else-clause)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;-- HERE shows in the
regular expression about where the problem was discovered.
See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switch condition not recognized
in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(F) If the argument to the (?(...)if-clause|else-clause)
construct is a number, it can be only a number. The &lt;--
HERE shows in the regular expression about where the problem
<br>
was discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">switching effective %s is not
implemented <br>
(F) While under the &quot;use filetest&quot; pragma, we
cannot switch the real and effective uids or gids.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s syntax OK <br>
(F) The final summary message when a &quot;perl -c&quot;
succeeds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syntax error <br>
(F) Probably means you had a syntax error. Common reasons
include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A keyword is misspelled. <br>
A semicolon is missing. <br>
A comma is missing. <br>
An opening or closing parenthesis is missing. <br>
An opening or closing brace is missing. <br>
A closing quote is missing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Often there will be another
error message associated with the syntax error giving more
information. (Sometimes it helps to turn on -w.) The error
message itself often tells <br>
you where it was in the line when it decided to give up.
Sometimes the actual error is several tokens before this,
because Perl is good at understanding random input. <br>
Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in
a blue moon the only way to figure out what&rsquo;s
triggering the error is to call &quot;perl -c&quot;
repeatedly, chopping away <br>
half the program each time to see if the error went away.
Sort of the cybernetic version of 20 questions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syntax error at line %d:
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; unexpected <br>
(A) You&rsquo;ve accidentally run your script through the
Bourne shell instead of Perl. Check the #! line, or manually
feed your script into Perl yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syntax error in file %s at line
%d, next 2 tokens &quot;%s&quot; <br>
(F) This error is likely to occur if you run a perl5 script
through a perl4 interpreter, especially if the next 2 tokens
are &quot;use strict&quot; or &quot;my $var&quot; or
&quot;our $var&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sysread() on closed filehandle
%s <br>
(W closed) You tried to read from a closed filehandle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sysread() on unopened filehandle
%s <br>
(W unopened) You tried to read from a filehandle that was
never opened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">System V %s is not implemented
on this machine <br>
(F) You tried to do something with a function beginning with
&quot;sem&quot;, &quot;shm&quot;, or &quot;msg&quot; but
that System V IPC is not implemented in your machine. In
some machines the <br>
functionality can exist but be unconfigured. Consult your
system support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syswrite() on closed filehandle
%s <br>
(W closed) The filehandle you&rsquo;re writing to got itself
closed sometime before now. Check your control flow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;-T&quot; and
&quot;-B&quot; not implemented on filehandles <br>
(F) Perl can&rsquo;t peek at the stdio buffer of filehandles
when it doesn&rsquo;t know about your kind of stdio.
You&rsquo;ll have to use a filename instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Target of goto is too deeply
nested <br>
(F) You tried to use &quot;goto&quot; to reach a label that
was too deeply nested for Perl to reach. Perl is doing you a
favor by refusing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">telldir() attempted on invalid
dirhandle %s <br>
(W io) The dirhandle you tried to telldir() is either closed
or not really a dirhandle. Check your control flow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tell() on unopened filehandle
<br>
(W unopened) You tried to use the tell() function on a
filehandle that was either never opened or has since been
closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That use of $[ is unsupported
<br>
(F) Assignment to $[ is now strictly circumscribed, and
interpreted as a compiler directive. You may say only one
of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[ = 0; <br>
$[ = 1; <br>
... <br>
local $[ = 0; <br>
local $[ = 1; <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is to prevent the problem
of one module changing the array base out from under another
module inadvertently. See &quot;$[&quot; in perlvar and
arybase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The crypt() function is
unimplemented due to excessive paranoia <br>
(F) Configure couldn&rsquo;t find the crypt() function on
your machine, probably because your vendor didn&rsquo;t
supply it, probably because they think the U.S. Government
thinks it&rsquo;s a <br>
secret, or at least that they will continue to pretend that
it is. And if you quote me on that, I will deny it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The %s function is unimplemented
<br>
(F) The function indicated isn&rsquo;t implemented on this
architecture, according to the probings of Configure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The stat preceding %s
wasn&rsquo;t an lstat <br>
(F) It makes no sense to test the current stat buffer for
symbolic linkhood if the last stat that wrote to the stat
buffer already went past the symlink to get to the real <br>
file. Use an actual filename instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;unique&rsquo;
attribute may only be applied to &rsquo;our&rsquo; variables
<br>
(F) This attribute was never supported on &quot;my&quot; or
&quot;sub&quot; declarations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This Perl can&rsquo;t reset CRTL
environ elements (%s) <br>
This Perl can&rsquo;t set CRTL environ elements (%s=%s) <br>
(W internal) Warnings peculiar to VMS. You tried to change
or delete an element of the CRTL&rsquo;s internal environ
array, but your copy of Perl wasn&rsquo;t built with a CRTL
that <br>
contained the setenv() function. You&rsquo;ll need to
rebuild Perl with a CRTL that does, or redefine
PERL_ENV_TABLES (see perlvms) so that the environ array
isn&rsquo;t the target of <br>
the change to %ENV which produced the warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">thread failed to start: %s <br>
(W threads)(S) The entry point function of
threads-&gt;create() failed for some reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">times not implemented <br>
(F) Your version of the C library apparently doesn&rsquo;t
do times(). I suspect you&rsquo;re not running on Unix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;-T&quot; is on the #!
line, it must also be used on the command line <br>
(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script
contains the -T option (or the -t option), but Perl was not
invoked with -T in its command line. This is an error <br>
because, by the time Perl discovers a -T in a script,
it&rsquo;s too late to properly taint everything from the
environment. So Perl gives up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the Perl script is being
executed as a command using the #! mechanism (or its local
equivalent), this error can usually be fixed by editing the
#! line so that the -%c <br>
option is a part of Perl&rsquo;s first argument: e.g. change
&quot;perl -n -%c&quot; to &quot;perl -%c -n&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the Perl script is being
executed as &quot;perl scriptname&quot;, then the -%c option
must appear on the command line: &quot;perl -%c
scriptname&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To%s: illegal mapping
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; <br>
(F) You tried to define a customized To-mapping for lc(),
lcfirst, uc(), or ucfirst() (or their string-inlined
versions), but you specified an illegal mapping. See
&quot;User- <br>
Defined Character Properties&quot; in perlunicode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Too deeply nested ()-groups <br>
(F) Your template contains ()-groups with a ridiculously
deep nesting level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Too few args to syscall <br>
(F) There has to be at least one argument to syscall() to
specify the system call to call, silly dilly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Too late for &quot;-%s&quot;
option <br>
(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script
contains the -M, -m or -C option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the case of -M and -m, this
is an error because those options are not intended for use
inside scripts. Use the &quot;use&quot; pragma instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -C option only works if it
is specified on the command line as well (with the same
sequence of letters or numbers following). Either specify
this option on the command <br>
line, or, if your system supports it, make your script
executable and run it directly instead of passing it to
perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Too late to run %s block <br>
(W void) A CHECK or INIT block is being defined during run
time proper, when the opportunity to run them has already
passed. Perhaps you are loading a file with
&quot;require&quot; or <br>
&quot;do&quot; when you should be using &quot;use&quot;
instead. Or perhaps you should put the &quot;require&quot;
or &quot;do&quot; inside a BEGIN block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Too many args to syscall <br>
(F) Perl supports a maximum of only 14 args to
syscall().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Too many arguments for %s <br>
(F) The function requires fewer arguments than you
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Too many )&rsquo;s <br>
(A) You&rsquo;ve accidentally run your script through csh
instead of Perl. Check the #! line, or manually feed your
script into Perl yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Too many (&rsquo;s <br>
(A) You&rsquo;ve accidentally run your script through csh
instead of Perl. Check the #! line, or manually feed your
script into Perl yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trailing &nbsp;in regex m/%s/
<br>
(F) The regular expression ends with an unbackslashed
backslash. Backslash it. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transliteration pattern not
terminated <br>
(F) The lexer couldn&rsquo;t find the interior delimiter of
a tr/// or tr[][] or y/// or y[][] construct. Missing the
leading &quot;$&quot; from variables $tr or $y may cause
this error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transliteration replacement not
terminated <br>
(F) The lexer couldn&rsquo;t find the final delimiter of a
tr///, tr[][], y/// or y[][] construct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;%s&rsquo; trapped by
operation mask <br>
(F) You tried to use an operator from a Safe compartment in
which it&rsquo;s disallowed. See Safe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">truncate not implemented <br>
(F) Your machine doesn&rsquo;t implement a file truncation
mechanism that Configure knows about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Type of arg %d to &amp;CORE::%s
must be %s <br>
(F) The subroutine in question in the CORE package requires
its argument to be a hard reference to data of the specified
type. Overloading is ignored, so a reference to an <br>
object that is not the specified type, but nonetheless has
overloading to handle it, will still not be accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Type of arg %d to %s must be %s
(not %s) <br>
(F) This function requires the argument in that position to
be of a certain type. Arrays must be @NAME or
&quot;@{EXPR}&quot;. Hashes must be %NAME or
&quot;%{EXPR}&quot;. No implicit <br>
dereferencing is allowed--use the {EXPR} forms as an
explicit dereference. See perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Type of argument to %s must be
unblessed hashref or arrayref <br>
(F) You called &quot;keys&quot;, &quot;values&quot; or
&quot;each&quot; with a scalar argument that was not a
reference to an unblessed hash or array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">umask not implemented <br>
(F) Your machine doesn&rsquo;t implement the umask function
and you tried to use it to restrict permissions for yourself
(EXPR &amp; 0700).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unable to create sub named
&quot;%s&quot; <br>
(F) You attempted to create or access a subroutine with an
illegal name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unbalanced context: %d more

(W internal) The exit code detected an internal
inconsistency in how many execution contexts were entered
and left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unbalanced saves: %d more saves

(W internal) The exit code detected an internal
inconsistency in how many blocks were entered and left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unbalanced string table

(W internal) On exit, Perl found some strings remaining in
the shared string table used for copy on write and for hash
keys. The entries should have been freed, so this <br>
indicates a bug somewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unbalanced tmps: %d more allocs

(W internal) The exit code detected an internal
inconsistency in how many mortal scalars were allocated and
freed.</p>

if it was, it has since been undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Undefined subroutine called <br>
(F) The anonymous subroutine you&rsquo;re trying to call
hasn&rsquo;t been defined, or if it was, it has since been
undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Undefined subroutine in sort
<br>
(F) The sort comparison routine specified is declared but
doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been defined yet. See

(F) The format indicated doesn&rsquo;t seem to exist.
Perhaps it&rsquo;s really in another package? See
perlform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Undefined value assigned to
typeglob <br>
(W misc) An undefined value was assigned to a typeglob, a la
&quot;*foo = undef&quot;. This does nothing. It&rsquo;s
possible that you really mean &quot;undef *foo&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s: Undefined variable <br>
(A) You&rsquo;ve accidentally run your script through csh
instead of Perl. Check the #! line, or manually feed your
script into Perl yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unexec of %s into %s failed!
<br>
(F) The unexec() routine failed for some reason. See your
local FSF representative, who probably put it there in the
first place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unexpected constant lvalue
entersub entry via type/targ %d:%d <br>
(P) When compiling a subroutine call in lvalue context, Perl
failed an internal consistency check. It encountered a
malformed op tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unicode non-character U+%X is
illegal for open interchange <br>
(W utf8, nonchar) Certain codepoints, such as U+FFFE and
U+FFFF, are defined by the Unicode standard to be
non-characters. Those are legal codepoints, but are reserved
for <br>
internal use; so, applications shouldn&rsquo;t attempt to
exchange them. If you know what you are doing you can turn
off this warning by &quot;no warnings
&rsquo;nonchar&rsquo;;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unicode surrogate U+%X is
illegal in UTF-8 <br>
(W utf8, surrogate) You had a UTF-16 surrogate in a context
where they are not considered acceptable. These code points,
between U+D800 and U+DFFF (inclusive), are used by <br>
Unicode only for UTF-16. However, Perl internally allows all
unsigned integer code points (up to the size limit available
on your platform), including surrogates. But these <br>
can cause problems when being input or output, which is
likely where this message came from. If you really really
know what you are doing you can turn off this warning by

&quot;no warnings &rsquo;surrogate&rsquo;;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unknown BYTEORDER <br>
(F) There are no byte-swapping functions for a machine with
this byte order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unknown error <br>
(P) Perl was about to print an error message in $@, but the
$@ variable did not exist, even after an attempt to create

&quot;&lt;&amp;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&amp;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unknown PerlIO layer
&quot;%s&quot; <br>
(W layer) An attempt was made to push an unknown layer onto
the Perl I/O system. (Layers take care of transforming data
between external and internal representations.) Note <br>
that some layers, such as &quot;mmap&quot;, are not
supported in all environments. If your program didn&rsquo;t
explicitly request the failing operation, it may be the
result of the value <br>
of the environment variable PERLIO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unknown process %x sent message
to prime_env_iter: %s <br>
(P) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl was reading values for
%ENV before iterating over it, and someone else stuck a
message in the stream of data Perl expected. Someone&rsquo;s
<br>
very confused, or perhaps trying to subvert Perl&rsquo;s
population of %ENV for nefarious purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unmatched [ in regex; marked by
&lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(F) The brackets around a character class must match. If you
wish to include a closing bracket in a character class,
backslash it or put it first. The &lt;-- HERE shows in the
<br>
regular expression about where the problem was discovered.
See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unmatched ( in regex; marked by
&lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(F) Unbackslashed parentheses must always be balanced in
regular expressions. If you&rsquo;re a vi user, the % key is
valuable for finding the matching parenthesis. The &lt;--
HERE <br>
shows in the regular expression about where the problem was
discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unmatched right %s bracket <br>
(F) The lexer counted more closing curly or square brackets
than opening ones, so you&rsquo;re probably missing a
matching opening bracket. As a general rule, you&rsquo;ll
find the <br>
missing one (so to speak) near the place you were last
editing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unquoted string &quot;%s&quot;
may clash with future reserved word <br>
(W reserved) You used a bareword that might someday be
claimed as a reserved word. It&rsquo;s best to put such a
word in quotes, or capitalize it somehow, or insert an
underbar <br>
into it. You might also declare it as a subroutine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unrecognized character %s;
marked by &lt;-- HERE after %s near column %d <br>
(F) The Perl parser has no idea what to do with the
specified character in your Perl script (or eval) near the
specified column. Perhaps you tried to run a compressed <br>
script, a binary program, or a directory as a Perl
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unrecognized escape c in
character class passed through in regex; marked by &lt;--
HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(W regexp) You used a backslash-character combination which
is not recognized by Perl inside character classes. The
character was understood literally, but this may change <br>
in a future version of Perl. The &lt;-- HERE shows in the
regular expression about where the escape was
discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unrecognized escape c passed
through <br>
(W misc) You used a backslash-character combination which is
not recognized by Perl. The character was understood
literally, but this may change in a future version of
Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unrecognized escape s passed
through in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(W regexp) You used a backslash-character combination which
is not recognized by Perl. The character(s) were understood
literally, but this may change in a future version of <br>
Perl. The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression about
where the escape was discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unrecognized signal name
&quot;%s&quot; <br>
(F) You specified a signal name to the kill() function that
was not recognized. Say &quot;kill -l&quot; in your shell to
see the valid signal names on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unrecognized switch: -%s (-h
will show valid options) <br>
(F) You specified an illegal option to Perl. Don&rsquo;t do
that. (If you think you didn&rsquo;t do that, check the #!
line to see if it&rsquo;s supplying the bad switch on your
behalf.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unsuccessful %s on filename
containing newline <br>
(W newline) A file operation was attempted on a filename,
and that operation failed, PROBABLY because the filename
contained a newline, PROBABLY because you forgot to chomp()
<br>
it off. See &quot;chomp&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unsupported directory function
&quot;%s&quot; called <br>
(F) Your machine doesn&rsquo;t support opendir() and
readdir().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unsupported function %s <br>
(F) This machine doesn&rsquo;t implement the indicated
function, apparently. At least, Configure doesn&rsquo;t
think so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unsupported function fork <br>
(F) Your version of executable does not support forking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that under some systems,
like OS/2, there may be different flavors of Perl
executables, some of which may support fork, some not. Try
changing the name you call Perl by <br>
to &quot;perl_&quot;, &quot;perl__&quot;, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unsupported script encoding %s
<br>
(F) Your program file begins with a Unicode Byte Order Mark
(BOM) which declares it to be in a Unicode encoding that
Perl cannot read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unsupported socket function
&quot;%s&quot; called <br>
(F) Your machine doesn&rsquo;t support the Berkeley socket
mechanism, or at least that&rsquo;s what Configure
thought.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unterminated attribute list <br>
(F) The lexer found something other than a simple identifier
at the start of an attribute, and it wasn&rsquo;t a
semicolon or the start of a block. Perhaps you terminated
the <br>
parameter list of the previous attribute too soon. See
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unterminated attribute parameter
in attribute list <br>
(F) The lexer saw an opening (left) parenthesis character
while parsing an attribute list, but the matching closing
(right) parenthesis character was not found. You may need
<br>
to add (or remove) a backslash character to get your
parentheses to balance. See attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unterminated compressed integer
<br>
(F) An argument to unpack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was
incompatible with the BER compressed integer format and
could not be converted to an integer. See &quot;pack&quot;
in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unterminated ...} pattern in
regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(F) You missed a close brace on a ..} pattern (group
reference) in a regular expression. Fix the pattern and
retry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unterminated &lt;&gt; operator
<br>
(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it
was expecting a term, so it&rsquo;s looking for the
corresponding right angle bracket, and not finding it.
Chances are <br>
you left some needed parentheses out earlier in the line,
and you really meant a &quot;less than&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unterminated verb pattern
argument in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(F) You used a pattern of the form &quot;(*VERB:ARG)&quot;
but did not terminate the pattern with a &quot;)&quot;. Fix
the pattern and retry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unterminated verb pattern in
regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(F) You used a pattern of the form &quot;(*VERB)&quot; but
did not terminate the pattern with a &quot;)&quot;. Fix the
pattern and retry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">untie attempted while %d inner
references still exist <br>
(W untie) A copy of the object returned from &quot;tie&quot;
(or &quot;tied&quot;) was still valid when &quot;untie&quot;
was called.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usage: POSIX::%s(%s) <br>
(F) You called a POSIX function with incorrect arguments.
See &quot;FUNCTIONS&quot; in POSIX for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usage: Win32::%s(%s) <br>
(F) You called a Win32 function with incorrect arguments.
See Win32 for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$[ used in %s (did you mean $]
?) <br>
(W syntax) You used $[ in a comparison, such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ($[ &gt; 5.006) { <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You probably meant to use $]
instead. $[ is the base for indexing arrays. $] is the Perl
version number in decimal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Useless assignment to a
temporary <br>
(W misc) You assigned to an lvalue subroutine, but what the
subroutine returned was a temporary scalar about to be
discarded, so the assignment had no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Useless (?-%s) - don&rsquo;t use
/%s modifier in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(W regexp) You have used an internal modifier such as (?-o)
that has no meaning unless removed from the entire
regexp:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ($string =~ /(?-o)$pattern/o)
{ ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">must be written as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ($string =~ /$pattern/) { ...
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;-- HERE shows in the
regular expression about where the problem was discovered.
See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Useless localization of %s <br>
(W syntax) The localization of lvalues such as
&quot;local($x=10)&quot; is legal, but in fact the local()
currently has no effect. This may change at some point in
the future, but in <br>
the meantime such code is discouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Useless (?%s) - use /%s modifier
in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ <br>
(W regexp) You have used an internal modifier such as (?o)
that has no meaning unless applied to the entire regexp:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ($string =~ /(?o)$pattern/) {
... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">must be written as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ($string =~ /$pattern/o) {
... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;-- HERE shows in the
regular expression about where the problem was discovered.
See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Useless use of /d modifier in
transliteration operator <br>
(W misc) You have used the /d modifier where the searchlist
has the same length as the replacelist. See perlop for more
information about the /d modifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Useless use of (W misc) You have
a &nbsp;in a double-quotish string without a &quot;U&quot;,
&quot;r &quot;Q&quot; preceding it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Useless use of %s in void
context <br>
(W void) You did something without a side effect in a
context that does nothing with the return value, such as a
statement that doesn&rsquo;t return a value from a block, or
the <br>
left side of a scalar comma operator. Very often this points
not to stupidity on your part, but a failure of Perl to
parse your program the way you thought it would. For <br>
example, you&rsquo;d get this if you mixed up your C
precedence with Python precedence and said</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$one, $two = 1, 2;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">when you meant to say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">($one, $two) = (1, 2);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another common error is to use
ordinary parentheses to construct a list reference when you
should be using square or curly brackets, for example, if
you say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$array = (1,2);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">when you should have said</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$array = [1,2];</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The square brackets explicitly
turn a list value into a scalar value, while parentheses do
not. So when a parenthesized list is evaluated in a scalar
context, the comma is <br>
treated like C&rsquo;s comma operator, which throws away the
left argument, which is not what you want. See perlref for
more on this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning will not be issued
for numerical constants equal to 0 or 1 since they are often
used in statements like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 while
sub_with_side_effects();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">String constants that would
normally evaluate to 0 or 1 are warned about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Useless use of &quot;re&quot;
pragma <br>
(W) You did &quot;use re;&quot; without any arguments. That
isn&rsquo;t very useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Useless use of sort in scalar
context <br>
(W void) You used sort in scalar context, as in :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $x = sort @y;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is not very useful, and
perl currently optimizes this away.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Useless use of %s with no values
<br>
(W syntax) You used the push() or unshift() function with no
arguments apart from the array, like &quot;push(@x)&quot; or
&quot;unshift(@foo)&quot;. That won&rsquo;t usually have any
effect on the <br>
array, so is completely useless. It&rsquo;s possible in
principle that push(@tied_array) could have some effect if
the array is tied to a class which implements a PUSH method.
If <br>
so, you can write it as &quot;push(@tied_array,())&quot; to
avoid this warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;use&quot; not allowed in
expression <br>
(F) The &quot;use&quot; keyword is recognized and executed
at compile time, and returns no useful value. See
perlmod.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of assignment to $[ is
deprecated <br>
(D deprecated) The $[ variable (index of the first element
in an array) is deprecated. See &quot;$[&quot; in
perlvar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of bare &lt;&lt; to mean
&lt;&lt;&quot;&quot; is deprecated <br>
(D deprecated) You are now encouraged to use the explicitly
quoted form if you wish to use an empty line as the
terminator of the here-document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of comma-less variable list
is deprecated <br>
(D deprecated) The values you give to a format should be
separated by commas, not just aligned on a line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of chdir(&rsquo;&rsquo;) or
chdir(undef) as chdir() deprecated <br>
(D deprecated) chdir() with no arguments is documented to
change to $ENV{HOME} or $ENV{LOGDIR}. chdir(undef) and
chdir(&rsquo;&rsquo;) share this behavior, but that has been
deprecated. <br>
In future versions they will simply fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be careful to check that what
you pass to chdir() is defined and not blank, else you might
find yourself in your home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of /c modifier is
meaningless in s/// <br>
(W regexp) You used the /c modifier in a substitution. The
/c modifier is not presently meaningful in
substitutions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of /c modifier is
meaningless without /g <br>
(W regexp) You used the /c modifier with a regex operand,
but didn&rsquo;t use the /g modifier. Currently, /c is
meaningful only when /g is used. (This may change in the
future.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of := for an empty attribute
list is not allowed <br>
(F) The construction &quot;my $x := 42&quot; used to parse
as equivalent to &quot;my $x : = 42&quot; (applying an empty
attribute list to $x). This construct was deprecated in
5.12.0, and has <br>
now been made a syntax error, so &quot;:=&quot; can be
reclaimed as a new operator in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need an empty attribute
list, for example in a code generator, add a space before
the &quot;=&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of freed value in iteration
<br>
(F) Perhaps you modified the iterated array within the loop?
This error is typically caused by code like the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@a = (3,4); <br>
@a = () for (1,2,@a);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You are not supposed to modify
arrays while they are being iterated over. For speed and
efficiency reasons, Perl internally does not do full
reference-counting of iterated <br>
items, hence deleting such an item in the middle of an
iteration causes Perl to see a freed value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of *glob{FILEHANDLE} is
deprecated <br>
(D deprecated) You are now encouraged to use the shorter
*glob{IO} form to access the filehandle slot within a
typeglob.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of /g modifier is
meaningless in split <br>
(W regexp) You used the /g modifier on the pattern for a
&quot;split&quot; operator. Since &quot;split&quot; always
tries to match the pattern repeatedly, the &quot;/g&quot;
has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of &quot;goto&quot; to jump
into a construct is deprecated <br>
(D deprecated) Using &quot;goto&quot; to jump from an outer
scope into an inner scope is deprecated and should be
avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for
non-method %s() is deprecated <br>
(D deprecated) As an (ahem) accidental feature,
&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; subroutines are looked up as methods
(using the @ISA hierarchy) even when the subroutines to be
autoloaded were <br>
called as plain functions (e.g. &quot;Foo::bar()&quot;), not
as methods (e.g. &quot;Foo-&gt;bar()&quot; or
&quot;$obj-&gt;bar()&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This bug will be rectified in
future by using method lookup only for methods&rsquo;
&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;s. However, there is a significant base
of existing code that may be using the old <br>
behavior. So, as an interim step, Perl currently issues an
optional warning when non-methods use inherited
&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The simple rule is: Inheritance
will not work when autoloading non-methods. The simple fix
for old code is: In any module that used to depend on
inheriting &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; for <br>
non-methods from a base class named &quot;BaseClass&quot;,
execute &quot;*AUTOLOAD = BaseClass::AUTOLOAD&quot; during
startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In code that currently says
&quot;use AutoLoader; @ISA = qw(AutoLoader);&quot; you
should remove AutoLoader from @ISA and change &quot;use
AutoLoader;&quot; to &quot;use AutoLoader
&rsquo;AUTOLOAD&rsquo;;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of %s in printf format not
supported <br>
(F) You attempted to use a feature of printf that is
accessible from only C. This usually means there&rsquo;s a
better way to do it in Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of %s is deprecated <br>
(D deprecated) The construct indicated is no longer
recommended for use, generally because there&rsquo;s a
better way to do it, and also because the old way has bad
side effects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of -l on filehandle %s <br>
(W io) A filehandle represents an opened file, and when you
opened the file it already went past any symlink you are
presumably trying to look for. The operation returned <br>
&quot;undef&quot;. Use a filename instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of %s on a handle without *
is deprecated <br>
(D deprecated) You used &quot;tie&quot;, &quot;tied&quot; or
&quot;untie&quot; on a scalar but that scalar happens to
hold a typeglob, which means its filehandle will be tied. If
you mean to tie a <br>
handle, use an explicit * as in &quot;tie
*$handle&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This was a long-standing bug
that was removed in Perl 5.16, as there was no way to tie
the scalar itself when it held a typeglob, and no way to
untie a scalar that had had a <br>
typeglob assigned to it. If you see this message, you must
be using an older version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of ?PATTERN? without
explicit operator is deprecated <br>
(D deprecated) You have written something like &quot;?2880
<br>
deprecated, so that the question mark will be available for
use in new operators in the future. Write &quot;m?1536 <br>
delimiter still invokes match-once behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of qw(...) as parentheses is
deprecated <br>
(D deprecated) You have something like &quot;foreach $x qw(a
b c) {...}&quot;, using a &quot;qw(...)&quot; list literal
where a parenthesised expression is expected. Historically
the parser <br>
fooled itself into thinking that &quot;qw(...)&quot;
literals were always enclosed in parentheses, and as a
result you could sometimes omit parentheses around them.
(You could never <br>
do the &quot;foreach qw(a b c) {...}&quot; that you might
have expected, though.) The parser no longer lies to itself
in this way. Wrap the list literal in parentheses, like
&quot;foreach <br>
$x (qw(a b c)) {...}&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of reference &quot;%s&quot;
as array index <br>
(W misc) You tried to use a reference as an array index;
this probably isn&rsquo;t what you mean, because references
in numerical context tend to be huge numbers, and so usually
<br>
indicates programmer error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you really do mean it,
explicitly numify your reference, like so: $array[0+$ref].
This warning is not given for overloaded objects, however,
because you can overload the <br>
numification and stringification operators and then you
presumably know what you are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of reserved word
&quot;%s&quot; is deprecated <br>
(D deprecated) The indicated bareword is a reserved word.
Future versions of perl may use it as a keyword, so
you&rsquo;re better off either explicitly quoting the word
in a <br>
manner appropriate for its context of use, or using a
different name altogether. The warning can be suppressed for
subroutine names by either adding a &quot;&amp;&quot;
prefix, or using a <br>
package qualifier, e.g. &quot;&amp;our()&quot;, or
&quot;Foo::our()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of tainted arguments in %s
is deprecated <br>
(W taint, deprecated) You have supplied &quot;system()&quot;
or &quot;exec()&quot; with multiple arguments and at least
one of them is tainted. This used to be allowed but will
become a fatal <br>
error in a future version of perl. Untaint your arguments.
See perlsec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of uninitialized value%s
<br>
(W uninitialized) An undefined value was used as if it were
already defined. It was interpreted as a &quot;&quot; or a
0, but maybe it was a mistake. To suppress this warning
assign <br>
a defined value to your variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To help you figure out what was
undefined, perl will try to tell you the name of the
variable (if any) that was undefined. In some cases it
cannot do this, so it also tells <br>
you what operation you used the undefined value in. Note,
however, that perl optimizes your program anid the operation
displayed in the warning may not necessarily appear <br>
literally in your program. For example, &quot;that
$foo&quot; is usually optimized into &quot;&quot;that &quot;
. $foo&quot;, and the warning will refer to the
&quot;concatenation (.)&quot; operator, even though <br>
there is no &quot;.&quot; in your program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using a hash as a reference is
deprecated <br>
(D deprecated) You tried to use a hash as a reference, as in
&quot;%foo-&gt;{&quot;bar&quot;}&quot; or
&quot;%$ref-&gt;{&quot;hello&quot;}&quot;. Versions of perl
&lt;= 5.6.1 used to allow this syntax, but shouldn&rsquo;t
have. <br>
It is now deprecated, and will be removed in a future
version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using an array as a reference is
deprecated <br>
(D deprecated) You tried to use an array as a reference, as
in &quot;@foo-&gt;[23]&quot; or &quot;@$ref-&gt;[99]&quot;.
Versions of perl &lt;= 5.6.1 used to allow this syntax, but
shouldn&rsquo;t have. It is <br>
now deprecated, and will be removed in a future version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using just the first character
returned by in character class <br>
(W) A charnames handler may return a sequence of more than
one character. Currently all but the first one are discarded
when used in a regular expression pattern bracketed <br>
character class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using !~ with %s doesn&rsquo;t
make sense <br>
(F) Using the &quot;!~&quot; operator with
&quot;s///r&quot;, &quot;tr///r&quot; or &quot;y///r&quot;
is currently reserved for future use, as the exact behaviour
has not been decided. (Simply returning the <br>
boolean opposite of the modified string is usually not
particularly useful.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UTF-16 surrogate U+%X <br>
(W utf8, surrogate) You had a UTF-16 surrogate in a context
where they are not considered acceptable. These code points,
between U+D800 and U+DFFF (inclusive), are used by <br>
Unicode only for UTF-16. However, Perl internally allows all
unsigned integer code points (up to the size limit available
on your platform), including surrogates. But these <br>
can cause problems when being input or output, which is
likely where this message came from. If you really really
know what you are doing you can turn off this warning by
<br>
&quot;no warnings &rsquo;surrogate&rsquo;;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Value of %s can be
&quot;0&quot;; test with defined() <br>
(W misc) In a conditional expression, you used
&lt;HANDLE&gt;, &lt;*&gt; (glob), &quot;each()&quot;, or
&quot;readdir()&quot; as a boolean value. Each of these
constructs can return a value of &quot;0&quot;; that <br>
would make the conditional expression false, which is
probably not what you intended. When using these constructs
in conditional expressions, test their values with the <br>
&quot;defined&quot; operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Value of CLI symbol
&quot;%s&quot; too long <br>
(W misc) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl tried to read the
value of an %ENV element from a CLI symbol table, and found
a resultant string longer than 1024 characters. The <br>
return value has been truncated to 1024 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable &quot;%s&quot; is not
available <br>
(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or
eval is attempting to capture an outer lexical that is not
currently available. This can happen for one of two <br>
reasons. First, the outer lexical may be declared in an
outer anonymous subroutine that has not yet been created.
(Remember that named subs are created at compile time, <br>
while anonymous subs are created at run-time.) For
example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub { my $a; sub f { $a } }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the time that f is created,
it can&rsquo;t capture the current value of $a, since the
anonymous subroutine hasn&rsquo;t been created yet.
Conversely, the following won&rsquo;t give a <br>
warning since the anonymous subroutine has by now been
created and is live:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub { my $a; eval &rsquo;sub f {
$a }&rsquo; }-&gt;();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second situation is caused
by an eval accessing a variable that has gone out of scope,
for example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub f { <br>
my $a; <br>
sub { eval &rsquo;$a&rsquo; } <br>
} <br>
f()-&gt;();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here, when the &rsquo;$a&rsquo;
in the eval is being compiled, f() is not currently being
executed, so its $a is not available for capture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable &quot;%s&quot; is not
imported%s <br>
(W misc) With &quot;use strict&quot; in effect, you referred
to a global variable that you apparently thought was
imported from another module, because something else of the
same name <br>
(usually a subroutine) is exported by that module. It
usually means you put the wrong funny character on the front
of your variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable length lookbehind not
implemented in m/%s/ <br>
(F) Lookbehind is allowed only for subexpressions whose
length is fixed and known at compile time. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s&quot; variable %s masks
earlier declaration in same %s <br>
(W misc) A &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot; or
&quot;state&quot; variable has been redeclared in the
current scope or statement, effectively eliminating all
access to the previous instance. This is almost <br>
always a typographical error. Note that the earlier variable
will still exist until the end of the scope or until all
closure referents to it are destroyed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable syntax <br>
(A) You&rsquo;ve accidentally run your script through csh
instead of Perl. Check the #! line, or manually feed your
script into Perl yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable &quot;%s&quot; will not
stay shared <br>
(W closure) An inner (nested) named subroutine is
referencing a lexical variable defined in an outer named
subroutine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the inner subroutine is
called, it will see the value of the outer
subroutine&rsquo;s variable as it was before and during the
*first* call to the outer subroutine; in this <br>
case, after the first call to the outer subroutine is
complete, the inner and outer subroutines will no longer
share a common value for the variable. In other words, the
<br>
variable will no longer be shared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This problem can usually be
solved by making the inner subroutine anonymous, using the
&quot;sub {}&quot; syntax. When inner anonymous subs that
reference variables in outer <br>
subroutines are created, they are automatically rebound to
the current values of such variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vector argument not supported
with alpha versions <br>
(W internal) The %vd (s)printf format does not support
version objects with alpha parts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verb pattern &rsquo;%s&rsquo;
has a mandatory argument in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in
m/%s/ <br>
(F) You used a verb pattern that requires an argument.
Supply an argument or check that you are using the right
verb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verb pattern &rsquo;%s&rsquo;
may not have an argument in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in
m/%s/ <br>
(F) You used a verb pattern that is not allowed an argument.
Remove the argument or check that you are using the right
verb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version number must be a
constant number <br>
(P) The attempt to translate a &quot;use Module n.n
LIST&quot; statement into its equivalent &quot;BEGIN&quot;
block found an internal inconsistency with the version
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version string &rsquo;%s&rsquo;
contains invalid data; ignoring: &rsquo;%s&rsquo; <br>
(W misc) The version string contains invalid characters at
the end, which are being ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: something&rsquo;s wrong
<br>
(W) You passed warn() an empty string (the equivalent of
&quot;warn &quot;&quot;&quot;) or you called it with no args
and $@ was empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: unable to close
filehandle %s properly <br>
(S) The implicit close() done by an open() got an error
indication on the close(). This usually indicates your file
system ran out of disk space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: Use of &quot;%s&quot;
without parentheses is ambiguous <br>
(S ambiguous) You wrote a unary operator followed by
something that looks like a binary operator that could also
have been interpreted as a term or unary operator. For <br>
instance, if you know that the rand function has a default
argument of 1.0, and you write</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rand + 5;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">you may THINK you wrote the same
thing as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rand() + 5;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but in actual fact, you got</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rand(+5);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So put in parentheses to say
what you really mean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wide character in %s <br>
(S utf8) Perl met a wide character (&gt;255) when it
wasn&rsquo;t expecting one. This warning is by default on
for I/O (like print). The easiest way to quiet this warning
is simply <br>
to add the &quot;:utf8&quot; layer to the output, e.g.
&quot;binmode STDOUT, &rsquo;:utf8&rsquo;&quot;. Another way
to turn off the warning is to add &quot;no warnings
&rsquo;utf8&rsquo;;&quot; but that is often closer to <br>
cheating. In general, you are supposed to explicitly mark
the filehandle with an encoding, see open and
&quot;binmode&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Within []-length
&rsquo;%c&rsquo; not allowed <br>
(F) The count in the (un)pack template may be replaced by
&quot;[TEMPLATE]&quot; only if &quot;TEMPLATE&quot; always
matches the same amount of packed bytes that can be
determined from the <br>
template alone. This is not possible if it contains any of
the codes @, /, U, u, w or a *-length. Redesign the
template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">write() on closed filehandle %s
<br>
(W closed) The filehandle you&rsquo;re writing to got itself
closed sometime before now. Check your control flow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s &quot;X&quot; does not map to
Unicode <br>
(F) When reading in different encodings Perl tries to map
everything into Unicode characters. The bytes you read in
are not legal in this encoding, for example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utf8 &quot; does not map to
Unicode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if you try to read in the
a-diaereses Latin-1 as UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;X&rsquo; outside of
string <br>
(F) You had a (un)pack template that specified a relative
position before the beginning of the string being
(un)packed. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;x&rsquo; outside of
string in unpack <br>
(F) You had a pack template that specified a relative
position after the end of the string being unpacked. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YOU HAVEN&rsquo;T DISABLED
SET-ID SCRIPTS IN THE KERNEL YET! <br>
(F) And you probably never will, because you probably
don&rsquo;t have the sources to your kernel, and your vendor
probably doesn&rsquo;t give a rip about what you want. Your
best bet <br>
is to put a setuid C wrapper around your script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You need to quote &quot;%s&quot;
<br>
(W syntax) You assigned a bareword as a signal handler name.
Unfortunately, you already have a subroutine of that name
declared, which means that Perl 5 will try to call the <br>
subroutine when the assignment is executed, which is
probably not what you want. (If it IS what you want, put an
&amp; in front.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Your random numbers are not that
random <br>
(F) When trying to initialise the random seed for hashes,
Perl could not get any randomness out of your system. This
usually indicates Something Very Wrong.</p>
