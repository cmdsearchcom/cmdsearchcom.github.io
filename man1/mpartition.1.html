<p>mpartition(1) General Commands Manual mpartition(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name <br>
mpartition - partition an MSDOS hard disk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note of warning <br>
This manpage has been automatically generated from
mtools&rsquo;s texinfo documentation, and may not be
entirely accurate or complete. See the end of this man page
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description <br>
The mpartition command is used to create MS-DOS file systems
as partitions. This is intended to be used on non-Linux
systems, i.e. systems where fdisk and easy access to SCSI
<br>
devices are not available. This command only works on drives
whose partition variable is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mpartition -p drive <br>
mpartition -r drive <br>
mpartition -I [-B bootSector] drive <br>
mpartition -a drive <br>
mpartition -d drive <br>
mpartition -c [-s sectors] [-h heads] <br>
[-t cylinders] [-v [-T type] [-b <br>
begin] [-l length] [-f]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mpartition supports the
following operations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Prints a command line to
recreate the partition for the drive. Nothing is printed if
the partition for the drive is not defined, or an
inconsistency has been detected. <br>
If verbose (-v) is also set, prints the current partition
table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Removes the partition
described by drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I Initializes the partition
table, and removes all partitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Creates the partition
described by drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a &quot;Activates&quot; the
partition, i.e. makes it bootable. Only one partition can be
bootable at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d &quot;Deactivates&quot; the
partition, i.e. makes it unbootable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no operation is given, the
current settings are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For partition creations, the
following options are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s sectors <br>
The number of sectors per track of the partition (which is
also the number of sectors per track for the whole
drive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h heads <br>
The number of heads of the partition (which is also the
number of heads for the whole drive). By default, the
geometry information (number of sectors and heads) is
fig&acirc; <br>
ured out from neighboring partition table entries, or
guessed from the size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t cylinders <br>
The number of cylinders of the partition (not the number of
cylinders of the whole drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b begin <br>
The starting offset of the partition, expressed in sectors.
If begin is not given, mpartition lets the partition begin
at the start of the disk (partition number 1), or <br>
immediately after the end of the previous partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l length <br>
The size (length) of the partition, expressed in sectors. If
end is not given, mpartition figures out the size from the
number of sectors, heads and cylinders. If these <br>
are not given either, it gives the partition the biggest
possible size, considering disk size and start of the next
partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following option is
available for all operation which modify the partition
table:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f Usually, before writing back
any changes to the partition, mpartition performs certain
consistency checks, such as checking for overlaps and proper
alignment of the parti&acirc; <br>
tions. If any of these checks fails, the partition table is
not changes. The -f allows you to override these
safeguards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
available for all operations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v Together with -p prints the
partition table as it is now (no change operation), or as it
is after it is modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vv If the verbosity flag is
given twice, mpartition will print out a hexdump of the
partition table when reading it from and writing it to the
device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following option is
available for partition table initialization:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B bootSector <br>
Reads the template master boot record from file
bootSector.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Viewing the texi doc <br>
This manpage has been automatically generated from
mtools&rsquo;s texinfo documentation. However, this process
is only approximative, and some items, such as
crossreferences, footnotes <br>
and indices are lost in this translation process. Indeed,
these items have no appropriate representation in the
manpage format. Moreover, not all information has been
trans&acirc; <br>
lated into the manpage version. Thus I strongly advise you
to use the original texinfo doc. See the end of this manpage
for instructions how to view the texinfo doc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* To generate a printable copy
from the texinfo doc, run the following commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./configure; make dvi; dvips
mtools.dvi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* To generate a html copy,
run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./configure; make html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A premade html can be found at
&lsquo;http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/manual/mtools.html&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* To generate an info copy
(browsable using emacs&rsquo; info mode), run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./configure; make info</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The texinfo doc looks most
pretty when printed or as html. Indeed, in the info version
certain examples are difficult to read due to the quoting
conventions used in info.</p>
