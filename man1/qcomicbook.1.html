<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
QComicBook - QT viewer for comic book archives (cbr/cbz)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
qcomicbook [archive] [dir] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
QComicBook is a viewer for comic book archives containing
jpeg/png/xpm/gif images, which aims at convenience and
simplicity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Features include: <br>
- automatic decompression of zip (cbz), rar (cbr), ace
(cba), targzipped (cbg) and tarbzip2ped (cbb) archives <br>
- full-screen mode <br>
- two-pages viewing <br>
- page scaling <br>
- mouse or keyboard navigation <br>
- bookmarks <br>
- thumbnails <br>
- page caching and page preloading <br>
- ... and more</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QComicBook software
requirements: <br>
- rar/unrar (one of them), unzip, unace and tar (with gzip
and bzip2 support compiled-in) available somewhere in the
PATH (e.g. in /usr/bin). If one of them is missing, you <br>
won&rsquo;t be able to open some archives <br>
- a lot of disk space available in /tmp directory, for
handling decompression of archives</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MENU <br>
File</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File menu provies basic
operations for loading comic books: <br>
- Open directory - open directory containg images. <br>
- Open archive - open archived images. <br>
- Recently opened - list of ten recently opened archives /
directories (most recently opened on the top). <br>
- Info - displays information about currenly opened comic
book. This includes contents of file_id.diz *.nf o files (if
any) as well as memory usage info. <br>
- Settings - allows you to fine-tune some options. <br>
- Close - closes currently opened comic book. <br>
- Quit - quits QComicBook.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QComicBook offers some tunable
options, available via Settings menu option. These options
include: <br>
- Background color - the color of the empty area around
displayed image. <br>
- Hide menubar in fullscreen mode - menubar may be hidded in
fullscreen mode if desired; together with toolbar hiding
option, it may give you the whole screen for displaying <br>
page contents. <br>
- Hide statusbar in fullscreen mode - statusbar may be
hidden in fullscreen mode, giving you even more space. <br>
- Small mouse cursor - toggles small (4x4 pixels) mouse
cursor for QComicBook window. <br>
- Scaling method - the algorithm used for image scaling;
either Smooth or Fast. Smooth scaling provides best quality,
but is slower; it is recommened method unless you have <br>
really slow machine. <br>
- Cache size - the number of pages kept in memory. Value of
0 disables caching; 1 has no effect on performance; 2 or
more may improve your experience. Keep in mind, that caching
<br>
may consume a lot of memory - for example, an 1280x1984
image may take as much as 9Mb of memory! <br>
- Preload next page - enables page preloading in the
background. This setting takes effect only for cache size of
3 and greater. It is recommended to enable this option, as
it <br>
may really improve overall experience. <br>
- Use disk cache for thumbnails - thumbnails are saved to
disk, which speeds up things when loading them later. Set
this option on if you tend to open comic books more then
<br>
once. <br>
- Number of days to keep thumbnails - defines, for how long
to keep thumbnails on disk; old thumbnails are deleted when
exiting QComicBook. Value of 0 disables purging. <br>
- Help browser - allows to choose between simple built-in
browser (the default) or any other external web browser.
<br>
- Forward and backward two pages in two-pages mode. <br>
- Open info dialog after opening comic book - when enabled,
info dialog is opened after opening comic book. You may
still open this dialog manually with File/Info menu option.
<br>
- Confirm exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: changing cache size takes
effect on new comic book.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">View</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">View submenu provides some basic
settings for page view.</p>

following scaling modes: <br>
- Original size - no scaling is done and original image size
is preserved. <br>
- Fit width - image is scaled to fit window width. <br>
- Fit height - image is scaled to fit window height. <br>
- Whole page - image is scaled to fit window. <br>
- Best fit - depending on image dimensions, QComicBook
chooses the best method to scale image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The page can be rotated with 90
degree step, with these options: <br>
- Rotate right - rotates image clockwise. <br>
- Rotate left - rotates image counter clockwise. <br>
- No rotation - resets rotation, restores original image.
<br>

for viewing next pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bookmarks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bookmarks menu allows you to
bookmark pages in comic books. These bookmarks are however
somewhat different than, for example, in any webbrowser and
are more similiar to real <br>
bookmarks. Each bookmark keeps bookmarked page number (as
well as file name), so you can easily start with your comic
book from the point, where you last stopped reading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two options are available in
this menu: <br>
- Set bookmark for this comicbook - creates bookmark for
current comic book; existing bookmark for this comic book is
deleted. <br>

bookmark for current comic book; to remove other bookmarks,
use Manage bookmarks option. <br>

can be easily removed.</p>

the list of currently saved bookmarks. Just click on one of
them to go to bookmarked comic book and page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERNALS <br>
Here is some information for people interested in QComicBook
internals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Settings handling</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QComicBook keeps settings in
~/.qcomicbook directory within these two files: <br>
- qcomicbookrc - main configuration file <br>
- bookmarks - bookmarks file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both files are plain text files
and may be edited manually (with caution!), if needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Thumbnails handling</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thumbnails are stored (if
thumbnails disk caching is enabled) in ~/.qcomicbook/cache
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Archives handling</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Archived comic books are
decompressed to temporary directory (/tmp/qcomicbook-XXXXX,
with XXXXX being some random number). This directory is
purged when closing current comic <br>
book, opening a new one or quitting QComicBook.</p>
