<b>File</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
File menu provies basic operations for loading comic books:
<br/>
 - Open directory - open directory containg images.
<br/>
 - Open archive - open archived images.
<br/>
 - Recently opened - list of ten recently opened archives / directories (most
  recently opened on the top).
<br/>
 - Info - displays information about currenly opened comic book. This includes
  contents of file_id.diz *.nf o files (if any) as well as memory usage info.
<br/>
 - Settings - allows you to fine-tune some options.
<br/>
 - Close - closes currently opened comic book.
<br/>
 - Quit - quits QComicBook.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
QComicBook offers some tunable options, available via Settings menu option.
  These options include:
<br/>
 - Background color - the color of the empty area around displayed image.
<br/>
 - Hide menubar in fullscreen mode - menubar may be hidded in fullscreen mode if
  desired; together with toolbar hiding option, it may give you the whole screen
  for displaying page contents.
<br/>
 - Hide statusbar in fullscreen mode - statusbar may be hidden in fullscreen
  mode, giving you even more space.
<br/>
 - Small mouse cursor - toggles small (4x4 pixels) mouse cursor for QComicBook
  window.
<br/>
 - Scaling method - the algorithm used for image scaling; either Smooth or Fast.
  Smooth scaling provides best quality, but is slower; it is recommened method
  unless you have really slow machine.
<br/>
 - Cache size - the number of pages kept in memory. Value of 0 disables caching;
  1 has no effect on performance; 2 or more may improve your experience. Keep in
  mind, that caching may consume a lot of memory - for example, an 1280x1984
  image may take as much as 9Mb of memory!
<br/>
 - Preload next page - enables page preloading in the background. This setting
  takes effect only for cache size of 3 and greater. It is recommended to enable
  this option, as it may really improve overall experience.
<br/>
 - Use disk cache for thumbnails - thumbnails are saved to disk, which speeds up
  things when loading them later. Set this option on if you tend to open comic
  books more then once.
<br/>
 - Number of days to keep thumbnails - defines, for how long to keep thumbnails
  on disk; old thumbnails are deleted when exiting QComicBook. Value of 0
  disables purging.
<br/>
 - Help browser - allows to choose between simple built-in browser (the default)
  or any other external web browser.
<br/>
 - Forward and backward two pages in two-pages mode.
<br/>
 - Open info dialog after opening comic book - when enabled, info dialog is
  opened after opening comic book. You may still open this dialog manually with
  File/Info menu option.
<br/>
 - Confirm exit.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<i>Note: changing cache size takes effect on new comic book.</i>

  however somewhat different than, for example, in any webbrowser and are more
  similiar to real bookmarks. Each bookmark keeps bookmarked page number (as

Here is some information for people interested in QComicBook internals.
<div class="Pp"></div>
1. Settings handling
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
QComicBook keeps settings in ~/.qcomicbook directory within these two files:
<br/>
 - qcomicbookrc - main configuration file
<br/>
 - bookmarks - bookmarks file
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Both files are plain text files and may be edited manually (with caution!), if
  needed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
2. Thumbnails handling
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Thumbnails are stored (if thumbnails disk caching is enabled) in
  ~/.qcomicbook/cache directory.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
3. Archives handling
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Archived comic books are decompressed to temporary directory
  (/tmp/qcomicbook-XXXXX, with XXXXX being some random number). This directory
  is purged when closing current comic book, opening a new one or quitting
  QComicBook.
