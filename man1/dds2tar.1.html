<p>dds2tar(1) General Commands Manual dds2tar(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dds2tar - tool for fast tape access</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dds2tar [ -f device ] [ -t indexfile ] [options] string
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dds2tar uses an index to find the files with record seek (a
fast operation of DAT devices). Since the file structure of
the tape archives is used to extract the files, the
ar&acirc; <br>
chive has to be created by tar, compressed only by (the
transparent signal processor of) the device. So you can step
through the archive very quickly and extract files. The <br>
index may be created using dds2index or tar-vRt and is
normally stored as a file on your hard disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A tar archive is a sequence of
blocks (e.g. 10240 bytes by default), each containing the
same number (20 by default) of records, 512 byte each.
dds2tar reads the tape and writes <br>
the tar records of the specified files (that means the
header record and the data records of each selected file) to
stdout. You may pipe the dds2tar output to the stdin of tar
<br>
-xvvf - to restore the files to your disk. (See EXAMPLES
below.) Before a file is extracted, the records of parent
directories of the file are also written to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The index of the archive should
contain enough information to compute the number of the
block containing the header of each selected file. dds2index
will give such a table, tar <br>
-Rvt e.g. will not (only record numbers are listed). A patch
for GNU tar-1.12 is available, adding the option
--record-file. This patch is not included in the version of
tar <br>
that ships with Debian. Alternatively there are some tricks
to get the missing information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The strings are regular
expressions to select the files. The matching algorithm is
the one from GNU tar. If the option -l is given, the matched
file names are printed to stdout <br>
(You may not pipe this list of pathnames to tar!).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default device is /dev/nst0,
which may be overridden with the environment variable TAPE,
which in turn may be overridden with the -f device option.
The device must be a SCSI <br>
tape device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f devicefile Device of the tape archive. Must be a SCSI
tape device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t indexfile <br>
Specifies the index file (default is stdin).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s # Set the number of the first
tape block of the archive. This option is useful only if the
index file contains the verbose output of tar -Rvt. Any
information about the <br>
first block inside the index file will be overridden by this
option. If no information is available, the archive has to
be the first file of the tape. If you have posi&acirc; <br>
tioned your tape at the first block of the archive, you can
use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dds2tar &lsquo;mt-dds&lsquo; -t
index ... | tar -f - ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to complete the information of
the output of tar -Rvt stored in the index file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b # Set the blocksize of the
archive (tar -b #). This option is useful only if the index
file contains the verbose output of tar (or if you have
problems with the size of the <br>
internal buffer of dds2tar). Any information about the
blocksize inside the index file will be overridden by this
option. If no information is available, the default <br>
blocksize of tar is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z The index file should be read
and stored in compressed mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS you didn&rsquo;t really
need <br>
--z, --no-compress <br>
Don&rsquo;t filter the archive file through gzip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quick <br>
Don&rsquo;t extract the parent directories of the selected
objects from tape. --body Write only the first selected file
to stdout. This is useful if you want to read a file or <br>
extract an archive which is part of the current archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v,--verbose <br>
verbose mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hash-mode <br>
Print a hash sign for each MB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V,--version <br>
Print only the Version Number to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Don&rsquo;t access the tape
but print the file names to stdout. You may not pipe this
list of pathnames into tar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--extract <br>
The stdout is closed and opened by a pipe to the command tar
-fxb - 1 . You may find this option convenient, I like to
pipe the output to tar by hand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Example of getting the index from the default tape /dev/nst0
and storing it in file archive.idx:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dds2index -t archive.idx</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively you can use a
patched version of tar to create an index file. With the
patch you can direct the errors and warning to stdout and
the index information including <br>
information about the blocksize and the number of the first
block to a file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tar -t --record-file
archive.idx</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the archive is the first file
of the tape and the blocksize is the default of 20, you can
use the verbose output of tar (-Rv) as an index file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tar -t -v -R | tee
archive.idx</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the archive is not the first
file of the tape, you can store all the necessary
information inside the index file with the use of mt-dds and
tar :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mt asf ... <br>
mt-dds tell &gt; archive.idx <br>
tar -tvR &gt;&gt;archive.idx</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example of using dds2tar to
extract the gnu library (all files containing the string
&quot;glibc&quot; in filename) from the default tape
/dev/nst0, using the previously stored index file <br>
archive.idx:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dds2tar -t archive.idx
&rsquo;*glibc*&rsquo; | tar xvvf -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To see in advance what would
happen in the previous command without actually writing
anything to your disk, you may use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dds2tar -t archive.idx
&rsquo;*glibc*&rsquo; | tar tvvf -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example of checking the matches.
You may try:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dds2tar -t archive.idx -l
&rsquo;*glibc*&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BACKGROUND INFORMATION <br>
tapes <br>
A tape device handles all I/O (read, write, seek) in units
of tape records. The bigger a tape record, the more
effective usually is the access (and the less gaps are on
QIC- <br>
tapes). However, normally a program will only read or write
complete tape records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normal tape drives allow to seek
only relative to the current position. However, some newer
SCSI-2 tapes, i.e. DAT, conforming to the DDS standard, keep
track of the absolute <br>
position on the tape by inserting the tape record number
inside each track. This number can be read while the fast
seek is performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tar(1) program uses a
slightly different terminology. It calls tape blocks what
normally is called tape records. In the following sections
we use the tar terminology to <br>
avoid confusion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tar <br>
The unit inside a tar archive is a tar record with a fixed
length of 512 bytes. Every file, directory or soft link will
occupy at least one tar record of information about
path&acirc; <br>
name, permission information and so on called header record.
The data of each file is stored in additional tar records
directly after the header record of that file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tar reports the tar record
number of every header record in the archive with its -R
option. tar counts the records continuously, starting with 0
(if invoked as tar -tR) or with <br>
1 (if invoked as tar -cR).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tar handles multiple records as
a tar block, mainly to make the access of tapes (or disks)
more efficient (and save tape space of QIC-tapes). tar only
writes and reads full <br>
blocks to or from an archive. The -b option of tar controls,
how many records are in one block. The default number of
records per block is 20. This number is usually called the
<br>
tar block size. However, this term is a little bit
confusing, since it does not mean the number of bytes in a
block. Thus a perhaps better name would be the tar blocking
fac&acirc; <br>
tor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tar on tapes <br>
tar writes or reads its archive to or from tape in units of
tar blocks. As stated above, only a complete tape block may
be transferred to/from tape. To extract a specific tar <br>
block from tape, one has to read an entire tape block into a
buffer and extract the specified tar record from the buffer
manually. If you would like to read a tar record with a <br>
given number, you have to know the number of the first tape
block of the archive and the tar block size to compute the
number of the tape block witch contains the tar record to
<br>
read. If the tar archive is the first file on the tape, the
tape block number is the equal to the tar block number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: A file with the tar
record number 1234 (records start with 0) may be found in a
tape tar archive, written with a blocking factor of 20. It
may be found in the tar block <br>
with the number <br>
blk = (int) 1234/20 = (int) 61.7 = 61 <br>
which is also the tape block number. The requested file is
within this tar block at the record offset <br>
rec = 1234-(61*20) = 14 <br>
in 512 byte units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a current archive is not the
first archive on the tape, then the number of tape blocks of
all previous archives has to be added to the block number
computed above, to get the <br>
current tape block number. The number of previous tape
records should be obtained from DDS devices when the tape is
positioned at the beginning of the current archive (use mt-
<br>
dds without arguments for example).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: Assuming the archive in
the above example to be the second file on a tape, and the
archive starts at tape block 20222. Then we will find our
file with tar record number <br>
1234 in the tape block <br>
tblk = 20222 + (int) 1234/20 = 20283 <br>
on the tape. The record offset inside the tape block will be
the same as above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
This program can only read records (tar is calling them tape
blocks) up to 32 kbytes due to the limitations of the Linux
device driver. The extracted archive is written to
std&acirc; <br>
out with a block size of 512 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The environment variable TAPE overrides the default tape
device /dev/nst0. The variable DDS2TAR cat be used to give
some options, e.g. --compress, -z, -s # , -b #.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
dds2index(1), mt(1), mt-dds(1), tar(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
This program was created to use the fast seek operation of
my DAT streamer. The tapes are called dds (digital data
storage). Since the program will write a tar archive to
std&acirc; <br>
out, I called this program dds2tar. If I created the index
file, I&rsquo;m now able to restore a file of 1MB within one
minute even if the tape contains more than 2GB of data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thanks to Andreas
(Andreas_Bagge@h2.maus.de), who has written a nice manual
page for the overloaded version 1.1.3 of the program dds2tar
(I added too much features ... ) His man&acirc; <br>
ual page for dds2tar-1.1.3 gave me the idea how to split the
program dds2tar into the peaces dds2tar, dds2index and
mt-dds. Additionally his manual page was the starting point
<br>
for this page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the version 2.2 has a very
robust algorithm to read the index file and the ability of
pattern matching, a lot of options where obsolete and has
been deleted. I tried to <br>
make dds2tar as simple I can.</p>
