dds2tar - tool for fast tape access
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>dds2tar</b> [ <b>-f</b> <i>device</i> ] [ <b>-t</b> <i>indexfile</i> ]
  [options] <i>string ...</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>dds2tar</b> uses an index to find the files with record seek (a fast
  operation of DAT devices). Since the file structure of the tape archives is
  used to extract the files, the archive has to be created by <b>tar</b>,
  compressed only by (the transparent signal processor of) the device. So you
  can step through the archive very quickly and extract files. The index may be
  created using <b>dds2index</b> or <b>tar</b>-vRt and is normally stored as a
  file on your hard disk.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A tar archive is a sequence of blocks (e.g. 10240 bytes by default), each
  containing the same number (20 by default) of records, 512 byte each.
  <b>dds2tar</b> reads the tape and writes the tar records of the specified
  files (that means the header record and the data records of each selected
  file) to stdout. You may pipe the <b>dds2tar</b> output to the stdin of <i>tar
  -xvvf -</i> to restore the files to your disk. (See <b>EXAMPLES</b> below.)
  Before a file is extracted, the records of parent directories of the file are
  also written to stdout.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The index of the archive should contain enough information to compute the number
  of the block containing the header of each selected file. <b>dds2index</b>
  will give such a table, <b>tar -Rvt</b> e.g. will not (only record numbers are
  listed). A patch for <b>GNU tar-1.12</b> is available, adding the option
  <b>--record-file.</b> This patch is not included in the version of tar that
  ships with Debian. Alternatively there are some tricks to get the missing
  information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The strings are regular expressions to select the files. The matching algorithm
  is the one from GNU tar. If the option <b>-l</b> is given, the matched file
  names are printed to stdout (You may not pipe this list of pathnames to tar!).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default device is <i>/dev/nst0</i>, which may be overridden with the
  environment variable <b>TAPE</b>, which in turn may be overridden with the
  <b>-f&#x00A0;</b><i>device</i> option. The device must be a SCSI tape device.

Example of <b>getting the index</b> from the default tape /dev/nst0 and storing
  it in file archive.idx:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">dds2index -t archive.idx</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Alternatively you can use a patched version of tar to create an index file. With
  the patch you can direct the errors and warning to stdout and the index
  information including information about the blocksize and the number of the
  first block to a file:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">tar -t --record-file archive.idx</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the archive is the first file of the tape and the blocksize is the default of
  20, you can use the verbose output of tar (-Rv) as an index file.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">tar -t -v -R | tee archive.idx</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the archive is not the first file of the tape, you can store all the
  necessary information inside the index file with the use of <b>mt-dds</b> and
  <b>tar</b> :
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
mt asf ...
mt-dds tell &gt; archive.idx
tar -tvR &gt;&gt;archive.idx
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example of <b>using dds2tar</b> to extract the gnu library (all files containing
  the string &quot;glibc&quot; in filename) from the default tape /dev/nst0,
  using the previously stored index file archive.idx:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">dds2tar -t archive.idx '*glibc*' | tar xvvf -</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To see in advance what would happen in the previous command without actually
  writing anything to your disk, you may use:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">dds2tar -t archive.idx '*glibc*' | tar tvvf -</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example of checking the matches. You may try:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">dds2tar -t archive.idx -l '*glibc*'</dd>
</dl>

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="tapes"><a class="selflink" href="#tapes">tapes</a></h2>
A tape device handles all I/O (read, write, seek) in units of <i>tape
  records</i>. The bigger a tape record, the more effective usually is the
  access (and the less gaps are on QIC-tapes). However, normally a program will
  only read or write complete tape records.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Normal tape drives allow to seek only relative to the current position. However,
  some newer SCSI-2 tapes, i.e. DAT, conforming to the DDS standard, keep track
  of the absolute position on the tape by inserting the tape record number
  inside each track. This number can be read while the fast seek is performed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>tar(1)</b> program uses a slightly different terminology. It calls
  <i>tape blocks</i> what normally is called <i>tape records</i>. In the
  following sections we use the tar terminology to avoid confusion.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="tar"><a class="selflink" href="#tar">tar</a></h2>
The unit inside a <b>tar</b> archive is a <i>tar record</i> with a fixed length
  of 512 bytes. Every file, directory or soft link will occupy at least one tar
  record of information about pathname, permission information and so on called
  header record. The data of each file is stored in additional tar records
  directly after the header record of that file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
tar reports the <i>tar record number</i> of every header record in the archive
  with its -R option. tar counts the records continuously, starting with
  <b>0</b> (if invoked as tar -tR) or with <b>1</b> (if invoked as tar -cR).
<div class="Pp"></div>
tar handles multiple records as a <i>tar block</i>, mainly to make the access of
  tapes (or disks) more efficient (and save tape space of QIC-tapes). tar only
  writes and reads full blocks to or from an archive. The -b option of tar
  controls, how many records are in one block. The default number of records per
  block is <b>20</b>. This number is usually called the <i>tar block size</i>.
  However, this term is a little bit confusing, since it does not mean the
  number of bytes in a block. Thus a perhaps better name would be the <i>tar
  blocking factor</i>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="tar_on_tapes"><a class="selflink" href="#tar_on_tapes">tar
  on tapes</a></h2>
tar writes or reads its archive to or from tape in units of tar blocks. As
  stated above, only a complete tape block may be transferred to/from tape. To
  extract a specific tar block from tape, one has to read an entire tape block
  into a buffer and extract the specified tar record from the buffer manually.
  If you would like to read a tar record with a given number, you have to know
  the number of the first tape block of the archive and the tar block size to
  compute the number of the tape block witch contains the tar record to read. If
  the tar archive is the first file on the tape, the <i>tape block number</i> is
  the equal to the <i>tar block number</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Example:</b> A file with the tar record number 1234 (records start with 0)
  may be found in a tape tar archive, written with a blocking factor of 20. It
  may be found in the tar block with the number
<div style="margin-left: 7.00ex;">
<br/>
 blk = (int) 1234/20 = (int) 61.7 = 61</div>
which is also the tape block number. The requested file is within this tar block
  at the record offset
<div style="margin-left: 7.00ex;">
<br/>
 rec = 1234-(61*20) = 14</div>
in 512 byte units.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a current archive is not the first archive on the tape, then the number of
  <i>tape blocks</i> of all previous archives has to be added to the block
  number computed above, to get the <i>current tape block number</i>. The number
  of previous tape records should be obtained from DDS devices when the tape is
  positioned at the beginning of the current archive (use <b>mt-dds</b> without
  arguments for example).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Example:</b> Assuming the archive in the above example to be the second file
  on a tape, and the archive starts at tape block 20222. Then we will find our
  file with tar record number 1234 in the tape block
<div style="margin-left: 7.00ex;">
<br/>
 tblk = 20222 + (int) 1234/20 = 20283</div>
on the tape. The record offset inside the tape block will be the same as above.

This program can only read records (tar is calling them tape blocks) up to 32
  kbytes due to the limitations of the Linux device driver. The extracted
  archive is written to stdout with a block size of 512 bytes.

The environment variable <b>TAPE</b> overrides the default tape device
  /dev/nst0. The variable <b>DDS2TAR cat be used to give some options, e.g.</b>
  <b>--compress, -z, -s # , -b #.</b>

This program was created to use the fast seek operation of my DAT streamer. The
  tapes are called dds (digital data storage). Since the program will write a
  tar archive to stdout, I called this program <b>dds2tar</b>. If I created the
  index file, I'm now able to restore a file of 1MB within one minute even if
  the tape contains more than 2GB of data.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Thanks to Andreas (Andreas_Bagge@h2.maus.de), who has written a nice manual page
  for the overloaded version 1.1.3 of the program dds2tar (I added too much
  features ... ) His manual page for dds2tar-1.1.3 gave me the idea how to split
  the program dds2tar into the peaces dds2tar, dds2index and mt-dds.
  Additionally his manual page was the starting point for this page.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Since the version 2.2 has a very robust algorithm to read the index file and the
  ability of pattern matching, a lot of options where obsolete and has been
  deleted. I tried to make dds2tar as simple I can.
