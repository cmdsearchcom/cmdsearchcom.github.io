<p>DJPEG(1) General Commands Manual DJPEG(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
djpeg - decompress a JPEG file to an image file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
djpeg [ options ] [ filename ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
djpeg decompresses the named JPEG file, or the standard
input if no file is named, and produces an image file on the
standard output. PBMPLUS (PPM/PGM), BMP, GIF, Targa, or RLE
<br>
(Utah Raster Toolkit) output format can be selected. (RLE is
supported only if the URT library is available.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
All switch names may be abbreviated; for example, -grayscale
may be written -gray or -gr. Most of the &quot;basic&quot;
switches can be abbreviated to as little as one letter.
Upper and <br>
lower case are equivalent (thus -BMP is the same as -bmp).
British spellings are also accepted (e.g., -greyscale),
though for brevity these are not mentioned below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The basic switches are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-colors N <br>
Reduce image to at most N colors. This reduces the number of
colors used in the output image, so that it can be displayed
on a colormapped display or stored in a col&acirc; <br>
ormapped file format. For example, if you have an 8-bit
display, you&rsquo;d need to reduce to 256 or fewer
colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quantize N <br>
Same as -colors. -colors is the recommended name, -quantize
is provided only for backwards compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fast Select recommended
processing options for fast, low quality output. (The
default options are chosen for highest quality output.)
Currently, this is equivalent to -dct <br>
fast -nosmooth -onepass -dither ordered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-grayscale <br>
Force gray-scale output even if JPEG file is color. Useful
for viewing on monochrome displays; also, djpeg runs
noticeably faster in this mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-scale M/N <br>
Scale the output image by a factor M/N. Currently the scale
factor must be M/8, where M is an integer between 1 and 16
inclusive, or any reduced fraction thereof (such as <br>
1/2, 3/4, etc.) Scaling is handy if the image is larger than
your screen; also, djpeg runs much faster when scaling down
the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bmp Select BMP output format
(Windows flavor). 8-bit colormapped format is emitted if
-colors or -grayscale is specified, or if the JPEG file is
gray-scale; otherwise, 24-bit <br>
full-color format is emitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gif Select GIF output format.
Since GIF does not support more than 256 colors, -colors 256
is assumed (unless you specify a smaller number of
colors).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-os2 Select BMP output format
(OS/2 1.x flavor). 8-bit colormapped format is emitted if
-colors or -grayscale is specified, or if the JPEG file is
gray-scale; otherwise, <br>
24-bit full-color format is emitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pnm Select PBMPLUS (PPM/PGM)
output format (this is the default format). PGM is emitted
if the JPEG file is gray-scale or if -grayscale is
specified; otherwise PPM is emit&acirc; <br>
ted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rle Select RLE output format.
(Requires URT library.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-targa Select Targa output
format. Gray-scale format is emitted if the JPEG file is
gray-scale or if -grayscale is specified; otherwise,
colormapped format is emitted if -colors <br>
is specified; otherwise, 24-bit full-color format is
emitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switches for advanced users:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dct int <br>
Use integer DCT method (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dct fast <br>
Use fast integer DCT (less accurate).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dct float <br>
Use floating-point DCT method. The float method is very
slightly more accurate than the int method, but is much
slower unless your machine has very fast floating-point <br>
hardware. Also note that results of the floating-point
method may vary slightly across machines, while the integer
methods should give the same results everywhere. The <br>
fast integer method is much less accurate than the other
two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dither fs <br>
Use Floyd-Steinberg dithering in color quantization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dither ordered <br>
Use ordered dithering in color quantization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dither none <br>
Do not use dithering in color quantization. By default,
Floyd-Steinberg dithering is applied when quantizing colors;
this is slow but usually produces the best results. <br>
Ordered dither is a compromise between speed and quality; no
dithering is fast but usually looks awful. Note that these
switches have no effect unless color quantization <br>
is being done. Ordered dither is only available in -onepass
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-map file <br>
Quantize to the colors used in the specified image file.
This is useful for producing multiple files with identical
color maps, or for forcing a predefined set of colors <br>
to be used. The file must be a GIF or PPM file. This option
overrides -colors and -onepass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nosmooth <br>
Use a faster, lower-quality upsampling routine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-onepass <br>
Use one-pass instead of two-pass color quantization. The
one-pass method is faster and needs less memory, but it
produces a lower-quality image. -onepass is ignored <br>
unless you also say -colors N. Also, the one-pass method is
always used for gray-scale output (the two-pass method is no
improvement then).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maxmemory N <br>
Set limit for amount of memory to use in processing large
images. Value is in thousands of bytes, or millions of bytes
if &quot;M&quot; is attached to the number. For example,
<br>
-max 4m selects 4000000 bytes. If more space is needed,
temporary files will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-outfile name <br>
Send output image to the named file, not to standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-memsrc <br>
Load input file into memory before decompressing. This
feature was implemented mainly as a way of testing the
in-memory source manager (jpeg_mem_src().)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Enable debug printout. More -v&rsquo;s give more output.
Also, version information is printed at startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-debug Same as -verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
This example decompresses the JPEG file foo.jpg, quantizes
it to 256 colors, and saves the output in 8-bit BMP format
in foo.bmp:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">djpeg -colors 256 -bmp foo.jpg
&gt; foo.bmp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HINTS <br>
To get a quick preview of an image, use the -grayscale
and/or -scale switches. -grayscale -scale 1/8 is the fastest
case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several options are available
that trade off image quality to gain speed. -fast turns on
the recommended settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dct fast and/or -nosmooth gain
speed at a small sacrifice in quality. When producing a
color-quantized image, -onepass -dither ordered is fast but
much lower quality than the <br>
default behavior. -dither none may give acceptable results
in two-pass mode, but is seldom tolerable in one-pass
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are fortunate enough to
have very fast floating point hardware, -dct float may be
even faster than -dct fast. But on most machines -dct float
is slower than -dct int; in <br>
this case it is not worth using, because its theoretical
accuracy advantage is too small to be significant in
practice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
JPEGMEM <br>
If this environment variable is set, its value is the
default memory limit. The value is specified as described
for the -maxmemory switch. JPEGMEM overrides the default
<br>
value specified when the program was compiled, and itself is
overridden by an explicit -maxmemory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
To avoid the Unisys LZW patent, djpeg produces uncompressed
GIF files. These are larger than they should be, but are
readable by standard GIF decoders.</p>
