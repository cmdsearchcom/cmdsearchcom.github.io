This page covers the very basics of understanding, creating and using regular
  expressions ('regexes') in Perl.

  Guide</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Simple_word_matching"><a class="selflink" href="#Simple_word_matching">Simple
  word matching</a></h2>
The simplest regex is simply a word, or more generally, a string of characters.
  A regex consisting of a word matches any string that contains that word:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    &quot;Hello World&quot; =~ /World/;  # matches
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In this statement, &quot;World&quot; is a regex and the &quot;//&quot; enclosing
  &quot;/World/&quot; tells Perl to search a string for a match. The operator
  &quot;=~&quot; associates the string with the regex match and produces a true
  value if the regex matched, or false if the regex did not match. In our case,
  &quot;World&quot; matches the second word in &quot;Hello World&quot;, so the
  expression is true. This idea has several variations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Expressions like this are useful in conditionals:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    print &quot;It matches\n&quot; if &quot;Hello World&quot; =~ /World/;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The sense of the match can be reversed by using &quot;!~&quot; operator:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    print &quot;It doesn't match\n&quot; if &quot;Hello World&quot; !~ /World/;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The literal string in the regex can be replaced by a variable:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $greeting = &quot;World&quot;;
    print &quot;It matches\n&quot; if &quot;Hello World&quot; =~ /$greeting/;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you're matching against $_, the &quot;$_ =~&quot; part can be omitted:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $_ = &quot;Hello World&quot;;
    print &quot;It matches\n&quot; if /World/;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, the &quot;//&quot; default delimiters for a match can be changed to
  arbitrary delimiters by putting an 'm' out front:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    &quot;Hello World&quot; =~ m!World!;   # matches, delimited by '!'
    &quot;Hello World&quot; =~ m{World};   # matches, note the matching '{}'
    &quot;/usr/bin/perl&quot; =~ m&quot;/perl&quot;; # matches after '/usr/bin',
                                 # '/' becomes an ordinary char
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Regexes must match a part of the string <i>exactly</i> in order for the
  statement to be true:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    &quot;Hello World&quot; =~ /world/;  # doesn't match, case sensitive
    &quot;Hello World&quot; =~ /o W/;    # matches, ' ' is an ordinary char
    &quot;Hello World&quot; =~ /World /; # doesn't match, no ' ' at end
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl will always match at the earliest possible point in the string:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    &quot;Hello World&quot; =~ /o/;       # matches 'o' in 'Hello'
    &quot;That hat is red&quot; =~ /hat/; # matches 'hat' in 'That'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Not all characters can be used 'as is' in a match. Some characters, called
  <b>metacharacters</b>, are reserved for use in regex notation. The
  metacharacters are
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    {}[]()^$.|*+?\
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A metacharacter can be matched by putting a backslash before it:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    &quot;2+2=4&quot; =~ /2+2/;    # doesn't match, + is a metacharacter
    &quot;2+2=4&quot; =~ /2\+2/;   # matches, \+ is treated like an ordinary +
    'C:\WIN32' =~ /C:\\WIN/;                       # matches
    &quot;/usr/bin/perl&quot; =~ /\/usr\/bin\/perl/;  # matches
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the last regex, the forward slash '/' is also backslashed, because it is used
  to delimit the regex.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Non-printable ASCII characters are represented by <b>escape sequences</b>.
  Common examples are &quot;\t&quot; for a tab, &quot;\n&quot; for a newline,
  and &quot;\r&quot; for a carriage return. Arbitrary bytes are represented by
  octal escape sequences, e.g., &quot;\033&quot;, or hexadecimal escape
  sequences, e.g., &quot;\x1B&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    &quot;1000\t2000&quot; =~ m(0\t2)      # matches
    &quot;cat&quot;      =~ /\143\x61\x74/ # matches in ASCII, but a weird way to spell cat
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Regexes are treated mostly as double-quoted strings, so variable substitution
  works:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $foo = 'house';
    'cathouse' =~ /cat$foo/;   # matches
    'housecat' =~ /${foo}cat/; # matches
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
With all of the regexes above, if the regex matched anywhere in the string, it
  was considered a match. To specify <i>where</i> it should match, we would use
  the <b>anchor</b> metacharacters &quot;^&quot; and &quot;$&quot;. The anchor
  &quot;^&quot; means match at the beginning of the string and the anchor
  &quot;$&quot; means match at the end of the string, or before a newline at the
  end of the string. Some examples:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    &quot;housekeeper&quot; =~ /keeper/;         # matches
    &quot;housekeeper&quot; =~ /^keeper/;        # doesn't match
    &quot;housekeeper&quot; =~ /keeper$/;        # matches
    &quot;housekeeper\n&quot; =~ /keeper$/;      # matches
    &quot;housekeeper&quot; =~ /^housekeeper$/;  # matches
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Using_character_classes"><a class="selflink" href="#Using_character_classes">Using
  character classes</a></h2>
A <b>character class</b> allows a set of possible characters, rather than just a
  single character, to match at a particular point in a regex. Character classes
  are denoted by brackets &quot;[...]&quot;, with the set of characters to be
  possibly matched inside. Here are some examples:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    /cat/;            # matches 'cat'
    /[bcr]at/;        # matches 'bat', 'cat', or 'rat'
    &quot;abc&quot; =~ /[cab]/; # matches 'a'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the last statement, even though 'c' is the first character in the class, the
  earliest point at which the regex can match is 'a'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    /[yY][eE][sS]/; # match 'yes' in a case-insensitive way
                    # 'yes', 'Yes', 'YES', etc.
    /yes/i;         # also match 'yes' in a case-insensitive way
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The last example shows a match with an 'i' <b>modifier</b>, which makes the
  match case-insensitive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Character classes also have ordinary and special characters, but the sets of
  ordinary and special characters inside a character class are different than
  those outside a character class. The special characters for a character class
  are &quot;-]\^$&quot; and are matched using an escape:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   /[\]c]def/; # matches ']def' or 'cdef'
   $x = 'bcr';
   /[$x]at/;   # matches 'bat, 'cat', or 'rat'
   /[\$x]at/;  # matches '$at' or 'xat'
   /[\\$x]at/; # matches '\at', 'bat, 'cat', or 'rat'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The special character '-' acts as a range operator within character classes, so
  that the unwieldy &quot;[0123456789]&quot; and &quot;[abc...xyz]&quot; become
  the svelte &quot;[0-9]&quot; and &quot;[a-z]&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    /item[0-9]/;  # matches 'item0' or ... or 'item9'
    /[0-9a-fA-F]/;  # matches a hexadecimal digit
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If '-' is the first or last character in a character class, it is treated as an
  ordinary character.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The special character &quot;^&quot; in the first position of a character class
  denotes a <b>negated character class</b>, which matches any character but
  those in the brackets. Both &quot;[...]&quot; and &quot;[^...]&quot; must
  match a character, or the match fails. Then
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    /[^a]at/;  # doesn't match 'aat' or 'at', but matches
               # all other 'bat', 'cat, '0at', '%at', etc.
    /[^0-9]/;  # matches a non-numeric character
    /[a^]at/;  # matches 'aat' or '^at'; here '^' is ordinary
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl has several abbreviations for common character classes. (These definitions
  are those that Perl uses in ASCII-safe mode with the &quot;/a&quot; modifier.
  Otherwise they could match many more non-ASCII Unicode characters as well. See
  &quot;Backslash sequences&quot; in perlrecharclass for details.)

<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;\d\s\w\D\S\W&quot; abbreviations can be used both inside and outside
  of character classes. Here are some in use:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    /\d\d:\d\d:\d\d/; # matches a hh:mm:ss time format
    /[\d\s]/;         # matches any digit or whitespace character
    /\w\W\w/;         # matches a word char, followed by a
                      # non-word char, followed by a word char
    /..rt/;           # matches any two chars, followed by 'rt'
    /end\./;          # matches 'end.'
    /end[.]/;         # same thing, matches 'end.'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>word&#x00A0;anchor</b>&#x00A0; &quot;\b&quot; matches a boundary between
  a word character and a non-word character &quot;\w\W&quot; or
  &quot;\W\w&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $x = &quot;Housecat catenates house and cat&quot;;
    $x =~ /\bcat/;  # matches cat in 'catenates'
    $x =~ /cat\b/;  # matches cat in 'housecat'
    $x =~ /\bcat\b/;  # matches 'cat' at end of string
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the last example, the end of the string is considered a word boundary.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Matching_this_or_that"><a class="selflink" href="#Matching_this_or_that">Matching
  this or that</a></h2>
We can match different character strings with the <b>alternation</b>
  metacharacter '|'. To match &quot;dog&quot; or &quot;cat&quot;, we form the
  regex &quot;dog|cat&quot;. As before, Perl will try to match the regex at the
  earliest possible point in the string. At each character position, Perl will
  first try to match the first alternative, &quot;dog&quot;. If &quot;dog&quot;
  doesn't match, Perl will then try the next alternative, &quot;cat&quot;. If
  &quot;cat&quot; doesn't match either, then the match fails and Perl moves to
  the next position in the string. Some examples:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    &quot;cats and dogs&quot; =~ /cat|dog|bird/;  # matches &quot;cat&quot;
    &quot;cats and dogs&quot; =~ /dog|cat|bird/;  # matches &quot;cat&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Even though &quot;dog&quot; is the first alternative in the second regex,
  &quot;cat&quot; is able to match earlier in the string.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    &quot;cats&quot;          =~ /c|ca|cat|cats/; # matches &quot;c&quot;
    &quot;cats&quot;          =~ /cats|cat|ca|c/; # matches &quot;cats&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
At a given character position, the first alternative that allows the regex match
  to succeed will be the one that matches. Here, all the alternatives match at
  the first string position, so the first matches.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Grouping_things_and_hierarchical_matching"><a class="selflink" href="#Grouping_things_and_hierarchical_matching">Grouping
  things and hierarchical matching</a></h2>
The <b>grouping</b> metacharacters &quot;()&quot; allow a part of a regex to be
  treated as a single unit. Parts of a regex are grouped by enclosing them in
  parentheses. The regex &quot;house(cat|keeper)&quot; means match
  &quot;house&quot; followed by either &quot;cat&quot; or &quot;keeper&quot;.
  Some more examples are
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    /(a|b)b/;    # matches 'ab' or 'bb'
    /(^a|b)c/;   # matches 'ac' at start of string or 'bc' anywhere
    /house(cat|)/;  # matches either 'housecat' or 'house'
    /house(cat(s|)|)/;  # matches either 'housecats' or 'housecat' or
                        # 'house'.  Note groups can be nested.
    &quot;20&quot; =~ /(19|20|)\d\d/;  # matches the null alternative '()\d\d',
                             # because '20\d\d' can't match
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Extracting_matches"><a class="selflink" href="#Extracting_matches">Extracting
  matches</a></h2>
The grouping metacharacters &quot;()&quot; also allow the extraction of the
  parts of a string that matched. For each grouping, the part that matched
  inside goes into the special variables $1, $2, etc. They can be used just as
  ordinary variables:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # extract hours, minutes, seconds
    $time =~ /(\d\d):(\d\d):(\d\d)/;  # match hh:mm:ss format
    $hours = $1;
    $minutes = $2;
    $seconds = $3;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In list context, a match &quot;/regex/&quot; with groupings will return the list
  of matched values &quot;($1,$2,...)&quot;. So we could rewrite it as
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    ($hours, $minutes, $second) = ($time =~ /(\d\d):(\d\d):(\d\d)/);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the groupings in a regex are nested, $1 gets the group with the leftmost
  opening parenthesis, $2 the next opening parenthesis, etc. For example, here
  is a complex regex and the matching variables indicated below it:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    /(ab(cd|ef)((gi)|j))/;
     1  2      34
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Associated with the matching variables $1, $2, ... are the <b>backreferences</b>
  &quot;\g1&quot;, &quot;\g2&quot;, ... Backreferences are matching variables
  that can be used <i>inside</i> a regex:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    /(\w\w\w)\s\g1/; # find sequences like 'the the' in string
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
$1, $2, ... should only be used outside of a regex, and &quot;\g1&quot;,
  &quot;\g2&quot;, ... only inside a regex.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Matching_repetitions"><a class="selflink" href="#Matching_repetitions">Matching
  repetitions</a></h2>
The <b>quantifier</b> metacharacters &quot;?&quot;, &quot;*&quot;,
  &quot;+&quot;, and &quot;{}&quot; allow us to determine the number of repeats
  of a portion of a regex we consider to be a match. Quantifiers are put
  immediately after the character, character class, or grouping that we want to
  specify. They have the following meanings:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;a?&quot; = match 'a' 1 or 0 times</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;a*&quot; = match 'a' 0 or more times, i.e., any
      number of times</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;a+&quot; = match 'a' 1 or more times, i.e., at least
      once</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;a{n,m}&quot; = match at least &quot;n&quot; times,
      but not more than &quot;m&quot; times.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;a{n,}&quot; = match at least &quot;n&quot; or more
      times</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">&quot;a{n}&quot; = match exactly &quot;n&quot; times</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here are some examples:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    /[a-z]+\s+\d*/;  # match a lowercase word, at least some space, and
                     # any number of digits
    /(\w+)\s+\g1/;    # match doubled words of arbitrary length
    $year =~ /^\d{2,4}$/;  # make sure year is at least 2 but not more
                           # than 4 digits
    $year =~ /^\d{4}$|^\d{2}$/;    # better match; throw out 3 digit dates
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
These quantifiers will try to match as much of the string as possible, while
  still allowing the regex to match. So we have
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $x = 'the cat in the hat';
    $x =~ /^(.*)(at)(.*)$/; # matches,
                            # $1 = 'the cat in the h'
                            # $2 = 'at'
                            # $3 = ''   (0 matches)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first quantifier &quot;.*&quot; grabs as much of the string as possible
  while still having the regex match. The second quantifier &quot;.*&quot; has
  no string left to it, so it matches 0 times.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="More_matching"><a class="selflink" href="#More_matching">More
  matching</a></h2>
There are a few more things you might want to know about matching operators. The
  global modifier &quot;//g&quot; allows the matching operator to match within a
  string as many times as possible. In scalar context, successive matches
  against a string will have &quot;//g&quot; jump from match to match, keeping
  track of position in the string as it goes along. You can get or set the
  position with the &quot;pos()&quot; function. For example,
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $x = &quot;cat dog house&quot;; # 3 words
    while ($x =~ /(\w+)/g) {
        print &quot;Word is $1, ends at position &quot;, pos $x, &quot;\n&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
prints
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    Word is cat, ends at position 3
    Word is dog, ends at position 7
    Word is house, ends at position 13
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A failed match or changing the target string resets the position. If you don't
  want the position reset after failure to match, add the &quot;//c&quot;, as in
  &quot;/regex/gc&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In list context, &quot;//g&quot; returns a list of matched groupings, or if
  there are no groupings, a list of matches to the whole regex. So
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    @words = ($x =~ /(\w+)/g);  # matches,
                                # $word[0] = 'cat'
                                # $word[1] = 'dog'
                                # $word[2] = 'house'
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Search_and_replace"><a class="selflink" href="#Search_and_replace">Search
  and replace</a></h2>
Search and replace is performed using &quot;s/regex/replacement/modifiers&quot;.
  The &quot;replacement&quot; is a Perl double-quoted string that replaces in
  the string whatever is matched with the &quot;regex&quot;. The operator
  &quot;=~&quot; is also used here to associate a string with &quot;s///&quot;.
  If matching against $_, the &quot;$_&#x00A0;=~&quot; can be dropped. If there
  is a match, &quot;s///&quot; returns the number of substitutions made;
  otherwise it returns false. Here are a few examples:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $x = &quot;Time to feed the cat!&quot;;
    $x =~ s/cat/hacker/;   # $x contains &quot;Time to feed the hacker!&quot;
    $y = &quot;'quoted words'&quot;;
    $y =~ s/^'(.*)'$/$1/;  # strip single quotes,
                           # $y contains &quot;quoted words&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
With the &quot;s///&quot; operator, the matched variables $1, $2, etc. are
  immediately available for use in the replacement expression. With the global
  modifier, &quot;s///g&quot; will search and replace all occurrences of the
  regex in the string:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $x = &quot;I batted 4 for 4&quot;;
    $x =~ s/4/four/;   # $x contains &quot;I batted four for 4&quot;
    $x = &quot;I batted 4 for 4&quot;;
    $x =~ s/4/four/g;  # $x contains &quot;I batted four for four&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The non-destructive modifier &quot;s///r&quot; causes the result of the
  substitution to be returned instead of modifying $_ (or whatever variable the
  substitute was bound to with &quot;=~&quot;):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $x = &quot;I like dogs.&quot;;
    $y = $x =~ s/dogs/cats/r;
    print &quot;$x $y\n&quot;; # prints &quot;I like dogs. I like cats.&quot;
    $x = &quot;Cats are great.&quot;;
    print $x =~ s/Cats/Dogs/r =~ s/Dogs/Frogs/r =~ s/Frogs/Hedgehogs/r, &quot;\n&quot;;
    # prints &quot;Hedgehogs are great.&quot;
    @foo = map { s/[a-z]/X/r } qw(a b c 1 2 3);
    # @foo is now qw(X X X 1 2 3)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The evaluation modifier &quot;s///e&quot; wraps an &quot;eval{...}&quot; around
  the replacement string and the evaluated result is substituted for the matched
  substring. Some examples:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # reverse all the words in a string
    $x = &quot;the cat in the hat&quot;;
    $x =~ s/(\w+)/reverse $1/ge;   # $x contains &quot;eht tac ni eht tah&quot;
    # convert percentage to decimal
    $x = &quot;A 39% hit rate&quot;;
    $x =~ s!(\d+)%!$1/100!e;       # $x contains &quot;A 0.39 hit rate&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The last example shows that &quot;s///&quot; can use other delimiters, such as
  &quot;s!!!&quot; and &quot;s{}{}&quot;, and even &quot;s{}//&quot;. If single
  quotes are used &quot;s'''&quot;, then the regex and replacement are treated
  as single-quoted strings.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_split_operator"><a class="selflink" href="#The_split_operator">The
  split operator</a></h2>
&quot;split /regex/, string&quot; splits &quot;string&quot; into a list of
  substrings and returns that list. The regex determines the character sequence
  that &quot;string&quot; is split with respect to. For example, to split a
  string into words, use
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $x = &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;;
    @word = split /\s+/, $x;  # $word[0] = 'Calvin'
                              # $word[1] = 'and'
                              # $word[2] = 'Hobbes'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To extract a comma-delimited list of numbers, use
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $x = &quot;1.618,2.718,   3.142&quot;;
    @const = split /,\s*/, $x;  # $const[0] = '1.618'
                                # $const[1] = '2.718'
                                # $const[2] = '3.142'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the empty regex &quot;//&quot; is used, the string is split into individual
  characters. If the regex has groupings, then the list produced contains the
  matched substrings from the groupings as well:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $x = &quot;/usr/bin&quot;;
    @parts = split m!(/)!, $x;  # $parts[0] = ''
                                # $parts[1] = '/'
                                # $parts[2] = 'usr'
                                # $parts[3] = '/'
                                # $parts[4] = 'bin'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since the first character of $x matched the regex, &quot;split&quot; prepended
  an empty initial element to the list.
