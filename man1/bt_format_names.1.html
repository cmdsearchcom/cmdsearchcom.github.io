bt_format_names - formatting BibTeX names for consistent
output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
After splitting a name into its components parts
(represented as a &quot;bt_name&quot; structure), you often
want to put it back together again as a single string in a
consistent way. <br>
btparse provides a very flexible way to do this, generally
in two stages: first, you create a &quot;name format&quot;
which describes how to put the tokens and parts of any name
back <br>
together, and then you apply the format to a particular
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;name format&quot; is
encapsulated in a &quot;bt_name_format&quot; structure,
which is created with &quot;bt_create_name_format()&quot;.
This function includes some clever trickery that means you
<br>
can usually get away with calling it alone, and not need to
do any customization of the format. If you do need to
customize the format, though,
&quot;bt_set_format_text()&quot; and <br>
&quot;bt_set_format_options()&quot; provide that
capability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format controls the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; which name parts
are printed, and in what order (e.g. &quot;first von last
jr&quot;, or &quot;von last jr first&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the text that
precedes and follows each part (e.g. if the first name
follows the last name, you probably want a comma before the
&lsquo;first&rsquo; part: &quot;Smith, John&quot; rather
than <br>
&quot;Smith John&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the text that
precedes and follows each token (e.g. if the first name is
abbreviated, you may want a period after each token:
&quot;J. R. Smith&quot; rather than &quot;J R
Smith&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the method used
to join the tokens of each part together</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the method used
to join each part to the following part</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of these except the list of
parts to format are kept in arrays indexed by name part: for
example, the structure has a field</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">char *
post_token[BT_MAX_NAMEPARTS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and
&quot;post_token[BTN_FIRST]&quot; (&quot;BTN_FIRST&quot; is
from the &quot;bt_namepart&quot; &quot;enum&quot;) is the
string to be added after each token in the first name---for
example, &quot;.&quot; if the first name is to <br>
be abbreviated in the conventional way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Yet another &quot;enum&quot;,
&quot;bt_joinmethod&quot;, describes the available methods
for joining tokens together. Note that there are two sets of
join methods in a name format: between tokens <br>
within a single part, and between the tokens of two
different parts. The first allows you, for example, to
change &quot;J R Smith&quot; (first name abbreviated with no
post-token text but <br>
tokens joined by a space) to &quot;JR Smith&quot; (the same,
but first-name tokens jammed together). The second is mainly
used to ensure that &quot;von&quot; and &quot;last&quot;
name-parts may be joined <br>
with a tie: &quot;de~Roche&quot; rather than &quot;de
Roche&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The token join methods are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BTJ_MAYTIE <br>
Insert a &quot;discretionary tie&quot; between tokens. That
is, either a space or a &quot;tie&quot; is inserted,
depending on context. (A &quot;tie,&quot; otherwise known as
unbreakable space, is <br>
currently hard-coded as &quot;~&quot;---from TeX.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format is then applied to a
particular name by &quot;bt_format_name()&quot;, which
returns a new string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BTJ_SPACE <br>
Always insert a space between tokens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BTJ_FORCETIE <br>
Always insert a &quot;tie&quot; (&quot;~&quot;) between
tokens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BTJ_NOTHING <br>
Insert nothing between tokens---just jam them together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tokens are joined together, and
thus the choice of whether to insert a &quot;discretionary
tie&quot; is made, at two places: within a part and between
two parts. Naturally, this only <br>
applies when &quot;BTJ_MAYTIE&quot; was supplied as the
token-join method; &quot;BTJ_SPACE&quot; and
&quot;BTJ_FORCETIE&quot; always insert either a space or
tie, and &quot;BTJ_NOTHING&quot; always adds nothing between
<br>
tokens. Within a part, ties are added after a the first
token if it is less than three characters long, and before
the last token. Between parts, a tie is added only if the
<br>
preceding part consisted of single token that was less than
three characters long. In all other cases, spaces are
inserted. (This implementation slavishly follows
BibTeX.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUNCTIONS <br>
bt_create_name_format() <br>
bt_name_format * bt_create_name_format (char * parts, <br>
boolean abbrev_first)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Creates a name format for a
given set of parts, with variations for the most common
forms of customization---the order of parts and whether to
abbreviate the first name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;parts&quot; parameter
specifies which parts to include in a formatted name, as
well as the order in which to format them. &quot;parts&quot;
must be a string of four or fewer <br>
characters, each of which denotes one of the four name
parts: for instance, &quot;vljf&quot; means to format all
four parts in &quot;von last jr first&quot; order. No
characters outside of the <br>
set &quot;fvlj&quot; are allowed, and no characters may be
repeated. &quot;abbrev_first&quot; controls whether the
&lsquo;first&rsquo; part will be abbreviated (i.e., only the
first letter from each token <br>
will be printed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to simply setting
the list of parts to format and the &quot;abbreviate&quot;
flag for the first name, &quot;bt_create_name_format()&quot;
initializes the entire format structure so <br>
as to minimize the need for further customizations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The &quot;token
join method&quot;---what to insert between tokens of the
same part---is set to &quot;BTJ_MAYTIE&quot; (discretionary
tie) for all parts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The &quot;part
join method&quot;---what to insert after the final token of
a particular part, assuming there are more parts to
come---is set to &quot;BTJ_SPACE&quot; for the
&lsquo;first&rsquo;, &lsquo;last&rsquo;, <br>
and &lsquo;jr&rsquo; parts. If the &lsquo;von&rsquo; part is
present and immediately precedes the &lsquo;last&rsquo; part
(which will almost always be the case),
&quot;BTJ_MAYTIE&quot; is used to join &lsquo;von&rsquo; to
<br>
&lsquo;last&rsquo;; otherwise, &lsquo;von&rsquo; also gets
&quot;BTJ_SPACE&quot; for the inter-part join method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The abbreviation
flag is set to &quot;FALSE&quot; for the &lsquo;von&rsquo;,
&lsquo;last&rsquo;, and &lsquo;jr&rsquo; parts; for
&lsquo;first&rsquo;, the abbreviation flag is set to
whatever you pass in as &quot;abbrev_first&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Initially, all
&quot;surrounding text&quot; (pre-part, post-part,
pre-token, and post-token) for all parts is set to the empty
string. Then a few tweaks are done, depending on the <br>
&quot;abbrev_first&quot; flag and the order of tokens.
First, if &quot;abbrev_first&quot; is &quot;TRUE&quot;, the
post-token text for first name is set to
&quot;.&quot;---this changes &quot;J R Smith&quot; to
&quot;J. R. <br>
Smith&quot;, which is usually the desired form. (If you
don&rsquo;t want the periods, you&rsquo;ll have to set the
post-token text yourself with
&quot;bt_set_format_text()&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then, if &lsquo;jr&rsquo; is
present and immediately after &lsquo;last&rsquo; (almost
always the case), the pre-part text for &lsquo;jr&rsquo; is
set to &quot;, &quot;, and the inter-part join method for
&lsquo;last&rsquo; is <br>
set to &quot;BTJ_NOTHING&quot;. This changes &quot;John
Smith Jr&quot; (where the space following &quot;Smith&quot;
comes from formatting the last name with a
&quot;BTJ_SPACE&quot; inter-part join method) to <br>
&quot;John Smith, Jr&quot; (where the &quot;, &quot; is now
associated with &quot;Jr&quot;---that way, if there is no
&lsquo;jr&rsquo; part, the &quot;, &quot; will not be
printed.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, if &lsquo;first&rsquo;
is present and immediately follows either &lsquo;jr&rsquo;
or &lsquo;last&rsquo; (which will usually be the case in
&quot;last-name first&quot; formats), the same sort of
trickery is <br>
applied: the pre-part text for &lsquo;first&rsquo; is set to
&quot;, &quot;, and the part join method for the preceding
part (either &lsquo;jr&rsquo; or &lsquo;last&rsquo;) is set
to &quot;BTJ_NOTHING&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While all these rules are rather
complicated, they mean that you are usually freed from
having to do any customization of the name format. Certainly
this is the case if you <br>
only need &quot;fvlj&quot; and &quot;vljf&quot; part orders,
only want to abbreviate the first name, want periods after
abbreviated tokens, non-breaking spaces in the
&quot;right&quot; places, and commas <br>
in the conventional places.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want something out of the
ordinary---for instance, abbreviated tokens jammed together
with no puncuation, or abbreviated last names---you&rsquo;ll
need to customize the name <br>
format a bit with &quot;bt_set_format_text()&quot; and
&quot;bt_set_format_options()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bt_free_name_format() <br>
void bt_free_name_format (bt_name_format * format)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Frees a name format created by
&quot;bt_create_name_format()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bt_set_format_text() <br>
void bt_set_format_text (bt_name_format * format, <br>
bt_namepart part, <br>
char * pre_part, <br>
char * post_part, <br>
char * pre_token, <br>
char * post_token)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allows you to customize some or
all of the surrounding text for a single name part. Supply
&quot;NULL&quot; for any chunk of text that you don&rsquo;t
want to change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, say you want a
name format that will abbreviate first names, but without
any punctuation after the abbreviated tokens. You could
create and customize the <br>
format as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format = bt_create_name_format
(&quot;fvlj&quot;, TRUE); <br>
bt_set_format_text (format, <br>
BTN_FIRST, /* name-part to customize */ <br>
NULL, NULL, /* pre- and post- part text */ <br>
NULL, &quot;&quot;); /* empty string for post-token */</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without the
&quot;bt_set_format_text()&quot; call, &quot;format&quot;
would result in names formatted like &quot;J. R.
Smith&quot;. After setting the post-token text for first
names to &quot;&quot;, this name <br>
would become &quot;J R Smith&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bt_set_format_options() <br>
void bt_set_format_options (bt_name_format * format, <br>
bt_namepart part, <br>
boolean abbrev, <br>
bt_joinmethod join_tokens, <br>
bt_joinmethod join_part)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allows further customization of
a name format: you can set the abbreviation flag and the two
token-join methods. Alas, there is no mechanism for leaving
a value unchanged; <br>
you must set everything with
&quot;bt_set_format_options()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, let&rsquo;s say
that just dropping periods from abbreviated tokens in the
first name isn&rsquo;t enough; you really want to save space
by jamming the abbreviated tokens <br>
together: &quot;JR Smith&quot; rather than &quot;J R
Smith&quot; Assuming the two calls in the above example have
been done, the following will finish the job:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bt_set_format_options (format,
BTN_FIRST, <br>
TRUE, /* keep same value for abbrev flag */ <br>
BTJ_NOTHING, /* jam tokens together */ <br>
BTJ_SPACE); /* space after final token of part */</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that we unfortunately had
to know (and supply) the current values for the abbreviation
flag and post-part join method, even though we were only
setting the intra-part <br>
join method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bt_format_name() <br>
char * bt_format_name (bt_name * name, bt_name_format *
format)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once a name format has been
created and customized to your heart&rsquo;s content, you
can use it to format any number of names that have been
split with &quot;bt_split_name&quot; (see <br>
bt_split_names). Simply pass the name structure and name
format structure, and a newly-allocated string containing
the formatted name will be returned to you. It is your <br>
responsibility to &quot;free()&quot; this string.</p>
