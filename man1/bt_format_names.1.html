<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
After splitting a name into its components parts (represented as a
  &quot;bt_name&quot; structure), you often want to put it back together again
  as a single string in a consistent way. <b>btparse</b> provides a very
  flexible way to do this, generally in two stages: first, you create a
  &quot;name format&quot; which describes how to put the tokens and parts of any
  name back together, and then you apply the format to a particular name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;name format&quot; is encapsulated in a &quot;bt_name_format&quot;
  structure, which is created with &quot;bt_create_name_format()&quot;. This
  function includes some clever trickery that means you can usually get away
  with calling it alone, and not need to do any customization of the format. If
  you do need to customize the format, though, &quot;bt_set_format_text()&quot;
  and &quot;bt_set_format_options()&quot; provide that capability.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The format controls the following:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">which name parts are printed, and in what order (e.g.
      &quot;first von last jr&quot;, or &quot;von last jr first&quot;)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">the text that precedes and follows each part (e.g. if the
      first name follows the last name, you probably want a comma before the
      `first' part: &quot;Smith, John&quot; rather than &quot;Smith
    John&quot;)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">the text that precedes and follows each token (e.g. if the
      first name is abbreviated, you may want a period after each token:
      &quot;J. R. Smith&quot; rather than &quot;J R Smith&quot;)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">the method used to join the tokens of each part
    together</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">the method used to join each part to the following
    part</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
All of these except the list of parts to format are kept in arrays indexed by
  name part: for example, the structure has a field
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   char * post_token[BT_MAX_NAMEPARTS]
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and &quot;post_token[BTN_FIRST]&quot; (&quot;BTN_FIRST&quot; is from the
  &quot;bt_namepart&quot; &quot;enum&quot;) is the string to be added after each
  token in the first name---for example, &quot;.&quot; if the first name is to
  be abbreviated in the conventional way.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Yet another &quot;enum&quot;, &quot;bt_joinmethod&quot;, describes the available
  methods for joining tokens together. Note that there are <i>two</i> sets of
  join methods in a name format: between tokens within a single part, and
  between the tokens of two different parts. The first allows you, for example,
  to change &quot;J R Smith&quot; (first name abbreviated with no post-token
  text but tokens joined by a space) to &quot;JR Smith&quot; (the same, but
  first-name tokens jammed together). The second is mainly used to ensure that
  &quot;von&quot; and &quot;last&quot; name-parts may be joined with a tie:
  &quot;de~Roche&quot; rather than &quot;de Roche&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The token join methods are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">BTJ_MAYTIE</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Insert a &quot;discretionary tie&quot; between tokens. That
      is, either a space or a &quot;tie&quot; is inserted, depending on context.
      (A &quot;tie,&quot; otherwise known as unbreakable space, is currently
      hard-coded as &quot;~&quot;---from TeX.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The format is then applied to a particular name by
      &quot;bt_format_name()&quot;, which returns a new string.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">BTJ_SPACE</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Always insert a space between tokens.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">BTJ_FORCETIE</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Always insert a &quot;tie&quot; (&quot;~&quot;) between
      tokens.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">BTJ_NOTHING</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Insert nothing between tokens---just jam them
    together.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Tokens are joined together, and thus the choice of whether to insert a
  &quot;discretionary tie&quot; is made, at two places: within a part and
  between two parts. Naturally, this only applies when &quot;BTJ_MAYTIE&quot;
  was supplied as the token-join method; &quot;BTJ_SPACE&quot; and
  &quot;BTJ_FORCETIE&quot; always insert either a space or tie, and
  &quot;BTJ_NOTHING&quot; always adds nothing between tokens. Within a part,
  ties are added after a the first token if it is less than three characters
  long, and before the last token. Between parts, a tie is added only if the
  preceding part consisted of single token that was less than three characters
  long. In all other cases, spaces are inserted. (This implementation slavishly
  follows BibTeX.)

    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Creates a name format for a given set of parts, with variations for the most
      common forms of customization---the order of parts and whether to
      abbreviate the first name.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The &quot;parts&quot; parameter specifies which parts to include in a
      formatted name, as well as the order in which to format them.
      &quot;parts&quot; must be a string of four or fewer characters, each of
      which denotes one of the four name parts: for instance, &quot;vljf&quot;
      means to format all four parts in &quot;von last jr first&quot; order. No
      characters outside of the set &quot;fvlj&quot; are allowed, and no
      characters may be repeated. &quot;abbrev_first&quot; controls whether the
      `first' part will be abbreviated (i.e., only the first letter from each
      token will be printed).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In addition to simply setting the list of parts to format and the
      &quot;abbreviate&quot; flag for the first name,
      &quot;bt_create_name_format()&quot; initializes the entire format
      structure so as to minimize the need for further customizations:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The &quot;token join method&quot;---what to insert between
      tokens of the same part---is set to &quot;BTJ_MAYTIE&quot; (discretionary

<dl class="Bl-tag">

      come---is set to &quot;BTJ_SPACE&quot; for the `first', `last', and `jr'
      parts. If the `von' part is present and immediately precedes the `last'
      part (which will almost always be the case), &quot;BTJ_MAYTIE&quot; is
      used to join `von' to `last'; otherwise, `von' also gets
      &quot;BTJ_SPACE&quot; for the inter-part join method.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The abbreviation flag is set to &quot;FALSE&quot; for the
      `von', `last', and `jr' parts; for `first', the abbreviation flag is set

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Initially, all &quot;surrounding text&quot; (pre-part,
      post-part, pre-token, and post-token) for all parts is set to the empty
      string. Then a few tweaks are done, depending on the
      &quot;abbrev_first&quot; flag and the order of tokens. First, if
      &quot;abbrev_first&quot; is &quot;TRUE&quot;, the post-token text for
      first name is set to &quot;.&quot;---this changes &quot;J R Smith&quot; to
      &quot;J. R. Smith&quot;, which is usually the desired form. (If you
      <i>don't</i> want the periods, you'll have to set the post-token text
      yourself with &quot;bt_set_format_text()&quot;.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Then, if `jr' is present and immediately after `last' (almost always the
      case), the pre-part text for `jr' is set to &quot;, &quot;, and the
      inter-part join method for `last' is set to &quot;BTJ_NOTHING&quot;. This
      changes &quot;John Smith Jr&quot; (where the space following
      &quot;Smith&quot; comes from formatting the last name with a
      &quot;BTJ_SPACE&quot; inter-part join method) to &quot;John Smith,
      Jr&quot; (where the &quot;, &quot; is now associated with
      &quot;Jr&quot;---that way, if there is no `jr' part, the &quot;, &quot;
      will not be printed.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Finally, if `first' is present and immediately follows either `jr' or `last'
      (which will usually be the case in &quot;last-name first&quot; formats),
      the same sort of trickery is applied: the pre-part text for `first' is set
      to &quot;, &quot;, and the part join method for the preceding part (either
      `jr' or `last') is set to &quot;BTJ_NOTHING&quot;.</dd>

<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
While all these rules are rather complicated, they mean that you are usually
  freed from having to do any customization of the name format. Certainly this
  is the case if you only need &quot;fvlj&quot; and &quot;vljf&quot; part
  orders, only want to abbreviate the first name, want periods after abbreviated
  tokens, non-breaking spaces in the &quot;right&quot; places, and commas in the
  conventional places.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you want something out of the ordinary---for instance, abbreviated tokens
  jammed together with no puncuation, or abbreviated last names---you'll need to
  customize the name format a bit with &quot;bt_set_format_text()&quot; and
  &quot;bt_set_format_options()&quot;.</div>

    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Allows you to customize some or all of the surrounding text for a single
      name part. Supply &quot;NULL&quot; for any chunk of text that you don't
      want to change.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For instance, say you want a name format that will abbreviate first names,
      but without any punctuation after the abbreviated tokens. You could create
      and customize the format as follows:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
   format = bt_create_name_format (&quot;fvlj&quot;, TRUE);
   bt_set_format_text (format, 
                       BTN_FIRST,       /* name-part to customize */
                       NULL, NULL,      /* pre- and post- part text */
                       NULL, &quot;&quot;);       /* empty string for post-token */
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Without the &quot;bt_set_format_text()&quot; call, &quot;format&quot; would
      result in names formatted like &quot;J. R. Smith&quot;. After setting the
      post-token text for first names to &quot;&quot;, this name would become
      &quot;J R Smith&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>bt_set_format_options()</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
   void bt_set_format_options (bt_name_format * format, 
                               bt_namepart part,
                               boolean abbrev,
                               bt_joinmethod join_tokens,
                               bt_joinmethod join_part)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Allows further customization of a name format: you can set the abbreviation
      flag and the two token-join methods. Alas, there is no mechanism for
      leaving a value unchanged; you must set everything with
      &quot;bt_set_format_options()&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example, let's say that just dropping periods from abbreviated tokens in
      the first name isn't enough; you <i>really</i> want to save space by
      jamming the abbreviated tokens together: &quot;JR Smith&quot; rather than
      &quot;J R Smith&quot; Assuming the two calls in the above example have
      been done, the following will finish the job:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
   bt_set_format_options (format, BTN_FIRST,
                          TRUE,         /* keep same value for abbrev flag */
                          BTJ_NOTHING,  /* jam tokens together */
                          BTJ_SPACE);   /* space after final token of part */
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that we unfortunately had to know (and supply) the current values for
      the abbreviation flag and post-part join method, even though we were only
      setting the intra-part join method.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>bt_format_name()</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Once a name format has been created and customized to your heart's content,
      you can use it to format any number of names that have been split with
      &quot;bt_split_name&quot; (see bt_split_names). Simply pass the name
      structure and name format structure, and a newly-allocated string
      containing the formatted name will be returned to you. It is your
      responsibility to &quot;free()&quot; this string.</dd>
