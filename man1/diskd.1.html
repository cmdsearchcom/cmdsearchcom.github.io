<p>diskd(1) General Commands Manual diskd(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name <br>
diskd - disk daemon; wait for disk to be inserted</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
This manpage has been automatically generated from
fdutils&rsquo;s texinfo documentation. However, this process
is only approximative, and some items, such as
cross-references, foot&acirc; <br>
notes and indices are lost in this translation process.
Indeed, these items have no appropriate representation in
the manpage format. Moreover, only the items specific to
each <br>
command have been translated, and the general information
about fdutils has been dropped in the manpage version. Thus
I strongly advise you to use the original texinfo doc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* To generate a printable copy
from the texinfo doc, run the following commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./configure; make dvi; dvips
fdutils.dvi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* To generate a HTML copy,
run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./configure; make html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A pre-made HTML can be found at:
&lsquo;http://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/fdutils&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* To generate an info copy
(browsable using emacs&rsquo; info mode), run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./configure; make info</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The texinfo doc looks most
pretty when printed or as HTML. Indeed, in the info version
certain examples are difficult to read due to the quoting
conventions used in info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description <br>
The diskd command has the following syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diskd [-d drive] [-i interval]
[-e command]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Diskd waits for a disk to be
inserted into a given drive, and then either executes the
command or exits. This program can be used to automatically
mount a disk as soon as it is <br>
inserted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning <br>
This program works by switching the motor on for a very
short interval, and then seeking to track -1. This might
damage hardware in the long run. Amigas, which also use
these <br>
techniques, are known for having problems with their disk
drives no longer spinning up properly after a few month of
usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
-d drive <br>
Selects the drive to observe for disk insertion. By default,
drive 0 (/dev/fd0) is observed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i interval <br>
Selects the polling interval. The interval is given in
tenths of seconds. Default is 10 (one second).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e command <br>
Gives the command to be executed when a disk is inserted. If
no command is given the program simply exits. Typically, the
command mounts the disk. It can be a shell <br>
scripts which probes for several filesystems and disk
geometries until it succeeds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bugs <br>
* Automatic unmounting cannot yet be handled. It is indeed
not enough to scan for disk removal, because when the disk
is removed, it is already too late: There might be some <br>
buffers needing flushing. However, the fdmountd program
allows automatic unmounting by using the SYNC mount options,
which switches off write buffering (see section <br>
fdmount).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The drive motor is running all
the time, and on some computers, the drive led flickers at
each time the drive is polled.</p>
