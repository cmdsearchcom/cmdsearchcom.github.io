<p>DH_MOVEFILES(1) Debhelper DH_MOVEFILES(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dh_movefiles - move files out of debian/tmp into
subpackages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dh_movefiles [debhelper&Acirc;&nbsp;options]
[--sourcedir=dir] [-Xitem] [file&Acirc;&nbsp;...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dh_movefiles is a debhelper program that is responsible for
moving files out of debian/tmp or some other directory and
into other package build directories. This may be useful if
<br>
your package has a Makefile that installs everything into
debian/tmp, and you need to break that up into
subpackages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: dh_install is a much
better program, and you are recommended to use it instead of
dh_movefiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
debian/package.files <br>
Lists the files to be moved into a package, separated by
whitespace. The filenames listed should be relative to
debian/tmp/. You can also list directory names, and the
whole <br>
directory will be moved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--sourcedir=dir <br>
Instead of moving files out of debian/tmp (the default),
this option makes it move files out of some other directory.
Since the entire contents of the sourcedir is moved, <br>
specifying something like --sourcedir=/ is very unsafe, so
to prevent mistakes, the sourcedir must be a relative
filename; it cannot begin with a &lsquo;/&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xitem, --exclude=item <br>
Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename
from being installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file ... <br>
Lists files to move. The filenames listed should be relative
to debian/tmp/. You can also list directory names, and the
whole directory will be moved. It is an error to list <br>
files here unless you use -p, -i, or -a to tell dh_movefiles
which subpackage to put them in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Note that files are always moved out of debian/tmp by
default (even if you have instructed debhelper to use a
compatibility level higher than one, which does not
otherwise use <br>
debian/tmp for anything at all). The idea behind this is
that the package that is being built can be told to install
into debian/tmp, and then files can be moved by dh_movefiles
<br>
from that directory. Any files or directories that remain
are ignored, and get deleted by dh_clean later.</p>
