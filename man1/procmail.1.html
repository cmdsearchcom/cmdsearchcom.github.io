<p>PROCMAIL(1) General Commands Manual PROCMAIL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
procmail - autonomous mail processor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
procmail [-ptoY] [-f fromwhom] <br>
[parameter=value | rcfile] ... <br>
procmail [-toY] [-f fromwhom] [-a argument] ... <br>
-d recipient ... <br>
procmail [-ptY] -m [parameter=value] ... rcfile <br>
[argument] ... <br>
procmail [-toY] [-a argument] -z <br>
procmail -v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
For a quick start, see NOTES at the end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Procmail should be invoked
automatically over the .forward file mechanism as soon as
mail arrives. Alternatively, when installed by a system
administrator (and in the standard <br>
Red Hat Linux configuration), it can be invoked from within
the mailer immediately. When invoked, it first sets some
environment variables to default values, reads the mail
mes&acirc; <br>
sage from stdin until an EOF, separates the body from the
header, and then, if no command line arguments are present,
it starts to look for a file named $HOME/.procmailrc. <br>
According to the processing recipes in this file, the mail
message that just arrived gets distributed into the right
folder (and more). If no rcfile is found, or processing of
<br>
the rcfile falls off the end, procmail will store the mail
in the default system mailbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no rcfiles and no -p have
been specified on the command line, procmail will, prior to
reading $HOME/.procmailrc, interpret commands from
/etc/procmailrc (if present). Care <br>
must be taken when creating /etc/procmailrc, because, if
circumstances permit, it will be executed with root
privileges (contrary to the $HOME/.procmailrc file of
course).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If running suid root or with
root privileges, procmail will be able to perform as a
functionally enhanced, backwards compatible mail delivery
agent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Procmail can also be used as a
general purpose mail filter, i.e., provisions have been made
to enable procmail to be invoked in a special sendmail
rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rcfile format is described
in detail in the procmailrc(5) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The weighted scoring technique
is described in detail in the procmailsc(5) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples for rcfile recipes can
be looked up in the procmailex(5) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Signals <br>
TERMINATE Terminate prematurely and requeue the mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HANGUP Terminate prematurely and
bounce the mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERRUPT Terminate prematurely
and bounce the mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUIT Terminate prematurely and
silently lose the mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALARM Force a timeout (see
TIMEOUT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USR1 Equivalent to a
VERBOSE=off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USR2 Equivalent to a
VERBOSE=on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v Procmail will print its version number, display its
compile time configuration and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Preserve any old environment.
Normally procmail clears the environment upon startup,
except for the value of TZ. However, in any case: any
default values will override any <br>
preexisting environment variables, i.e., procmail will not
pay any attention to any predefined environment variables,
it will happily overwrite them with its own defaults. <br>
For the list of environment variables that procmail will
preset see the procmailrc(5) man page. If both -p and -m are
specified, the list of preset environment variables <br>
shrinks to just: LOGNAME, HOME, SHELL, ORGMAIL and
MAILDIR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Make procmail fail softly,
i.e., if procmail cannot deliver the mail to any of the
destinations you gave, the mail will not bounce, but will
return to the mailqueue. <br>
Another delivery-attempt will be made at some time in the
future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f fromwhom <br>
Causes procmail to regenerate the leading &lsquo;From
&rsquo; line with fromwhom as the sender (instead of -f one
could use the alternate and obsolete -r). If fromwhom
consists merely <br>
of a single &lsquo;-&rsquo;, then procmail will only update
the timestamp on the &lsquo;From &rsquo; line (if present,
if not, it will generate a new one).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Instead of allowing anyone to
generate &lsquo;From &rsquo; lines, simply override the
fakes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y Assume traditional Berkeley
mailbox format, ignore any Content-Length: fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a argument <br>
This will set $1 to be equal to argument. Each succeeding -a
argument will set the next number variable ($2, $3, etc). It
can be used to pass meta information along to <br>
procmail. This is typically done by passing along the $@x
information from the sendmail mailer rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d recipient ... <br>
This turns on explicit delivery mode, delivery will be to
the local user recipient. This, of course, only is possible
if procmail has root privileges (or if procmail is <br>
already running with the recipient&rsquo;s euid and egid).
Procmail will setuid to the intended recipients and delivers
the mail as if it were invoked by the recipient with no <br>
arguments (i.e., if no rcfile is found, delivery is like
ordinary mail). This option is incompatible with -p.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Turns procmail into a general
purpose mail filter. In this mode one rcfile must be
specified on the command line. After the rcfile, procmail
will accept an unlimited num&acirc; <br>
ber of arguments. If the rcfile is an absolute path starting
with /etc/procmailrcs/ without backward references (i.e. the
parent directory cannot be mentioned) procmail <br>
will, only if no security violations are found, take on the
identity of the owner of the rcfile (or symbolic link). For
some advanced usage of this option you should look <br>
in the EXAMPLES section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z This turns on LMTP mode,
wherein procmail acts as an RFC2033 LMTP server. Delivery
takes place in the same manner and under the same
restrictions as the delivery mode <br>
enabled with -d. This option is incompatible with -p and
-f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
Any arguments containing an &rsquo;=&rsquo; are considered
to be environment variable assignments, they will all be
evaluated after the default values have been assigned and
before the first <br>
rcfile is opened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other arguments are presumed
to be rcfile paths (either absolute, or if they start with
&lsquo;./&rsquo; relative to the current directory; any
other relative path is relative to $HOME, <br>
unless the -m option has been given, in which case all
relative paths are relative to the current directory);
procmail will start with the first one it finds on the
command line. <br>
The following ones will only be parsed if the preceding ones
have a not matching HOST-directive entry, or in case they
should not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no rcfiles are specified, it
looks for $HOME/.procmailrc. If not even that can be found,
processing will continue according to the default settings
of the environment vari&acirc; <br>
ables and the ones specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Examples for rcfile recipes can be looked up in the
procmailex(5) man page. A small sample rcfile can be found
in the NOTES section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Skip the rest of this EXAMPLES
section unless you are a system administrator who is vaguely
familiar with sendmail.cf syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -m option is typically used
when procmail is called from within a rule in the
sendmail.cf file. In order to be able to do this it is
convenient to create an extra &lsquo;procmail&rsquo; <br>
mailer in your sendmail.cf file (in addition to the perhaps
already present &lsquo;local&rsquo; mailer that starts up
procmail). To create such a &lsquo;procmail&rsquo; mailer
I&rsquo;d suggest something <br>
like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mprocmail, P=/usr/bin/procmail,
F=mSDFMhun, S=11, R=21, <br>
A=procmail -m $h $g $u</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This enables you to use rules
like the following (most likely in ruleset 0) to filter mail
through the procmail mailer (please note the leading tab to
continue the rule, and the <br>
tab to separate the comments):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R$*&lt;@some.where&gt;$* <br>
$#procmail $@/etc/procmailrcs/some.rc
$:$1@some.where.procmail$2 <br>
R$*&lt;@$*.procmail&gt;$* <br>
$1&lt;@$2&gt;$3 Already filtered, map back</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And /etc/procmailrcs/some.rc
could be as simple as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SENDER = &quot;&lt;$1&gt;&quot;
# fix for empty sender addresses <br>
SHIFT = 1 # remove it from $@</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:0 # sink all junk mail <br>
* ^Subject:.*junk <br>
/dev/null</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:0 w # pass along all other mail
<br>
! -oi -f &quot;$SENDER&quot; &quot;$@&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do watch out when sending mail
from within the /etc/procmailrcs/some.rc file, if you send
mail to addresses which match the first rule again, you
could be creating an endless <br>
mail loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/passwd to set the recipient&rsquo;s LOGNAME, HOME and
SHELL variable defaults</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/spool/mail/$LOGNAME <br>

directory it is in will be created every time procmail
starts and either one is not present</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Autoforwarding mailbox found <br>
The system mailbox had its suid or sgid bit set, procmail
terminates with EX_NOUSER assuming that this mailbox must
not be delivered to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bad substitution of
&quot;x&quot; <br>
Not a valid environment variable name specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Closing brace unexpected <br>
There was no corresponding opening brace (nesting
block).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conflicting options Not all
option combinations are useful</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conflicting x suppressed <br>
Flag x is not compatible with some other flag on this
recipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Couldn&rsquo;t create
&quot;x&quot; The system mailbox was missing and could
not/will not be created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Couldn&rsquo;t create maildir
part &quot;x&quot; <br>
The maildir folder &quot;x&quot; is missing one or more
required subdirectories and procmail could not create
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Couldn&rsquo;t create or rename
temp file &quot;x&quot; <br>
An error occurred in the mechanics of delivering to the
directory folder &quot;x&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Couldn&rsquo;t determine
implicit lockfile from &quot;x&quot; <br>
There were no &lsquo;&gt;&gt;&rsquo; redirectors to be
found, using simply &lsquo;$LOCKEXT&rsquo; as
locallockfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Couldn&rsquo;t read
&quot;x&quot; Procmail was unable to open an rcfile or it
was not a regular file, or procmail couldn&rsquo;t open an
MH directory to find the highest numbered file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Couldn&rsquo;t unlock
&quot;x&quot; Lockfile was already gone, or write permission
to the directory where the lockfile is has been denied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deadlock attempted on
&quot;x&quot; <br>
The locallockfile specified on this recipe is equal to a
still active $LOCKFILE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Denying special privileges for
&quot;x&quot; <br>
Procmail will not take on the identity that comes with the
rcfile because a security violation was found (e.g. -p or
variable assignments on the command <br>
line) or procmail had insufficient privileges to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Descriptor &quot;x&quot; was not
open <br>
As procmail was started, stdin, stdout or stderr was not
connected (possibly an attempt to subvert security)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enforcing stricter permissions
on &quot;x&quot; <br>
The system mailbox of the recipient was found to be
unsecured, procmail secured it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Error while writing to
&quot;x&quot; <br>
Nonexistent subdirectory, no write permission, pipe died or
disk full.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exceeded LINEBUF Buffer overflow
detected, LINEBUF was too small, PROCMAIL_OVERFLOW has been
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAILDIR is not an absolute
path</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAILDIR path too long</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ORGMAIL is not an absolute
path</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ORGMAIL path too long</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default rcfile is not an
absolute path</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default rcfile path too long
<br>
The specified item&rsquo;s full path, when expanded, was
longer than LINEBUF or didn&rsquo;t start with a file
separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Excessive output quenched from
&quot;x&quot; <br>
The program or filter &quot;x&quot; tried to produce too
much output for the current LINEBUF, the rest was discarded
and PROCMAIL_OVERFLOW has been set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extraneous x ignored The action
line or other flags on this recipe makes flag x
meaningless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Failed forking &quot;x&quot;
Process table is full (and NORESRETRY has been
exhausted).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Failed to execute &quot;x&quot;
Program not in path, or not executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forced unlock denied on
&quot;x&quot; <br>
No write permission in the directory where lockfile
&quot;x&quot; resides, or more than one procmail trying to
force a lock at exactly the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forcing lock on &quot;x&quot;
Lockfile &quot;x&quot; is going to be removed by force
because of a timeout (see also: LOCKTIMEOUT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incomplete recipe The start of a
recipe was found, but it stranded in an EOF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Insufficient privileges <br>
Procmail either needs root privileges, or must have the
right (e)uid and (e)gid to run in delivery mode. The mail
will bounce.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid regexp &quot;x&quot; The
regular expression &quot;x&quot; contains errors (most
likely some missing or extraneous parens).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kernel-lock failed While trying
to use the kernel-supported locking calls, one of them
failed (usually indicates an OS error), procmail ignores
this error and proceeds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kernel-unlock failed See
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lock failure on &quot;x&quot;
Can only occur if you specify some real weird (and illegal)
lockfilenames or if the lockfile could not be created
because of insufficient permissions or <br>
nonexistent subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lost &quot;x&quot; Procmail
tried to clone itself but could not find back rcfile
&quot;x&quot; (it either got removed or it was a relative
path and you changed directory since procmail <br>
opened it last time).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Missing action The current
recipe was found to be incomplete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Missing closing brace A nesting
block was started, but never finished.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Missing name The -f option needs
an extra argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Missing argument You specified
the -a option but forgot the argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Missing rcfile You specified the
-m option, procmail expects the name of an rcfile as
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Missing recipient You specified
the -d option or called procmail under a different name, it
expects one or more recipients as arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No space left to finish writing
&quot;x&quot; <br>
The filesystem containing &quot;x&quot; does not have enough
free space to permit delivery of the message to the
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Out of memory The system is out
of swap space (and NORESRETRY has been exhausted).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Processing continued The
unrecognised options on the command line are ignored,
proceeding as usual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Program failure (nnn) of
&quot;x&quot; <br>
Program that was started by procmail returned nnn instead of
EXIT_SUCCESS (=0); if nnn is negative, then this is the
signal the program died on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quota exceeded while writing
&quot;x&quot; <br>
The filesize quota for the recipient on the filesystem
containing &quot;x&quot; does not permit delivering the
message to the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Renaming bogus &quot;x&quot;
into &quot;x&quot; <br>
The system mailbox of the recipient was found to be bogus,
procmail performed evasive actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rescue of unfiltered data
succeeded/failed <br>
A filter returned unsuccessfully, procmail tried to get back
the original text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Skipped: &quot;x&quot;
Couldn&rsquo;t do anything with &quot;x&quot; in the rcfile
(syntax error), ignoring it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suspicious rcfile &quot;x&quot;
The owner of the rcfile was not the recipient or root, the
file was world writable, or the directory that contained it
was world writable, or this was the <br>
default rcfile ($HOME/.procmailrc) and either it was group
writable or the directory that contained it was group
writable (the rcfile was not used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Terminating prematurely whilst
waiting for ... <br>
Procmail received a signal while it was waiting for ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Timeout, terminating
&quot;x&quot; <br>
Timeout has occurred on program or filter &quot;x&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Timeout, was waiting for
&quot;x&quot; <br>
Timeout has occurred on program, filter or file
&quot;x&quot;. If it was a program or filter, then it
didn&rsquo;t seem to be running anymore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Truncated file to former size
<br>
The file could not be delivered to successfully, so the file
was truncated to its former size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Truncating &quot;x&quot; and
retrying lock <br>
&quot;x&quot; does not seem to be a valid filename or the
file is not empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unable to treat as directory
&quot;x&quot; <br>
Either the suffix on &quot;x&quot; would indicate that it
should be an MH or maildir folder, or it was listed as an
second folder into which to link, but it already <br>
exists and is not a directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unexpected EOL Missing closing
quote, or trying to escape EOF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unknown user &quot;x&quot; The
specified recipient does not have a corresponding uid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Extended diagnostics can be turned on and off through
setting the VERBOSE variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[pid] time &amp; date
Procmail&rsquo;s pid and a timestamp. Generated whenever
procmail logs a diagnostic and at least a second has elapsed
since the last timestamp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acquiring kernel-lock Procmail
now tries to kernel-lock the most recently opened file
(descriptor).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assigning &quot;x&quot;
Environment variable assignment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assuming identity of the
recipient, VERBOSE=off <br>
Dropping all privileges (if any), implicitly turns off
extended diagnostics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bypassed locking &quot;x&quot;
The mail spool directory was not accessible to procmail, it
relied solely on kernel locks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Executing &quot;x&quot; Starting
program &quot;x&quot;. If it is started by procmail directly
(without an intermediate shell), procmail will show where it
separated the arguments by in&acirc; <br>
serting commas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOST mismatched &quot;x&quot;
This host was called &quot;x&quot;, HOST contained something
else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Locking &quot;x&quot; Creating
lockfile &quot;x&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Linking to &quot;x&quot;
Creating a hardlink between directory folders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No match on &quot;x&quot;
Condition didn&rsquo;t match, recipe skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-zero exitcode (nnn) by
&quot;x&quot; <br>
Program that was started by procmail as a condition or as
the action of a recipe with the &lsquo;W&rsquo; flag
returned nnn instead of EXIT_SUCCESS (=0); the usage
in&acirc; <br>
dicates that this is not an entirely unexpected
condition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notified comsat:

This condition scored &lsquo;added&rsquo; points, which
resulted in a &lsquo;newtotal&rsquo; score.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlocking &quot;x&quot; Removing
lockfile &quot;x&quot; again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNINGS <br>
You should create a shell script that uses lockfile(1)
before invoking your mail shell on any mailbox file other
than the system mailbox (unless of course, your mail shell
uses <br>
the same lockfiles (local or global) you specified in your
rcfile).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the unlikely event that you
absolutely need to kill procmail before it has finished,
first try and use the regular kill command (i.e., not kill
-9, see the subsection Signals <br>
for suggestions), otherwise some lockfiles might not get
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beware when using the -t option,
if procmail repeatedly is unable to deliver the mail (e.g.,
due to an incorrect rcfile), the system mailqueue could fill
up. This could aggra&acirc; <br>
vate both the local postmaster and other users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The /etc/procmailrc file might
be executed with root privileges, so be very careful of what
you put in it. SHELL will be equal to that of the current
recipient, so if procmail <br>
has to invoke the shell, you&rsquo;d better set it to some
safe value first. See also: DROPPRIVS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keep in mind that if chown(1) is
permitted on files in /etc/procmailrcs/, that they can be
chowned to root (or anyone else) by their current owners.
For maximum security, make <br>
sure this directory is executable to root only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Procmail is not the proper tool
for sharing one mailbox among many users, such as when you
have one POP account for all mail to your domain. It can be
done if you manage to con&acirc; <br>
figure your MTA to add some headers with the envelope
recipient data in order to tell Procmail who a message is
for, but this is usually not the right thing to do. Perhaps
you <br>
want to investigate if your MTA offers &lsquo;virtual user
tables&rsquo;, or check out the &lsquo;multidrop&rsquo;
facility of Fetchmail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
After removing a lockfile by force, procmail waits $SUSPEND
seconds before creating a new lockfile so that another
process that decides to remove the stale lockfile will not
re&acirc; <br>
move the newly created lock by mistake.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Procmail uses the regular
TERMINATE signal to terminate any runaway filter, but it
does not check if the filter responds to that signal and it
only sends it to the filter itself, <br>
not to any of the filter&rsquo;s children.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A continued Content-Length:
field is not handled correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The embedded newlines in a
continued header should be skipped when matching instead of
being treated as a single space as they are now.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MISCELLANEOUS <br>
If there is an existing Content-Length: field in the header
of the mail and the -Y option is not specified, procmail
will trim the field to report the correct size. Procmail
<br>
does not change the fieldwidth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is no Content-Length:
field or the -Y option has been specified and procmail
appends to regular mailfolders, any lines in the body of the
message that look like post&acirc; <br>
marks are prepended with &lsquo;&gt;&rsquo; (disarms bogus
mailheaders). The regular expression that is used to search
for these postmarks is: <br>
&lsquo;0rom &rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the destination name used in
explicit delivery mode is not in /etc/passwd, procmail will
proceed as if explicit delivery mode was not in effect. If
not in explicit delivery <br>
mode and should the uid procmail is running under, have no
corresponding /etc/passwd entry, then HOME will default to
/, LOGNAME will default to #uid, SHELL will default to <br>
/bin/sh, and ORGMAIL will default to /tmp/dead.letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When in explicit delivery mode,
procmail will generate a leading &lsquo;From &rsquo; line if
none is present. If one is already present procmail will
leave it intact. If procmail is not <br>
invoked with one of the following user or group ids: root,
daemon, uucp, mail, x400, network, list, slist, lists or
news, but still has to generate or accept a new &lsquo;From
&rsquo; line, <br>
it will generate an additional &lsquo;&gt;From &rsquo; line
to help distinguish fake mails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For security reasons procmail
will only use an absolute or $HOME-relative rcfile if it is
owned by the recipient or root, not world writable, and the
directory it is contained in <br>
is not world writable. The $HOME/.procmailrc file has the
additional constraint of not being group-writable or in a
group-writable directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If /var/spool/mail/$LOGNAME is a
bogus mailbox (i.e., does not belong to the recipient, is
unwritable, is a symbolic link or is a hard link), procmail
will upon startup try to <br>
rename it into a file starting with
&lsquo;BOGUS.$LOGNAME.&rsquo; and ending in an
inode-sequence-code. If this turns out to be impossible,
ORGMAIL will have no initial value, and hence <br>
will inhibit delivery without a proper rcfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If /var/spool/mail/$LOGNAME
already is a valid mailbox, but has got too loose
permissions on it, procmail will correct this. To prevent
procmail from doing this make sure the <br>
u+x bit is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When delivering to directories,
MH folders, or maildir folders, you don&rsquo;t need to use
lockfiles to prevent several concurrently running procmail
programs from messing up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delivering to MH folders is
slightly more time consuming than delivering to normal
directories or mailboxes, because procmail has to search for
the next available number (instead <br>
of having the filename immediately available).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On general failure procmail will
return EX_CANTCREAT, unless option -t is specified, in which
case it will return EX_TEMPFAIL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make &lsquo;egrepping&rsquo;
of headers more consistent, procmail concatenates all
continued header fields; but only internally. When
delivering the mail, line breaks will appear as be&acirc;
<br>
fore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If procmail is called under a
name not starting with &lsquo;procmail&rsquo; (e.g., if it
is linked to another name and invoked as such), it comes up
in explicit delivery mode, and expects <br>
the recipients&rsquo; names as command line arguments (as if
-d had been specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comsat/biff notifications are
done using udp. They are sent off once when procmail
generates the regular logfile entry. The notification
messages have the following extended <br>
format (or as close as you can get when final delivery was
not to a file): <br>

$LOGNAME@offset_of_message_in_mailbox:absolute_path_to_mailbox</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whenever procmail itself opens a
file to deliver to, it consistently uses the following
kernel locking strategies: fcntl(2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Procmail is NFS-resistant and
eight-bit clean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Calling up procmail with the -h or -? options will cause it
to display a command-line help and recipe flag
quick-reference page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There exists an excellent newbie
FAQ about mailfilters (and procmail in particular); it is
maintained by Nancy McGough &lt;nancym@ii.com&gt; and can be
obtained by sending a mail to <br>
mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the following in the body:
<br>
send usenet/news.answers/mail/filtering-faq</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If procmail is not installed
globally as the default mail delivery agent (ask your system
administrator), you have to make sure it is invoked when
your mail arrives. In this <br>
case your $HOME/.forward (beware, it has to be world
readable) file should contain the line below. Be sure to
include the single and double quotes, and unless you know
your site <br>
to be running smrsh (the SendMail Restricted SHell), it must
be an absolute path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;|exec
/usr/bin/procmail&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some mailers (notably exim) do
not currently accept the above syntax. In such case use this
instead:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">|/usr/bin/procmail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Procmail can also be invoked to
postprocess an already filled system mailbox. This can be
useful if you don&rsquo;t want to or can&rsquo;t use a
$HOME/.forward file (in which case the fol&acirc; <br>
lowing script could periodically be called from within
cron(1), or whenever you start reading mail):</p>
