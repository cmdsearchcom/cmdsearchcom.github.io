<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: No space is allowed
between the option flag and the associated arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
grdtrack reads one or more grid files (or a Sandwell/Smith
IMG files) and a table (from file or standard input; but see
-E for exception) with (x,y) [or (lon,lat)] positions in
<br>
the first two columns (more columns may be present). It
interpolates the grid(s) at the positions in the table and
writes out the table with the interpolated values added as
(one <br>
or more) new columns. Alternatively (-C), the input is
considered to be line-segments and we create orthogonal
cross-profiles at each data point or with an equidistant
separation <br>
and sample the grid(s) along these profiles. A bicubic
[Default], bilinear, B-spline or nearest-neighbor (see -n)
interpolation is used, requiring boundary conditions at the
lim&acirc; <br>
its of the region (see -n; Default uses
&acirc;natural&acirc; conditions (second partial derivative
normal to edge is zero) unless the grid is automatically
recognized as periodic.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIRED ARGUMENTS <br>
-Ggridfile <br>
grdfile is a 2-D binary grid file with the function f(x,y).
If the specified grid is in Sandwell/Smith Mercator format
you must append a comma-separated list of arguments <br>
that includes a scale to multiply the data (usually 1 or
0.1), the mode which stand for the following: (0) Img files
with no constraint code, returns data at all points, <br>
(1) Img file with constraints coded, return data at all
points, (2) Img file with constraints coded, return data
only at constrained points and NaN elsewhere, and (3) Img
<br>
file with constraints coded, return 1 at constraints and 0
elsewhere, and optionally the max latitude in the IMG file
[80.738]. You may repeat -G as many times as you have <br>
grids you wish to sample. Alternatively, use -G+llist to
pass a list of file names. The grids are sampled and results
are output in the order given. (See GRID FILE FOR&acirc;
<br>
MAT below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS <br>
xyfile This is an ASCII (or binary, see -bi) file where the
first 2 columns hold the (x,y) positions where the user
wants to sample the 2-D data set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Af|pm|r|R[+l] <br>
For track resampling (if -C or -E are set) we can select how
this is to be performed. Append f to keep original points,
but add intermediate points if needed [Default], m <br>
as f, but first follow meridian (along y) then parallel
(along x), p as f, but first follow parallel (along y) then
meridian (along x), r to resample at equidistant loca&acirc;
<br>
tions; input points are not necessarily included in the
output, and R as r, but adjust given spacing to fit the
track length exactly. Finally, append +l if distances <br>
should be measured along rhumb lines (loxodromes). Ignored
unless -C is used.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Clength[u]/ds[/spacing][+a][+v]
<br>
Use input line segments to create an equidistant and
(optionally) equally-spaced set of crossing profiles along
which we sample the grid(s) [Default simply samples the <br>
grid(s) at the input locations]. Specify two length scales
that control how the sampling is done: length sets the full
length of each cross-profile, while ds is the sam&acirc;
<br>
pling spacing along each cross-profile. Optionally, append
/spacing for an equidistant spacing between cross-profiles
[Default erects cross-profiles at the input coordi&acirc;
<br>
nates]. By default, all cross-profiles have the same
direction (left to right as we look in the direction of the
input line segment). Append +a to alternate the direction
<br>
of cross-profiles, or v to enforce either a
&acirc;west-to-east&acirc; or &acirc;south-to-north&acirc;
view. Append suitable units to length; it sets the unit used
for ds [and spacing] (See UNITS <br>
below). The default unit for geographic grids is meter while
Cartesian grids implies the user unit. The output columns
will be lon, lat, dist, azimuth, z1, z2, &acirc;&brvbar;, zn
(The <br>
zi are the sampled values for each of the n grids)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ddfile <br>
In concert with -C we can save the (possibly resampled)
original lines to the file dfile [Default only saves the
cross-profiles]. The columns will be lon, lat, dist, <br>
azimuth, z1, z2, &acirc;&brvbar; (sampled value for each
grid)</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Eline[,line,&acirc;&brvbar;][+aaz][+d][+iinc[u]][+llength[u]][+nnp][+oaz][+rradius[u]
<br>
Instead of reading input track coordinates, specify profiles
via coordinates and modifiers. The format of each line is
start/stop, where start or stop are either lon/lat <br>
(x/y for Cartesian data) or a 2-character XY key that uses
the pstext-style justification format format to specify a
point on the map as [LCR][BMT]. In addition, you can <br>
use Z-, Z+ to mean the global minimum and maximum locations
in the grid (only available if only one grid is given).
Instead of two coordinates you can specify an origin <br>
and one of +a, +o, or +r. You may append +iinc[u] to set the
sampling interval; if not given then we default to half the
minimum grid interval. The +a sets the azimuth of <br>
a profile of given length starting at the given origin,
while +o centers the profile on the origin; both require +l.
For circular sampling specify +r to define a circle of <br>
given radius centered on the origin; this option requires
either +n or +i. The +nnp sets the desired number of points,
while +llength gives the total length of the pro&acirc; <br>
file. Append +d to output the along-track distances after
the coordinates. Note: No track file will be read. Also note
that only one distance unit can be chosen. Giving <br>
different units will result in an error. If no units are
specified we default to great circle distances in km (if
geographic). If working with geographic data you can <br>
prepend - (Flat Earth) or + (Geodesic) to inc, length, or
radius to change the mode of distance calculation [Great
Circle]. Note: If -C is set and spacing is given the <br>
that sampling scheme overrules any modifier in -E.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Do not skip points that fall
outside the domain of the grid(s) [Default only output
points within grid domain].</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Rxmin/xmax/ymin/ymax[+r][+uunit]
(more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Specify the region of interest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Smethod/modifiers <br>
In conjunction with -C, compute a single stacked profile
from all profiles across each segment. Append how stacking
should be computed: a = mean (average), m = median, p = <br>
mode (maximum likelihood), l = lower, L = lower but only
consider positive values, u = upper, U = upper but only
consider negative values [a]. The modifiers control the <br>
output; choose one or more among these choices: +a : Append
stacked values to all cross-profiles. +d : Append stack
deviations to all cross-profiles. +r : Append data <br>
residuals (data - stack) to all cross-profiles. +s[file] :
Save stacked profile to file [grdtrack_stacked_profile.txt].
+cfact : Compute envelope on stacked profile as +/- <br>
fact *deviation [2]. Notes: (1) Deviations depend on method
and are st.dev (a), L1 scale (m and p), or half-range
(upper-lower)/2. (2) The stacked profile file contains a
<br>
leading column plus groups of 4-6 columns, with one group
for each sampled grid. The leading column holds cross
distance, while the first four columns in a group hold <br>
stacked value, deviation, min value, and max value,
respectively. If method is one of a|m|p then we also write
the lower and upper confidence bounds (see +c). When one or
<br>
more of +a, +d, and +r are used then we also append the
stacking results to the end of each row, for all
cross-profiles. The order is always stacked value (+a),
followed <br>
by deviations (+d) and finally residuals (+r). When more
than one grid is sampled this sequence of 1-3 columns is
repeated for each grid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T[radius[u]][+e|p] <br>
To be used with normal grid sampling, and limited to a
single, non-IMG grid. If the nearest node to the input point
is NaN, search outwards until we find the nearest <br>
non-NaN node and report that value instead. Optionally
specify a search radius which limits the consideration to
points within this distance from the input point. To <br>
report the location of the nearest node and its distance
from the input point, append +e. To instead replace the
input point with the coordinates of the nearest node, <br>
append +p.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V[level] (more &acirc;&brvbar;)
<br>
Select verbosity level [c].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z Only write out the sampled

input].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d[i|o]nodata (more

reverse on output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h[i|o][n][+c][+d][+rremark][+rtitle]

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-icols[+l][+sscale][+ooffset][,&acirc;&brvbar;]
(more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Select input columns and transformations (0 is first
column).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n[b|c|l|n][+a][+bBC][+c][+tthreshold]
(more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Select interpolation mode for grids.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ocols[,&acirc;&brvbar;] (more

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-^ or just - <br>
Print a short message about the syntax of the command, then
exits (NOTE: on Windows just use -).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+ or just + <br>
Print an extensive usage (help) message, including the
explanation of any module-specific option (but not the GMT
common options), then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? or no arguments <br>
Print a complete usage (help) message, including the
explanation of all options, then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNITS <br>
For map distance unit, append unit d for arc degree, m for
arc minute, and s for arc second, or e for meter [Default],
f for foot, k for km, M for statute mile, n for nautical
<br>
mile, and u for US survey foot. By default we compute such
distances using a spherical approximation with great
circles. Prepend - to a distance (or the unit is no distance
is <br>
given) to perform &acirc;Flat Earth&acirc; calculations
(quicker but less accurate) or prepend + to perform exact
geodesic calculations (slower but more accurate).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASCII FORMAT PRECISION <br>
The ASCII output formats of numerical data are controlled by
parameters in your gmt.conf file. Longitude and latitude are
formatted according to FORMAT_GEO_OUT, absolute time is <br>
under the control of FORMAT_DATE_OUT and FORMAT_CLOCK_OUT,
whereas general floating point values are formatted
according to FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT. Be aware that the format in
effect <br>
can lead to loss of precision in ASCII output, which can
lead to various problems downstream. If you find the output
is not written with enough precision, consider switching to
<br>
binary output (-bo if available) or specify more decimals
using the FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRID FILE FORMATS <br>
By default GMT writes out grid as single precision floats in
a COARDS-complaint netCDF file format. However, GMT is able
to produce grid files in many other commonly used grid <br>
file formats and also facilitates so called
&acirc;packing&acirc; of grids, writing out floating point
data as 1- or 2-byte integers. (more &acirc;&brvbar;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF GRID RESAMPLING
<br>
Resample or sampling of grids will use various algorithms
(see -n) that may lead to possible distortions or unexpected
results in the resampled values. One expected effect of <br>
resampling with splines is the tendency for the new
resampled values to slightly exceed the global min/max
limits of the original grid. If this is unacceptable, you
can impose <br>
clipping of the resampled values values so they do not
exceed the input min/max values by adding +c to your -n
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HINTS <br>
If an interpolation point is not on a node of the input
grid, then a NaN at any node in the neighborhood surrounding
the point will yield an interpolated NaN. Bicubic
interpola&acirc; <br>
tion [default] yields continuous first derivatives but
requires a neighborhood of 4 nodes by 4 nodes. Bilinear
interpolation [-n] uses only a 2 by 2 neighborhood, but
yields <br>
only zeroth-order continuity. Use bicubic when smoothness is
important. Use bilinear to minimize the propagation of NaNs,
or lower threshold.</p>
