perlhack - How to hack on Perl
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document explains how Perl development works. It includes details about the
  Perl 5 Porters email list, the Perl repository, the Perlbug bug tracker, patch
  guidelines, and commentary on Perl development philosophy.

  QUICK PATCH GUIDE</a></h1>
If you just want to submit a single small patch like a pod fix, a test for a
  bug, comment fixes, etc., it's easy! Here's how:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Check out the source repository
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The perl source is in a git repository. You can clone the repository with
      the following command:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  % git clone git://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git perl
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Make your change
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Hack, hack, hack.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Test your change
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You can run all the tests with the following commands:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  % ./Configure -des -Dusedevel
  % make test
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Keep hacking until the tests pass.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Commit your change
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Committing your work will save the change <i>on your local system</i>:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  % git commit -a -m 'Commit message goes here'
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Make sure the commit message describes your change in a single sentence. For
      example, &quot;Fixed spelling errors in perlhack.pod&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Send your change to perlbug
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The next step is to submit your patch to the Perl core ticket system via
      email.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Assuming your patch consists of a single git commit, the following writes
      the file as a MIME attachment, and sends it with a meaningful subject:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
  % git format-patch -1 --attach
  % perlbug -s &quot;[PATCH] $(git log -1 --oneline HEAD)&quot; -f 0001-*.patch
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The perlbug program will ask you a few questions about your email address
      and the patch you're submitting. Once you've answered them it will submit
      your patch via email.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Thank you
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The porters appreciate the time you spent helping to make Perl better. Thank
      you!</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUG_REPORTING"><a class="selflink" href="#BUG_REPORTING">BUG
  REPORTING</a></h1>
If you want to report a bug in Perl, you must use the <i>perlbug</i> command
  line tool. This tool will ensure that your bug report includes all the
  relevant system and configuration information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To browse existing Perl bugs and patches, you can use the web interface at
  &lt;http://rt.perl.org/&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Please check the archive of the perl5-porters list (see below) and/or the bug
  tracking system before submitting a bug report. Often, you'll find that the
  bug has been reported already.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can log in to the bug tracking system and comment on existing bug reports.
  If you have additional information regarding an existing bug, please add it.
  This will help the porters fix the bug.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PERL_5_PORTERS"><a class="selflink" href="#PERL_5_PORTERS">PERL
  5 PORTERS</a></h1>
The perl5-porters (p5p) mailing list is where the Perl standard distribution is
  maintained and developed. The people who maintain Perl are also referred to as
  the &quot;Perl 5 Porters&quot;, &quot;p5p&quot; or just the
  &quot;porters&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A searchable archive of the list is available at
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/
  &lt;http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/&gt;. There is also
  another archive at http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/
  &lt;http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/&gt;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="perl-changes_mailing_list"><a class="selflink" href="#perl-changes_mailing_list">perl-changes
  mailing list</a></h2>
The perl5-changes mailing list receives a copy of each patch that gets submitted
  to the maintenance and development branches of the perl repository. See
  http://lists.perl.org/list/perl5-changes.html
  &lt;http://lists.perl.org/list/perl5-changes.html&gt; for subscription and
  archive information.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="#p5p_on_IRC"><a class="selflink" href="##p5p_on_IRC">#p5p
  on IRC</a></h2>
Many porters are also active on the &lt;irc://irc.perl.org/#p5p&gt; channel.
  Feel free to join the channel and ask questions about hacking on the Perl
  core.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GETTING_THE_PERL_SOURCE"><a class="selflink" href="#GETTING_THE_PERL_SOURCE">GETTING
  THE PERL SOURCE</a></h1>
All of Perl's source code is kept centrally in a Git repository at
  <i>perl5.git.perl.org</i>. The repository contains many Perl revisions from
  Perl 1 onwards and all the revisions from Perforce, the previous version
  control system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For much more detail on using git with the Perl repository, please see perlgit.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Read_access_via_Git"><a class="selflink" href="#Read_access_via_Git">Read
  access via Git</a></h2>
You will need a copy of Git for your computer. You can fetch a copy of the
  repository using the git protocol:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  % git clone git://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git perl
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This clones the repository and makes a local copy in the <i>perl</i> directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you cannot use the git protocol for firewall reasons, you can also clone via
  http, though this is much slower:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  % git clone http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git perl
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Read_access_via_the_web"><a class="selflink" href="#Read_access_via_the_web">Read
  access via the web</a></h2>
You may access the repository over the web. This allows you to browse the tree,
  see recent commits, subscribe to RSS feeds for the changes, search for
  particular commits and more. You may access it at
  &lt;http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git&gt;. A mirror of the repository is
  found at &lt;http://github.com/mirrors/perl&gt;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Read_access_via_rsync"><a class="selflink" href="#Read_access_via_rsync">Read
  access via rsync</a></h2>
You can also choose to use rsync to get a copy of the current source tree for
  the bleadperl branch and all maintenance branches:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    % rsync -avz rsync://perl5.git.perl.org/perl-current .
    % rsync -avz rsync://perl5.git.perl.org/perl-5.12.x .
    % rsync -avz rsync://perl5.git.perl.org/perl-5.10.x .
    % rsync -avz rsync://perl5.git.perl.org/perl-5.8.x .
    % rsync -avz rsync://perl5.git.perl.org/perl-5.6.x .
    % rsync -avz rsync://perl5.git.perl.org/perl-5.005xx .
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(Add the &quot;--delete&quot; option to remove leftover files.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
To get a full list of the available sync points:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    % rsync perl5.git.perl.org::

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PATCHING_PERL"><a class="selflink" href="#PATCHING_PERL">PATCHING
  PERL</a></h1>
If you're planning to do more extensive work than a single small fix, we
  encourage you to read the documentation below. This will help you focus your
  work and make your patches easier to incorporate into the Perl source.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Submitting_patches"><a class="selflink" href="#Submitting_patches">Submitting
  patches</a></h2>
If you have a small patch to submit, please submit it via perlbug. You can also
  send email directly to perlbug@perl.org. Please note that messages sent to
  perlbug may be held in a moderation queue, so you won't receive a response
  immediately.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You'll know your submission has been processed when you receive an email from
  our ticket tracking system. This email will give you a ticket number. Once
  your patch has made it to the ticket tracking system, it will also be sent to
  the perl5-porters@perl.org list.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Patches are reviewed and discussed on the p5p list. Simple, uncontroversial
  patches will usually be applied without any discussion. When the patch is
  applied, the ticket will be updated and you will receive email. In addition,
  an email will be sent to the p5p list.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In other cases, the patch will need more work or discussion. That will happen on
  the p5p list.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You are encouraged to participate in the discussion and advocate for your patch.
  Sometimes your patch may get lost in the shuffle. It's appropriate to send a
  reminder email to p5p if no action has been taken in a month. Please remember
  that the Perl 5 developers are all volunteers, and be polite.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Changes are always applied directly to the main development branch, called
  &quot;blead&quot;. Some patches may be backported to a maintenance branch. If
  you think your patch is appropriate for the maintenance branch, please explain
  why when you submit it.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Getting_your_patch_accepted"><a class="selflink" href="#Getting_your_patch_accepted">Getting
  your patch accepted</a></h2>
If you are submitting a code patch there are several things that you can do to
  help the Perl 5 Porters accept your patch.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Patch style</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you used git to check out the Perl source, then using &quot;git
  format-patch&quot; will produce a patch in a style suitable for Perl. The
  &quot;format-patch&quot; command produces one patch file for each commit you
  made. If you prefer to send a single patch for all commits, you can use
  &quot;git diff&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  % git checkout blead
  % git pull
  % git diff blead my-branch-name
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This produces a patch based on the difference between blead and your current
  branch. It's important to make sure that blead is up to date before producing
  the diff, that's why we call &quot;git pull&quot; first.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We strongly recommend that you use git if possible. It will make your life
  easier, and ours as well.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, if you're not using git, you can still produce a suitable patch. You'll
  need a pristine copy of the Perl source to diff against. The porters prefer
  unified diffs. Using GNU &quot;diff&quot;, you can produce a diff like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  % diff -Npurd perl.pristine perl.mine
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Make sure that you &quot;make realclean&quot; in your copy of Perl to remove any
  build artifacts, or you may get a confusing result.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Commit message</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As you craft each patch you intend to submit to the Perl core, it's important to
  write a good commit message. This is especially important if your submission
  will consist of a series of commits.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first line of the commit message should be a short description without a
  period. It should be no longer than the subject line of an email, 50
  characters being a good rule of thumb.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A lot of Git tools (Gitweb, GitHub, git log --pretty=oneline, ...) will only
  display the first line (cut off at 50 characters) when presenting commit
  summaries.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The commit message should include a description of the problem that the patch
  corrects or new functionality that the patch adds.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a general rule of thumb, your commit message should help a programmer who
  knows the Perl core quickly understand what you were trying to do, how you
  were trying to do it, and why the change matters to Perl.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Why
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Your commit message should describe why the change you are making is
      important. When someone looks at your change in six months or six years,
      your intent should be clear.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you're deprecating a feature with the intent of later simplifying another
      bit of code, say so. If you're fixing a performance problem or adding a
      new feature to support some other bit of the core, mention that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">What
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Your commit message should describe what part of the Perl core you're
      changing and what you expect your patch to do.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">How
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    While it's not necessary for documentation changes, new tests or trivial
      patches, it's often worth explaining how your change works. Even if it's
      clear to you today, it may not be clear to a porter next month or next
      year.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A commit message isn't intended to take the place of comments in your code.
  Commit messages should describe the change you made, while code comments
  should describe the current state of the code.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you've just implemented a new feature, complete with doc, tests and
  well-commented code, a brief commit message will often suffice. If, however,
  you've just changed a single character deep in the parser or lexer, you might
  need to write a small novel to ensure that future readers understand what you
  did and why you did it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Comments, Comments, Comments</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Be sure to adequately comment your code. While commenting every line is
  unnecessary, anything that takes advantage of side effects of operators, that
  creates changes that will be felt outside of the function being patched, or
  that others may find confusing should be documented. If you are going to err,
  it is better to err on the side of adding too many comments than too few.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The best comments explain <i>why</i> the code does what it does, not <i>what</i>
  <i>it does</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Style</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In general, please follow the particular style of the code you are patching.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In particular, follow these general guidelines for patching Perl sources:
<dl class="Bl-tag">

      FALSE) ...&quot; etc.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Test suite</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If your patch changes code (rather than just changing documentation), you should
  also include one or more test cases which illustrate the bug you're fixing or
  validate the new functionality you're adding. In general, you should update an
  existing test file rather than create a new one.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Your test suite additions should generally follow these guidelines (courtesy of
  Gurusamy Sarathy &lt;gsar@activestate.com&gt;):
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Patching_a_core_module"><a class="selflink" href="#Patching_a_core_module">Patching
  a core module</a></h2>
This works just like patching anything else, with one extra consideration.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Modules in the <i>cpan/</i> directory of the source tree are maintained outside
  of the Perl core. When the author updates the module, the updates are simply
  copied into the core. See that module's documentation or its listing on
  &lt;http://search.cpan.org/&gt; for more information on reporting bugs and
  submitting patches.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In most cases, patches to modules in <i>cpan/</i> should be sent upstream and
  should not be applied to the Perl core individually. If a patch to a file in
  <i>cpan/</i> absolutely cannot wait for the fix to be made upstream, released
  to CPAN and copied to blead, you must add (or update) a &quot;CUSTOMIZED&quot;
  entry in the <i>&quot;Porting/Maintainers.pl&quot;</i> file to flag that a
  local modification has been made. See
  <i>&quot;Porting/Maintainers.pl&quot;</i> for more details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In contrast, modules in the <i>dist/</i> directory are maintained in the core.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Updating_perldelta"><a class="selflink" href="#Updating_perldelta">Updating

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_makes_for_a_good_patch?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_makes_for_a_good_patch?">What
  makes for a good patch?</a></h2>
New features and extensions to the language can be contentious. There is no
  specific set of criteria which determine what features get added, but here are
  some questions to consider when developing a patch:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Does the concept match the general goals of Perl?</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Our goals include, but are not limited to:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Keep it fast, simple, and useful.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Keep features/concepts as orthogonal as possible.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">No arbitrary limits (platforms, data sizes, cultures).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">4.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Keep it open and exciting to use/patch/advocate Perl
      everywhere.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">5.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Either assimilate new technologies, or build bridges to
      them.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Where is the implementation?</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
All the talk in the world is useless without an implementation. In almost every
  case, the person or people who argue for a new feature will be expected to be
  the ones who implement it. Porters capable of coding new features have their
  own agendas, and are not available to implement your (possibly good) idea.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Backwards compatibility</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It's a cardinal sin to break existing Perl programs. New warnings can be
  contentious--some say that a program that emits warnings is not broken, while
  others say it is. Adding keywords has the potential to break programs,
  changing the meaning of existing token sequences or functions might break
  programs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Perl 5 core includes mechanisms to help porters make backwards incompatible
  changes more compatible such as the feature and deprecate modules. Please use
  them when appropriate.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Could it be a module instead?</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl 5 has extension mechanisms, modules and XS, specifically to avoid the need
  to keep changing the Perl interpreter. You can write modules that export
  functions, you can give those functions prototypes so they can be called like
  built-in functions, you can even write XS code to mess with the runtime data
  structures of the Perl interpreter if you want to implement really complicated
  things.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Whenever possible, new features should be prototyped in a CPAN module before
  they will be considered for the core.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Is the feature generic enough?</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Is this something that only the submitter wants added to the language, or is it
  broadly useful? Sometimes, instead of adding a feature with a tight focus, the
  porters might decide to wait until someone implements the more generalized
  feature.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Does it potentially introduce new bugs?</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Radical rewrites of large chunks of the Perl interpreter have the potential to
  introduce new bugs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>How big is it?</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The smaller and more localized the change, the better. Similarly, a series of
  small patches is greatly preferred over a single large patch.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Does it preclude other desirable features?</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A patch is likely to be rejected if it closes off future avenues of development.
  For instance, a patch that placed a true and final interpretation on
  prototypes is likely to be rejected because there are still options for the
  future of prototypes that haven't been addressed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Is the implementation robust?</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Good patches (tight code, complete, correct) stand more chance of going in.
  Sloppy or incorrect patches might be placed on the back burner until the
  pumpking has time to fix, or might be discarded altogether without further
  notice.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Is the implementation generic enough to be portable?</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The worst patches make use of system-specific features. It's highly unlikely
  that non-portable additions to the Perl language will be accepted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Is the implementation tested?</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Patches which change behaviour (fixing bugs or introducing new features) must
  include regression tests to verify that everything works as expected.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Without tests provided by the original author, how can anyone else changing perl
  in the future be sure that they haven't unwittingly broken the behaviour the
  patch implements? And without tests, how can the patch's author be confident
  that his/her hard work put into the patch won't be accidentally thrown away by
  someone in the future?
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Is there enough documentation?</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Patches without documentation are probably ill-thought out or incomplete. No
  features can be added or changed without documentation, so submitting a patch
  for the appropriate pod docs as well as the source code is important.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Is there another way to do it?</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Larry said &quot;Although the Perl Slogan is <i>There's More Than One Way to</i>
  <i>Do It</i>, I hesitate to make 10 ways to do something&quot;. This is a
  tricky heuristic to navigate, though--one man's essential addition is another
  man's pointless cruft.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Does it create too much work?</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Work for the pumpking, work for Perl programmers, work for module authors, ...
  Perl is supposed to be easy.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Patches speak louder than words</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Working code is always preferred to pie-in-the-sky ideas. A patch to add a
  feature stands a much higher chance of making it to the language than does a
  random feature request, no matter how fervently argued the request might be.
  This ties into &quot;Will it be useful?&quot;, as the fact that someone took
  the time to make the patch demonstrates a strong desire for the feature.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TESTING"><a class="selflink" href="#TESTING">TESTING</a></h1>
The core uses the same testing style as the rest of Perl, a simple &quot;ok/not
  ok&quot; run through Test::Harness, but there are a few special
  considerations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are three ways to write a test in the core. Test::More, <i>t/test.pl</i>
  and ad hoc &quot;print $test ? &quot;ok 42\n&quot; : &quot;not ok
  42\n&quot;&quot;. The decision of which to use depends on what part of the
  test suite you're working on. This is a measure to prevent a high-level
  failure (such as Config.pm breaking) from causing basic functionality tests to
  fail.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>t/test.pl</i> library provides some of the features of Test::More, but
  avoids loading most modules and uses as few core features as possible.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you write your own test, use the Test Anything Protocol
  &lt;http://testanything.org&gt;.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>t/base</i> and <i>t/comp</i>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Since we don't know if require works, or even subroutines, use ad hoc tests
      for these two. Step carefully to avoid using the feature being
    tested.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>t/cmd</i>, <i>t/run</i>, <i>t/io</i> and <i>t/op</i>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Now that basic <i>require()</i> and subroutines are tested, you can use the
      <i>t/test.pl</i> library.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You can also use certain libraries like Config conditionally, but be sure to
      skip the test gracefully if it's not there.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Everything else
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Now that the core of Perl is tested, Test::More can and should be used. You
      can also use the full suite of core modules in the tests.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you say &quot;make test&quot;, Perl uses the <i>t/TEST</i> program to run
  the test suite (except under Win32 where it uses <i>t/harness</i> instead).
  All tests are run from the <i>t/</i> directory, <b>not</b> the directory which
  contains the test. This causes some problems with the tests in <i>lib/</i>, so
  here's some opportunity for some patching.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You must be triply conscious of cross-platform concerns. This usually boils down
  to using File::Spec and avoiding things like &quot;fork()&quot; and
  &quot;system()&quot; unless absolutely necessary.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Special_&quot;make_test&quot;_targets"><a class="selflink" href="#Special_&quot;make_test&quot;_targets">Special
  &quot;make test&quot; targets</a></h2>
There are various special make targets that can be used to test Perl slightly
  differently than the standard &quot;test&quot; target. Not all them are
  expected to give a 100% success rate. Many of them have several aliases, and
  many of them are not available on certain operating systems.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Run the test suite with the <i>t/harness</i> controlling program, instead of
      <i>t/TEST</i>. <i>t/harness</i> is more sophisticated, and uses the
      Test::Harness module, thus using this test target supposes that perl
      mostly works. The main advantage for our purposes is that it prints a
      detailed summary of failed tests at the end. Also, unlike <i>t/TEST</i>,
      it doesn't redirect stderr to stdout.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that under Win32 <i>t/harness</i> is always used instead of
      <i>t/TEST</i>, so there is no special &quot;test_harness&quot; target.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Under Win32's &quot;test&quot; target you may use the TEST_SWITCHES and
      TEST_FILES environment variables to control the behaviour of
      <i>t/harness</i>. This means you can say
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    nmake test TEST_FILES=&quot;op/*.t&quot;
    nmake test TEST_SWITCHES=&quot;-torture&quot; TEST_FILES=&quot;op/*.t&quot;

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Parallel_tests"><a class="selflink" href="#Parallel_tests">Parallel
  tests</a></h2>
The core distribution can now run its regression tests in parallel on Unix-like
  platforms. Instead of running &quot;make test&quot;, set &quot;TEST_JOBS&quot;
  in your environment to the number of tests to run in parallel, and run
  &quot;make test_harness&quot;. On a Bourne-like shell, this can be done as
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    TEST_JOBS=3 make test_harness  # Run 3 tests in parallel
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
An environment variable is used, rather than parallel make itself, because
  TAP::Harness needs to be able to schedule individual non-conflicting test
  scripts itself, and there is no standard interface to &quot;make&quot;
  utilities to interact with their job schedulers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that currently some test scripts may fail when run in parallel (most
  notably <i>ext/IO/t/io_dir.t</i>). If necessary, run just the failing scripts
  again sequentially and see if the failures go away.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Running_tests_by_hand"><a class="selflink" href="#Running_tests_by_hand">Running
  tests by hand</a></h2>
You can run part of the test suite by hand by using one of the following
  commands from the <i>t/</i> directory:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    ./perl -I../lib TEST list-of-.t-files
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    ./perl -I../lib harness list-of-.t-files

    This is of paramount importance, since it's the documentation of what goes
      where in the Perl source. Read it over a couple of times and it might
      start to make sense - don't worry if it doesn't yet, because the best way
      to study it is to read it in conjunction with poking at Perl source, and
      we'll do that later on.

    A working knowledge of XSUB programming is incredibly useful for core
      hacking; XSUBs use techniques drawn from the PP code, the portion of the
      guts that actually executes a Perl program. It's a lot gentler to learn
      those techniques from simple examples and explanation than from the core
      itself.</dd>

Here's some more recommendations
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Subscribe to perl5-porters, follow the patches and try and
      understand them; don't be afraid to ask if there's a portion you're not
      clear on - who knows, you may unearth a bug in the patch...</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Do read the README associated with your operating system,
      e.g. README.aix on the IBM AIX OS. Don't hesitate to supply patches to
      that README if you find anything missing or changed over a new OS
    release.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Find an area of Perl that seems interesting to you, and see
      if you can work out how it works. Scan through the source, and step over
      it in the debugger. Play, poke, investigate, fiddle! You'll probably get
      to understand not just your chosen area but a much wider range of
      <i>perl</i>'s activity as well, and probably sooner than you'd think.</dd>

If you recognized the quote about the Road above, you're in luck.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most software projects begin each file with a literal description of each file's
  purpose. Perl instead begins each with a literary allusion to that file's
  purpose.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Like chapters in many books, all top-level Perl source files (along with a few
  others here and there) begin with an epigrammatic inscription that alludes,
  indirectly and metaphorically, to the material you're about to read.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Quotations are taken from writings of J.R.R. Tolkien pertaining to his
  Legendarium, almost always from <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. Chapters and
  page numbers are given using the following editions:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>The Hobbit</i>, by J.R.R. Tolkien. The hardcover,
      70th-anniversary edition of 2007 was used, published in the UK by Harper
      Collins Publishers and in the US by the Houghton Mifflin Company.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, by J.R.R. Tolkien. The
      hardcover, 50th-anniversary edition of 2004 was used, published in the UK
      by Harper Collins Publishers and in the US by the Houghton Mifflin
      Company.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>The Lays of Beleriand</i>, by J.R.R. Tolkien and
      published posthumously by his son and literary executor, C.J.R. Tolkien,
      being the 3rd of the 12 volumes in Christopher's mammoth <i>History of
      Middle Earth</i>. Page numbers derive from the hardcover edition, first
      published in 1983 by George Allen &amp; Unwin; no page numbers changed for
      the special 3-volume omnibus edition of 2002 or the various trade-paper
      editions, all again now by Harper Collins or Houghton Mifflin.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Other JRRT books fair game for quotes would thus include <i>The</i>
  <i>Adventures of Tom Bombadil</i>, <i>The Silmarillion</i>, <i>Unfinished
  Tales</i>, and <i>The Tale of the Children of Hurin</i>, all but the first
  posthumously assembled by CJRT. But <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> itself is
  perfectly fine and probably best to quote from, provided you can find a
  suitable quote there.
<div class="Pp"></div>
So if you were to supply a new, complete, top-level source file to add to Perl,
  you should conform to this peculiar practice by yourself selecting an
  appropriate quotation from Tolkien, retaining the original spelling and
  punctuation and using the same format the rest of the quotes are in. Indirect
  and oblique is just fine; remember, it's a metaphor, so being meta is, after
  all, what it's for.
