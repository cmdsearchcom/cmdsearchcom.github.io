<p>audacity(1) General Commands Manual audacity(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
audacity - Graphical cross-platform audio editor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
audacity -help <br>
audacity -version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">audacity [-blocksize nnn] -test
<br>
audacity [-blocksize nnn] [ AUDIO-FILE ] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Audacity is a graphical audio editor. This man page does not
describe all of the features of Audacity or how to use it;
for this, see the html documentation that came with the <br>
program, which should be accessible from the Help menu. This
man page describes the Unix-specific features, including
special files and environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Audacity currently uses
libsndfile to open many uncompressed audio formats such as
WAV, AIFF, and AU, and it can also be linked to libmad,
libvorbis, and libflac, to provide sup&acirc; <br>
port for opening MP2/3, Ogg Vorbis, and FLAC files,
respectively. LAME, libvorbis, libflac and libtwolame
provide facilities to export files to all these formats as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Audacity is primarily an
interactive, graphical editor, not a batch-processing tool.
Whilst there is a basic batch processing tool it is
experimental and incomplete. If you need <br>
to batch-process audio or do simple edits from the command
line, using sox or ecasound driven by a bash script will be
much more powerful than audacity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-help display a brief list of command line options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version display the audacity
version number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-test run self diagnostics tests
(only present in development builds)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-blocksize nnn <br>
set the audacity block size for writing files to disk to nnn
bytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.audacity-data/audacity.cfg <br>
Per user configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/tmp/audacity-&lt;user&gt;/
<br>
Default location of Audacity&rsquo;s temp directory, where
&lt;user&gt; is your username. If this location is not
suitable (not enough space in /var/tmp, for example), you
should <br>
change the temp directory in the Preferences and restart
Audacity. Audacity is a disk-based editor, so the temp
directory is very important: it should always be on a fast
<br>
(local) disk with lots of free space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that older versions of
Audacity put the temp directory inside of the user&rsquo;s
home directory. This is undesirable on many systems, and
using some directory in /tmp is <br>
recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On many modern Linux systems all
files in /tmp/ will be deleted each time the system boots
up, which makes recovering a recording that was going on
when the system crashed <br>
much harder. This is why the default is to use a directory
in /var/tmp/ which will not normally be deleted by the
system. Open the Preferences to check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEARCH PATH <br>
When looking for plug-ins, help files, localization files,
or other configuration files, Audacity searches the
following locations, in this order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUDACITY_PATH <br>
Any directories in the AUDACITY_PATH environment variable
will be searched before anywhere else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">. <br>
The current working directory when Audacity is started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.audacity-data/Plug-Ins</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;prefix&gt;/share/audacity
<br>
The system-wide Audacity directory, where &lt;prefix&gt; is
usually /usr or /usr/local, depending on where the program
was installed.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;prefix&gt;/share/doc/audacity
<br>
The system-wide Audacity documentation directory, where
&lt;prefix&gt; is usually /usr or /usr/local, depending on
where the program was installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For localization files in
particular (i.e. translations of Audacity into other
languages), Audacity also searches
&lt;prefix&gt;/share/locale</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLUG-INS <br>
Audacity supports two types of plug-ins on Unix: LADSPA and
Nyquist plug-ins. These are generally placed in a directory
called plug-ins somewhere on the search path (see
above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LADSPA plug-ins can either be in
the plug-ins directory, or alternatively in a ladspa
directory on the search path if you choose to create one.
Audacity will also search the <br>
directories in the LADSPA_PATH environment variable for
additional LADSPA plug-ins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nyquist plug-ins can either be
in the plug-ins directory, or alternatively in a nyquist
directory on the search path if you choose to create
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION <br>
This man page documents audacity version 1.3.5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LICENSE <br>
Audacity is distributed under the GPL, however some of the
libraries it links to are distributed under other free
licenses, including the LGPL and BSD licenses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
For details of known problems, see the release notes and the
audacity wiki: <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
Project leaders include Dominic Mazzoni, Matt Brubeck, James
Crook, Vaughan Johnson, Leland Lucius, and Markus Meyer, but
dozens of others have contributed, and Audacity would <br>
not be possible without wxWindows, libsndfile, and many of
the other libraries it is built upon. For the most recent
list of contributors and current email addresses, see our
